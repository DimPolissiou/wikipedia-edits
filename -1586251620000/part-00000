The channel's programming was originally aimed mainly at women and young adults. More recently, with shows such as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', ''[[Boston Legal]]'' and ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'', the channel has broadened its audience reach to a wider range of [[Demography|demographics]], including men aged 18\u201345.\n\n==History ==\n'''UK Living''' began broadcasting on 1 September 1993, as part of the [[Sky Multichannels]] network. It was originally owned by a three way partnership; former [[ITV plc|ITV]] London franchise holder [[Thames Television]], [[Tele-Communications Inc.]] and fellow cable communications company Cox Enterprises, with a budget of \u00a325million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/thames-television-plans-satellitecable-channel-launch--3870 |title=Thames Television Plans Satellite/Cable Channel Launch |publisher=Telecompaper |date= |accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref> The channel was mainly aimed at women aged between 25 and 45, broadcasting films, dramas, chat shows and soap operas. Most of its original programming came from the programme libraries of Thames Television and the [[BBC]]. A unique aspect was the repeats of programmes such as ''Kilroy'', ''Anne and Nick'', and ''Floyd'', which were all shown within a week of being transmitted on mainstream television.\n\nBy January 1994, [[Living TV Group|Flextech]] (later known as Virgin Media Television and [[Living TV Group]]), took over TCI's shares in UK Living as part of a deal between the two companies<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/03/business/merger-plans-for-flextech.html |title=Merger Plans For Flextech |newspaper=The New York Times |date=3 January 1994 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"telecompaper.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/flextech-set-to-acquire-tci-programming |title=Flextech Set To Acquire TCI Programming |publisher=Telecompaper |date=21 December 1993 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nBy 1996, [[Telewest]]'s [[Living TV Group|Flextech]] division gained full control, after buying out the now-defunct Thames and Cox Enterprises.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Martyn |url=http://www.sat-net.com/listserver/ts-news/msg00139.html |title=TS News \u2013 Flextech Reveals BBC, UK Gold Talks |publisher=Sat-net.com |date=14 August 1996 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"independent.co.uk\">{{cite news|last=Horsman |first=Mathew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/flextech-ties-up-paytv-deal-1360937.html |title=Flextech ties up pay-TV deal |newspaper=The Independent |date=30 October 1996 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/flextech-set-to-agree-channels-deal-with-bbc |title=Flextech Set To Agree Channels Deal With BBC |publisher=Telecompaper |date=16 August 1996 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> Shortly afterwards the channel moved away from its reliance of [[BBC]] programming, and increase its output of American programming.\n\nIn 1997, when the BBC and [[Living TV Group|Flextech]] launched the UKTV Network: [[Home (TV channel)|UK Style]], [[UK Horizons]] and [[Alibi (TV channel)|UK Arena]], it was decided that UK Living would remain a separate channel. As such, it had to remove the 'UK' branding to avoid being confused with the UKTV services; thus UK Living became '''Living'''.\n\n===Sky ownership===\nBSkyB announced on 25 October 2010, that Living would be rebranded as '''Sky Living''' in early 2011 and moving EPG positions on Sky from channel 112 to 107, between [[Sky One]] and [[Sky Atlantic]], to improve their entertainment line-up.<ref name=Strength>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/investors/press_releases/2010/sky_confirms_strengthened_line_up|title=Sky confirms strengthened entertainment line-up|date=25 October 2010|work=[[British Sky Broadcasting]]|accessdate=25 October 2010}}</ref> As part of an attempt to appeal more to men, the channel's pink branding was replaced by a blue and silver logo in September 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Halliday |first=Josh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/24/sky-living-channel-rebrand |title=Sky Living director: 'I am de-pinking the channel' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 August 2013 |accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 June 2018, Sky announced that the channel would be rebranded as '''Sky Witness''' on 6 August 2018, bringing an end to the ''Living'' brand after 25 years.<ref>[https://www.a516digital.com/2018/06/sky-living-to-become-sky-witness.html Sky Living to become Sky Witness] a516digital, 8 June 2018</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Clarke |first1=Stewart |title=Sky Rebrands U.S. Drama Channel, Lands MGM\u2019s \u2018Harry Quebert\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/sky-witness-new-name-for-us-drama-channel-1202837204/ |work=Variety |date=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Sky by [[Comcast]], which already operated [[Universal TV (British and Irish TV channel)|Universal TV]], much of the programming previously screened on Universal TV, particularly first-run acquired series, transferred to Sky Witness, allowing Universal to be closed and replaced by [[Sky Comedy]].\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programmes broadcast by Sky Witness}}\n\nThe most watched shows on the channel are ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' and ''[[The Enfield Haunting]]''.\n\nThe channel has also aired [[Yvette Fielding]]'s ''[[Most Haunted]]'' and ''[[Most Haunted Live!]]'', in which Fielding and the team, that at one point included medium [[Derek Acorah]], investigate haunted locations in the UK and abroad. The show had brought some of the channel's biggest ratings to date.\n\nIn 2001, the channel helped to launch a whole new genre of [[paranormal]] programming with such shows as ''Crossing Over with John Edward'', ''6ixth Sense with Colin Fry'', ''[[Scream Team]]'', ''Jane Goldman Investigates'', ''[[Dead Famous (TV series)|Dead Famous]]'', ''[[I'm Famous and Frightened!]]'' and ''Most Haunted'', which continued to be popular.\u0175\n\nThe channel has also launched a number of successful US television shows in the UK market. Past successes include ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[Will & Grace]]'', ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'', ''[[Miss Match]]'', ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'', ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'', and ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]''.

However, in recent years, he has been mostly absent from the channel apart from the occasional ''[[Celebrity Extra]]'' presenting duties. Instead, fellow ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' contestant [[Jade Goody]] became the channel's newest public face, with three different shows devoted to her life, ''Jade's Salon'', ''Just Jade'' and ''Jade's PA'', but in January 2007, she was dropped due to the [[Celebrity Big Brother racism controversy|racism row]] on ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. In 2009, when Jade discovered that she had terminal cancer, the channel acquired the exclusive rights to film a documentary through her final days followed by the show producing two-hour-long tribute shows a week after her death followed by a further two tribute shows in 2010 and 2011.\n\nTo continue the list of reality TV stars hosting programmes, [[Jodie Marsh]] announced that she would be presenting a new programme called ''[[Get A Life (Reality TV Show)|Get A Life]]'' starting on 1 March 2007. However, the channel announced that the show was to be cancelled and discussions got underway as to whether the remaining four episodes would be aired.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a43988/living-gives-jodies-show-the-axe.html Living gives Jodie's show the axe] Digital Spy, 16 June 2007</ref>\n\nThe channel announced in February 2007 that [[Abigail Clancy]], the runner up of ''Britain's Next Top Model'' (cycle 2), signed a deal with the channel to make a new reality show with [[Janice Dickinson]] as her mentor, on trying to crack into America.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nThe channel announced in June 2010 that model [[Katie Price]] had signed a \u00a35&nbsp;million, 2-year contract to make and broadcast Series 3 and 4 of her fly-on-the-wall show, ''[[What Katie Did Next]]'', after turning down a weaker offer from rival channel [[ITV2]] to continue making further series of the show.

Also there is some independently produced series, some commissioned directly by Sky, focusing on Ireland's various emergency services, medical,  and certain Government of Ireland agencies, such as the Revenue Commissioners.

This was initially represented on-screen by the addition of the letters 'TV' to the established logo. In a 2004 branding relaunch, the way the name was displayed changed to '''LIVINGtv'''.\n\nIn a further change in 2007, the channel name reverted from LIVINGtv back to '''LIVING''' (still officially spelt all in capitals, though some media write the name in normal case). In 2009, the idents were changed to a 3D logo, with glass on the side of the 'L' in either pink or blue.

Instead, fellow ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' contestant [[Jade Goody]] became the channel's newest public face, with three different shows devoted to her life, ''Jade's Salon'', ''Just Jade'' and ''Jade's PA'', but in January 2007, she was dropped due to the [[Celebrity Big Brother racism controversy|racism row]] on ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''. In 2009, when Jade discovered that she had terminal cancer, the channel acquired the exclusive rights to film a documentary through her final days followed by the show producing two-hour-long tribute shows a week after her death followed by a further two tribute shows in 2010 and 2011.\n\nTo continue the list of reality TV stars hosting programmes, [[Jodie Marsh]] announced that she would be presenting a new programme called ''[[Get A Life (Reality TV Show)|Get A Life]]'' starting on 1 March 2007.

The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming. \n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world. He claimed that he mastered his magic without the help of tutors, spending years exploring the spirit realm of the Fade and coming to a rare understanding of its denizens. Although his skills are beyond doubt, it has been thus far impossible to verify the rest of his history as told.\"\n| source = \u2014Character Guide<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas presents himself as a self-taught hedge mage who wields powers developed outside of conventional teaching and who has no affiliation with the Chantry-sanctioned Circle of Magi or any Dalish clan. He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist. Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind.<ref name=\"PAX\"/> This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''. He appeared as [[Ianto Jones]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise.]]\n\nSolas was written by [[Patrick Weekes]], with heavy input from lead writer [[David Gaider]], although the character was originally conceived and named prior to Weekes joining the project.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> In an interview, Weekes said that Solas was initially based on [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor Who]] performance to capture his humanity and ancient nature.<ref>{{Citation|last=BioFan|title=BioFan Interview Patrick Weekes BioWare Lead Writer for Dragon Age|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0m_eQtwXA|accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref>Weekes noted that writing a character with hidden depths like Solas provided a great deal of both difficulty and opportunity. The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/> \n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/>, and he is also referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result. \n\n===''Trespasser''===\n''Trespasser'', the third and final [[downloadable content|DLC]] released for ''Inquisition'' is set two years after the defeat of Corypheus, and provides some insight into Solas' backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas. While investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, the Inquisitor visits several Elven ruins and learns that the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to being divine beings. After they became corrupt and abused their power, a rebellion was led by Fen'Harel, who created the Veil, and in doing so caused the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plans; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. \n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel and creating the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently. Regretful for his direct role in the downfall of elven civilization, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, hoping he would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating the darkspawn magister. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan. \n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace, the Inquisitor must either disband the Inquisition or repurpose it to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking either weaker efforts against Solas or corruption in the ranks, respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that elves across Thedas have disappeared to join Solas, in addition to detailing the fates of the Inquisitor's allies. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> The character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Tease\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/> \n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Sithma Illangasinghe acknowledges that she was inspired to write an opinion piece on [[Medium (website)|Medium]] about Solas' duplicity in ''Inquisition'' as \"his character had enchanted me to that extent which as a result I am now writing an analysis of his potential [[villain]]y we are to expect\".<ref name=\"Medium\"/> \n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece titled ''It\u2019s Been Three Years And I Still Hate Solas'' reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n\nIn her opinion piece ''It's Been Three Years, And I Still Love Solas'' published in response to Jackson's aforementioned opinion piece about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that, \"there's no question that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe is popular, in part, because it is so immersive, gorgeously rendered, and inclusive. Most of all, however, I think it inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that, \"Nowhere is this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.

The character made his debut in 2014's ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', where he serves as a [[Party (role-playing games)|party member]]. He is an [[elf|elven]] outlaw [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]]  operating outside of the edicts of the Chantry, the dominant religious organization in Thedas, the world setting of ''Dragon Age''. His primary interest is in the Fade, a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] realm that is tied to Thedas which is normally accessible only through dreaming. \n\nSolas sought out and joined the Inquisition shortly after a massive explosion at a peace conference killed everyone present, except for the protagonist, who was discovered emerging from a [[Portal (architecture)|dimensional rift]]. This is followed by the opening of the Breach, a massive dimensional tear in the sky that allows multitudes of demonic spirits to pass through into the physical world. Solas sets himself up as the Inquisition's expert on the Fade and its denizens; his knowledge and expertise proving instrumental in aiding the organisation's struggle to close the Breach and defend the world from invaders coming through Fade rifts.\n\nSolas is voiced by Welsh actor [[Gareth David-Lloyd]].\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = left\n| quote = \"Solas professed to have spent his life as an apostate, living in the wilderness well away from the civilized world. He claimed that he mastered his magic without the help of tutors, spending years exploring the spirit realm of the Fade and coming to a rare understanding of its denizens. Although his skills are beyond doubt, it has been thus far impossible to verify the rest of his history as told.\"\n| source = \u2014Character Guide<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas presents himself as a self-taught hedge mage who wields powers developed outside of conventional teaching and who has no affiliation with the Chantry-sanctioned Circle of Magi or any Dalish clan. He spends much of his time dreaming in ancient ruins and learning all there is to learn about what lies beyond the Veil, a metaphysical barrier which normally prevents direct physical access between the physical Thedas and the Fade.<ref name=\"Memories\"/> Solas believes in cause and effect, wisdom as its own reward and the inherent right of all free willed people to exist. Solas concludes that the many current conflicts in Thedas, such as the Mage-Templar War or the racial tensions between elves and humans, are little more than the black-and-white reductionist dichotomies which have led to the many tragedies of history.\n\nSolas sometimes speaks in [[iambic pentameter]], and the Inquisitor will gain approval when replying in kind.<ref name=\"PAX\"/> This is a deliberate design choice, given his characterization and personality.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/><ref name=\"Sound\"/>\n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Gareth David-Lloyd by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|Gareth David-Lloyd, the voice of Solas in ''Inquisition''. He appeared as [[Ianto Jones]] in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' franchise.]]\n\nSolas was written by [[Patrick Weekes]], with heavy input from lead writer [[David Gaider]], although the character was originally conceived and named prior to Weekes joining the project.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> In an interview, Weekes said that Solas was initially based on [[David Tennant]]'s [[Tenth Doctor|Doctor Who]] performance to capture his humanity and ancient nature.<ref>{{Citation|last=BioFan|title=BioFan Interview Patrick Weekes BioWare Lead Writer for Dragon Age|date=2016-03-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aj0m_eQtwXA|accessdate=2016-03-30}}</ref>Weekes noted that writing a character with hidden depths like Solas provided a great deal of both difficulty and opportunity. The character is depicted within an in-game cutscene as disdaining tea.<ref name=\"Tea\"/> Besides the fact that tea, particularly caffeinated tea, is a stimulant which may hinder Solas from crossing into the Fade during sleep, the character's dislike of tea also reflects Weekes' personal dislike of tea.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/>\n\nOriginally, Solas was not available as a romance option in ''Inquisition''; according to Mike Laidlaw, BioWare redesigned him as a potential love interest for a female elven Inquisitor when they extended the game's development for a year.<ref name=\"Romance\"/> Weekes noted that this was an opportunity to increase the basic sadness of the character.<ref name=\"Nerd\"/> Solas will initiate the breakup of his relationship with the Inquisitor at the conclusion of the romance subplot, regardless of the player's choices.<ref name=\"Heartbreak\"/>\n\nIn a video uploaded on BioWare's official YouTube channel titled \"What Makes a Good Character?\", Weekes used [[Harry Potter]] as a metaphor to explain how Solas perceives himself as the hero of the story; he feels he is \"this luckless, unfortunate person who by an unpleasant destiny and the simple fact that no one else has the ability to do it, that it has to be him and that someone else would get it wrong\".<ref name=\"Good\"/>\n \nDuring a [[wikt:Q and A|Q&A]] session at the Phoenix Fan Fest 2015, Gareth David-Lloyd revealed that he recorded voice work for Solas over a period of two and a half years. He was provided with a simple outline and some lines on a screen to work with in lieu of a comprehensive backstory for Solas; he eventually developed a stronger idea of who the character is about three or four months after he started.<ref name=\"Phoenix\"/> \n\n===Visual design===\nSolas is envisioned by Weekes to be a middle-aged man in his early to mid-forties.<ref name=\"Weekes\"/> His appearance is reflective of a wandering nomad's lifestyle, who journeys from place to place without a set destination. BioWare's designers intended Solas to appear as if he is wearing all that he owns, and that his items of clothing are meant to look like homemade improvisations born from necessity.<ref name=\"Art\"/> \n\nConcept art displayed in ''The Art of Dragon Age Inquisition'' book shows the creative process for Solas as the team develops his look after many renditions to match the ideas provided by other creative teams. After exploring many different hairstyles, the final decision was made to design Solas with a bold, bald head. This is intended to evoke a sense of ageless wisdom required by his character.<ref name=\"Art\"/> His visage is subsequently associated with that of an egg by ''Dragon Age'' fandom<ref name=\"Hate\"/><ref name=\"FanByte\"/><ref name=\"Gaider\"/>, and he is also referred to as an [[egghead]].<ref name=\"Egghead\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===''Inquisition''===\nSolas is encountered at the beginning of the game, fighting demons alongside [[Varric Tethras]] and a few Inquisition personnel. It is revealed that right after the calamity began where the Breach opened, Solas approached the fledgling Inquisition's leadership. He claimed that he might be able to help the sole survivor of the Divine Conclave's explosion and the suspiciously glowing mark on their hand, and that he would not stand idly by when his knowledge of the arcane could mean the difference between salvation and utter destruction. He was granted permission to study the survivor and one of the smaller rifts, in hopes of finding a way to seal the Breach and help the prisoner. Solas claims that he managed to use healing magic and minor wards to prevent the mark on the survivor's hand from growing and save their life.\n\nHe helps the Inquisitor seal a small rift shortly after their meeting, and then follows them to the Temple itself to close the first and largest rift, which he theorizes would stabilize the Breach. After the Inquisitor successfully enlists the help of either the mages or the templars, Solas assists the Inquisitor with closing the Breach itself. Following the destruction of the Inquisition's base in Haven by the Elder One, now revealed as an ancient darkspawn and formerly human magister known as Corypheus, Solas explains that the orb that he wields as a weapon is of elven origin. It is in fact one of the foci used by the elves to channel ancient magics. He worries that if the orb's origin were to be revealed, it may have negative consequences for the reputation of the elven people. He then guides the Inquisitor to Skyhold, a disused fortress located in the Frostback Mountains that the Inquisition could claim as its new headquarters.\n\nWhen the Inquisitor finally defeats Corypheus and stops him from opening another rift, with the orb being damaged permanently in the process,  Solas seems distraught and laments the destruction of the orb as the loss of yet another elven artifact. He disappears shortly afterwards, his whereabouts are completely untraceable by the Inquisition's agents. In the [[post-credits scene]] it is revealed that Solas is '''Fen'Harel''', an ancient being who is a member of the elven [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon of gods]], and a recurring [[trickster]] figure in ''Dragon Age'' lore. The elven orb actually belonged to him; he intended to use Corypheus to unlock the orb's power, which is something he could not accomplish on his own as he had awakened from millennia of slumber in the Fade and was too weak as a result. \n\n===''Trespasser''===\n''Trespasser'', the third and final [[downloadable content|DLC]] released for ''Inquisition'' is set two years after the defeat of Corypheus, and provides some insight into Solas' backstory and motives, as well as his involvement in the current world state of Thedas. While investigating a Qunari plot to invade Thedas, the Inquisitor visits several Elven ruins and learns that the Evanuris were in fact extremely powerful mages as to opposed to being divine beings. After they became corrupt and abused their power, a rebellion was led by Fen'Harel, who created the Veil, and in doing so caused the civilization of the ancient elves to collapse due to its dependency on magic. The Inquisitor eventually encounters the Viddasala, the Qunari leader in charge of \"Dragon's Breath\", a plot that involves Qunari sleeper agents within the Inquisition smuggling barrels of \"gaatlock\" (The Qunari version of [[gunpowder]]) into seats of power across southern Thedas, with the intention of wiping out its leadership and facilitating an invasion. She claims that the Qunari instigated it to prevent incidents like the Breach from being repeated. The Inquisitor also learn that agents supposedly working for Fen'Harel have been disrupting the Qunari plans; concurrently, the Inquisitor is losing control of the Anchor, threatening their life. The Inquisitor foils the plot and follows the Viddasala into the Eluvian network to confront Solas, despite the Anchor growing increasingly out of control. \n\nAfter petrifying the Viddasala, Solas calms the Anchor to explain himself to the Inquisitor. He confesses to being Fen'Harel and creating the Veil to seal away the Evanuris after they assassinated Mythal, sundering the physical world and the Fade permanently. Regretful for his direct role in the downfall of elven civilization, Solas now plans to unmake the Veil he created millennia ago and restore the ancient elven world by reuniting the physical world and the Fade, being fully aware that this act may potentially destroy the world in its present state and killing countless lives in the process. He also admits to engineering the events which led to the Breach, albeit inadvertently; he had initially arranged for Corypheus to obtain his orb, hoping he would unlock it and destroy himself in the subsequent explosion. Solas would then retrieve the orb and use the Anchor to achieve his goal. Realizing later that Corypheus survived the orb's destructive power, he joined the Inquisition to guide the organization into defeating the darkspawn magister. Solas also reveals that he allowed the Qunari's Dragon's Breath plot to be discovered so that the Inquisitor may thwart it, and that he has double agents working within the Inquisition, before ultimately amputating the Inquisitor's arm to prevent the Anchor from killing them and leaving. The Inquisitor may resolve to either stop Solas by any means necessary or attempt to convince him to abandon his plan. \n\nUpon returning to the Winter Palace, the Inquisitor must either disband the Inquisition or repurpose it to serve directly under Divine Victoria, risking either weaker efforts against Solas or corruption in the ranks, respectively. An epilogue reveals that, following the failure of the Viddasala's plot, the Qunari disavowed her actions and resumed their war with Tevinter, and that elves across Thedas have disappeared to join Solas, in addition to detailing the fates of the Inquisitor's allies. Regardless, the Inquisitor resolves to follow through with their vow to Solas, noting his familiarity with the workings of the Inquisition and planning to recruit new allies from Tevinter.\n\n===Other appearances===\nFen'Harel's [[sobriquet]], '''The Dread Wolf''', and associated imagery is referenced by a promotional trailer released by BioWare during the 5th annual [[The Game Awards]] show in December 2018.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> The character has been the focus for much of the media coverage pertaining to information released by BioWare about the [[Dragon Age#Dragon Age 4|upcoming fourth main entry]] of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Tease\"/><ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/> \n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote =  It doesn\u2019t surprise me at all that Solas is a popular character with a huge fanbase. There are so few characters in games that feel this real. In some twisted way, my hatred of Solas makes me a fan, inasmuch as I hope he comes back for later games and I can tell him how I really feel. I empathize with Solas. I truly understand why he is so condescending, thinks he knows the solution to everything, is dismissive of other points of view, and is a massive racist. I applaud the writers of Inquisition for their effort, and I thank them for writing a scene where I can punch Solas in the face.\n| source = \u2014Gita Jackson, ''Kotaku''<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n}}\n\nSolas has been positively received as a complex and well-written character. Patricia Hernandez of ''Kotaku'' was fascinated by the [[plot (narrative)|plot twist]] in the post-credit scene of ''Inquisition'' which reveals his true identity. She observed that the reveal was a subject of intense discussion by ''Dragon Age'' fandom on social media at the time. She concludes that \"the ending is a [[cliffhanger]], and a damn good one at that\".<ref name=\"Ending\"/> Sithma Illangasinghe acknowledges that she was inspired to write an opinion piece on [[Medium (website)|Medium]] about Solas' duplicity in ''Inquisition'' as \"his character had enchanted me to that extent which as a result I am now writing an analysis of his potential [[villain]]y we are to expect\".<ref name=\"Medium\"/> \n\nGita Jackson from ''[[Kotaku]]'' dislikes the character on a personal level. The opening paragraph of her opinion piece titled ''It\u2019s Been Three Years And I Still Hate Solas'' reads: \"Solas is one of the best-written characters in video games. It\u2019s hard for me to think of a character whose loathsome worldview is so well developed, who, even when he\u2019s on your side, manages to be a complete piece of shit about everything. He is a such a great character that I want to strangle that dude with my bare hands\".<ref name=\"Hate\"/>\n\nIn her opinion piece ''It's Been Three Years, And I Still Love Solas'' published in response to Jackson's aforementioned opinion piece about Solas, Angela D. Mitchell finds the character too complex, too trapped, and too tragic for her to despise. She noted that, \"there's no question that BioWare's ''Dragon Age'' universe is popular, in part, because it is so immersive, gorgeously rendered, and inclusive. Most of all, however, I think it inspires so many deep emotions because of the rich, complex characters that fans passionately love and hate.\" She further noted that, \"Nowhere is this level of emotional response more visible, however, than with the character of Solas, the ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' (DAI) companion who is ultimately revealed to be the elven god Fen'Harel and our unexpected adversary\".<ref name=\"Love\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the sixty-second trailer for the upcoming fourth installment of the ''Dragon Age'' series released in December 2018, Kat Brewster from ''[[IGN]]'' said \"...In true BioWare trickery, The Dread Wolf had been hiding in tapestries and lore all since ''[[Dragon Age: Origins|Origins]]''\". She called Solas \"the dear elven pal we love to hate and hate to love\".<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Alison Stalberg from ''TheGamer.com'' rated Solas highly for his intellect, saying \"Not only did he outsmart all the characters, he created the Fade. He imprisoned the elf gods. We still do not know what else he has in store.\"<ref name=\"Intellect\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Characters of Dragon Age: Inquisition|Characters of ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'']]\n*[[Elves in fiction]]\n*[[List of fictional tricksters]]\n{{Portal bar|Video games}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Memories\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Inquisition |developer=BioWare |level=Haven/Skyhold |quote='''Solas''':  Some of my fondest memories were found in crumbling cities long picked dry by treasure seekers.

When she is on her way home, she gets into an accident, which leads to memory loss that can only allow her remember anything for just 24 hours. She keeps a diary where she jots down all her memories.\n\nThen we meet Gautham([[Vineeth Sreenivasan]]) a young businessman who also suffers from temporary memory problems. His mother ([[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]]) get annoyed with him and asks him to marry a girl, Hema ([[Muktha (actress)|Muktha]]), whom he doesn't like. Angry with his mother because of this, he and his grandmother (Lakshmi) make a plan. The plan is that he will say that he is in love with another girl and the next day they are going to have a date.\n\nThe next morning he goes for a walk around the city looking for a date. He then meets Nithya and watches her sand art and memory show. They fall in love. Nithya does not write her memories of Gautham in her memory book, as she thinks if they are real soul mates then this magic will happen.\n\nThe next day they meet, but Nithya does not recognize Gautham. Then Gautham, his friend Apoorva ( [[Aju Varghese]]) and Nithya's sister Neetu ([[Soumya Sadanandan]]) make up plans to meet Nithya again, and at last he succeeds. He tells his mother that he loves Nithya and then brings her to his house. There they realize their love for each Other.\n\nThe next day Nithya forgets him, but reminds herself about him after reading her memory book. She then says that they can never stay together and so tears his memories from her book. They go their separate ways. Later Gautham is travelling to the US for a meeting, and he meets Neetu at the airport. She says that Nithya is fine. She then shows him the video of Nithya's program.\n\nHe sees that the pictures drawn were related to him. That moment he abandons his trip and goes to watch Nithya's show. When she sees him there, she gets draws her image of him. But when he asks her whether she remembers him, she says no. Gautham returns, and then sees his mother in the auditorium. His mother asks him to turn back. When he looks at the screen he sees Nithya drawing his face. Gautham runs back to the stage and asks her \"whether she really does not know him.\" She replies that \"even without knowing who you are I used to draw your pictures.\" Then they understand that even though she forgets everything after 24 hours, she will never be able to forget him as she loves him.\n\nThen they marry and live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Namitha Pramod]] as Nithya, Sand animation artist\n* [[Vineeth Sreenivasan]] as Gautham, Young businessman\n* [[Aju Varghese]] as Apoorva, Gautham's best pal\n* [[Soumya Sadanandan]] as Neethu, Nithya's Sister\n* [[Rohini (actress)|Rohini]] as Vasundhara Devi, Gautham's mother\n* [[Lakshmi (actress)|Lakshmi]] as Gautham's grand mother\n* [[Muktha (actress)|Muktha]] as Hema\n* [[Idavela Babu]] as Hema's Father\n* [[Anju Aravind]] as Hema's Mother\n* [[Mukesh (actor)|Mukesh]] as Nithya's Doctor/ Uncle John Kuruvilla\n* [[Reena Basheer]]\n* [[Raveendran (actor)|Raveendran]] as Gautham's Father\n* [[Bhagath Manuel]]\n\n==Production==\nFilming commenced in August 2014 in Kochi <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/shooting-ormayundo-ee-mukham-starring-vineeth-namitha-begins-607047|title=Shooting of 'Ormayundo Ee Mukham' Starring Vineeth and Namitha Begins|first=Nicy|last=V.P|publisher=}}</ref> and later took place at various locations including [[Pune]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/ormayundo-ee-mugam-starts-rolling-news-malayalam-ojqlMtcicgcaj.html|title='Ormayundo Ee Mugam' Starts Rolling|publisher=}}</ref> [[Angamaly]] <ref name = hi/> and [[Alappuzha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/Ormayundo-ee-mugham-shooting-progresses/articleshow/41785679.cms|title=Ormayundo ee mugham shooting progresses - Times of India|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Ormayundo Ee Mukham\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Shaan Rahman\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Poster\n| released   = {{Date|24 October 2014}}\n| recorded   = 2014\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film Soundtrack|Feature film soundtrack]]\n| length     =\n| language   = [[Malayalam]]\n| label      = [[Muzik 247]]\n| producer   = Shaan Rahman\n| prev_title = [[Saheba Subramanyam]]\n| prev_year  = 2014\n| next_title = [[Aadu Oru Bheegara Jeevi Aanu]]\n| next_year  = 2015\n}}\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed by [[Shaan Rahman]], Vineeth Sreenivasan's usual associate.

Nevertheless, two major phylogeographic groupings were discovered in dholes of the Asian mainland, which likely diverged during a [[Glacial period|glaciation event]]. One population extends from South, Central and North India (south of the Ganges) into Burma, and the other extends from India north of the Ganges into northeastern India, Burma, Thailand and the Malaysian Peninsula. The origin of dholes in Sumatra and Java is, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, unclear, as they show greater relatedness to dholes in India, Burma and China rather than with those in nearby Malaysia.

These \"cities\" may be developed over many generations of dholes, and are shared by the clan females when raising young together.<ref name=\"f43\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|pp=43\u201349}}</ref> Like [[African wild dog]]s and [[dingo]]es, dholes will avoid killing prey close to their dens.<ref name=\"f80\"/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n[[File:Cuon alpinus alpinus puppy.jpg|thumb|Dhole pup, [[Kolm\u00e5rden Wildlife Park]]]]\nIn India, the [[mating season]] occurs between mid-October and January, while captive dholes in the [[Moscow Zoo]] breed mostly in February.<ref name=\"cohen1978\"/> Unlike wolf packs, dhole clans may contain more than one breeding female.<ref name=\"f86\"/> More than one female dhole may den and rear their litters together in the same den.<ref name=\"nowak1983\"/> During [[mating]], the female assumes a crouched, cat-like position.

Competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection, although there is still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically target animals in the 30\u2013175&nbsp;kg range (mean weights of 35.3&nbsp;kg for dhole and 23.4&nbsp;kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176&nbsp;kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5&nbsp;kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality and aggressiveness, may play a role in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |author1=Karanth, K.

The winter fur was prized by the Chinese, who bought dhole pelts in [[Ussuriysk]] during the late 1860s for a few silver [[ruble]]s. In the early 20th century, dhole pelts reached eight rubles in [[Manchuria]]. In [[Semirechye]], [[fur coat]]s made from dhole skin were considered the warmest, but were very costly.<ref name=\"heptner1998\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn India, the dhole is protected under Schedule 2 of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]. The creation of reserves under [[Project Tiger]] provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s.

They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even [[Shere Khan]] and [[Hathi]] make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes. With Mowgli and [[Kaa]]'s help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle.\n\nJapanese author Uchida Roan wrote \u72ac\u7269\u8a9e (''Inu monogatari''; A dog's tale) in 1901 as a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds, which he asserted were descended from the dhole.<ref>Skabelund, A.

Today, their ranges are remote from each other; however, during the [[Pleistocene]] era the dhole could be found as far west as Europe.

Nevertheless, two major phylogeographic groupings were discovered in dholes of the Asian mainland, which likely diverged during a [[Glacial period|glaciation event]]. One population extends from South, Central and North India (south of the Ganges) into Burma, and the other extends from India north of the Ganges into northeastern India, Burma, Thailand and the Malaysian Peninsula. The origin of dholes in Sumatra and Java is, {{as of|2005|lc=y}}, unclear, as they show greater relatedness to dholes in India, Burma and China rather than with those in nearby Malaysia.

In this manner, they closely resemble African wild dogs in social structure.<ref name=\"f85\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=85}}</ref> They live in [[clan]]s rather than [[pack (canine)|pack]]s, as the latter term refers to a group of animals that always hunt together.

Dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks. The entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical, with a sharp turn three to four feet down. The tunnel opens into an antechamber, from which extends more than one passage. Some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to {{convert|100|ft}} of interconnecting tunnels.

Once [[weaning]] begins, the adults of the clan will regurgitate food for the pups until they are old enough to join in hunting. They remain at the den site for 70\u201380 days.

Competition between these species is mostly avoided through differences in prey selection, although there is still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically target animals in the 30\u2013175&nbsp;kg range (mean weights of 35.3&nbsp;kg for dhole and 23.4&nbsp;kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176&nbsp;kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5&nbsp;kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality and aggressiveness, may play a role in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal |author1=Karanth, K.

Certain people, such as the [[Kuruba|Kurumbas]] and some [[Mon Khmer]]-speaking tribes will appropriate dhole kills; some Indian villagers welcome the dhole because of this appropriation of dhole kills.<ref name=\"nowak1983\"/> Dholes were persecuted throughout India for bounties until they were given protection by the [[Wildlife Protection Act of 1972]]. Methods used for dhole hunting included poisoning, snaring, shooting and clubbing at den sites.

Persecution of dholes still occurs with varying degrees of intensity according to the region.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> Bounties paid for dholes used to be 25 [[rupee]]s, though this was reduced to 20 in 1926 after the number of presented dhole carcasses became too numerous to maintain the established reward.<ref name=\"f109\">{{Harvnb|Fox|1984|p=109}}</ref> In Indochina, dholes suffer heavily from nonselective hunting techniques such as snaring.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/>\n\nThe [[fur trade]] does not pose a significant threat to dholes.<ref name=\"durbin2004\"/> The people of India do not eat dhole flesh and their fur is not considered overly valuable.<ref name=\"mivart1890\"/> Due to their rarity, dholes were never harvested for their skins in large numbers in the [[Soviet Union]] and were sometimes accepted as dog or wolf pelts (being labeled as \"half wolf\" for the latter). The winter fur was prized by the Chinese, who bought dhole pelts in [[Ussuriysk]] during the late 1860s for a few silver [[ruble]]s. In the early 20th century, dhole pelts reached eight rubles in [[Manchuria]]. In [[Semirechye]], [[fur coat]]s made from dhole skin were considered the warmest, but were very costly.<ref name=\"heptner1998\"/>\n\n== Conservation ==\nIn India, the dhole is protected under Schedule 2 of the [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]]. The creation of reserves under [[Project Tiger]] provided some protection for dhole populations sympatric with [[Bengal tiger|tiger]]s.

This fear and superstition was not, however, shared by neighbouring [[Tungusic peoples]].\n\nVon Schrenk speculated that this differing attitude towards dholes was due to the Tungusic people's more nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle.<ref name=\"schrenk1859\">{{in lang|de}} [[Leopold von Schrenck|Schrenk, L. v.]] (1859), [https://archive.org/stream/reisenundforschu0112schr#page/48/mode/2up ''Reisen und forschungen im Amur-lande in den jahren 1854\u20131856''], St. Petersburg : K. Akademie der Wissenschaften, pp. 48\u201350</ref> Dhole-like animals are described in numerous old European texts, including the [[Ostrogoths|Ostrogoth]] [[saga]]s, where they are portrayed as [[hellhound]]s.<ref name=\"smith1839\"/> The demon dogs accompanying [[Harlequin|Hellequin]] in Mediaeval French [[Passion Play]]s, as well as the ones inhabiting the legendary forest of [[Broc\u00e9liande]], have been attributed to dholes.<ref name=\"smith1839\"/> According to [[Charles Hamilton Smith]], the dangerous wild canids mentioned by [[Scaliger]] as having lived in the forests of [[Province of Pisa|Montefalcone]] could have been based on dholes, as they were described as unlike wolves in habits, voice and appearance. The Montefalcone family's [[coat of arms]] had a pair of red dogs as supporters.<ref name=\"smith1839\"/>\n\nDholes appear in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Red Dog (Kipling short story)|Red Dog]]'', where they are portrayed as aggressive and bloodthirsty animals which descend from the [[Deccan Plateau]] into the [[Seoni, Madhya Pradesh|Seeonee Hills]] inhabited by [[Mowgli]] and his adopted wolf pack to cause carnage among the jungle's denizens. They are described as living in packs numbering hundreds of individuals, and that even [[Shere Khan]] and [[Hathi]] make way for them when they descend into the jungle. The dholes are despised by the wolves because of their destructiveness, their habit of not living in dens and the hair between their toes. With Mowgli and [[Kaa]]'s help, the Seeonee wolf pack manages to wipe out the dholes by leading them through bee hives and torrential waters before finishing off the rest in battle.\n\nJapanese author Uchida Roan wrote \u72ac\u7269\u8a9e (''Inu monogatari''; A dog's tale) in 1901 as a [[Japanese nationalism|nationalistic]] critique of the declining popularity of indigenous dog breeds, which he asserted were descended from the dhole.<ref>Skabelund, A.

They can be found hunting the player and other [[non-player character|NPCs]] across the map, but are easily killed, being one of the weakest enemies in the game. They once again appear in the video game ''[[Far Cry Primal]]'', where they play similar roles as their counterparts in the previous game, but can now also be tamed and used in combat by Takkar, the main protagonist of the game.\n\n===Tameability===\n[[Brian Houghton Hodgson]] kept captured dholes in captivity, and found, with the exception of one animal, they remained shy and vicious even after 10 months.<ref name=\"mivart1890\"/> According to [[Richard Lydekker]], adult dholes are nearly impossible to tame, though pups are docile and can even be allowed to play with domestic dog pups until they reach early adulthood.<ref name=\"lydekker1907\"/> A dhole may have been presented as a gift to [[Ibbi-Sin]] as tribute.<ref>McIntosh, J.

He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. \n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur. The [[Luni River]] and its tributaries are the major river system of Godwar and Marwar regions, draining the western slopes of the Aravallis and emptying southwest into the great [[Rann of Kutch]] wetland in neighbouring [[Gujarat]]. This river is saline in the lower reaches and remains potable only up to Balotara in Barmer district. The [[Ghaggar River]], which originates in [[Haryana]], is an intermittent stream that disappears into the sands of the Thar Desert in the northern corner of the state and is seen as a remnant of the primitive [[Sarasvati river]].\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2013}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"margin:1em; float:right; width:25%;\"\n|+ '''State symbols of '''Rajasthan'''\n|-\n| '''Formation day'''\n| 1 November\n|-\n| '''State animal'''\n| [[Chinkara]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\">{{cite web|title=States and Union Territories Symbols|url=http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|accessdate=7 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112080035/http://knowindia.gov.in/knowindia/national_symbols.php?id=16#raj|archivedate=12 November 2013}}</ref> and [[Camel]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Now the state animal camel|url=http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|accessdate=7 July 2014|work=Patrika Group|date=1 July 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806141624/http://www.patrika.com/news/now-the-state-animal-camel/1015253|archivedate=6 August 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| '''State bird'''\n| [[Great Indian bustard|Godavan (great Indian bustard)]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State flower'''\n| Flower \u2013 [[Tecomella undulata|Rohida]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|-\n| '''State Tree'''\n| [[Prosopis cineraria|Khejri]]<ref name=\"Rajasthan State Symbol\" />\n|}\n[[File:Sonchiriya.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The [[great Indian bustard]] has been classed as [[critically endangered]] since 2011.]]\nThough a large percentage of the total area is desert with little forest cover, Rajasthan has a rich and varied flora and fauna.

[[Mount Abu]] lies at the southwestern end of the range, separated from the main ranges by the [[West Banas River]], although a series of broken ridges continues into [[Haryana]] in the direction of [[Delhi]] where it can be seen as outcrops in the form of the [[Raisina Hill]] and the ridges farther north. About three-fifths of Rajasthan lies northwest of the Aravallis, leaving two-fifths on the east and south direction.\n\nThe Aravalli Range runs across the state from the southwest peak [[Guru Shikhar]] (Mount Abu), which is {{convert|1722|m}} in height, to [[Khetri]] in the northeast. This range divides the state into 60% in the northwest of the range and 40% in the southeast. The northwest tract is sandy and unproductive with little water but improves gradually from desert land in the far west and northwest to comparatively fertile and habitable land towards the east. The area includes the Thar Desert. The south-eastern area, higher in elevation (100 to 350&nbsp;m above sea level) and more fertile, has a very diversified topography. in the south lies the hilly tract of Mewar. In the southeast, a large area within the districts of [[Kota district|Kota]] and [[Bundi]] forms a tableland. To the northeast of these districts is a rugged region (badlands) following the line of the [[Chambal River]]. Farther north the country levels out; the flat plains of the northeastern [[Bharatpur district]] are part of an [[alluvial]] basin. [[Merta City]] lies in the geographical centre of Rajasthan.\n\nThe Aravalli Range and the lands to the east and southeast of the range are generally more fertile and better watered. This region is home to the [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]] ecoregion, with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forests]] that include [[teak]], ''[[Acacia]]'', and other trees. The hilly [[Vagad]] region, home to the cities of [[Dungarpur]] and [[Banswara]] lies in southernmost Rajasthan, on the border with Gujarat and [[Madhya Pradesh]]. With the exception of Mount Abu, Vagad is the wettest region in Rajasthan, and the most heavily forested. North of Vagad lies the [[Mewar]] region, home to the cities of [[Udaipur]] and [[Chittaurgarh]]. The [[Hadoti]] region lies to the southeast, on the border with Madhya Pradesh. North of Hadoti and Mewar lies the [[Dhundhar]] region, home to the state capital of [[Jaipur]]. [[Mewat]], the easternmost region of Rajasthan, borders [[Haryana]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern and southeastern Rajasthan is drained by the [[Banas River|Banas]] and [[Chambal River|Chambal]] rivers, tributaries of the [[Ganges]].\n\nThe northwestern portion of Rajasthan is generally sandy and dry. Most of this region is covered by the [[Thar Desert]] which extends into adjoining portions of Pakistan. The Aravalli Range does not intercept the moisture-giving southwest [[monsoon]] winds off the [[Arabian Sea]], as it lies in a direction parallel to that of the coming monsoon winds, leaving the northwestern region in a [[rain shadow]]. The Thar Desert is thinly populated; the town of [[Jodhpur]] is the largest city in the desert and known as the gateway of the Thar desert. The desert has some major districts like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Bikaner and Nagour. This area is also important in defence point of view. Jodhpur airbase is one of the largest airbase in India, BSF and Military bases are also situated here. A single civil airport is also situated in Jodhpur. \n\nThe [[Northwestern thorn scrub forests]] lie in a band around the Thar Desert, between the desert and the Aravallis. This region receives less than 400&nbsp;mm of rain annually. Temperatures can sometimes exceed 54&nbsp;\u00b0C in the summer months or {{convert|129|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} and drop below freezing point in the winter. The [[Godwar]], [[Marwar]], and [[Shekhawati]] [[List of regions in India|regions]] lie in the thorn scrub forest zone, along with the city of Jodhpur.

Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The scarcity of water and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking. It is known for its snacks like [[Bikaneri Bhujia]]. Other famous dishes include ''bajre ki roti'' (millet bread) and ''lahsun ki chutney'' (hot garlic paste), ''mawa kachori'' [[Mirchi Bada]], [[Pyaaj Kachori]] and [[ghevar]] from Jodhpur, [[Alwar]] ka Mawa (milk cake), ''Kadhi kachori'' from Ajmer, ''malpauas'' from Pushkar, Daal [[kachori]] (Kota kachori) from Kota and rassgollas from Bikaner.

Folk music is a large part of Rajasthani culture. The [[Manganiyar]] and [[Langha (tribe)|Langa]] communities from Rajasthan are notable for their folk music. [[Kathputli (puppetry)|Kathputli]], [[Bhopa]], Chang, Teratali, Ghindr, [[Gair dance]], Kachchhi Ghori, and [[Tejaji]] are examples of traditional Rajasthani culture. Folk songs are commonly ballads which relate heroic deeds and love stories; and religious or devotional songs known as bhajans and banis which are often accompanied by musical instruments like [[dholak]], [[sitar]], and [[sarangi]] are also sung.\n\nRajasthan is known for its traditional, colourful art. The block prints, tie and dye prints, gota patti (main), Bagaru prints, Sanganer prints, and [[Zari]] embroidery are major export products from Rajasthan. Handicraft items like wooden furniture and crafts, carpets, and blue pottery are commonly found here. Shopping reflects the colourful culture, Rajasthani clothes have a lot of mirror work and embroidery. A Rajasthani traditional dress for females comprises an ankle-length skirt and a short top, known as ''[[chaniya choli]]''Mainly pure owned by traditional people . A piece of cloth is used to cover the head, both for protection from heat and maintenance of modesty. Rajasthani dresses are usually designed in bright colours like blue, yellow and orange.\n\nThe main religious festivals are [[Deepawali]], [[Holi]], [[Gangaur]], [[Teej]], [[Gogaji]], [[Devnarayan|Shri Devnarayan Jayanti]], [[Makar Sankranti]] and [[Janmashtami]], as the main religion is [[Hinduism]].
