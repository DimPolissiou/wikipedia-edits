Once a [[multi-sports club]], since 2001 it has only two sections: [[Football (soccer)|football]] and [[volleyball]].\n\n==History==\n\n===The beginning===\nThe growing interest in sport in the country in the 1920s had a major impact on the international success of Astra athletes, especially Olympic gold medals of [[Halina Konopacka]] and [[Janusz Kusoci\u0144ski]]. In Krotoszyn the conditions were favourable: the attitude of the local authorities, the existence of a military garrison and secondary schools, the activity of the local intelligentsia, artisans and merchants. With the establishment of a municipal Astra club (meaning Star) in 1929, the town capitalised on hopes to establish durable development of sport.\n\nThe club formed several sections: [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], [[Association football|football]], [[bowling]], [[ice skating]], [[cycling]], [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], [[boxing]], [[motor club]], [[volleyball]] and [[basketball]]. Organized demonstrations, and later occupations, often on the occasion of various anniversaries and holidays.\n\nThose were the years of promoting new disciplines, become familiar with the rules and principles of training. The coaches and the youth were trained, although the latter initially were not allowed to join the club at first, and later overturned under condition of parental consent. Organizational weakness stemmed from the managerial changes, which occurred eight times during the first 10 years of existence, among the CEOs and board of directors. Despite the presence of mayors, officials and traders in the management, the club suffered severe financial shortages all the time. Funds for the purchase of equipment and uniforms were raised by organizing games, theatre performances, concerts, trips to Pozna\u0144 for international matches.\n\nA competition for the club were other associations&nbsp;\u2013 \"Gymnastic Society Sok\u00f3l\", ''Zwi\u0105zek Strzelecki'' ([[Shooting sport|shooting]] club), ''Bractwo Kurkowe'' (which later gained the support of municipal authorities). The club had survived this tough period. Greatest successes were in the swimming section. Their work was helped by two true sports fanatics&nbsp;\u2013 brothers John and Wladyslaw Szlachta. For the swimming competitions the top clubs from all around [[Greater Poland]] would arrive. Interest was also high for boxing matches, athletics and football.\n\n===Conflict with KS Kolejarz===\n\nIn the tragic years of [[World War II]], many activists and players of the club sacrificed their lives: Tadeusz Fenrych (mayor), Francis Dominiczak, Francis Hechmann, Zdzislaw Klemczak, Anthony Piaczy\u0144ski, Marian Drozdzynski, Stefan Kurzawski, Valerian Michalak, Wojciech Nowak, Marian Fish, Richard Zeller .\n\nAfter the war, activists and former players of the club reactivated the club on 30 May 1946, and the first president was mayor Stefan Zawieja. The club had following sections: [[Association football|football]], [[table tennis]], [[tennis]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[boxing]], and [[chess]]. Then more sections were created: [[Motorcycle speedway|speedway]], [[ice hockey]] and [[Olympic wrestling|wrestling]].\n\nThe first two decades after the war commenced with a rivalry with its neighbour&nbsp;\u2013 \"KS Kolejarz\", even taking the form of outright conflict between activists and players of both clubs, especially when \"KS Kolejarz\" did not agree to return Astra swimmers back to Astra. Meanwhile, a characteristic phenomenon had become prominent, the branding of sport through creating a union of sports associations. Therefore, Astra, which was previously an urban club, passed several membership changes, coupled with several name changes. They were: Robotniczy Klub Sportowy Orkan (1948), Gwardia (1949\u201353), Sp\u00f3jnia (1954\u201355), Sparta (1955\u201363). Belonging to a particular association carried financial guarantees, but the changes have led to changes in the boards, activists and athletes too.\n\nOnly in 1963 the conflict was revolved with Kolejarz, creating a united sport club. Finally, in 1970, the club returned to his first name&nbsp;\u2013 Astra. Henceforth it acted as an inter-union sports club, but the support and state of the unions was heavily varied. Therefore, gradually subsequent sections of the club had suspended operations.\n\n===Golden Era===\n\nThe swimming section which existed until 1975, produced successful athletes: Urszula Janas\u00f3wna, Bogdan Olszewski, Wladyslaw Kru\u015blak, Czeslaw Robinski, Maciej Sroczynski, Czeslaw P\u0142\u00f3ciennik, Edward Tomczak, John Malecki. They were country and association record holders. The Olympian Ryszard \u017bugaj began his career at Astra.\n\nTop places in the interprovincial league were achieved by the volleyball players, basketball players and boxers. In recent years Victus Astra table tennis players reached the second division, and were recently transferred to KS Krotosz. In the last decade the football team played in the [[II liga (Poland)|third tier]] between 1996 and 2002, which was made possible by the substantial support of the Mechanical Equipment Factory and several other local entrepreneurs. The team consisted of many famous players: Adam Grad, Thomas Szajkowski, Arkadiusz \u017baglewski, Peter Kasprzyk and Remi Wojtczak, a few joined the ranks of other higher league clubs: Dariusz Reyer, Christopher Go\u015bciniak, Richard Tomczak. The team travelled all over the country.\n\n===Decline and recent events===\n\nDue to the continuing poor financial situation, since 1982, only three sections of the club operated: football, volleyball and table tennis, and since 2001 the two: football and volleyball. The difficult financial situation resulted in the football team's relegation to the [[IV liga (Poland)|fourth league]], in which Astra languished, despite chances of promotion, but in a decisive play-off match [[Mieszko Gniezno]] proved to be better. More recently the club suffered yet another relegation.\n\nThe club's 80th anniversary, due to financial problems, will be celebrated rather modestly. 6 youth teams currently compete in the top of their leagues. The [[volleyball]] section is currently being re-activated, and the football team is hoping to re-build and gain promotion.\n\n==Fans==\nAstra have a small but loyal fan-base, including an [[ultras]] group. Many Astra fans also sympathise with the regional powerhouse [[Lech Pozna\u0144]]. Their biggest rivals are considered to be [[KKS Kalisz]], whereas the fans maintain friendly relations with fans of Kania Gosty\u0144 and LKS Czarnylas, and until January 2016, maintained friendly relations with [[Jarota Jarocin]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://astrakrotoszyn1929.futbolowo.pl Official club website]\n*[http://www.90minut.pl/skarb.php?id_sezon=59&id_klub=8 90minut.pl profile]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/KksAstraKrotoszynFanatyczniFani Fans Facebook page]\n*[https://twitter.com/AstraKrotoszyn Twitter page]\n*[http://www.pzpn.pl/klub/show/1166 Polish FA profile]\n\n[[Category:Football clubs in Poland]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1929]]\n[[Category:1929 establishments in Poland]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Greater Poland Voivodeship]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs in Poland]]\n[[Category:Volleyball clubs established in 1929]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{no footnotes|date=November 2014}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2014}}\n}}\n{{Infobox football club\n| clubname    = Astra Krotoszyn\n| image       = \n| fullname    = Krotoszy\u0144ski Klub Sportowy Astra Krotoszyn\n| nickname    = Asterka\n| founded     = 1929\n| ground      = Municipal Stadium, [[Krotoszyn]]\n| capacity    = 5000\n| chairman    = Mieczys\u0142aw Dylak\n| manager     = Patryk Halaburda\n| league      = Klasa Okr\u0119gowa, [[Kalisz]] group I ''(VI)''\n| season      = 2014/15\n| position    = \n| current     = \n| pattern_la1 =\n| pattern_b1  = \n| pattern_so1 = \n| leftarm1    = 0000FF\n| body1       = 0000FF\n| rightarm1   = 0000FF\n| shorts1     = 0000FF\n| socks1      = 000000\n| pattern_la2 = \n| pattern_ra2 = \n| pattern_b2  = \n| pattern_sh2 = \n| pattern_so2 = \n| leftarm2    = FF0000\n| body2       = FF0000\n| rightarm2   = FF0000\n| shorts2     = FF0000\n| socks2      = 000000\n| website     = http://astrakrotoszyn1929.futbolowo.pl\n}}\n\n'''KKS Astra Krotoszyn''' is a [[Poland|Polish]] sports club from [[Krotoszyn]], [[Greater Poland]].

It is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands of [[New Zealand]], ranging across the main islands as well as several of the [[New Zealand outlying islands|outlying islands]]. It has several other [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and [[English language|English]] names. There are several [[subspecies]] showing considerable variation in [[plumage]] and size. The species is not threatened and has adapted to the changes made to New Zealand's [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''tomtit'' was originally a shortened form of ''tom titmouse''.<ref>[https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/ask-an-expert/previous/tomtit.aspx Royal Society For The Protection of Birds: ''What kind of bird is known as a 'tom tit'?'']</ref> Either form has been used to describe a number of small birds, but in England ''tomtit'' was most commonly used as an alternate name of the [[blue tit]]. The word [[Tit (bird)|tit]] is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family Paridae. Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tit ''Tit''. Etymology Online]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\nThe tomtit is one of four species of the [[genus]] ''[[Petroica]]'' found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which colonised from [[Australia]]. The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event, and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M.

It has several other [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] and [[English language|English]] names. There are several [[subspecies]] showing considerable variation in [[plumage]] and size. The species is not threatened and has adapted to the changes made to New Zealand's [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''tomtit'' was originally a shortened form of ''tom titmouse''.<ref>[https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/ask-an-expert/previous/tomtit.aspx Royal Society For The Protection of Birds: ''What kind of bird is known as a 'tom tit'?'']</ref> Either form has been used to describe a number of small birds, but in England ''tomtit'' was most commonly used as an alternate name of the [[blue tit]]. The word [[Tit (bird)|tit]] is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family Paridae. Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tit ''Tit''. Etymology Online]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\nThe tomtit is one of four species of the [[genus]] ''[[Petroica]]'' found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which colonised from [[Australia]]. The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event, and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M.

Mason, the founder of Mason & Co. boot blacking.<ref name=\":9\" /> Augustus Post countersued his wife seeking an annulment on the same grounds as her second husband, arguing Emma's divorce from her first husband had not been legitimate and thus she had never been in a position to remarry. The court denied his petition and granted Emma Post alimony of $250 per month, the modern day equivalent of roughly $6,800.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wants Divorce and $500 Month Alimony|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5074372/emma_post_seeks_alimony_conflates/|newspaper=The Tennesseean=June 18, 1907|page=1|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=June 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201033352/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5074372/emma_post_seeks_alimony_conflates/#|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}} {{free access}}</ref> She did not file suit against his sister. [[File:Frederic allen williams.jpg|thumb|Frederic Allen Williams]]\nThe case of ''Post v. Post''<ref name=\":11\" /> returned to the headlines periodically over a four-year period between 1907 and 1911. Augustus Post petitioned the court to have his alimony reduced, indicating that he was ill and had lost his fortune in the stock market panic of 1907. His primary employer, E. D. Shepherd Banking, went into bankruptcy that year, but Post continued his work in Alexander Graham Bell's Aerial Experiment Association and then worked with Glenn Curtiss building and testing aircraft. By 1912 Emma and Augustus Post had formally separated and Emma Post had moved to Virginia.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mrs. Post Welcomes Soldiers|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5089169/emma_post_and_rifle_range_in_norfolk/|newspaper=The Washington Post =May 5, 1912|page=12|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=June 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108025919/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5089169/emma_post_and_rifle_range_in_norfolk/#|archive-date=2018-11-08|url-status=live}} {{free access}}</ref>\n\nIn 1935, Post moved in with the well-known sculptor and photographer [[Frederic Allen Williams]]. Post and Williams hosted parties at their apartment, travelled together, and participated in one another's creative endeavors. It is not clear that the partnership was a sexual one, but it was Post's closest and longest-lasting relationship. The pair remained together until Post's death.<ref name=\":12\">{{cite news|title=Reception Held at Studio of Augustus Post and Frederic Allen Williams for Women's International Association of Aeronautics|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4872068/the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/|newspaper=Brooklyn Daily Eagle =January 26, 1936|page=26|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=June 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181108031212/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4872068/the_brooklyn_daily_eagle/#|archive-date=2018-11-08|url-status=live}} {{free access}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nPost died of a heart attack on October 5, 1952 and was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/93867478|title=Find a Grave - Augustus T.
