Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.

''As described by ''Chicago,'' \"manuscript editing encompasses any or all of the tasks along a continuum from simple mechanical corrections (mechanical editing) through sentence-level interventions (line, or stylistic, editing) to substantial remedial work on literary style and clarity, disorganized passages, baggy prose, muddled tables and figures, and the like (substantive editing). Several professional associations of editors further describe this continuum of manuscript editing in terms of levels of editing and characterize the degrees of intervention as light, medium, and heavy copy editing.\"\n\nIn the world beyond traditional book and journal publishing, the term copy editing is sometimes applied to an even more expansive range of tasks, or the work is incorrectly referred to as proofreading by authors despite their lofty expectations of the services to be provided. Besides performing the conventional copy editing duties, an editor in these nontraditional publishing environments may be expected to assess the suitability of a manuscript for publication (usually the role of an acquisitions editor or literary agent); to midwife content, evaluate and reshape a manuscript, or overhaul organization and literary style (the work of a development or substantive editor).\n\nAlthough copy editors are generally expected to make simple revisions to smooth awkward passages, they do not have a license to rewrite a text line by line, nor do they prepare material on an author's behalf. Creating original content to be published under another person's name is called ''ghostwriting''. Furthermore, copy editors are expected to query structural and organizational problems, but they are not expected to fix these problems. Helping an author develop an idea into a publishable manuscript, overhauling a rough draft, identifying gaps in subject coverage, devising strategies for more effective communication of content, and creating features to enhance the final product and make it more competitive in the marketplace\u2014these tasks describe ''developmental editing''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Einsohn |first1=Amy |last2=Schwartz |first2=Marilyn |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook |date=2019 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, California |isbn=978-0-520-28672-6 |pages=5-14 |edition=4 |accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, an editor who does this work is called a ''copy editor''. An organization's highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the ''copy chief'', ''copy desk chief'', or ''news editor''. In book publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world that follow British [[nomenclature]], the term ''copy editor'' is used, but in newspaper and magazine publishing, the term is '''''subeditor''''' (or '''''sub-editor'''''), commonly shortened to ''sub''. The senior subeditor of a publication is often called the ''chief subeditor''. As the prefix ''sub'' suggests, copy editors typically have less authority than regular [[Editing|editors]].<ref>Lozano, George A. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2401 Ethics of Using Language Editing Services in an Era of Digital Communication and Heavily Multi-Authored Papers]. Retrieved 24 July 2014.</ref>\n\nIn the context of the Internet, online copy refers to the textual content of [[web page]]s. Similar to print, online copy editing is the process of revising and preparing the raw or draft text of web pages for publication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparkleweb.org/copy-editing-ux|title=Copy Editing Services in Chennai.|website=www.sparkleweb.org|access-date=2016-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528190011/http://www.sparkleweb.org/copy-editing-ux|archive-date=2016-05-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCopy editing has three levels: light, medium, and heavy. Depending on the budget and scheduling of the publication, the publisher will let the copy editor know what level of editing to employ. The chosen type of editing will help the copy editor prioritize their efforts.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|12}}\n\nWithin copy editing, there is mechanical editing and substantive editing: mechanical editing is the process of aligning a document with editorial or house style, keeping the preferred style and grammar rules of publication consistent across all content. It refers to editing in terms of spelling, punctuation, and correct usage of grammatical symbols, along with reviewing special elements such as tables, charts, formatting footnotes, and endnotes. [[Content editing]], also known as substantive editing, is the editing of the material, including its structure and organization, to ensure [[internal consistency]]. Content editing may require heavy editing or rewriting as compared to mechanical editing.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|5\u201310}}\n\nIn addition, copy editing may change punctuation, spelling, and usage for a different country. For a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] readership, the Oxford British and American spelling of \"organize\" may be changed to \"organise\", and \"color\" changed to \"colour\".\n\n== Practices ==\n=== Mechanical editing ===\nMechanical editing is the process of proofreading a piece of writing for consistency, either internally or in accordance with the publisher's house style. According to Einsohn, mechanical editors work with such things as the following:<ref>{{cite book |last=Einsohn |first=Amy |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, with Exercises and Answer Keys |year=2011 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-27156-2 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hbMwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false | quote= The heart of copyediting consists of making a manuscript conform to an ''editorial style'' (also called ''house style''). Editorial style includes: <br/> spelling <br/> hyphenation <br/> capitalization <br/> punctuation <br/> treatment of numbers and numerals <br/>treatment of quotations <br/> use of abbreviations and acronyms <br/> use of italics and bold type <br/> treatment of special elements (headings, lists, tables, charts, and graphs) <br/> format of footnotes or endnotes and other documentation. }}</ref>\n* Abbreviations and acronyms\n* Additional elements, such as charts, tables, and graphs\n* Capitalization\n* Footnotes and endnotes\n* Hyphenation\n* Italicization and boldfaced type\n* Numbers and numerals\n* Punctuation\n* Quotations\n* Spelling\n\nGilad also mentions the following:<ref>{{cite book |last=Gilad |first=Suzanne |title=Copyediting & Proofreading for Dummies |year=2007 |page=50 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-470-12171-9}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=April 2016}}\n* Initialisms\n* Page numbers, headers, and footers\n* Underscoring\n\nProper spelling and punctuation are subjective in some cases, where they must be left to the discretion of the copyeditor or the publisher. Most publishing firms use a widely recognized style guide such as ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' or ''The Associated Press Stylebook''. Companies that produce documents and reports but do not consider themselves publishers in the usual sense tend to rely on in-house style guides or on the judgment of the copyeditor.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|5}}\n\n=== Grammar and usage ===\nThe goal of the copy editor is to enforce inviolable rules while respecting personal stylistic preferences. This can be difficult, as some writers view grammatical corrections as a challenge to their intellectual ability or professional identity. Therefore copy editors are encouraged to respect the author's preference if it is acceptable. This practice is complicated further by volatile language conventions as recorded by books on grammar and usage, the authors of which often disagree.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|333\u2013337}}\n\n=== Content editing ===\nContent editing consists of reorganizing or restructuring a document. This involves any inconsistent parts of the content as well as any variances. Copy editors can either fix the content by rewriting it or heavily editing it. However, the copy editor will often point out any difficult passages for the author to resolve on his or her own time.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|9}}\n\nAlthough copy editors are not responsible for factual correctness of the document, they can provide comments for the author on any information that they know to be untrue,<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|9}} such as year discrepancies or misleading ideas. Such fact-checking is acceptable for copy editors who know the document's subject matter.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\nThe copy editor must also point out any biased language without infringing on the author's meaning. This includes material \"that might form the basis for a lawsuit alleging libel, invasion of privacy, or obscenity\". Some see censoring biased language as [[political correctness]], so it is important that the copy editor distinguishes between the two.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}} To do this, the copy editor will permit intentional \"politically incorrect\" views and censor only marginalized, offensive, or exclusive language.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|405}}\n\n=== Correlating parts, typecoding, and permissions ===\nMost [[manuscript]]s will require the copyeditor to correlate the parts within it. Copyeditors must carry out the following tasks in this process:<ref name=\"einsohn2011\">{{cite book |last=Einsohn |first=Amy |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, with Exercises and Answer Keys |year=2011 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-27156-2}}</ref>{{rp|7}}\n* Verify any [[cross-reference]]s that appear in the text\n* Check the numbering of footnotes, endnotes, tables, and illustrations\n* Specify the placement of tables and illustrations\n* Check the content of the illustrations against the captions and the text\n* Read the list of illustrations against the illustrations and captions\n* Read the [[table of contents]] against the manuscript\n* Read the footnotes/endnotes and in-text citations against the [[bibliography]]\n* Check the alphabetization of the bibliography or reference list\n \nSome manuscripts may require special cross-checking. For example, in a how-to text, a copyeditor might need to verify that the list of equipment or parts matches the instructions given within the text.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7}}\n \nTypecoding is the process of identifying which sections of the manuscript are not regular running text. These portions of text, known as elements, include the following:<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|10}}\n* Part and chapter numbers\n* Titles and subtitles\n* Headings and subheadings\n* Lists\n* Extracts\n* Displayed equations\n* Table numbers\n* Source lines\n* Footnotes\n* Figure numbers and captions\n\nIt is the copyeditor's job to typecode (or make note of) all manuscript elements for the publication designer.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160508130210/http://www.cyranoworks.com/documents/Editinglevels.pdf Cyranoworks.com]</ref> Hard copy copyeditors are usually asked to pencil in the typecodes in the left margin of the manuscript. On-screen copyeditors may be asked to insert typecodes at the beginning and end of each element.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nFinally, if the manuscript contains long quotations from a published work that is still under [[copyright]], the copyeditor should remind the author to acquire permission to [[reprint]] said quotations. The same goes for the reprinting of tables, charts, graphs, and illustrations that have appeared in print. Rules vary for the reproduction of unpublished materials (letters, diaries, etc.)<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|10}}\n\n== Processes ==\nThere are basic procedures that every copyeditor must follow: copyeditors need a system for marking changes to the author's text (marking), a process for querying the author and the editorial coordinator ([[question|querying]]), a method for keeping track of editorial decisions (recordkeeping), and procedures for incorporating the author's review of the copyediting into a final document (cleanup). These systems were originally developed in an era before that of the computer, but over time these procedures were adapted for a digital on-screen space.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\nEach medium (in print and on screen) has its own affordances, and although a copyeditor may prefer one editing process over the other, copyeditors are practically required to use both techniques.\n\n=== Hard-copy editing ===\nTraditional markup copy editing, or hard-copy editing, is still important because screening tests for employment may be administered in hard copy. Also, the author whose text the copy editor is editing may prefer hard-copy markup, and copy editors need to know traditional markup in case documents and materials cannot be exchanged electronically. When editing in hard-copy, all participating parties (the editor, author, typesetter, and proofreader) must understand the marks the copy editor makes, and therefore a universal marking system that signifies these changes exists. This is also why the copy editor should write legibly and neatly. Copy editors working hard-copy write their corrections in the text directly, leaving the margins for querying. Usually, the copy editor is asked to write in a bright color, so the author and other parties can easily recognize the editor's changes.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\n=== On-screen editing ===\nEvery year, more editing projects are being done on computers and fewer in print. Also, if there is a digital version of a text the copyeditor is editing, they can more easily search words, run spellcheckers, and generate clean copies of messy pages. The first thing copyeditors must do when editing on-screen is to copy the author's files, as the original document must be preserved.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}} Each word processing program provides various options for how an editor's markups are shown on screen and on the printout. On-screen editing mainly differs from hard-copy editing in the fact that the copyeditor should edit more cleanly on-screen, refraining from saving parts of words, and be careful in maintaining proper line spacing.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\n=== Querying ===\nCopyeditors often need to query their authors in order to address questions, comments, or explanations: most of these can be done in the margins of the text, or the comment section when on-screen.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}} The copyeditor must consider when to query and the length and tone of their queries, as querying too often or seldom, cryptically, or sarcastically can result in a negative relationship between the copyeditor and the author.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\n== Goals ==\nA copyeditor's goals may change depending on the publication for which they work; however, there are a few constituencies which must always be served \u2013 the author (the person who wrote or compiled the manuscript), the publisher (the person or company which pays for production), and the readers (the audience for whom the material is being produced). These parties (together with the copyeditor) work to achieve the same goal, which is to produce an error-free publication. The copyeditor strives to improve clarity, coherence, consistency, and correctness \u2013 otherwise known as the \"4 C's\", each of which serves the copyeditor's \"Cardinal C\", which is communication.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|3}}\n\n== History ==\nThe advent of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century opened the doors to the first printing houses in Europe. Even after the invention of the printing press and on to today, the editor's job is to correct perceived mistakes. Within these printing houses, there were a variety of employees, one type being correctors, or, as they are referred to today, editors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe biggest difference between monastic copyists and copyeditors is that copyeditors leave edits as suggestions that can be rejected by the writer. These printing houses established procedures for editing, preparing the text, and proofreading. Specialist correctors ensured that texts followed the standards of the time.<ref>Hellinga, Lotte (2009). ''The Gutenberg Revolutions A Companion to the History of the Book'', p. 211.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|9781405192781}}.</ref>\n\nBefore the printing press, monastic copyists altered words or phrases they thought were odd, under the assumption that the copyist before them had made a mistake. This is what led to so much variety in standard texts like the Bible.\n\nAfter the globalization of the [[book]] from 1800 to 1970 came the rise of American writers and editors. One editor in particular, Maxwell Perkins, was sought out by writers such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Wolfe because he greatly improved the work of these prominent authors with his editorial eye. Perkins was known for editing, guiding, and befriending his writers \u2013 but the times were changing.<ref name=\"Luey, Beth 2009 p. 369\">Luey, Beth (2009). ''Modernity and Print III: The United States 1890-1970 A Companion to the History of the Book'', p. 369.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|9781405192781}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the role of an editor was to decide if a manuscript was good enough to be published. As time passed, the role of an editor and [[publisher]] became more distant. Although there was a newfound relationship between editors and authors, thoughtful editing did not end.<ref name=\"Luey, Beth 2009 p. 369\"/>\n\nCopyeditors were employed at various publishing houses, magazines, journals, and by private authors seeking revisions to their work. Some copyeditors were even employed by [[public relations]] and [[advertising]] firms who valued strong editing practices in their business.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrigan|first1=Jane R.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Karen Brown|title=The Editorial Eye|date=2003|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|isbn=9780312152703|page=387|edition= Second}}</ref>\n\nThe symbols used by copyeditors today are based on those that have been used by proofreaders since the beginnings of publishing, though they have undergone some changes over time. However, the exact beginnings of the copyediting language used today are unclear. Despite its long history, copyediting as a practice has not experienced any extreme upheaval other than the desktop publishing revolution of the 1980s. This phenomenon began as the result of a series of inventions that were released during the middle of this decade, and refers to the growth of technology usage in the field of copyediting.<ref name=\"History Design.\">{{cite web |url=http://www.designtalkboard.com/design-articles/desktoppublishing.php  |title=History of Desktop Publishing |publisher=DesignTalk |access-date= March 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Book Publishing.\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.bookediting.ca/timeline.html |title=Book Editing Looks at Developments in the History of Book Printing and Publishing |publisher=The Authors Guild |access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> Namely, the development of the [[Macintosh]] computer, the desktop laser printer by Hewlett-Packard, and software for desktop publishing called [[PageMaker]] allowed the revolution to begin.<ref name=\"History Design.\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401200365.html |title=Desktop Publishing |author= Allen Renear |publisher= The Gale Group Inc. |year=2002 |access-date= March 19, 2016}}</ref> By allowing both individuals and publishing agencies alike to cheaply and effectively begin to edit compositions entirely on-screen rather than by hand, desktop publishing revolution morphed copyediting into the practice it is today. Most copyeditors today rely on more modern [[WYSIWYG]] (what you see is what you get) text processors such as Microsoft Word that are based on the original PageMaker to do their work.\n\nThere were a few events that led to changes within copyediting as a career. One of these, the successful strike of the editorial department of the ''Newark Ledger'' from November 17, 1934, to March 28, 1935, was \"the first major action of its kind by any local guild...[it] both confirmed the irreversibility of the guilds' movement away from the professional association idea and greatly accelerated that process\".<ref name=\"Toward Unionization: The American Newspaper Guild and the Newark Ledger Strike of 1934\u201335.\">{{cite journal |title=Toward Unionization: The American Newspaper Guild and the Newark Ledger Strike of 1934-35 |journal = Labor History|volume = 11|pages = 3\u201322|author=Daniel J.

At the conclusion of the second Macaulay strike, which occurred three months after the first, the nationwide drive towards unionization had entered the publishing industry and was \"sweeping through all the major publishing houses\".<ref name=\"Women Writers in the United States: A Timeline of Literary, Cultural, and Social History\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yqi0x7BEvCoC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=macaulay+newspaper+strike+1934#v=onepage&q=macaulay%20newspaper%20strike%201934&f=false |title=Women Writers in the United States: A Timeline of Literary, Cultural, and Social History |author=Cynthia J.

For instance, beginning in 1990, copyeditors learned pagination electronically.<ref name=\"digital age\">{{cite thesis |last=Avery-Ahlijian|first=Angela Anne. |date=2011|title=Copy Editing in the Digital Age: How Technology Has Changed Copy Editing |publisher=Eastern Michigan University |url=http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&context=honors}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} They could now look at different pages of a text on multiple screens and easily edit on there, as opposed to pasting them by hand onto a board. This technological advance also required that copyeditors learn new software such as Pagemaker, [[Quark Xpress]], and now [[Adobe InDesign]].\n\nModern copyeditors are often required to edit for digital as well as print versions of the text. Digital copyediting requires copyeditors to understand [[RSS feed]]s, [[social media]] such as Twitter and Facebook, and [[Hyper Text Markup Language]].<ref name=\"digital age\" />{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} What should be accounted for is that in this digital age, information is constantly being released, which leads to the decline in the editing of the online versions.

Hank Glamann, the co-founder of the [[American Copy Editors Society]], made the following observation about ads for copy editor positions at American newspapers:\n<blockquote>We want them to be skilled grammarians and wordsmiths and write bright and engaging headlines and must know Quark. But, often, when push comes to shove, we will let every single one of those requirements slide except the last one because you have to know that in order to push the button at the appointed time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=3836 |title=Workshop: Keeping your copy editors happy |accessdate=2 January 2009 |date=7 August 2002 |publisher=The American Society of Newspaper Editors |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207193451/http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=3836 |archivedate=7 February 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Traits, skills, and training==\nBesides an outstanding command of the language, copy-editors need broad general knowledge for spotting factual errors; good critical thinking skills in order to recognize inconsistencies or vagueness; interpersonal skills for dealing with writers, other editors and designers; attention to detail; and a sense of style. They must also set priorities and balance a desire for perfection with the need to meet deadlines.\n\nMany copy editors have a college degree, often in journalism, communications, or the language of the writing that they edit. In the United States, copy editing is often taught as a college journalism course, though its name varies. The courses often include news design and [[pagination]].\n\nIn the United States, The Dow Jones Newspaper Fund sponsors internships that include two weeks of training. Also, the American Press Institute, the [[Poynter Institute]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], UC San Diego Extension and conferences of the American Copy Editors Society offer mid-career training for newspaper copy editors and news editors (news copy desk supervisors).\n\nMost US newspapers and publishers give copy-editing job candidates an editing test or a tryout. These vary widely and can include general items such as acronyms, current events, math, punctuation, and skills such as the use of [[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]], headline writing, infographics editing, and [[journalism ethics]].\n\nIn both the US and the UK, there are no official bodies offering a single recognized qualification.\n\nIn the UK, there is a range of courses that are unofficially recognized within the industry. Training may be on the job or through publishing courses, privately run seminars, or correspondence courses of the Society for Editors<ref name=\"SfEP\">{{cite web|title=society for editors and proofreaders|url=https://www.sfep.org.uk/training/choose-a-course/|website=Society for Editors and Proofreaders|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}</ref> and Proofreaders. The [[National Council for the Training of Journalists]] also has a qualification for subeditors.\n\n== Contemporary ==\nBefore the digital era, copy-editors would mark errors and inconsistencies with a red pen, using a markup language of symbols which were universally known by copy-editors. The traditional copy editor was once defined as editing for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of style.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.editors.ca/hire/definitions.html |title=Definitions of editorial skills |accessdate=5 April 2016|publisher=Editors' Association of Canada }}</ref>\n\nCopy-editing symbols can not be used in digital editing because they are not supported on digital platforms such as track changes.

Copy editors are still employed and needed for heavy editings, such as fact-checking and content organization, which is beyond the abilities of the software. With [[grammar checker|grammar software]] and journalists who can edit, copy editors are seen as a luxury in publishing.<ref name=\"American Journalism Review\"/> The potential for a company to use editing software may also require the copy editor to only perform heavy editing and querying. Though the steps for copyediting are the same, the execution has been adapted for digital environments.\n\nThe technological development of [[cloud storage]] allows contemporary copy editors and writers to upload and share files across multiple devices.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coolheadtech.com/blog/four-differences-between-google-drive-and-dropbox | title=Four Differences Between Google Drive and Dropbox |accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 23 October 2013 |publisher=Coolhead Tech }}</ref> Online word processors such as Google Docs, Dropbox, Zoho, OpenGoo and Buzzword allow users to perform a number of tasks.

Teresa Schmedding, president of the American Copy Editors Society (ACES) and a deputy managing editor at the ''Daily Herald'' in Chicago, thinks that copyeditors are \"a natural fit\" for digital journalism and social media because, though publishing has been made available to almost anyone, quality and credibility is brought to content only by copy editors.<ref name=\"Track changes while you edit\"/> \n\nCopy editors must now consider multimedia aspects of the story, such as video, images, audio, and search engine optimization, which may be included in digital publications.<ref name=\"Track changes while you edit\"/>  Digital editing now requires copy editors to understand [[search engine optimization|SEO]], HTML, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], and [[RSS]] feeds<ref name=\"Track changes while you edit\"/>, as well as [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[Adobe Dreamweaver]].\n\n=== Issues ===\nOne of the problems with copy-editing is that it may slow the publication of the text. With the digital publishing era came an increased demand for a fast turnover of information. Additional details such as color printing, page size, and layout are determined by the allotted budget.<ref name=\":0\" /> Web-based publications, such as BuzzFeed and ''Slate'', do not have enough room in their budgets to keep sufficient staff to edit their massive, daily rushes of content. Therefore copy chief Emmy Favila says lower-priority posts are published without copyedits at Buzzfeed.<ref name=\"ajr.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://ajr.org/2014/05/13/copy-editors-digital-media/ |title= Copy Editors Carve Niche in Digital Media Landscape |accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 13 May 2014|publisher=American Journalism Review }}</ref> ''Slate'' does not edit its blog posts before publication, but all of its news articles are copy edited before publication, say ''Slate'' copy chief Lowen Liu and deputy editor Julia Turner.<ref name=\"ajr.org\" />\n\nIn response to such high demands for fast-produced content, some online publications have started publishing articles first and then editing later, a process known as back-editing. Editors prioritize stories to edit based on traffic and whether the content was originally reported for needing edits.\n\nReading material has become increasingly accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. Carolyn Rude exemplifies such cases in alternatively replacing illustrations with text and audio translations for the visually impaired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Technical editing|last1=Rude|first1=Carolyn D.|date=2006|publisher=Longman|last2=Dayton|first2=David|last3=Maylath|first3= Bruce|isbn=032133082X|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=60188071}}</ref> Rude also suggests that web developers attempt to stick to print guidelines, such as \"clear and simple language and consistent terms and navigation devices\", especially when readers are looking at text in a second language.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Effects of the Internet==\n\nAs online resources rise in popularity, copy editors endeavor to meet the increase of digital consumerism to the best of their abilities, and such high competition has resulted in a gradually \"declining of quality in editing\", such as proofreading or fact-checking.<ref name=\"digital age\" /> However, this doesn't mean that the Internet has limited the scope of a copy editor's responsibilities or job opportunities. One of the most important advancements of the digital age is the advent of pagination, which gives copy editors more control over the construction and revisions of their content. Pagination is a convenient feature in programs such as \"Pagemaker, the Quark Xpress, and AdobeIndesign\".<ref name=\"digital age\" /> Despite the increasing number of programs, however, some copy editors believe their basic functions and duties haven't changed much. Other copy editors think that the Internet has simplified fact-checking and that websites such as Facebook or Twitter have aided information-gathering. Other digital skills, such as image selection and search engine optimization, increase the visibility of search results, especially when searching for keywords in headlines.\n\nIn all likelihood, the Internet will continue to evolve, but this shouldn't hamper the overall importance of copy editing. Although it may be tempting to neglect proper revisions in favor of convenience, the credibility and quality of an editor's work should still be maintained, as there will always be updates in software and technology.<ref name=\"digital age\" /> As formats evolve, so too will the opportunities for journalists and other writers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Author editing]]\n* [[American Copy Editors Society]]\n* ''[[AP Stylebook]]''\n* [[Headline]]\n* [[News design]]\n* [[Photo caption]]\n* [[Proofreading]]\n* [[Robinson Prize]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Anderson, Laura.

As described by ''Chicago'', manuscript editing encompasses any or all of the tasks along a continuum from simple mechanical corrections (''mechanical editing'') through sentence-level interventions (line, or stylistic, editing) to substantial remedial work on literary style and clarity, disorganized passages, baggy prose, muddled tables and figures, and the like (''substantive editing''). Several professional associations of editors further describe this continuum of manuscript editing in terms of ''levels of editing'' and characterize the degrees of intervention as light, medium, and heavy copy editing. \n\nIn the world beyond traditional book and journal publishing, the term copy editing is sometimes applied to an even more expansive range of tasks, or the work is incorrectly referred to as proofreading by authors despite their lofty expectations of the services to be provided. Besides performing the conventional copy editing duties, an editor in these nontraditional publishing environments may be expected to assess the suitability of a manuscript for publication (usually the role of an acquisitions editor or literary agent); to midwife content, evaluate and reshape a manuscript, or overhaul organization and literary style (the work of a development or substantive editor).\n\nAlthough copy editors are generally expected to make simple revisions to smooth awkward passages, they do not have a license to rewrite a text line by line, nor do they prepare material on an author's behalf. Creating original content to be published under another person's name is called ''ghostwriting''. Furthermore, copy editors are expected to query structural and organizational problems, but they are not expected to fix these problems. Helping an author develop an idea into a publishable manuscript, overhauling a rough draft, identifying gaps in subject coverage, devising strategies for more effective communication of content, and creating features to enhance the final product and make it more competitive in the marketplace\u2014these tasks describe ''developmental editing''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Einsohn |first1=Amy |last2=Schwartz |first2=Marilyn |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook |date=2019 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, California |isbn=978-0-520-28672-6 |pages=5-14 |edition=4 |accessdate=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, an editor who does this work is called a ''copy editor''. An organization's highest-ranking copy editor, or the supervising editor of a group of copy editors, may be known as the ''copy chief'', ''copy desk chief'', or ''news editor''. In book publishing in the United Kingdom and other parts of the world that follow British [[nomenclature]], the term ''copy editor'' is used, but in newspaper and magazine publishing, the term is '''''subeditor''''' (or '''''sub-editor'''''), commonly shortened to ''sub''. The senior subeditor of a publication is often called the ''chief subeditor''. As the prefix ''sub'' suggests, copy editors typically have less authority than regular [[Editing|editors]].<ref>Lozano, George A. [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2401 Ethics of Using Language Editing Services in an Era of Digital Communication and Heavily Multi-Authored Papers]. Retrieved 24 July 2014.</ref>\n\nIn the context of the Internet, online copy refers to the textual content of [[web page]]s. Similar to print, online copy editing is the process of revising and preparing the raw or draft text of web pages for publication.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparkleweb.org/copy-editing-ux|title=Copy Editing Services in Chennai.|website=www.sparkleweb.org|access-date=2016-05-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528190011/http://www.sparkleweb.org/copy-editing-ux|archive-date=2016-05-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nCopy editing has three levels: light, medium, and heavy. Depending on the budget and scheduling of the publication, the publisher will let the copy editor know what level of editing to employ. The chosen type of editing will help the copy editor prioritize their efforts.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|12}}\n\nWithin copy editing, there is mechanical editing and substantive editing: mechanical editing is the process of aligning a document with editorial or house style, keeping the preferred style and grammar rules of publication consistent across all content. It refers to editing in terms of spelling, punctuation, and correct usage of grammatical symbols, along with reviewing special elements such as tables, charts, formatting footnotes, and endnotes. [[Content editing]], also known as substantive editing, is the editing of the material, including its structure and organization, to ensure [[internal consistency]]. Content editing may require heavy editing or rewriting as compared to mechanical editing.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|5\u201310}}\n\nIn addition, copy editing may change punctuation, spelling, and usage for a different country. For a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] readership, the Oxford British and American spelling of \"organize\" may be changed to \"organise\", and \"color\" changed to \"colour\".\n\n== Practices ==\n=== Mechanical editing ===\nMechanical editing is the process of proofreading a piece of writing for consistency, either internally or in accordance with the publisher's house style. According to Einsohn, mechanical editors work with such things as the following:<ref>{{cite book |last=Einsohn |first=Amy |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, with Exercises and Answer Keys |year=2011 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-27156-2 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=hbMwDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5#v=onepage&q&f=false | quote= The heart of copyediting consists of making a manuscript conform to an ''editorial style'' (also called ''house style''). Editorial style includes: <br/> spelling <br/> hyphenation <br/> capitalization <br/> punctuation <br/> treatment of numbers and numerals <br/>treatment of quotations <br/> use of abbreviations and acronyms <br/> use of italics and bold type <br/> treatment of special elements (headings, lists, tables, charts, and graphs) <br/> format of footnotes or endnotes and other documentation. }}</ref>\n* Abbreviations and acronyms\n* Additional elements, such as charts, tables, and graphs\n* Capitalization\n* Footnotes and endnotes\n* Hyphenation\n* Italicization and boldfaced type\n* Numbers and numerals\n* Punctuation\n* Quotations\n* Spelling\n\nGilad also mentions the following:<ref>{{cite book |last=Gilad |first=Suzanne |title=Copyediting & Proofreading for Dummies |year=2007 |page=50 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-470-12171-9}}</ref>{{Request quotation|date=April 2016}}\n* Initialisms\n* Page numbers, headers, and footers\n* Underscoring\n\nProper spelling and punctuation are subjective in some cases, where they must be left to the discretion of the copyeditor or the publisher. Most publishing firms use a widely recognized style guide such as ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' or ''The Associated Press Stylebook''. Companies that produce documents and reports but do not consider themselves publishers in the usual sense tend to rely on in-house style guides or on the judgment of the copyeditor.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|5}}\n\n=== Grammar and usage ===\nThe goal of the copy editor is to enforce inviolable rules while respecting personal stylistic preferences. This can be difficult, as some writers view grammatical corrections as a challenge to their intellectual ability or professional identity. Therefore copy editors are encouraged to respect the author's preference if it is acceptable. This practice is complicated further by volatile language conventions as recorded by books on grammar and usage, the authors of which often disagree.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|333\u2013337}}\n\n=== Content editing ===\nContent editing consists of reorganizing or restructuring a document. This involves any inconsistent parts of the content as well as any variances. Copy editors can either fix the content by rewriting it or heavily editing it. However, the copy editor will often point out any difficult passages for the author to resolve on his or her own time.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|9}}\n\nAlthough copy editors are not responsible for factual correctness of the document, they can provide comments for the author on any information that they know to be untrue,<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|9}} such as year discrepancies or misleading ideas. Such fact-checking is acceptable for copy editors who know the document's subject matter.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\nThe copy editor must also point out any biased language without infringing on the author's meaning. This includes material \"that might form the basis for a lawsuit alleging libel, invasion of privacy, or obscenity\". Some see censoring biased language as [[political correctness]], so it is important that the copy editor distinguishes between the two.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}} To do this, the copy editor will permit intentional \"politically incorrect\" views and censor only marginalized, offensive, or exclusive language.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|405}}\n\n=== Correlating parts, typecoding, and permissions ===\nMost [[manuscript]]s will require the copyeditor to correlate the parts within it. Copyeditors must carry out the following tasks in this process:<ref name=\"einsohn2011\">{{cite book |last=Einsohn |first=Amy |title=The Copyeditor's Handbook: A Guide for Book Publishing and Corporate Communications, with Exercises and Answer Keys |year=2011 |publisher=University of California |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=978-0-520-27156-2}}</ref>{{rp|7}}\n* Verify any [[cross-reference]]s that appear in the text\n* Check the numbering of footnotes, endnotes, tables, and illustrations\n* Specify the placement of tables and illustrations\n* Check the content of the illustrations against the captions and the text\n* Read the list of illustrations against the illustrations and captions\n* Read the [[table of contents]] against the manuscript\n* Read the footnotes/endnotes and in-text citations against the [[bibliography]]\n* Check the alphabetization of the bibliography or reference list\n \nSome manuscripts may require special cross-checking. For example, in a how-to text, a copyeditor might need to verify that the list of equipment or parts matches the instructions given within the text.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7}}\n \nTypecoding is the process of identifying which sections of the manuscript are not regular running text. These portions of text, known as elements, include the following:<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|10}}\n* Part and chapter numbers\n* Titles and subtitles\n* Headings and subheadings\n* Lists\n* Extracts\n* Displayed equations\n* Table numbers\n* Source lines\n* Footnotes\n* Figure numbers and captions\n\nIt is the copyeditor's job to typecode (or make note of) all manuscript elements for the publication designer.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160508130210/http://www.cyranoworks.com/documents/Editinglevels.pdf Cyranoworks.com]</ref> Hard copy copyeditors are usually asked to pencil in the typecodes in the left margin of the manuscript. On-screen copyeditors may be asked to insert typecodes at the beginning and end of each element.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nFinally, if the manuscript contains long quotations from a published work that is still under [[copyright]], the copyeditor should remind the author to acquire permission to [[reprint]] said quotations. The same goes for the reprinting of tables, charts, graphs, and illustrations that have appeared in print. Rules vary for the reproduction of unpublished materials (letters, diaries, etc.)<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|10}}\n\n== Processes ==\nThere are basic procedures that every copyeditor must follow: copyeditors need a system for marking changes to the author's text (marking), a process for querying the author and the editorial coordinator ([[question|querying]]), a method for keeping track of editorial decisions (recordkeeping), and procedures for incorporating the author's review of the copyediting into a final document (cleanup). These systems were originally developed in an era before that of the computer, but over time these procedures were adapted for a digital on-screen space.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\nEach medium (in print and on screen) has its own affordances, and although a copyeditor may prefer one editing process over the other, copyeditors are practically required to use both techniques.\n\n=== Hard-copy editing ===\nTraditional markup copy editing, or hard-copy editing, is still important because screening tests for employment may be administered in hard copy. Also, the author whose text the copy editor is editing may prefer hard-copy markup, and copy editors need to know traditional markup in case documents and materials cannot be exchanged electronically. When editing in hard-copy, all participating parties (the editor, author, typesetter, and proofreader) must understand the marks the copy editor makes, and therefore a universal marking system that signifies these changes exists. This is also why the copy editor should write legibly and neatly. Copy editors working hard-copy write their corrections in the text directly, leaving the margins for querying. Usually, the copy editor is asked to write in a bright color, so the author and other parties can easily recognize the editor's changes.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\n=== On-screen editing ===\nEvery year, more editing projects are being done on computers and fewer in print. Also, if there is a digital version of a text the copyeditor is editing, they can more easily search words, run spellcheckers, and generate clean copies of messy pages. The first thing copyeditors must do when editing on-screen is to copy the author's files, as the original document must be preserved.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}} Each word processing program provides various options for how an editor's markups are shown on screen and on the printout. On-screen editing mainly differs from hard-copy editing in the fact that the copyeditor should edit more cleanly on-screen, refraining from saving parts of words, and be careful in maintaining proper line spacing.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\n=== Querying ===\nCopyeditors often need to query their authors in order to address questions, comments, or explanations: most of these can be done in the margins of the text, or the comment section when on-screen.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}} The copyeditor must consider when to query and the length and tone of their queries, as querying too often or seldom, cryptically, or sarcastically can result in a negative relationship between the copyeditor and the author.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|7\u201310}}\n\n== Goals ==\nA copyeditor's goals may change depending on the publication for which they work; however, there are a few constituencies which must always be served \u2013 the author (the person who wrote or compiled the manuscript), the publisher (the person or company which pays for production), and the readers (the audience for whom the material is being produced). These parties (together with the copyeditor) work to achieve the same goal, which is to produce an error-free publication. The copyeditor strives to improve clarity, coherence, consistency, and correctness \u2013 otherwise known as the \"4 C's\", each of which serves the copyeditor's \"Cardinal C\", which is communication.<ref name=\"einsohn2011\" />{{rp|3}}\n\n== History ==\nThe advent of the printing press in the middle of the 15th century opened the doors to the first printing houses in Europe. Even after the invention of the printing press and on to today, the editor's job is to correct perceived mistakes. Within these printing houses, there were a variety of employees, one type being correctors, or, as they are referred to today, editors.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe biggest difference between monastic copyists and copyeditors is that copyeditors leave edits as suggestions that can be rejected by the writer. These printing houses established procedures for editing, preparing the text, and proofreading. Specialist correctors ensured that texts followed the standards of the time.<ref>Hellinga, Lotte (2009). ''The Gutenberg Revolutions A Companion to the History of the Book'', p. 211.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|9781405192781}}.</ref>\n\nBefore the printing press, monastic copyists altered words or phrases they thought were odd, under the assumption that the copyist before them had made a mistake. This is what led to so much variety in standard texts like the Bible.\n\nAfter the globalization of the [[book]] from 1800 to 1970 came the rise of American writers and editors. One editor in particular, Maxwell Perkins, was sought out by writers such as Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and Wolfe because he greatly improved the work of these prominent authors with his editorial eye. Perkins was known for editing, guiding, and befriending his writers \u2013 but the times were changing.<ref name=\"Luey, Beth 2009 p. 369\">Luey, Beth (2009). ''Modernity and Print III: The United States 1890-1970 A Companion to the History of the Book'', p. 369.Wiley-Blackwell, Oxford. {{ISBN|9781405192781}}.</ref>\n\nIn the late 19th century, the role of an editor was to decide if a manuscript was good enough to be published. As time passed, the role of an editor and [[publisher]] became more distant. Although there was a newfound relationship between editors and authors, thoughtful editing did not end.<ref name=\"Luey, Beth 2009 p. 369\"/>\n\nCopyeditors were employed at various publishing houses, magazines, journals, and by private authors seeking revisions to their work. Some copyeditors were even employed by [[public relations]] and [[advertising]] firms who valued strong editing practices in their business.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harrigan|first1=Jane R.|last2=Dunlap|first2=Karen Brown|title=The Editorial Eye|date=2003|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|isbn=9780312152703|page=387|edition= Second}}</ref>\n\nThe symbols used by copyeditors today are based on those that have been used by proofreaders since the beginnings of publishing, though they have undergone some changes over time. However, the exact beginnings of the copyediting language used today are unclear. Despite its long history, copyediting as a practice has not experienced any extreme upheaval other than the desktop publishing revolution of the 1980s. This phenomenon began as the result of a series of inventions that were released during the middle of this decade, and refers to the growth of technology usage in the field of copyediting.<ref name=\"History Design.\">{{cite web |url=http://www.designtalkboard.com/design-articles/desktoppublishing.php  |title=History of Desktop Publishing |publisher=DesignTalk |access-date= March 19, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Book Publishing.\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.bookediting.ca/timeline.html |title=Book Editing Looks at Developments in the History of Book Printing and Publishing |publisher=The Authors Guild |access-date=March 19, 2016}}</ref> Namely, the development of the [[Macintosh]] computer, the desktop laser printer by Hewlett-Packard, and software for desktop publishing called [[PageMaker]] allowed the revolution to begin.<ref name=\"History Design.\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3401200365.html |title=Desktop Publishing |author= Allen Renear |publisher= The Gale Group Inc. |year=2002 |access-date= March 19, 2016}}</ref> By allowing both individuals and publishing agencies alike to cheaply and effectively begin to edit compositions entirely on-screen rather than by hand, desktop publishing revolution morphed copyediting into the practice it is today. Most copyeditors today rely on more modern [[WYSIWYG]] (what you see is what you get) text processors such as Microsoft Word that are based on the original PageMaker to do their work.\n\nThere were a few events that led to changes within copyediting as a career. One of these, the successful strike of the editorial department of the ''Newark Ledger'' from November 17, 1934, to March 28, 1935, was \"the first major action of its kind by any local guild...[it] both confirmed the irreversibility of the guilds' movement away from the professional association idea and greatly accelerated that process\".<ref name=\"Toward Unionization: The American Newspaper Guild and the Newark  Ledger Strike of 1934\u201335.\">{{cite journal |title=Toward Unionization: The American Newspaper Guild and the Newark Ledger Strike of 1934-35 |journal = Labor History|volume = 11|pages = 3\u201322|author=Daniel J.

At the conclusion of the second Macaulay strike, which occurred three months after the first, the nationwide drive towards unionization had entered the publishing industry and was \"sweeping through all the major publishing houses\".<ref name=\"Women Writers in the United States: A Timeline of Literary, Cultural, and Social History\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yqi0x7BEvCoC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=macaulay+newspaper+strike+1934#v=onepage&q=macaulay%20newspaper%20strike%201934&f=false |title=Women Writers in the United States: A Timeline of Literary, Cultural, and Social History |author=Cynthia J.

For instance, beginning in 1990, copyeditors learned pagination electronically.<ref name= \"digital age\">{{cite thesis |last=Avery-Ahlijian|first=Angela Anne. |date=2011|title=Copy Editing in the Digital Age: How Technology Has Changed Copy Editing |publisher=Eastern Michigan University |url=http://commons.emich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1252&context=honors}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} They could now look at different pages of a text on multiple screens and easily edit on there, as opposed to pasting them by hand onto a board. This technological advance also required that copyeditors learn new software such as Pagemaker, [[Quark Xpress]], and now [[Adobe InDesign]].\n\nModern copyeditors are often required to edit for digital as well as print versions of the text. Digital copyediting requires copyeditors to understand [[RSS feed]]s, [[social media]] such as Twitter and Facebook, and [[Hyper Text Markup Language]].<ref name=\"digital age\" />{{Page needed|date=April 2016}} What should be accounted for is that in this digital age, information is constantly being released, which leads to the decline in the editing of the online versions. Editors of the website BuzzFeed commented that sometimes they \"simply can't get every post before it's published\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ajr.org/2014/05/13/copy-editors-digital-media/ |title=Copy Editors Carve Niche in Digital Media Landscape |author= Dan Appenfeller |date= May 13, 2014}}</ref>\nWhile copyeditors still do traditional tasks such as checking for facts, grammar, style, and writing headlines, some of their duties have been pushed aside to make way for technology. Some copyeditors now have to design page layouts and some even edit video content. Copyeditors are now sometimes referred to as \"copy/layout editors\" or \"producers/designers\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.copydesk.org/blog/2013/06/01/editing-job-losses/ |title=A look at the numbers: Editing job losses in the newsroom |author=Fred Vultee |date=June 1, 2013 |access-date=April 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809022924/http://www.copydesk.org/blog/2013/06/01/editing-job-losses/ |archive-date=August 9, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Changes in the field ==\n[[File:Example of copyedited manuscript.jpg|thumb|Example of non-professional copy editing in progress: the document finally published as <ref>{{cite web |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4sm4b8w2 |title=\"Wikipedia, User-Generated Content, and the Future of Reference Sources\" in David A.

Technical knowledge is therefore sometimes considered as important as writing ability, though this is truer in journalism than it is in [[book publishing]]. Hank Glamann, the co-founder of the [[American Copy Editors Society]], made the following observation about ads for copy editor positions at American newspapers:\n<blockquote>We want them to be skilled grammarians and wordsmiths and write bright and engaging headlines and must know Quark. But, often, when push comes to shove, we will let every single one of those requirements slide except the last one because you have to know that in order to push the button at the appointed time.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=3836 |title=Workshop: Keeping your copy editors happy |accessdate=2 January 2009 |date=7 August 2002 |publisher=The American Society of Newspaper Editors |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207193451/http://www.asne.org/index.cfm?ID=3836 |archivedate=7 February 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Traits, skills, and training==\nBesides an outstanding command of the language, copy-editors need broad general knowledge for spotting factual errors; good critical thinking skills in order to recognize inconsistencies or vagueness; interpersonal skills for dealing with writers, other editors and designers; attention to detail; and a sense of style. They must also set priorities and balance a desire for perfection with the need to meet deadlines.\n\nMany copy editors have a college degree, often in journalism, communications, or the language of the writing that they edit. In the United States, copy editing is often taught as a college journalism course, though its name varies. The courses often include news design and [[pagination]].\n\nIn the United States, The Dow Jones Newspaper Fund sponsors internships that include two weeks of training. Also, the American Press Institute, the [[Poynter Institute]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], UC San Diego Extension and conferences of the American Copy Editors Society offer mid-career training for newspaper copy editors and news editors (news copy desk supervisors).\n\nMost US newspapers and publishers give copy-editing job candidates an editing test or a tryout. These vary widely and can include general items such as acronyms, current events, math, punctuation, and skills such as the use of [[AP Stylebook|Associated Press style]], headline writing, infographics editing, and [[journalism ethics]].\n\nIn both the US and the UK, there are no official bodies offering a single recognized qualification.\n\nIn the UK, there is a range of courses that are unofficially recognized within the industry. Training may be on the job or through publishing courses, privately run seminars, or correspondence courses of the Society for Editors<ref name=\"SfEP\">{{cite web|title=society for editors and proofreaders|url=https://www.sfep.org.uk/training/choose-a-course/|website=Society for Editors and Proofreaders|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}</ref> and Proofreaders. The [[National Council for the Training of Journalists]] also has a qualification for subeditors.\n\n== Contemporary ==\nBefore the digital era, copy-editors would mark errors and inconsistencies with a red pen, using a markup language of symbols which were universally known by copy-editors. The traditional copy editor was once defined as editing for grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other mechanics of style.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.editors.ca/hire/definitions.html |title=Definitions of editorial skills |accessdate=5 April 2016|publisher=Editors' Association of Canada }}</ref>\n\nCopy-editing symbols can not be used in digital editing because they are not supported on digital platforms such as track changes.

Copy editors are still employed and needed for heavy editings, such as fact-checking and content organization, which is beyond the abilities of the software. With [[grammar checker|grammar software]] and journalists who can edit, copy editors are seen as a luxury in publishing.<ref name=\"American Journalism Review\"/> The potential for a company to use editing software may also require the copy editor to only perform heavy editing and querying. Though the steps for copyediting are the same, the execution has been adapted for digital environments.\n\nThe technological development of [[cloud storage]] allows contemporary copy editors and writers to upload and share files across multiple devices.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.coolheadtech.com/blog/four-differences-between-google-drive-and-dropbox | title=Four Differences Between Google Drive and Dropbox |accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 23 October 2013 |publisher=Coolhead Tech }}</ref> Online word processors such as Google Docs, Dropbox, Zoho, OpenGoo and Buzzword allow users to perform a number of tasks.

Teresa Schmedding, president of the American Copy Editors Society (ACES) and a deputy managing editor at the ''Daily Herald'' in Chicago, thinks that copyeditors are \"a natural fit\" for digital journalism and social media because, though publishing has been made available to almost anyone, quality and credibility is brought to content only by copy editors.<ref name=\"Track changes while you edit\"/> \n\nCopy editors must now consider multimedia aspects of the story, such as video, images, audio, and search engine optimization, which may be included in digital publications.<ref name=\"Track changes while you edit\"/>  Digital editing now requires copy editors to understand [[search engine optimization|SEO]], HTML, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], and [[RSS]] feeds<ref name=\"Track changes while you edit\"/>, as well as [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[Adobe Dreamweaver]].\n\n=== Issues ===\nOne of the problems with copy-editing is that it may slow the publication of the text. With the digital publishing era came an increased demand for a fast turnover of information. Additional details such as color printing, page size, and layout are determined by the allotted budget.<ref name=\":0\" /> Web-based publications, such as BuzzFeed and ''Slate'', do not have enough room in their budgets to keep sufficient staff to edit their massive, daily rushes of content. Therefore copy chief Emmy Favila says lower-priority posts are published without copyedits at Buzzfeed.<ref name=\"ajr.org\">{{Cite web |url=http://ajr.org/2014/05/13/copy-editors-digital-media/ |title= Copy Editors Carve Niche in Digital Media Landscape |accessdate=5 April 2016|date= 13 May 2014|publisher=American Journalism Review }}</ref> ''Slate'' does not edit its blog posts before publication, but all of its news articles are copy edited before publication, say ''Slate'' copy chief Lowen Liu and deputy editor Julia Turner.<ref name=\"ajr.org\" />\n\nIn response to such high demands for fast-produced content, some online publications have started publishing articles first and then editing later, a process known as back-editing. Editors prioritize stories to edit based on traffic and whether the content was originally reported for needing edits.\n\nReading material has become increasingly accessible to users with a wide range of disabilities. Carolyn Rude exemplifies such cases in alternatively replacing illustrations with text and audio translations for the visually impaired.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Technical editing|last1=Rude|first1=Carolyn D.|date=2006|publisher=Longman|last2=Dayton|first2=David|last3=Maylath|first3= Bruce|isbn=032133082X|edition= 4th|location=New York|oclc=60188071}}</ref> Rude also suggests that web developers attempt to stick to print guidelines, such as \"clear and simple language and consistent terms and navigation devices\", especially when readers are looking at text in a second language.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Effects of the Internet==\n\nAs online resources rise in popularity, copy editors endeavor to meet the increase of digital consumerism to the best of their abilities, and such high competition has resulted in a gradually \"declining of quality in editing\", such as proofreading or fact-checking.<ref name=\"digital age\" /> However, this doesn't mean that the Internet has limited the scope of a copy editor's responsibilities or job opportunities. One of the most important advancements of the digital age is the advent of pagination, which gives copy editors more control over the construction and revisions of their content. Pagination is a convenient feature in programs such as \"Pagemaker, the Quark Xpress, and AdobeIndesign\".<ref name=\"digital age\" /> Despite the increasing number of programs, however, some copy editors believe their basic functions and duties haven't changed much. Other copy editors think that the Internet has simplified fact-checking and that websites such as Facebook or Twitter have aided information-gathering. Other digital skills, such as image selection and search engine optimization, increase the visibility of search results, especially when searching for keywords in headlines.\n\nIn all likelihood, the Internet will continue to evolve, but this shouldn't hamper the overall importance of copy editing. Although it may be tempting to neglect proper revisions in favor of convenience, the credibility and quality of an editor's work should still be maintained, as there will always be updates in software and technology.<ref name=\"digital age\" /> As formats evolve, so too will the opportunities for journalists and other writers.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Author editing]]\n* [[American Copy Editors Society]]\n* ''[[AP Stylebook]]''\n* [[Headline]]\n* [[News design]]\n* [[Photo caption]]\n* [[Proofreading]]\n* [[Robinson Prize]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* Anderson, Laura.

According to [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] teaching, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]], is said to have been [[Assumption of Mary|assumed into heaven]] without the corruption of her earthly body; she is venerated as [[Queen of Heaven]].\n\nIn the [[Christian Bible]], concepts about [[Christian eschatology]], the future \"[[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|Kingdom of Heaven]]\", and the [[resurrection of the dead]] are found, particularly in the book of [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] and in [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+15&version=NIV 1 Corinthians 15].\n==Early Christianity==\n{{See also|Early Christianity|Heaven in Judaism}}\n\nThe 1st century early [[Jewish Christian|Jewish-Christians]], from whom Christianity developed as a Gentile religion, believed that the [[Kingdom of God]] was coming to earth within their own lifetimes, and looked forward to a divine future on earth.<ref name = \"Ehrman 2006\"/> According to [[Bart Ehrman]], when the Kingdom of God did not arrive, Christian beliefs gradually changed into the expectation of an immediate reward in heaven after death, rather than to a future divine kingdom on earth,<ref name = \"Ehrman 2006\"/> despite the churches' continuing to use the major creeds' statements of belief in a coming resurrection day and [[world to come]].\n\nThe earliest of the [[Apostolic Fathers]], [[Clement of Rome]], does not mention entry into Heaven after death but instead expresses belief in the [[resurrection of the dead]] after a [[Intermediate state|period of \"slumber\"]]<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/1clement-hoole.html 1 Clement] \"26:2 For he saith in a certain place, And thou shalt raise me up, and I will give thanks unto thee; and again: I slumbered and slept; I arose up because thou art with me.\"</ref> at the [[Second Coming]].<ref>E.

At the bottom is [[Paradise]] with the [[Bosom of Abraham]] (left), and the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Good Thief]] (right).]]\n\n===Eastern Orthodox cosmology===\n{{religious text primary|section|date=June 2019}}\nEastern Orthodox [[cosmology]] perceives heaven as having different levels ({{bibleverse||John|14:2|KJV}}), the lowest of which is [[Paradise]]. At the time of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], paradise touched the earth at the [[Garden of Eden]]. After the [[Fall of man]], paradise was separated from the earth, and mankind forbidden entry, lest he partake of the [[Tree of Life]] and live eternally in a state of sinfulness ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|HE}}). At his [[Death of Jesus|death on the Cross]], the Orthodox believe Jesus opened the door to Paradise to mankind again ({{bibleverse||Luke|23:43|KJV}}), and the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Good Thief]] was the first to enter.\n\nVarious [[saint]]s have had [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2-4|KJV}}). The Orthodox concept of life in heaven is described in one of the [[prayer for the dead|prayers for the dead]]: \"\u2026a place of light, a place of green pasture, a place of repose, from whence all sickness, sorrow and sighing are fled away\".<ref>''Book for Commemoration of the Living and the Dead'', trans. Father Lawrence (Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville NY), p. 77.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]], it is only [[God]] who has the final say on who enters heaven. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, heaven is part and parcel of deification (''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]]''), the eternal sharing of the divine qualities through communion with the Triune God (reunion of Father and Son through love).\n\n==Roman Catholicism==\n{{see also|Keys of Heaven}}\n{{Overquotation|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe Catholic Church teaches that \"heaven is the ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, definitive happiness\".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1024]</ref> In heaven one experiences the [[beatific vision]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2M.HTM CCC 1023]</ref> The church holds that,\n{{quote|by his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has 'opened' heaven to us. The life of the blessed consists in the full and perfect possession of the fruits of the redemption accomplished by Christ... Heaven is the blessed community of all who are perfectly incorporated into Christ.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1026]</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to fulfill God's will in relation to other men and to all creation. Already they reign with Christ; with him 'they shall reign for ever and ever' ({{bibleverse||Rev|22:5}}).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1029]</ref>}}\n\nHeaven is considered a state, a condition of existence, rather than a particular place somewhere in the [[cosmos]]. [[Pope John Paul II]] declared:\n{{quote|The 'heaven' or 'happiness' in which we will find ourselves is neither an abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but a living, personal relationship with the Holy Trinity. It is our meeting with the Father which takes place in the risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit.<ref name=\"JPII\"/>}}\n\nThose Christians who die still imperfectly purified must, according to Catholic teaching, pass through a state of purification known as [[purgatory]] before entering heaven.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030]</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave this explanation of what is meant by heaven:\n{{Quote|We all experience that when people die they continue to exist, in a certain way, in the memory and heart of those who knew and loved them. We might say that a part of the person lives on in them but it resembles a \"shadow\" because this survival in the heart of their loved ones is destined to end. God, on the contrary, never passes away and we all exist by virtue of his love. We exist because he loves us, because he conceived of us and called us to life. We exist in God's thoughts and in God's love. We exist in the whole of our reality, not only in our \"shadow\". Our serenity, our hope and our peace are based precisely on this: in God, in his thoughts and in his love, it is not merely a \"shadow\" of ourselves that survives but rather we are preserved and ushered into eternity with the whole of our being in him, in his creator love. It is his Love that triumphs over death and gives us eternity and it is this love that we call \"Heaven\": God is so great that he also makes room for us. And Jesus the man, who at the same time is God, is the guarantee for us that the being-man and the being-God can exist and live, the one within the other, for eternity.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20100815_assunzione_en.html Homily by Pope Benedict XVI on 16 August 2010]</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Pope John Paul II]],\n{{quote|The New Testament amplifies the idea of heaven in relation to the mystery of Christ. To show that the Redeemer's sacrifice acquires perfect and definitive value, the Letter to the Hebrews says that Jesus \"passed through the heavens\" (Heb. 4:14), and \"entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself\" (ibid., 9:24). Since believers are loved in a special way by the Father, they are raised with Christ and made citizens of heaven... After the course of our earthly life, participation in complete intimacy with the Father thus comes through our insertion into Christ's paschal mystery...\"<ref name=JPII/>}}\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church indicates several images of heaven found in the Bible:\n{{quote|This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who are in Christ is beyond all understanding and description. Scripture speaks of it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, wine of the kingdom, the Father's house, the [[heavenly Jerusalem]], paradise: 'no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him'.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1027]</ref>}}\n\n==Protestant Christianity==\n{{See also|Intermediate state|Christian mortalism|Arminianism|Calvinism}}\nSome denominations teach that one enters heaven at the moment of death, while others teach that this occurs at a later time (the [[Last Judgment]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Some Christians maintain that entry into Heaven awaits such time as \"When the form of this world has passed away.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html JPII]</ref>\n\nTwo related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the \"[[resurrection of the body]]\" as contrasted with \"the [[immortality of the soul]]\". In the first, the [[soul]] does not enter heaven until the [[last judgement]] or the \"end of time\" when it (along with the body) is resurrected and judged. In the second concept, the soul goes to a heaven on another plane immediately after death. These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is [[Particular judgment|judged once at death]] and goes to a temporary heaven, while awaiting a [[General judgment|second and final judgement]] at the end of the world.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html\" JPII]</ref>\n\nSome teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after [[Adam and Eve]] disobeyed [[God]] so that mankind would not live forever in a state of [[sin]] and thus a state of separation from God.<ref>Moody, D.L.

The afterlife is divided first into two levels until the Last Judgement; afterwards it is divided into four levels, the upper three of which are referred to as \"degrees of glory\" that, for illustrative purposes, are compared to the brightness of heavenly bodies: the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[stars]].\n\nBefore the Last Judgment, spirits separated from their bodies at death go either to [[Paradise#Mormonism|paradise]] or to [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]] dependent on if they had been baptised and confirmed by the laying on of hands. Paradise is a place of rest while its inhabitants continue learning in preparation for the Last Judgement. Spirit Prison is a place of learning for the wicked and unrepentant and those who were not baptised; however, missionary efforts done by spirits from Paradise enable those in Spirit Prison to repent, accept the gospel and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and receive baptism through the practice of [[baptism for the dead]].<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|128|18}}, [[Standard Works]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]</ref>\n\nAfter the resurrection and Last Judgement, people are sent to one of four levels:\n* The [[Celestial Kingdom]] is the highest level, with its power and glory comparable to the sun. Here, faithful and valiant disciples of Christ who accepted the fullness of his gospel and kept their covenants with Him through following the prophets of their dispensation are reunited with their families and with God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit for all eternity. Those who would have accepted the gospel with all their hearts had they been given the opportunity in life (as judged by Christ and God the Father) are also saved in the Celestial Kingdom. Latter-Day Saint movements do not believe in the concept of [[original sin]], but believe children to be innocent through the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]].

At the time of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]], paradise touched the earth at the [[Garden of Eden]]. After the [[Fall of man]], paradise was separated from the earth, and mankind forbidden entry, lest he partake of the [[Tree of Life]] and live eternally in a state of sinfulness ({{bibleverse||Genesis|3:22-24|HE}}). At his [[Death of Jesus|death on the Cross]], the Orthodox believe Jesus opened the door to Paradise to mankind again ({{bibleverse||Luke|23:43|KJV}}), and the [[The Good Thief (Christianity)|Good Thief]] was the first to enter.\n\nVarious [[saint]]s have had [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]] of heaven ({{bibleverse|2|Corinthians|12:2-4|KJV}}). The Orthodox concept of life in heaven is described in one of the [[prayer for the dead|prayers for the dead]]: \"\u2026a place of light, a place of green pasture, a place of repose, from whence all sickness, sorrow and sighing are fled away\".<ref>''Book for Commemoration of the Living and the Dead'', trans. Father Lawrence (Holy Trinity Monastery, Jordanville NY), p. 77.</ref>\n\nHowever, in the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]], it is only [[God]] who has the final say on who enters heaven. In the Eastern Orthodox Church, heaven is part and parcel of deification (''[[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Theosis]]''), the eternal sharing of the divine qualities through communion with the Triune God (reunion of Father and Son through love).\n\n==Roman Catholicism==\n{{see also|Keys of Heaven}}\n{{Overquotation|section|date=December 2019}}\nThe Catholic Church teaches that \"heaven is the ultimate end and fulfillment of the deepest human longings, the state of supreme, definitive happiness\".<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1024]</ref> In heaven one experiences the [[beatific vision]].<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P2M.HTM CCC 1023]</ref> The church holds that,\n{{quote|by his death and Resurrection, Jesus Christ has 'opened' heaven to us. The life of the blessed consists in the full and perfect possession of the fruits of the redemption accomplished by Christ... Heaven is the blessed community of all who are perfectly incorporated into Christ.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1026]</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|In the glory of heaven the blessed continue joyfully to fulfill God's will in relation to other men and to all creation. Already they reign with Christ; with him 'they shall reign for ever and ever' ({{bibleverse||Rev|22:5}}).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1029]</ref>}}\n\nHeaven is considered a state, a condition of existence, rather than a particular place somewhere in the [[cosmos]]. [[Pope John Paul II]] declared:\n{{quote|The 'heaven' or 'happiness' in which we will find ourselves is neither an abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but a living, personal relationship with the Holy Trinity. It is our meeting with the Father which takes place in the risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit.<ref name=\"JPII\"/>}}\n\nThose Christians who die still imperfectly purified must, according to Catholic teaching, pass through a state of purification known as [[purgatory]] before entering heaven.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1030]</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] gave this explanation of what is meant by heaven:\n{{Quote|We all experience that when people die they continue to exist, in a certain way, in the memory and heart of those who knew and loved them. We might say that a part of the person lives on in them but it resembles a \"shadow\" because this survival in the heart of their loved ones is destined to end. God, on the contrary, never passes away and we all exist by virtue of his love. We exist because he loves us, because he conceived of us and called us to life. We exist in God's thoughts and in God's love. We exist in the whole of our reality, not only in our \"shadow\". Our serenity, our hope and our peace are based precisely on this: in God, in his thoughts and in his love, it is not merely a \"shadow\" of ourselves that survives but rather we are preserved and ushered into eternity with the whole of our being in him, in his creator love. It is his Love that triumphs over death and gives us eternity and it is this love that we call \"Heaven\": God is so great that he also makes room for us. And Jesus the man, who at the same time is God, is the guarantee for us that the being-man and the being-God can exist and live, the one within the other, for eternity.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/homilies/2010/documents/hf_ben-xvi_hom_20100815_assunzione_en.html Homily by Pope Benedict XVI on 16 August 2010]</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[Pope John Paul II]],\n{{quote|The New Testament amplifies the idea of heaven in relation to the mystery of Christ. To show that the Redeemer's sacrifice acquires perfect and definitive value, the Letter to the Hebrews says that Jesus \"passed through the heavens\" (Heb. 4:14), and \"entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself\" (ibid., 9:24). Since believers are loved in a special way by the Father, they are raised with Christ and made citizens of heaven... After the course of our earthly life, participation in complete intimacy with the Father thus comes through our insertion into Christ's paschal mystery...\"<ref name=JPII/>}}\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church indicates several images of heaven found in the Bible:\n{{quote|This mystery of blessed communion with God and all who are in Christ is beyond all understanding and description. Scripture speaks of it in images: life, light, peace, wedding feast, wine of the kingdom, the Father's house, the [[heavenly Jerusalem]], paradise: 'no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him'.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1027]</ref>}}\n\n==Protestant Christianity==\n{{See also|Intermediate state|Christian mortalism|Arminianism|Calvinism}}\nSome denominations teach that one enters heaven at the moment of death, while others teach that this occurs at a later time (the [[Last Judgment]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Some Christians maintain that entry into Heaven awaits such time as \"When the form of this world has passed away.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html JPII]</ref>\n\nTwo related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the \"[[resurrection of the body]]\" as contrasted with \"the [[immortality of the soul]]\". In the first, the [[soul]] does not enter heaven until the [[last judgement]] or the \"end of time\" when it (along with the body) is resurrected and judged. In the second concept, the soul goes to a heaven on another plane immediately after death. These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is [[Particular judgment|judged once at death]] and goes to a temporary heaven, while awaiting a [[General judgment|second and final judgement]] at the end of the world.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html\" JPII]</ref>\n\nSome teach that death itself is not a natural part of life, but was allowed to happen after [[Adam and Eve]] disobeyed [[God]] so that mankind would not live forever in a state of [[sin]] and thus a state of separation from God.<ref>Moody, D.L.

The afterlife is divided first into two levels until the Last Judgement; afterwards it is divided into four levels, the upper three of which are referred to as \"degrees of glory\" that, for illustrative purposes, are compared to the brightness of heavenly bodies: the [[sun]], [[moon]], and [[stars]].\n\nBefore the Last Judgment, spirits separated from their bodies at death go either to [[Paradise#Mormonism|paradise]] or to [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)#Spirit prison|spirit prison]] dependent on if they had been baptised and confirmed by the laying on of hands. Paradise is a place of rest while its inhabitants continue learning in preparation for the Last Judgement. Spirit Prison is a place of learning for the wicked and unrepentant and those who were not baptised; however, missionary efforts done by spirits from Paradise enable those in Spirit Prison to repent, accept the gospel and the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] and receive baptism through the practice of [[baptism for the dead]].<ref>{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|128|18}}, [[Standard Works]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]</ref>\n\nAfter the resurrection and Last Judgement, people are sent to one of four levels:\n* The [[Celestial Kingdom]] is the highest level, with its power and glory comparable to the sun. Here, faithful and valiant disciples of Christ who accepted the fullness of his gospel and kept their covenants with Him through following the prophets of their dispensation are reunited with their families and with God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit for all eternity. Those who would have accepted the gospel with all their hearts had they been given the opportunity in life (as judged by Christ and God the Father) are also saved in the Celestial Kingdom. Latter-Day Saint movements do not believe in the concept of [[original sin]], but believe children to be innocent through the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Therefore, all children who die before the [[age of accountability]] inherit this glory. Men and women who have entered into [[celestial marriage]] are eligible, under the tutelage of God the Father, to eventually become gods and goddesses as joint-heirs with Jesus Christ.\n* The [[Terrestrial Kingdom]]'s power and glory is comparable to that of the moon, and is reserved for those who understood and rejected the full gospel in life but lived good lives; those who did accept the gospel but failed to keep their covenants through continuing the process of faith, repentance, and service to others; those who \"died without law\" (D & C 76:72) but accepted the full gospel and repented after death due to the missionary efforts undertaken in Spirit Prison. God the Father does not come into the Terrestrial Kingdom, but Jesus Christ visits them and the Holy Spirit is given to them.\n* The [[Telestial Kingdom]] is comparable to the glory of the stars.

Lay Dominicans preach primarily in the marketplace or wherever our station in life finds us. We preach by our lives and example, and when opportunity arises, with our voices as well. Dominican Lay men and women pursue study, particularly in theology, Scripture, and catechesis in order to preach well when called upon to do so.\n\nThe Lay Dominicans make promises to follow The Rule of the Lay Chapters of St. Dominic and the Particular Directory of the Province in which they live. They meet in community regularly and participate with the friars, nuns, and sisters, as well as the Church in general, in praying the Liturgy of the Hours. They engage in active apostolates such as letter-writing on issues of peace and justice, ministry to the poor, liturgical ministries, teaching, authorship, and spiritual counseling. They endeavor to live lives of simplicity and generosity.<ref>[http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm ''Dominican Life USA'': \"Who are Lay Dominicans\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121230095255/http://www.domlife.org/beingdominican/WhoWeAre/Laity.htm |date=December 30, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Dominican Young Adults, USA==\nIn the summer of 2008, members who attended the Preaching in Action College conference, held a reunion at Edgewood College in Madison, WI.

Alemany, who in 1840 completed his studies in sacred theology in Rome at the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] College of St. Thomas, the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], had been appointed Bishop of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and invited Fr. Vilarrasa to accompany him to [[California]].

Mary Goemaere (1809-1891) volunteered to accompany the new bishop and to begin a school in his new diocese. Within three years, nine women (three American, one Mexican, and five Spanish) joined Sister Mary to form the Congregation of the Most Holy Name.  The province was soon reduced to a self-governing Congregation.  Finally in 1912, the congregation was formally re-erected as a province,<ref>Article \"Dominicans\" by W.A. Hinnebusch, P.
