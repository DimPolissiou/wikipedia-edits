It also allowed the creation of stand-alone, real-time applications ranging from architectural visualization to [[video game]]s. In April 2018 it was removed from the upcoming Blender 2.8 release series, having long lagged behind other game engines such as the open-source [[Godot (game engine)|Godot]], and [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]].<ref name=\"bge-removed\" /> In the 2.8 announcement, the Blender team specifically mentioned the Godot engine as a suitable replacement for migrating Blender Game Engine users.<ref name=OSgodotRec />\n* Blender Internal, a biased ''[[Rendering (computer graphics)#Scanline%20rendering%20and%20rasterisation|rasterization]] engine'' / [[Scanline rendering|scanline renderer]] used in the previous versions of Blender was also removed for the 2.80 release, in favor of the new Eevee renderer, a realtime PBR renderer.<ref name=\"bi-removed\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blendernation.com/2018/04/19/blender-internal-renderer-removed-from-2-8/|title=Blender Internal renderer removed from 2.8|date=April 19, 2018|website=BlenderNation}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:Working with Nodes Blender.PNG|Using the node editor to create [[anisotropic]] metallic materials\nFile:Engine movingparts.jpg|A [[3D rendering]] with [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]] and [[ambient occlusion]] using Blender and [[YafaRay]]\nFile:Lone House.jpg|Rendering of a house\nFile:Sintel Cover Durian Project.jpg|Sintel is the main character in the Blender [[Sintel|open film of the same name]].\nFile:Fluid simulation blender.ogg|A simple fluid simulation done with Blender\n</gallery>\n\n===User interface===\n[[File:Blender Version 2.570.jpg|300px|thumb|Blender's user interface underwent a significant update during the 2.5x series, and again with the release of Blender 2.80]]\n\nBlender's [[user interface]] incorporates the following concepts:\n;Editing modes: The two primary modes of work are ''Object Mode'' and ''Edit Mode'', which are toggled with the <tt>Tab</tt> key. Object mode is used to manipulate individual objects as a unit, while Edit mode is used to manipulate the actual object data. For example, Object Mode can be used to move, scale, and rotate entire [[polygon mesh]]es, and Edit Mode can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh. There are also several other modes, such as Vertex Paint, Weight Paint, and Sculpt Mode.\n\n;[[Hotkey]] usage: Most of the commands are accessible via [[Keyboard shortcut|hotkeys]]. There are also comprehensive [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] menus.\n\n;Numeric input: Numeric buttons can be \"dragged\" to change their value directly without the need to aim at a particular widget, as well as being set using the keyboard. Both sliders and number buttons can be constrained to various step sizes with modifiers like the <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>Shift</tt> keys. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] expressions can also be typed directly into number entry fields, allowing mathematical expressions to specify values.\n\n;Workspace management: The Blender GUI builds its own [[tiled windowing system]] on top of one or multiple windows provided by the underlying platform. One platform window (often sized to fill the screen) is divided into sections and subsections that can be of any type of Blender's views or window-types. The user can define multiple layouts of such Blender windows, called ''screens'', and switch quickly between them by selecting from a menu or with keyboard shortcuts. Each window-type's own GUI elements can be controlled with the same tools that manipulate 3D view. For example, one can zoom in and out of GUI-buttons using similar controls, one zooms in and out in the 3D viewport. The GUI viewport and screen layout are fully user-customizable. It is possible to set up the interface for specific tasks such as video editing or [[UV mapping]] or texturing by hiding features not used for the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blenderguru.com/quick-tip-use-blender-on-multiple-monitors/|title=Using Blender with multiple monitors|publisher=Blenderguru.com|accessdate=2012-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729005447/http://www.blenderguru.com/quick-tip-use-blender-on-multiple-monitors/|archive-date=2011-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware requirements===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Blender hardware requirements<ref name=\"system-requirements\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/ |title=System Requirements | website=Blender.org |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2016}}</ref>\n!

Blender 2.76b is the last supported release for Windows XP and version 2.63 was the last supported release for [[PowerPC]].<ref name=\"system-requirements\"/>\n\n===File format===\nBlender features an internal file system that can pack multiple scenes into a single file (called a \"'''.blend'''\" file).\n\n* All of Blender's \".blend\" files are forward, backward, and cross-platform compatible with other versions of Blender, with the following exceptions:\n** Loading animations stored in post-2.5 files in Blender pre-2.5. This is due to the reworked animation subsystem introduced in Blender 2.5 being inherently incompatible with older versions.\n** Loading meshes stored in post 2.63. This is due to the introduction of BMesh, a more versatile mesh format.\n* All scenes, objects, materials, textures, sounds, images, post-production effects for an entire animation can be stored in a single \".blend\" file. Data loaded from external sources, such as images and sounds, can also be stored externally and referenced through either an absolute or relative pathname. Likewise, \".blend\" files themselves can also be used as libraries of Blender assets.\n* Interface configurations are retained in the \".blend\" files.\n\nA wide variety of import/export scripts that extend Blender capabilities (accessing the object data via an internal [[Application programming interface|API]]) make it possible to interoperate with other 3D tools.\n\nBlender organizes data as various kinds of \"data blocks\", such as Objects, Meshes, Lamps, Scenes, Materials, Images and so on. An object in Blender consists of multiple data blocks&nbsp;\u2013 for example, what the user would describe as a polygon mesh consists of at least an Object and a Mesh data block, and usually also a Material and many more, linked together. This allows various data blocks to refer to each other. There may be, for example, multiple Objects that refer to the same Mesh and making subsequent editing of the shared mesh result in shape changes in all Objects using this Mesh. Objects, meshes, materials, textures etc. can also be linked to from other .blend files, which is what allows the use of .blend files as reusable resource libraries.\n\n====Import and export====\nThe software supports a variety of 3D file formats for import and export, among them [[Alembic (computer graphics)|Alembic]], [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio]] (3DS), Filmbox (FBX), Autodesk ([[DXF]]), [[SVG]], [[STL (file format)|STL]] (for 3D printing), UDIM, [[USD]], [[VRML]], [[WebM]] and [[X3D]].\n\n===Video editing===\n[[File:Blender 28 Editing Workspace.png|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The Video Sequence Editor (VSE)]]\n\nBlender features a fully functional, production-ready non-linear video editor called Video Sequence Editor or VSE for short. Blender's VSE has many features, including effects like [[Gaussian blur|Gaussian blur]], [[color grading]], fade and wipe transitions, and other video transformations. However, there is no multi-core support for rendering video with VSE.\n\n==Cycles rendering engine==\n[[File:Architectural render 02 (Blender).jpg|thumb|An architectural render showing different rendering styles in Blender, including a photorealistic style using Cycles]]\n\nCycles is a [[Path Tracing|path-tracing]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render engine]] that is designed to be interactive and easy to use, while still supporting many features.<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\">{{cite web|title = Introduction \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/introduction.html|website = www.blender.org|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}</ref> It has been included with Blender since 2011, with the release of Blender 2.61.\n\n===GPU rendering===\nCycles supports [[GPU]] rendering, which is used to speed up rendering times. There are three GPU rendering modes: [[CUDA]], which is the preferred method for older [[Nvidia]] graphics cards; [[OptiX]], which utilizes the hardware ray-tracing capabilities of Nvidia's [[Turing (microarchitecture)|Turing architecture]]; and [[OpenCL]], which supports rendering on [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Radeon|graphics cards]]. \n\nMultiple GPUs are also supported, which can be used to create a [[render farm]] \u2013 although having multiple GPUs doesn't increase the available [[Memory (computer)|memory]], because each GPU can only access its own memory.<ref>{{cite web|title = GPU Rendering \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.html |website = www.blender.org |accessdate = 2015-10-18}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Supported features<ref>{{cite web|title = Features \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/features.html#features|website = www.blender.org|accessdate = 2016-03-24}}</ref>\n!

Cycles currently supports a [[path tracing]] integrator with ''direct light sampling''. It works well for a variety of lighting setups, but it is not as suitable for [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] and certain other complex lighting situations. [[Ray tracing (graphics)|Rays are traced]] from the camera into the scene, bouncing around until they find a light source (a lamp, an object material emitting light, or the world background), or until they are simply terminated based on the number of ''maximum bounces'' determined in the light path settings for the renderer. To find lamps and surfaces emitting light, both ''indirect light sampling'' (letting the ray follow the surface [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|bidirectional scattering distribution function, or BSDF]]) and direct light sampling (picking a light source and tracing a ray towards it) are used.<ref>{{cite web|title = Integrator \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/settings/integrator.html#integrator|website = www.blender.org|accessdate = 2015-10-18|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151009124836/http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/settings/integrator.html#integrator|archive-date = 2015-10-09|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n====The two types of integrators====\n# The default path tracing integrator is a \"pure\" path tracer. This integrator works by sending a number of [[light rays]] that act as [[Photon|photons]] from the [[camera]] out into the scene. These rays will eventually hit either: a light source, an object, or the world background. If these rays hit an object, they will bounce based on the angle of impact, and continue bouncing until a light source has been reached or until a maximum number of bounces, as determined by the user, which will cause it to terminate and result in a black, unlit pixel. Multiple rays are calculated and averaged out for each individual pixel, a process known as \"sampling\". This sampling number is set by the user and greatly affects the final image. Lower sampling often results in more noise and has the potential to create \"fireflies\" (which are uncharacteristically bright pixels), while higher sampling greatly reduces noise, but also increases render times.\n# The alternative is a ''branched path tracing'' integrator, which works mostly the same way. Branched path tracing splits the light rays at each intersection with an object according to different surface components,{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=December 2019}} and takes all lights into account for shading instead of just one. This added complexity makes computing each ray slower, but reduces noise in the render, especially in scenes dominated by direct (one-bounce) lighting.\n\n===Open Shading Language===\nBlender users can create their own [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] using the [[Open Shading Language]] (OSL), although it is important to note that this feature is not supported by GPUs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/shader_nodes/osl.html|title=Open Shading Language \u2014 Blender Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=www.blender.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212162656/https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/shader_nodes/osl.html|archive-date=December 12, 2019|accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Materials===\nMaterials define the look of [[polygon mesh|meshes]], [[Non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS curves]], and other geometric objects. They consist of three [[shader]]s to define the mesh's surface appearance, volume inside, and surface displacement.<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\" />\n\n====Surface shader====\nThe ''surface shader'' defines the light interaction at the surface of the mesh. One or more bidirectional scattering distribution functions, or [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|BSDFs]], can specify if incoming light is [[Light reflection|reflected]], [[refracted]] into the mesh, or [[Light absorption|absorbed]].<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\" /> The [[Alpha compositing|alpha value]] is one measure of translucency.\n\n====Volume shader====\nWhen the surface shader does not reflect or absorb light, it enters the volume (light transmission).

It also allowed the creation of stand-alone, real-time applications ranging from architectural visualization to [[video game]]s.

Object mode is used to manipulate individual objects as a unit, while Edit mode is used to manipulate the actual object data. For example, Object Mode can be used to move, scale, and rotate entire [[polygon mesh]]es, and Edit Mode can be used to manipulate the individual vertices of a single mesh. There are also several other modes, such as Vertex Paint, Weight Paint, and Sculpt Mode.\n\n;[[Hotkey]] usage: Most of the commands are accessible via [[Keyboard shortcut|hotkeys]]. There are also comprehensive [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] menus.\n\n;Numeric input: Numeric buttons can be \"dragged\" to change their value directly without the need to aim at a particular widget, as well as being set using the keyboard. Both sliders and number buttons can be constrained to various step sizes with modifiers like the <tt>Ctrl</tt> and <tt>Shift</tt> keys. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] expressions can also be typed directly into number entry fields, allowing mathematical expressions to specify values.\n\n;Workspace management: The Blender GUI builds its own [[tiled windowing system]] on top of one or multiple windows provided by the underlying platform. One platform window (often sized to fill the screen) is divided into sections and subsections that can be of any type of Blender's views or window-types. The user can define multiple layouts of such Blender windows, called ''screens'', and switch quickly between them by selecting from a menu or with keyboard shortcuts. Each window-type's own GUI elements can be controlled with the same tools that manipulate 3D view. For example, one can zoom in and out of GUI-buttons using similar controls, one zooms in and out in the 3D viewport. The GUI viewport and screen layout are fully user-customizable. It is possible to set up the interface for specific tasks such as video editing or [[UV mapping]] or texturing by hiding features not used for the task.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blenderguru.com/quick-tip-use-blender-on-multiple-monitors/|title=Using Blender with multiple monitors|publisher=Blenderguru.com|accessdate=2012-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729005447/http://www.blenderguru.com/quick-tip-use-blender-on-multiple-monitors/|archive-date=2011-07-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Hardware requirements===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Blender hardware requirements<ref name=\"system-requirements\">{{cite web|url=https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/ |title=System Requirements | website=Blender.org |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2016}}</ref>\n!

Blender 2.76b is the last supported release for Windows XP and version 2.63 was the last supported release for [[PowerPC]].<ref name=\"system-requirements\"/>\n\n===File format===\nBlender features an internal file system that can pack multiple scenes into a single file (called a \"'''.blend'''\" file).\n\n* All of Blender's \".blend\" files are forward, backward, and cross-platform compatible with other versions of Blender, with the following exceptions:\n** Loading animations stored in post-2.5 files in Blender pre-2.5. This is due to the reworked animation subsystem introduced in Blender 2.5 being inherently incompatible with older versions.\n** Loading meshes stored in post 2.63. This is due to the introduction of BMesh, a more versatile mesh format.\n* All scenes, objects, materials, textures, sounds, images, post-production effects for an entire animation can be stored in a single \".blend\" file. Data loaded from external sources, such as images and sounds, can also be stored externally and referenced through either an absolute or relative pathname. Likewise, \".blend\" files themselves can also be used as libraries of Blender assets.\n* Interface configurations are retained in the \".blend\" files.\n\nA wide variety of import/export scripts that extend Blender capabilities (accessing the object data via an internal [[Application programming interface|API]]) make it possible to interoperate with other 3D tools.\n\nBlender organizes data as various kinds of \"data blocks\", such as Objects, Meshes, Lamps, Scenes, Materials, Images and so on. An object in Blender consists of multiple data blocks&nbsp;\u2013 for example, what the user would describe as a polygon mesh consists of at least an Object and a Mesh data block, and usually also a Material and many more, linked together. This allows various data blocks to refer to each other. There may be, for example, multiple Objects that refer to the same Mesh and making subsequent editing of the shared mesh result in shape changes in all Objects using this Mesh. Objects, meshes, materials, textures etc. can also be linked to from other .blend files, which is what allows the use of .blend files as reusable resource libraries.\n\n====Import and export====\nThe software supports a variety of 3D file formats for import and export, among them [[Alembic (computer graphics)|Alembic]], [[Autodesk 3ds Max|3D Studio]] (3DS), Filmbox (FBX), Autodesk ([[DXF]]), [[SVG]], [[STL (file format)|STL]] (for 3D printing), UDIM, [[USD]], [[VRML]], [[WebM]] and [[X3D]].\n\n===Video editing===\n[[File:Blender 28 Editing Workspace.png|alt=|thumb|250x250px|The Video Sequence Editor (VSE)]]\n\nBlender features a fully functional, production-ready non-linear video editor called Video Sequence Editor or VSE for short. Blender's VSE has many features, including effects like [[Gaussian blur|Gaussian blur]], [[color grading]], fade and wipe transitions, and other video transformations. However, there is no multi-core support for rendering video with VSE.\n\n==Cycles rendering engine==\n[[File:Architectural render 02 (Blender).jpg|thumb|An architectural render showing different rendering styles in Blender, including a photorealistic style using Cycles]]\n\nCycles is a [[Path Tracing|path-tracing]] [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render engine]] that is designed to be interactive and easy to use, while still supporting many features.<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\">{{cite web|title = Introduction \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/introduction.html|website = www.blender.org|accessdate = 2015-10-18}}</ref> It has been included with Blender since 2011, with the release of Blender 2.61.\n\n===GPU rendering===\nCycles supports [[GPU]] rendering, which is used to speed up rendering times. There are three GPU rendering modes: [[CUDA]], which is the preferred method for older [[Nvidia]] graphics cards; [[OptiX]], which utilizes the hardware ray-tracing capabilities of Nvidia's [[Turing (microarchitecture)|Turing architecture]]; and [[OpenCL]], which supports rendering on [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] [[Radeon|graphics cards]]. \n\nMultiple GPUs are also supported, which can be used to create a [[render farm]] \u2013 although having multiple GPUs doesn't increase the available [[Memory (computer)|memory]], because each GPU can only access its own memory.<ref>{{cite web|title = GPU Rendering \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/gpu_rendering.html |website = www.blender.org |accessdate = 2015-10-18}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Supported features<ref>{{cite web|title = Features \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/features.html#features|website = www.blender.org|accessdate = 2016-03-24}}</ref>\n!

Cycles currently supports a [[path tracing]] integrator with ''direct light sampling''. It works well for a variety of lighting setups, but it is not as suitable for [[Caustic (optics)|caustics]] and certain other complex lighting situations. [[Ray tracing (graphics)|Rays are traced]] from the camera into the scene, bouncing around until they find a light source (a lamp, an object material emitting light, or the world background), or until they are simply terminated based on the number of ''maximum bounces'' determined in the light path settings for the renderer. To find lamps and surfaces emitting light, both ''indirect light sampling'' (letting the ray follow the surface [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|bidirectional scattering distribution function, or BSDF]]) and direct light sampling (picking a light source and tracing a ray towards it) are used.<ref>{{cite web|title = Integrator \u2014 Blender Reference Manual|url = http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/settings/integrator.html#integrator|website = www.blender.org|accessdate = 2015-10-18|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151009124836/http://www.blender.org/manual/render/cycles/settings/integrator.html#integrator|archive-date = 2015-10-09|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\n====The two types of integrators====\n# The default path tracing integrator is a \"pure\" path tracer. This integrator works by sending a number of [[light rays]] that act as [[Photon|photons]] from the [[camera]] out into the scene. These rays will eventually hit either: a light source, an object, or the world background. If these rays hit an object, they will bounce based on the angle of impact, and continue bouncing until a light source has been reached or until a maximum number of bounces, as determined by the user, which will cause it to terminate and result in a black, unlit pixel. Multiple rays are calculated and averaged out for each individual pixel, a process known as \"sampling\". This sampling number is set by the user and greatly affects the final image. Lower sampling often results in more noise and has the potential to create \"fireflies\" (which are uncharacteristically bright pixels), while higher sampling greatly reduces noise, but also increases render times.\n# The alternative is a ''branched path tracing'' integrator, which works mostly the same way. Branched path tracing splits the light rays at each intersection with an object according to different surface components,{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=December 2019}} and takes all lights into account for shading instead of just one. This added complexity makes computing each ray slower, but reduces noise in the render, especially in scenes dominated by direct (one-bounce) lighting.\n\n===Open Shading Language===\nBlender users can create their own [[Node (computer science)|nodes]] using the [[Open Shading Language]] (OSL), although it is important to note that this feature is not supported by GPUs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/shader_nodes/osl.html|title=Open Shading Language \u2014 Blender Manual|last=|first=|date=|website=www.blender.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212162656/https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/render/shader_nodes/osl.html|archive-date=December 12, 2019|accessdate=December 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Materials===\nMaterials define the look of [[polygon mesh|meshes]], [[Non-uniform rational B-spline|NURBS curves]], and other geometric objects. They consist of three [[shader]]s to define the mesh's surface appearance, volume inside, and surface displacement.<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\" />\n\n====Surface shader====\nThe ''surface shader'' defines the light interaction at the surface of the mesh. One or more bidirectional scattering distribution functions, or [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|BSDFs]], can specify if incoming light is [[Light reflection|reflected]], [[refracted]] into the mesh, or [[Light absorption|absorbed]].<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\" /> The [[Alpha compositing|alpha value]] is one measure of translucency.\n\n====Volume shader====\nWhen the surface shader does not reflect or absorb light, it enters the volume (light transmission). If no volume shader is specified, it will pass straight through (or be refracted, see [[Refractive index|refractive index or IOR]]) to another side of the mesh.\n\nIf one is defined, a ''volume shader'' describes the light interaction as it passes through the volume of the mesh. Light may be [[Light scattering|scattered]], absorbed, or even [[Light emission|emitted]]{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=December 2019}} at any point in the volume.<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\" />\n\n====Displacement shader====\nThe shape of the surface may be altered by ''displacement shaders''. In this way, [[texture mapping|textures]] can be used to make the mesh surface more detailed.\n\nDepending on the settings, the displacement may be virtual \u2013 only modifying the [[surface normals]] to give the impression of displacement (also known as [[bump mapping]]) \u2013 real, or a combination of real displacement with bump mapping.<ref name=\"manual-cycles-intro\" />\n\n==Demo reels==\nThe Blender website contains several [[showreel (actors)|demo reels]] that showcase various features of Blender, such as particle simulation, motion graphics, and texturing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blender.org/features/reels/ |title=Demo Reels |website=blender.org |access-date=October 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026070021/http://www.blender.org/features/reels/ |archive-date=October 26, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{Refexample|section|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Rendering engines==\n{{List to table|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Engines included in Blender===\n* '''Cycles''' \u2014 [[Unbiased rendering|Unbiased]] [[path tracing]] render engine.

The assets were then split into a separate company, prior to being sold.\n\nThe domestic transmitter network was purchased by a US company, Crown Castle, when it was privatised in 1997. Subsequently, in 2004, this was purchased by [[National Grid plc]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3846869.stm|title=National Grid buys TV masts firm|date=2004-06-28|access-date=2020-04-17|language=en-GB}}</ref> which merged in its own private communication network, the name changing to National Grid Wireless in October 2005. Transmitters used by the BBC Overseas services were sold to a new startup company, called [[VT Communications|Merlin Communications]].\n\n===National Grid===\n[[National Grid plc]] had a large internal network for the communication of its engineers serving initially the electricity companies, but subsequently, the gas industry as well. This company developed on the back of the growth in mobile phones, and its large portfolio of tower locations. This was added to by the purchase of the former BBC network (as above).\n\nNational Grid Wireless, as it became, led a consortium bidding for the second UK national [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] licence, but was unsuccessful.

The ITA appointed and regulated a number of regional programme contractors, and built and operated a network of transmitters.\n\nThe [[Sound Broadcasting Act 1972]] created legal commercial radio in the UK for the first time. It was modelled on ITA, in that programmes were made by local contractors while the regulator, renamed the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]], owned and operated the transmitters.\n\n===ITC, RA and Transcom===\nThe [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] split the IBA into three bodies. The [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) regulated commercial TV and the [[Ofcom|Radio Authority]] (RA) regulated commercial radio. The IBA's engineering division, which operated the transmitters as well as doing research and development, became an independent company called National Transcommunications Limited (NTL), also known as \"Transcom\". At this point, technical standards regulation, previously carried out in accordance with the IBA engineering \"Code of Practice\", seems to have disappeared from the regulatory landscape.\n\n===CableTel, Simoco and NTL===\nTranscom was acquired by International CableTel Inc., which subsequently built its brand around the NTL name. It ran up huge debts during the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] which crippled the company for many years. In 1998, NTL acquired the UK antenna sites business of Simoco, a [[professional mobile radio|private mobile radio]] (PMR) company formed from Philips Telecom - PMR. In 1999 NTL acquired the UK field service operations business of Simoco. In 2004, NTL sold its 'broadcast unit' to Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group, but continued as a cable operator.\n\n===Macquarie===\nIn January 2005, [[Macquarie Group|Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group]] renamed its new subsidiary Arqiva.\nSubsequently in July 2009, Macquarie sold off a substantial part of its holding and moved the remaining amount to its investment fund. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) now has a 48% holding and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 2 (MEIF 2) has 21%, with other [[Macquarie Group]] funds holding 13% <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqiva.com/corporate/structure/|title=About Us|work=arqiva.com|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Inmedia===\nArqiva acquired [[Inmedia Communications]] from the Carlyle Group for \u00a368.5 million in July 2005 to form the new Satellite Media Solutions business unit. Inmedia was owned by [[KCOM Group|Kingston Communications]] and known as Kingston inmedia before being bought by the [[Carlyle Group]] in 2004.\n\n===BT Broadcast===\nArqiva announced the signing of a Sale & Purchase Agreement (SPA) with BT to acquire the full-time service components of BT\u2019s Satellite Broadcast Services business for \u00a325 million in cash in November 2006. The deal will include long-term customer contracts, operations and personnel located in the USA, France, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the UK. Deal completion is subject to regulatory approval in the UK and Germany.\n\n===National Grid Wireless===\nArqiva purchased National Grid Wireless on 3 April 2007 for \u00a32.5billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqiva.com/press-office/press-releases/press-releases-2007/arqiva-and-national-grid-wireless-combine-to-create-unified-uk-c|title=Arqiva and National Grid Wireless to create unified UK communications infrastructure - Arqiva.com|accessdate=2007-04-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602105016/http://www.arqiva.com/press-office/press-releases/press-releases-2007/arqiva-and-national-grid-wireless-combine-to-create-unified-uk-c|archivedate=2007-06-02}}</ref> The company planned to run NGW as a separate company \u2013 Macquarie UK Broadcast Ventures Ltd \u2013 pending review of the deal by competition regulators. Regulatory agreement was reached in late 2008 and National Grid Wireless was amalgamated into Arqiva. The new company employs around 2,300 people and operates all the TV and most of the radio transmitters in the UK (BBC national and local and many commercial stations). It is deemed to be a monopoly operator and as such is regulated by [[Ofcom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSL032432220070403|title=Macquarie buys National Grid wireless for $4.9 bln|publisher= Reuters|accessdate= 3 April 2007}}</ref>\n\n===JFMG===\nArqiva purchased PMSE band manager JFMG 19 February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beirg.co.uk/2009/02/arqiva-buys-jfmg.html|title=BEIRG: Arqiva buys JFMG|work=beirg.co.uk|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref> JFMG were contracted by communications regulator [[Ofcom|OFCOM]] to provide spectrum management and licensing services for programme making and special events ([[Programme making and special events|PMSE]]).

The assets were then split into a separate company, prior to being sold.\n\nThe domestic transmitter network was purchased by a US company, Crown Castle, when it was privatised in 1997. Subsequently, in 2004, this was purchased by [[National Grid plc]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3846869.stm|title=National Grid buys TV masts firm|date=2004-06-28|access-date=2020-04-17|language=en-GB}}</ref> which merged in its own private communication network, the name changing to National Grid Wireless in October 2005. Transmitters used by the BBC Overseas services were sold to a new startup company, called [[VT Communications|Merlin Communications]].\n\n===National Grid===\n[[National Grid plc]] had a large internal network for the communication of its engineers serving initially the electricity companies, but subsequently, the gas industry as well. This company developed on the back of the growth in mobile phones, and its large portfolio of tower locations. This was added to by the purchase of the former BBC network (as above).\n\nNational Grid Wireless, as it became, led a consortium bidding for the second UK national [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] licence, but was unsuccessful. The licence was awarded instead to [[4 Digital Group]] in July 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/jul/06/channel4.radio|title=Channel 4 wins radio multiplex bid - MediaGuardian.co.uk|accessdate=2008-01-08 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Ben | last=Dowell | date=6 July 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080107171540/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jul/06/channel4.radio| archivedate= 7 January 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Independent Television Authority (ITA) / Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)===\nThe [[Television Act 1954]] gave birth to the [[Independent Television Authority]] (ITA). The ITA appointed and regulated a number of regional programme contractors, and built and operated a network of transmitters.\n\nThe [[Sound Broadcasting Act 1972]] created legal commercial radio in the UK for the first time. It was modelled on ITA, in that programmes were made by local contractors while the regulator, renamed the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]], owned and operated the transmitters.\n\n===ITC, RA and Transcom===\nThe [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] split the IBA into three bodies. The [[Independent Television Commission]] (ITC) regulated commercial TV and the [[Ofcom|Radio Authority]] (RA) regulated commercial radio. The IBA's engineering division, which operated the transmitters as well as doing research and development, became an independent company called National Transcommunications Limited (NTL), also known as \"Transcom\". At this point, technical standards regulation, previously carried out in accordance with the IBA engineering \"Code of Practice\", seems to have disappeared from the regulatory landscape.\n\n===CableTel, Simoco and NTL===\nTranscom was acquired by International CableTel Inc., which subsequently built its brand around the NTL name. It ran up huge debts during the [[dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] which crippled the company for many years. In 1998, NTL acquired the UK antenna sites business of Simoco, a [[professional mobile radio|private mobile radio]] (PMR) company formed from Philips Telecom - PMR. In 1999 NTL acquired the UK field service operations business of Simoco. In 2004, NTL sold its 'broadcast unit' to Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group, but continued as a cable operator.\n\n===Macquarie===\nIn January 2005, [[Macquarie Group|Macquarie Communications Infrastructure Group]] renamed its new subsidiary Arqiva.\nSubsequently in July 2009, Macquarie sold off a substantial part of its holding and moved the remaining amount to its investment fund. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) now has a 48% holding and Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund 2 (MEIF 2) has 21%, with other [[Macquarie Group]] funds holding 13% <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqiva.com/corporate/structure/|title=About Us|work=arqiva.com|accessdate=13 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Inmedia===\nArqiva acquired [[Inmedia Communications]] from the Carlyle Group for \u00a368.5 million in July 2005 to form the new Satellite Media Solutions business unit. Inmedia was owned by [[KCOM Group|Kingston Communications]] and known as Kingston inmedia before being bought by the [[Carlyle Group]] in 2004.\n\n===BT Broadcast===\nArqiva announced the signing of a Sale & Purchase Agreement (SPA) with BT to acquire the full-time service components of BT\u2019s Satellite Broadcast Services business for \u00a325 million in cash in November 2006. The deal will include long-term customer contracts, operations and personnel located in the USA, France, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the UK.

The Indians that had lost their connections with their communities and had adopted different cultural elements could \"pass\" and be considered mestizos. The same applied to blacks and castas. Rather, the factor that distinguished the various social groups was their ''calidad'' (\"quality\"); this concept was related to an idea of blood as conferring status, but there were also other elements, such as occupation and marriage, that could have the effect of blanqueamiento (whitening) on people and influence their upward social mobility.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Chambers, Sarah C.|year=2003|chapter=Little Middle Ground The Instability of a Mestizo Identity in the Andes, 18th and 19th centuries|title=Race and Nation in Modern Latin American|editor=Nancy P.

For most of the colonial period, Americans of European descent were simply referred to as \"Spaniards\"; beginning in the late 18th century, the term \"blanco\" (white) came into increasing but not exclusive use.

First, divergent patterns of colonization may account for differences in the construction of racial groupings, as evidenced in Latin America, which was colonized primarily by the Spanish. The Spanish colonials had a longer history of tolerance of non-White racial groupings through their interactions with the Moors and North African social groups, as well as a different understanding of the rights of colonized subjects and a different pattern of economic development.}}</ref>\n\nPeople descended from European settlers who arrived in [[Americas|the Americas]] during the colonial and post-independence periods can be found throughout Latin America.

However, while most present-day racial classifications include a concept of being white that is ideologically connected to European heritage and specific phenotypic and biological features associated with European heritage, there are differences in how people are classified. These differences arise from the various historical processes and social contexts in which a given racial classification is used. As Latin America is characterized by differing histories and social contexts, there is also variance in the perception of whiteness throughout Latin America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chambers, Sarah C.|year=2003|chapter=Little Middle Ground The Instability of a Mestizo Identity in the Andes, 18th and 19th centuries|title=Race and Nation in Modern Latin American|editor=Nancy P. Appelbaum|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|quote=This blending of culture and genealogy is also reflected in the use of the terms ''Spanish'' and ''white''. For most of the colonial period, Americans of European descent were simply referred to as ''Spaniards''; beginning in the late 18th century, the term ''blanco'' (white) came into increasing but not exclusive use. Even those of presumably mixed ancestry may have felt justified in claiming to be Spanish (and later white) if they participated in the dominant culture by, for example, speaking Spanish and wearing European clothing.(p. 33)}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Peter Wade]], a specialist in race concepts of Latin America,\n\n<blockquote>...racial categories and racial ideologies are not simply those that elaborate social constructions on the basis of phenotypical variation or ideas about innate difference but those that do so using the particular aspects of phenotypical variation that were worked into vital signifiers of difference during European colonial encounters with others.<ref>Wade, Peter. 1997. Race and Ethnicity in Latin America. Critical Studies On Latin America. Pluto Press p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn many parts of Latin America being white is more a matter of socio-economic status than specific phenotypic traits, and it is often said that in Latin America \"money whitens\".<ref>Levine-Rasky, Cynthia. 2002. \"Working through whiteness: international perspectives. SUNY Press (p. 73) \" 'Money whitens' If any phrase encapsulates the association of whiteness and the modern in Latin America, this is it. It is a clich\u00e9 formulated and reformulated throughout the region, a truism dependent upon the social experience that wealth is associated with whiteness, and that in obtaining the former one may become aligned with the latter (and vice versa).\"</ref> Within Latin America there are variations in how racial boundaries have been defined. In Argentina, for example, the notion of mixture has been downplayed.

In Latin America, a person's ancestry may not be decisive in racial classification.

The ''[[casta]]'' system, a primarily race-based classification that was used in colonial Latin America designated people according to its racial background, with the main classifications being ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indio]]'' (used to refer to Native American people), ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' (those of complete European ancestry born in Latin America, or in cases, people who were 7/8 or more European and 1/8 Indigenous or less), ''[[castizo]]'' (3/4 European, 1/4 Indigenous), or ''[[mestizo]]'' (1/2 European, 1/2 Indigenous), ''[[Demographics of Africa|negro]]'' (Sub-Saharan Africans) ''[[mulato]]'' (1/2 European, 1/2 African), ''[[zambo]]'' (1/2 African, 1/2 Indigenous), ''[[Pardo]]'' (persons with European, African and Indigenous ancestry), and ''Peninsulares'' who were Europeans born in Spain or other European countries such as Portugal in the case of Portuguese colonies.\n\nAs in Spain, persons of even remote Jewish or Moorish ancestry were not allowed to enroll in the Spanish Army or the Catholic Church in the colonies. Applicants to both institutions, and their spouses, had to obtain a ''[[Limpieza de sangre]]'' (purity of blood) certificate that proved that they had no Jewish or Moorish ancestors, in the same way as those in the Peninsula did. However, being a medieval concept that targeted exclusively those religious groups, it was never an issue among the native population in the colonies of the Spanish Empire, which by law allowed people from all racial groups to join the army, with being of the Catholic faith the only prerequisite.

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085).

The majority of the deaths of Native Americans were the cause of diseases such as measles and smallpox, which were spread by European settlers. Many Native Americans were also killed by armed conflicts with European settlers.\n\nWhite Colombians are mostly descendants of Spaniards, although Italian, German, Irish, Portuguese, Slavic, and Lebanese Colombians are found in significant numbers. Many Spanish colonists came searching for gold, while other Spaniards established themselves as leaders of social organizations teaching natives the Christian faith and the ways of European civilization. Catholic priests provided education for Native Americans that otherwise was unavailable.\n\nBetween 1540 and 1559, 8.9 percent of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin. It has been suggested that the present day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] is attributable to the Basque immigration and character traits. Today many Colombians of the Department of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] region preserve their Basque ethnic heritage.

During 1850\u20131900, the country welcomed four waves of European immigrants, mainly Spaniards, Italians and Frenchmen. In smaller numbers came British, Germans, Swiss, Russians, Portuguese, Poles, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Dutch, Belgians, Croatians, Lebanese, Armenians, Greeks, Scandinavians, and Irish. The demographic impact of these migratory waves was greater than in Argentina, Uruguay going from having 70,000 inhabitants in 1830, to 450,000 in 1875, and a million inhabitants by 1900, its population thus increasing fourteen-fold in only 70 years. Between 1840 and 1890, 50%\u201360% of [[Montevideo]]'s population was born abroad, almost all in Europe. The Census conducted in 1860 showed that 35% of the country's population was made up by foreigners, although by the time of the 1908 Census this figure had dropped to 17%.<ref>[http://www.rau.edu.uy/uruguay/historia/Uy.hist3.htm \"El Nacimiento del Uruguay Moderno en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX\"] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1996 to 1997, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) of Uruguay conducted a Continuous Household Survey, of 40,000 homes, that included the topic of race in the country.

These results were extrapolated, and the INE estimated that out of 2,790,600 inhabitants, some 2,602,200 were white (93.2%), some 164,200 (5.9%) were totally or partially black, some 12,100 were totally or partially Amerindian (0.4%), and the remaining 12,000 considered themselves Yellow.<ref>[http://www.ine.gub.uy/biblioteca/raza/MODULO_RAZA.pdf \"Encuesta Cont\u00ednua de Hogares 1996-1997\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019035805/http://www.ine.gub.uy/biblioteca/raza/MODULO_RAZA.pdf |date=2011-10-19 }}.

Until the last years of World War II, a large part of European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, and their cultural impact was significant, influencing its gastronomy, customs and the development of Castilian in the country. With the beginning of oil production during the first decades of the 20th century, employees of oil companies from the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands established themselves in Venezuela. Later, in the middle of the century, there was a new wave of immigrants originating from Spain (mainly from Galicia, Andalucia, and Basque country, some being refugees from the [[Spanish Civil War]]), Italy (mainly from southern Italy and the Veneto region), and Portugal (from Madeira), as well as from Germany, France, England, [[Croatia]], the Netherlands, other European countries, and the [[Middle East]] (Lebanon and Syria), encouraged by a welcoming immigration policy to a prosperous, rapidly developing country where educated and skilled immigrants were needed.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n==Representation in the media==\nSome American media outlets have criticized Latin American media for allegedly featuring a disproportionate number of [[blond]] and [[eye color#Blue|blue-eyed]] white actors and actresses in [[telenovela]]s, relative to non-whites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/58525?tid=relatedcl |title=Y Tu Black Mama Tambien |accessdate=2008-05-02 |last=Quinonez |first=Ernesto |date=2003-06-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A19009-2000Aug1&notFound=true|title=Washington Post: Breaking News, World, US, DC News & Analysis|work=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://latinola.com/story.php?story=9009|title=LatinoLA - Forum :: Blonde, Blue-Eyed, Euro-Cute Latinos on Spanish TV|work=LatinoLA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art40221.asp|title=What are Telenovelas?|work=bellaonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-08-06/news/0008060066_1_spanish-latino-leaders-caste|title=Racial Bias Charged On Spanish-language Tv|work=tribunedigital-sunsentinel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackelectorate.com/articles.asp?ID=281|title=:: BlackElectorate.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.antimoon.com/forum/2004/5104-9.htm|title=Differences Between American and Castilian Spanish|work=antimoon.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/corpus/film_description.php|title=Film Description - Corpus - POV - PBS|work=pbs.org}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Latin America}}\n{{columns\n|width=270px\n|col1 =\n* [[Race and ethnicity in Latin America]]\n* [[Latin Americans]]\n* [[Blanqueamiento]]\n* [[Carcamano]]\n* [[Castizo]]\n|col2 =\n* [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]]\n* [[Mulatto]]\n* [[Peninsulares]]\n* [[Tejano]]\n* [[Afro-Latin Americans]]\n|col3 =\n* [[Chicano]]\n* [[Asian Latin Americans]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Mestizo]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Twinam, Ann. 2015.

However, while most present-day racial classifications include a concept of being white that is ideologically connected to European heritage and specific phenotypic and biological features associated with European heritage, there are differences in how people are classified. These differences arise from the various historical processes and social contexts in which a given racial classification is used. As Latin America is characterized by differing histories and social contexts, there is also variance in the perception of whiteness throughout Latin America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chambers, Sarah C.|year=2003|chapter=Little Middle Ground The Instability of a Mestizo Identity in the Andes, 18th and 19th centuries|title=Race and Nation in Modern Latin American|editor=Nancy P.

The ''[[casta]]'' system, a primarily race-based classification that was used in colonial Latin America designated people according to its racial background, with the main classifications being ''[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indio]]'' (used to refer to Native American people), ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' (those of complete European ancestry born in Latin America, or in cases, people who were 7/8 or more European and 1/8 Indigenous or less), ''[[castizo]]'' (3/4 European, 1/4 Indigenous), or ''[[mestizo]]'' (1/2 European, 1/2 Indigenous), ''[[Demographics of Africa|negro]]'' (Sub-Saharan Africans) ''[[mulato]]'' (1/2 European, 1/2 African), ''[[zambo]]'' (1/2 African, 1/2 Indigenous), ''[[Pardo]]'' (persons with European, African and Indigenous ancestry), and ''Peninsulares'' who were Europeans born in Spain or other European countries such as Portugal in the case of Portuguese colonies.\n\nAs in Spain, persons of even remote Jewish or Moorish ancestry were not allowed to enroll in the Spanish Army or the Catholic Church in the colonies. Applicants to both institutions, and their spouses, had to obtain a ''[[Limpieza de sangre]]'' (purity of blood) certificate that proved that they had no Jewish or Moorish ancestors, in the same way as those in the Peninsula did. However, being a medieval concept that targeted exclusively those religious groups, it was never an issue among the native population in the colonies of the Spanish Empire, which by law allowed people from all racial groups to join the army, with being of the Catholic faith the only prerequisite. One notable example was that of [[Francisco Menendez (creole)|Francisco Menendez]], a freed-black military officer of the Spanish Army during the 18th century at the [[Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose]] fort in St. Augustine, Florida.<ref>{{cite book | title=Black society in Spanish Florida | publisher=University of Illinois Press | author=Landers, Jane | year=1999 | pages=29 | isbn=0-252-06753-3}}</ref>\n\nAlthough historically both [[Colonial Brazil|Colonial]] and [[Imperial Brazil]] had [[institutionalized discrimination]] against citizens who were deemed people of color, it never had a casta system like that of Hispanic America.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} White Brazilians equivalent in status to the Hispanic criollo could have less than 80% European (overwhelmingly Portuguese) ancestry.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Having some Amerindian and black African ancestry\u2014which is widespread among white Brazilians, among all social classes in its [[Regions of Brazil|five geographic regions]] since the 16th to 17th centuries\u2013as well as having Moorish, Jewish, Arab, or [[Romani people|Romani]] ancestry, affected social status less than in Hispanic America,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} This does not mean that the social status of \"fully non-white\" people (people of color who are not mulattoes, mestizos, [[zambos]], pardos, etc.\u2014in short, [[Mixed-race Brazilian]]s\u2014even with Caucasian features), \"westernized\" Brazilians with non-Caucasian phenotypes, or people with known non-European ancestry was equal to that of Brazilian elites.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n==Populations==\nThe largest white population in [[Latin America]] is in Brazil, with 91 million whites out of 190.7 million total Brazilians,<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=2018&id_pagina=1 IBGE - 2010 Census: Country faces decline of fertility] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117081541/http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=2018&id_pagina=1 |date=2013-01-17 }}</ref> or 47.7% of the total population, as of the 2010 census.

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bio-anthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal |pmid=19639555 | doi=10.1002/ajhb.20976 | volume=22 | issue=2 | title=Genetic composition of Brazilian population samples based on a set of twenty-eight ancestry informative SNPs | year=2010 | journal=Am.

The majority of the deaths of Native Americans were the cause of diseases such as measles and smallpox, which were spread by European settlers. Many Native Americans were also killed by armed conflicts with European settlers.\n\nWhite Colombians are mostly descendants of Spaniards, although Italian, German, Irish, Portuguese, Slavic, and Lebanese Colombians are found in significant numbers. Many Spanish colonists came searching for gold, while other Spaniards established themselves as leaders of social organizations teaching natives the Christian faith and the ways of European civilization. Catholic priests provided education for Native Americans that otherwise was unavailable.\n\nBetween 1540 and 1559, 8.9 percent of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin. It has been suggested that the present day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] is attributable to the Basque immigration and character traits. Today many Colombians of the Department of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] region preserve their Basque ethnic heritage.

However, in some rural regions, Mestizos refer to themselves as Blancos, to distinguish themselves from Native Americans and Quechua speakers.

During 1850\u20131900, the country welcomed four waves of European immigrants, mainly Spaniards, Italians and Frenchmen. In smaller numbers came British, Germans, Swiss, Russians, Portuguese, Poles, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Dutch, Belgians, Croatians, Lebanese, Armenians, Greeks, Scandinavians, and Irish. The demographic impact of these migratory waves was greater than in Argentina, Uruguay going from having 70,000 inhabitants in 1830, to 450,000 in 1875, and a million inhabitants by 1900, its population thus increasing fourteen-fold in only 70 years. Between 1840 and 1890, 50%\u201360% of [[Montevideo]]'s population was born abroad, almost all in Europe. The Census conducted in 1860 showed that 35% of the country's population was made up by foreigners, although by the time of the 1908 Census this figure had dropped to 17%.<ref>[http://www.rau.edu.uy/uruguay/historia/Uy.hist3.htm \"El Nacimiento del Uruguay Moderno en la segunda mitad del siglo XIX\"] {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1996 to 1997, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) of Uruguay conducted a Continuous Household Survey, of 40,000 homes, that included the topic of race in the country. Its results were based on \"the explicit statements of the interviewee about the race they consider they belong themselves\". These results were extrapolated, and the INE estimated that out of 2,790,600 inhabitants, some 2,602,200 were white (93.2%), some 164,200 (5.9%) were totally or partially black, some 12,100 were totally or partially Amerindian (0.4%), and the remaining 12,000 considered themselves Yellow.<ref>[http://www.ine.gub.uy/biblioteca/raza/MODULO_RAZA.pdf \"Encuesta Cont\u00ednua de Hogares 1996-1997\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019035805/http://www.ine.gub.uy/biblioteca/raza/MODULO_RAZA.pdf |date=2011-10-19 }}.

This reduction in the percentage of self-declared \"pure whites\" between surveys could be caused by the phenomenon of the interviewee giving new value to their African heritage, similar to what has happened in Brazil in the last three censuses. Anyway, it is worth noting that 2,897,525 interview\u00e9es declared having only white ancestry (87.4%), 302,460 declared having total or partial black ancestry (9.1%), 106,368 total or partial Amerindian ancestry (2.9%) and 6,549 total or partial Yellow ancestry (0.2%).<ref>[http://www.ine.gub.uy/enha2006/Informe%20final%20raza.pdf \"Perfil Demogr\u00e1fico y Socioecon\u00f3mico de la Poblaci\u00f3n Uruguaya seg\u00fan su Ascendencia Racial\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601180825/http://www.ine.gub.uy/enha2006/Informe%20final%20raza.pdf |date=2012-06-01 }} por Marisa Bucheli y Wanda Cabela.
