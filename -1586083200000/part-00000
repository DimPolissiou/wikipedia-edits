Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga, Richard A.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, John T. Wilder took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry]] Regiments, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His intial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavlary to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the the Rolling Fork River.<ref>The History of Morgan\u2019s Cavalry, Basil W. Duke, Indiana University Press</ref><ref>John Hunt Morgan and his Raiders, Edison H. Thomas, University of KY Press</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen. Several times, Rosecrans wrot to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Scretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref>[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html</ref>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creatuve man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nFrom the outset, the brigade used their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but once engaged with the enemy, the soldiers fought dismounted. It was due to this speed of deployment that the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields,]] and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breechloading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref>https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/</ref><ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland. Embarrassed, the Government paid for the weapons before the men expended any of their personal money.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon had a tubular magazine that held seven rimfire cartridges and, it would soon prove to be one of the most deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Wilder and other mounted infantry units in the Army of the Cumberland developed new methods.\n\n==[[Tullahoma Campaign]]==\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right. His troops struck out toward Liberty, Hoover's, and Bellbuckle Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref>Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Glenn W. Sunderland, Thomas Yoseloff</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised the Confederate 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment, under Colonel J. Russell Butler at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm National Park Service battle description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318161310/http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn017.htm |date=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap</ref>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.\n<br>\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21-24; Connelly, pp. 126-27; Korn, pp. 24-26.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cozzens |first=Peter |date=1992 |title=This Terrible Sound |isbn=0-252-01703-X |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/thisterriblesoun0000cozz }}</ref> \n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably&mdash;Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28-30; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31-33; Connelly, pp. 127-28; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his force under Maj. Gen [[Alexander P. Stewart]] at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128-29; Lamers, pp. 280-82.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36-38.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38-40; Connelly, pp. 130-32; Lamers, pp. 284-85; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40-42; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285-88.</ref>\n\n==[[Chickamauga Campaign]]==\n\n===[[Second Battle of Chattanooga]]===\n(August 21-September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had eployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon saw his three corps separated by 60 miles. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor n disarray.  wsa not defeated\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army as it crossed Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas informed Rosecrans that the enemy was no longer falling back as they thought nut seemd to be massing. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook started making plans to shift their corps closer  together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65&ndash;75.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]] advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref>https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm</ref>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by building fires over a large area to bluff the Confederates into believing his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref>Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Glenn W. Sunderland, Bookworks</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of September 18 and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112-17; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46-47.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199-200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49-50; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199-200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44-45; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172-73; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582-83.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45-46; Cozzens, pp. 218-24, 259-62; Tucker, pp. 170-72, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41-42; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288-99, 315-17; Cozzens, pp. 376-90, 392-96; Woodworth, pp. 118-19.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually dispersed through the corps of the army with two of the regiments, 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana being assigned to the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Baumgartner, Richard A.

The story has been adapted for the cinema on several occasions.  The seventeenth book in Zola's ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'' series, it is based upon the railway between [[Paris]] and [[Le Havre]] in the 19th century and is a tense, [[psychological thriller]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe main characters are Roubaud, the deputy station master at Le Havre, his wife S\u00e9verine, and Jacques Lantier. Lantier is an engine driver on the line and the family link with the rest of ''Les Rougon-Macquart'' series. He is the son of Gervaise (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), the brother of \u00c9tienne Lantier (''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'') and Claude Lantier (''[[L'\u0152uvre]]''), and the half-brother of the eponymous [[Nana (novel)|Nana]].\n\n==Plot==\nLantier, the \"human beast\" of the title, has a hereditary madness and has several times in his life wanted to murder women. At the beginning of the story he is an engine driver, in control of his engine, \"La Lison.\" His relationship with \"La Lison\" is almost sexual and provides some degree of control over his mania.\n\nAs a result of a chance remark, Roubaud suspects that S\u00e9verine has had an affair some years earlier, with Grandmorin, one of the directors of the railway company, who had acted as her patron and who had helped Roubaud get his job. He forces a confession out of her and makes her write a letter to Grandmorin, telling him to take a particular train that evening, the same train Roubaud and S\u00e9verine are taking back to Le Havre.\n\nMeanwhile, Lantier, who is not working while his engine is being repaired, goes to visit his Aunt Phasie who lives in an isolated house by the railway. On leaving he meets his cousin Flore, with whom he has had a longstanding mutual attraction. After a brief conversation with her his passions become inflamed and he is on the verge of raping her but this in turn brings on his homicidal mania. He has a desire to stab her but just about controls himself and rushes away. Finding himself beside the railway track as the train from Paris passes, he sees, in a split second, a figure on the train holding a knife, bent over another person. Shortly after, he finds the body of Grandmorin beside the track with his throat cut. It is also discovered that he has been robbed of his watch and some money.\n\nAn investigation is launched and Roubaud and S\u00e9verine are prime suspects, as they were on the train at the time and were due to inherit some property from Grandmorin. The authorities never suspect their true motive. Lantier sees Roubaud while waiting to be interviewed and identifies him as the murderer on the train, but when questioned, says he cannot be sure. The investigating magistrate, believing the killer was Cabuche, a carter who lived nearby, dismisses Roubaud and S\u00e9verine. The murder remains unsolved.\n\nDespite being cleared of suspicion, the marriage of Roubaud and S\u00e9verine declines. Zola casually tosses in a remark that the money and watch stolen from Grandmorin was hidden behind the skirting board in their apartment, thus confirming the reader\u2019s suspicion that Roubaud was the murderer all along. S\u00e9verine and Lantier begin an affair, at first clandestinely but then more blatantly until they are caught ''in flagrante delicto'' by Roubaud. Despite his previous jealousy, Roubaud seems unmoved and spends less and less time at home and turns to gambling and drink.\n\nS\u00e9verine admits to Lantier that Roubaud committed the murder and that together they disposed of the body. Lantier feels the return of his desire to kill and one morning leaves the apartment to kill the first woman he meets. After having picked a victim, he is seen by someone he knows, and so abandons the idea. He then realizes that he has the desire no longer. It is his relationship with S\u00e9verine and her association with the murder that has abated his desire.\n\nThe relationship between Roubaud and his wife deteriorates when she realizes that he has taken the last of the hidden money. Lantier has the opportunity to invest money in a friend's business venture in New York. S\u00e9verine suggests they use the money from the sale of the property they inherited from Grandmorin. Roubaud is now the only obstacle to this new life and they decide to kill him. They approach him one night when he is working as a watchman at the station, hoping that the murder will be attributed to robbers. At the last moment however, Lantier loses his nerve.\n\nCousin Flore, meanwhile, sees Lantier pass her house every day on the train and noticing S\u00e9verine with him, realizes they are having an affair and becomes insanely jealous, wishing to kill them both. She hatches a plot to remove a rail from the line in order to cause a derailment of his train. One morning she seizes the opportunity when Cabuche leaves his wagon and horses unattended, near the railway. She leads the horses onto the line shortly before the train arrives. In the resulting crash, numerous people are killed and Lantier is seriously injured. S\u00e9verine, however, remains unhurt. Wracked by guilt, Flore commits suicide by walking in front of a train.\n\nS\u00e9verine nurses Lantier back to health. She convinces him that they must kill Roubaud and Lantier finally gives in, and they concoct a plan to get away with it completely. However, Lantier's mania returns and when she tries to sleep with him just before Roubaud is due to arrive, he murders her. The unfortunate Cabuche is the first to find her body and is accused of killing her at the behest of Roubaud. Both are put on trial for this and the murder of Grandmorin. They are both convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nLantier begins driving again, but his new engine is just a number to him. He begins an affair with his fireman's girlfriend.\n\nThe novel ends as Lantier is driving a train carrying troops towards the front at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].

The story has been adapted for the cinema on several occasions.  The seventeenth book in Zola's ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'' series, it is based upon the railway between [[Paris]] and [[Le Havre]] in the 19th century and is a tense, [[psychological thriller]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe main characters are Roubaud, the deputy station master at Le Havre, his wife S\u00e9verine, and Jacques Lantier. Lantier is an engine driver on the line and the family link with the rest of ''Les Rougon-Macquart'' series. He is the son of Gervaise (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), the brother of \u00c9tienne Lantier (''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'') and Claude Lantier (''[[L'\u0152uvre]]''), and the half-brother of the eponymous [[Nana (novel)|Nana]].\n\n==Plot==\nLantier, the \"human beast\" of the title, has a hereditary madness and has several times in his life wanted to murder women. At the beginning of the story he is an engine driver, in control of his engine \"La Lison\". His relationship with \"La Lison\" is almost sexual and provides some degree of control over his mania.\n\nAs a result of a chance remark, Roubaud suspects that S\u00e9verine has had an affair some years earlier, with Grandmorin  one of the directors of the railway company, who had acted as her patron and who had helped Roubaud get his job. He forces a confession out of her and  makes her write a letter to Grandmorin telling him to take a particular train that evening, the same train Roubaud and S\u00e9verine are taking back to Le Havre.\n\nMeanwhile, Lantier who is not working while his engine is being repaired goes to visit his Aunt Phasie who lives in an isolated house by the railway. On leaving he meets his cousin Flore, with whom he has had a longstanding mutual attraction. After a brief conversation with her his passions become inflamed and he is on the verge of raping her but this in turn brings on his homicidal mania. He has a desire to stab her but just about controls himself and rushes away. Finding himself beside the railway track as the train from Paris passes, he sees, in a split second, a figure on the train holding a knife, bent over another person. Shortly after, he finds the body of Grandmorin beside the track with his throat cut. It was also discovered that he had been robbed of his watch and some money.\n\nAn investigation is launched and Roubaud and S\u00e9verine are prime suspects as they were on the train at the time and were due to inherit some property from Grandmorin. The authorities never suspect their true motive. Lantier sees Roubaud while waiting to be interviewed and identifies him as the murderer on the train, but when questioned says he cannot be sure. The investigating magistrate \u2014  believing the killer was Cabuche, a carter who lived nearby \u2014 dismisses Roubaud and S\u00e9verine. The murder remains unsolved.\n\nDespite being cleared of suspicion, the marriage of Roubaud and S\u00e9verine declines. Zola casually tosses in a remark that the money and watch stolen from Grandmorin was hidden behind the skirting  board in their apartment, thus confirming the reader\u2019s suspicion that Roubaud was the murderer all along. S\u00e9verine and Lantier begin an affair, at first clandestinely but then more blatantly until they are caught ''in flagrante delicto'' by Roubaud. Despite his previous jealousy, Roubaud seems unmoved and spends less and less time at home and turns to gambling and drink.\n\nS\u00e9verine admits to Lantier that Roubaud committed the murder and that together they disposed of the body. Lantier feels the return of his desire to kill and one morning leaves the apartment to kill the first woman he meets. After having picked a victim he is seen by someone he knows and so abandons the idea. He then realizes that he has the desire no longer. It is his relationship with S\u00e9verine and her association with the murder that has abated his desire.\n\nThe relationship between Roubaud and his wife deteriorates when she realizes that he has taken the last of the hidden money. Lantier has the opportunity to invest money in a friend\u2019s business venture in New York. S\u00e9verine suggests they use the money from the sale of the property they inherited from Grandmorin. Roubaud is now the only obstacle to this new life and they decide to kill him. They approach him one night when he is working as a watchman at the station, hoping that the murder will be attributed to robbers. At the last moment however, Lantier loses his nerve.\n\nCousin Flore, meanwhile, sees Lantier pass her house every day on the train and noticing S\u00e9verine with him, realizes they are having an affair and becomes insanely jealous, wishing to kill them both. She hatches a plot to remove a rail from the line in order to cause a derailment of his train. One morning she seizes the opportunity when Cabuche leaves his wagon and horses unattended by the railway. She drags the horses onto the line shortly before the train arrives. In the resulting crash, numerous people are killed and Lantier is seriously injured. S\u00e9verine, however, remains unhurt. Wracked by guilt, Flore commits suicide by walking in front of a train.\n\nS\u00e9verine nurses Lantier back to health. She convinces him that they must kill Roubaud and Lantier finally gives in, with them concocting a plan to get away with it completely. However, Lantier's mania returns and when she tries to sleep with him just before Roubaud is due to arrive, he murders her. The unfortunate Cabuche is the first to find her body and is accused of killing her at the behest of Roubaud. Both are put on trial for this and the murder of Grandmorin. They are both convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nLantier begins driving again but his new engine is just a number to him. He begins an affair with his fireman's girlfriend.\n\nThe novel ends as Lantier is driving a train carrying troops towards the front at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The resentment between Lantier and his fireman breaks out as the train is travelling at full steam. Both fall to their deaths as the train full of happy, drunken, patriotic and doomed soldiers hurtles driverless through the night.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n* 1890, ''La B\u00eate humaine'' (French), Paris: [[Biblioth\u00e8que-Charpentier]]\n* 1968, ''The Beast in Man'' (translated by [[Robert Godfrey Goodyear]] and [[P.J.R.

Among Ukrainian fans the most popular Ukrainian clubs are [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]].<ref name=UCPUI27813/> Other popular clubs include [[Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Chornomorets Odesa]].<ref name=UCPUI27813>[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/poll-40-of-ukrainians-consider-themselves-football-supporters-most-against-idea-of-cis-league/ Poll: 40% of Ukrainians consider themselves football supporters, most against idea of CIS league], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 August 2013)</ref>\n\n==General overview and format==\nThe [[2019\u201320 Ukrainian Premier League|2019\u201320]] season is the league's twelfth after the restructuring of professional club football in 2008 and the 29th season since establishing of professional club's competition independent from the [[Soviet Union]]. As of 2019, [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] is the reigning Ukrainian Premier League champion. To summarise, [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] won the first championship, while all the subsequent titles have gone to either [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] or [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Only 2 teams, [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] have participated in all previous 28 Ukrainian Top League competitions. The central feature of the league is a game between the same Dynamo and Shakhtar which is developed into the [[Klasychne derby|Klasychne]] (''Classic'').\n\nOn 15 April 2008 the new Premier-Liha (''Premier League'') was formed. The new sports organization consists of 12 football club organizations that take control of the league's operations under the statues of [[Football Federation of Ukraine]], [[UEFA]], and [[FIFA]]. With the new reorganization the format of the League was preserved, while the changes that were made were exclusively administrative. Competitions continued to be conducted in a [[double round robin]] format among 16 clubs. There were couple seasons when the 14-clubs league's composition was experimented. Since the 2014 Russian aggression, the league was reduced to 12 members, while its format also has changed. The season is still being played in a double round robin in the first half of a season, after which the league splits in half into two groups of six (6) teams. Both the top six and the bottom six play another a double round robin tournament with the clubs of own group. For 2019-20 there was also introduced post season play-off for qualification for the European club competitions.\n\nThe teams that reach the top ranks of the competition table at the end of each season as always gain the chance to represent [[Ukraine]] internationally in several prestigious tournaments (continental club tournaments). Also at the end of the season, the bottom clubs (usually two) are relegated to the [[Ukrainian First League|First League]] (part of the lower [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|Professional Football League]]) and replaced by the top clubs from that league. All the participants of the Premier League enter the [[Ukrainian Cup|National Cup]] competition and enter it at the round of 32 (1/16th of the final) or Round of 16 stage. Also the winner of the League at the beginning of every next season plays against the winner of the National Cup for the [[Ukrainian Super Cup]] (under administration of the Premier Liha). Beside Super Cup game and championship among senior teams of the league's clubs, the league also conducts competitions among junior teams including under 21 and under 19. The champion of the under 19 championship qualifies for the [[UEFA Youth League]].\n\n===Emblem===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n\n | image1 = Ukrainian Premier League.png\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = \n | link1 = \n | caption1  = <center>Old emblem</center>\n\n | image2 = \u041e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043c'\u0454\u0440-\u041b\u0456\u0433\u0438.png\n | width2 = 122\n | alt2 = \n | link2 = \n | caption2 = <center>New emblem</center>\n\n | image3 = \u041b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f \u041b\u0456\u0433\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0456-\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0447 (2016).png\n | width3 = 155\n | alt3 = \n | link3 = \n | caption3  = <center>Season's emblem in 2016<br>with Pari-Match as sponsor</center>\n\n | footer = \n}}\nThe old emblem depicts a [[Football (association football)|football]] that is wrapped around by the blue-yellow stripe (the national colors of [[Ukraine]]) on the blue background. Across the top and around the ball there are 16 stars that represent the league's participants (although in 2014 the league was shortened up to 14 teams the emblem was not changed). On the bottom the script says \"Premier-League - Union of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine\".\n\nAs the old emblem, the new emblem also contains 16 stars. For the 2016-17 season there was added the sponsor's name.\n\n===Season's format and regulations===\nSeason regulations is one of the two most important documents (other being the competition calendar) that are adopted by the Premier League prior to each season.\n\nPremier League directly organizes and conducts competitions among member clubs. Competitions are conducted on principle of \"Fair play\" and according to competitions calendar which is approved by the Premier League General Assembly and the FFU Executive Committee 30 days before start of competitions. Until 2019{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} all advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of games of championship and cup belong to the club that hosts them (the Super Cup of Ukraine and the \"Gold game\"). All advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of the game of Super Cup and the \"Gold game\". Before 2014 Premier League was also administering some rounds of the [[Ukrainian Cup]] (Round of 8, Quarterfinals, and Semifinals). The earlier rounds were administered by the Professional League and the final by the Federation. Since 2014 the organization of Ukrainian Cup competitions in full belongs exclusively to the Federation.\n\nThere are currently 12 club members of the league. All participants get approved by the Premier League General Assembly. Each club fields each team for senior competitions, and competitions for under 21 and under 19 teams (three teams). A club is required to have a stadium (registered with FFU) and an education and training facility (or center). A club is also obligated to finance its own youth sports institution and a complex scientific-methodical group as well as to own and finance a number of youth teams. A Premier League club needs to ensure participation of at least four youth teams (ages groups between 14 and 17) in the Youth Football League of Ukraine. A club cannot field more than one team for a certain competition.\n\nAll club's staff members (coaches, physicians, massage specialists) have to be contracted and be UEFA licensed. All coaches should have A-diploma, while head coaches - PRO-diploma. Football players are listed in \"A\" and \"B\" rosters. \"A\" roster contains no more than 25 players, while \"B\" roster has unlimited number of players no older than 21 who have professional contracts or agreements for sports training. The 25-players \"A\" roster includes the number of slots allotted for players developed by the club.\n\nDuring breaks in competitions in summer and winter there are two periods for registering players.\n\nBeside the main championship among senior teams, the Premier League also organizes youth championship which was adopted from the previous Vyshcha Liha championship of doubles (reserves). Since 2012 there was added another competition for junior teams, so the original youth championship was renamed into the Championship of U-21 teams and the new competition was named as the Championship of U-19 teams. Unlike the Championship of U-21 teams, in the Championship of U-19 teams beside all of the Premier League clubs' junior teams, there also compete teams of some lower leagues' clubs.\n\nThe league's championship among senior teams is conducted by manner of the [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] system in two cycles \"fall-spring\" with one game at home and another at opponent's field with each participant. A competition calendar is formed after a draw that is conducted based on the Premier League club rankings. The calendar of the second cycle repeats the first, while hosting teams are switched. There should be no less than two calendar days between official games of a club. All games take place between 12:00 and 22:00 local time. Any game postponement is allowed only in emergencies and on decision of the Premier League Administration (Dyrektsiya). Game forfeitures are controlled by technical win/loss nominations and fines, followed by additional sanctions of the FFU Control-Disciplinary Committee, and possible elimination from the league.\n\n===Competition calendar===\nClubs play each other twice (once at home and once away) in the 26-match season. The league begins in mid-July and ends in mid-June. After 13 rounds of fixtures, there is a winter break that lasts for three months (from early December to early March). Thus, the winter break is significantly longer than the interval between seasons. This schedule accounts for climatic conditions and matches that of most European leagues in terms of the beginning and the end of the season.\n\nThe [[1992 Ukrainian Premier League|first season]] of the League in 1992 was an exception, as it lasted only half a year. This was because the last [[Soviet Top League|Soviet league]] season ended in the autumn of 1991, and the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] decided to shift the calendar from \u201cspring-fall\u201d to \u201cfall-spring\u201d football seasons. In the inaugural season, 20 clubs were divided into two 10-team groups. In both groups, each club played each other twice, and the championship was decided by a play-off match between the group winners, in which [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] surprised the pre-season favorite [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].\n\nAfter the first season, in each of the following seasons each team played each other team in the League twice. The number of participating teams fluctuated between 14 and 18, stabilizing since [[2002\u201303 Ukrainian Premier League|2002\u201303 season]] at 16.\n\nAs of the [[2005\u201306 Ukrainian Premier League|2005\u201306 season]], the golden match rule was introduced. According to the rule, if the first two teams obtain the same number of points, the championship is to be decided by an additional \"golden\" match between the two teams. In fact, in that season [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] had earned the same number of points and Shakhtar won the championship by winning the golden match (2&ndash;1 after extra time).\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Football in Ukraine|Soviet Top League|Championship of the Ukrainian SSR|Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR}}\n\n===Vyshcha Liha and Professional Football League (1992\u20131999)===\nSince the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the inaugural independent championship took place hastily at the start of spring 1992 after the creation of the Ukrainian Higher League ({{lang-uk|\u0412\u0438\u0449\u0430 \u041b\u0456\u0433\u0430}}, Vyshcha Liha). The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of the eleven Ukrainian teams from the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the [[Ukrainian First League]] as they were to be relegated anyway. The two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were also placed in the Higher League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup which finished ninth in the same group (Soviet Second League B).\n\nThe 20 participants were split into two groups with the winners playing for the championship title and the runners-up playing for third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As expected, the five favorites, ''[[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]'', ''[[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]'', ''[[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]'', ''[[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]]'', and ''[[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]]'' finished at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] 1\u20130. The Crimeans earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far their only one), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka|Temp Shepetivka]].\n\nAfter being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in [[Lviv]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] were anxious to earn their first title at the second opportunity. In the second Ukrainian championship, which had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rivals of the Kyivians were [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], who were top after the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were neck and neck and at the end they finished with the same number of points. The championship title was awarded to [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had a better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'', nor the fact that [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] had a better head-to-head record was considered.\n\nThe next seven years were known as the total domination of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. During this period 'the main Soviet protagonists' had changed as some of the best teams were facing a crisis. After the [[1993\u201394 Ukrainian Premier League|1993\u201394]] season [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] were surprisingly relegated to the [[Ukrainian First League|First League]]. In the [[1995\u201396 Ukrainian Premier League|1995\u201396]] season [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] had the worst year in the club's history, coming tenth. [[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]] were relegated twice during that first decade after which manager [[Leonid Buryak]] was sacked. A few newly created teams have since emerged such as [[FC Arsenal Kyiv|Arsenal Kyiv]] and [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh Donetsk]], as well as [[FC Vorskla Poltava|Vorskla Poltava]], who surprisingly came third in the club's first season at the Top Level in the [[1996\u201397 Ukrainian Premier League|1997]].\n\n===Dynamo\u2013Shakhtar rivalry and Premier League (2000\u20132010)===\n{{see also|Ukrainian derby}}\nThe next decade was marked by fierce competition between [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Since 2000, [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] has proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning a place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to secure the [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players has become particularly acute and brought a series of court cases. The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming up with a plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of foreign players over time.\n\nThe clubs such as [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]], who were recent contenders for the title, had to put up a fierce fight against the newly established contenders [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh Donetsk]] and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] shone brightly in the late 2000s (decade) by consistently finishing right behind [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] in third place. Their most remarkable feat was their participation in the 2009 European season when they had to face [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] to earn a place in the quarter-finals of the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]], but lost on the away goals rule. That same [[2009 UEFA Cup Final|2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]] competition was won for the first time by [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], the first club of independent Ukraine to win the title. It was also the last UEFA cup title before it changed its name to the Europa league. In the 2008\u201309 season the league earned the highest [[UEFA coefficient#Current ranking|UEFA league coefficient]] in Europe for that season.\n\n[[File:Rakytskyy, Devich, Berezovchuk, Luiz Andriano, Fernandinho, Slyusar.jpg|thumb|Areal duel between players of Shakhtar and Metalist in September 2009 including [[Fernandinho (footballer, born May 1985)|Fernandinho]] and [[Marko Devic]]]]\nOn 15 November 2007 clubs' presidents of the Vyshcha Liha adopted a decision to create the Premier League (Premier Liha).<ref name=aftwad>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171118174829/http://www.upl.ua/news/view/1448 At first there was a decision...

Ukrainian Premier League. 16 November 2017</ref> At the same meeting session there was created a supervisory board that consisted of [[Ravil Safiullin]] (Professional Football League), [[Vitaliy Danilov]] (FC Kharkiv), [[Petro Dyminskyi]] (FC Karpaty), and [[Vadym Rabinovych]] (FC Arsenal).<ref name=aftwad/> During the next three months that body curated a process on creation of the Premier League's regulation and statute as well as a procedure of launching the championship starting from the 2008-09 season.<ref name=aftwad/> On 15 April 2008 at one of the meetings among the presidents of clubs there was signed a protocol about establishing the Association of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine \"Premier-Liha\"<ref name=aftwad/> as an autonomous entity, parting away from the PFL. The Premier League has been split since the moment it was created in regards to its president. The dispute went as far as even canceling the 13th round of [[2009\u201310 Ukrainian Premier League|2009\u201310 season]] and moving it to the spring half, while having the 14th round still playing in the fall. The representatives of five clubs: [[FC Arsenal Kyiv|Arsenal Kyiv]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], [[FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih|Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih]], and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] have been boycotting most of the League meetings, not complying with its financial obligations and giving the broadcasting rights to TV-channels other than the League official supplier. They justified their actions due to what they deem to be the illegal election of the Premier League president. The representatives of the above-mentioned clubs did not recognize the election in 2008 of [[Vitaliy Danilov]] as the president and believed that the elections should have been won by [[Vadim Rabinovich]].\n\nTo resolve this conflict [[Vitaliy Danilov]] instigated the re-election of the Premier League president in September 2009, and on 1 December 2009 won the election again with 11 clubs voting for his candidature, 3 were against, 1 abstained, and 1 was absent. This time most club presidents of the Premier League of Ukraine acknowledged [[Vitaliy Danilov]] legality. In the subsequent elections on 9 December 2011 [[Vitaliy Danilov]] was challenged by Andriy Kurhanskyi (through the proposal of [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]]). The other available candidates, Miletiy Balchos (president of the Professional Football League of Ukraine) and Yuriy Kindzerskyi, were not picked by any members of the Premier League. [[Vitaliy Danilov]] managed to retain his seat with nine votes for him.\n\n===New challenges of the Premier League (2011\u2013present) ===\nStarting from 2010 and until 2015, FC Shakhtar led by Romanian coach [[Mircea Lucescu]] obtained five national league titles in a row and making Lucescu the most successful coach in the league. In the 2013-14 season FC Dynamo for the first time since Ukrainian independence placed fourth in league's season ranking and led to dismissal of former national team coach and the legend of Soviet football [[Oleh Blokhin]] as the club's manager.\n\n[[File:Shakhtar Donetsk 2017.jpg|thumb|The 2017 Liha Pari-Match champions [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] with a pennant (Hrayemo Chesno, We Play

The rivalry started ever since the end of 1990s when both teams started consistently to place the top two places from season to season. The rivalry became really established when Shakhtar obtained its first national title in 2002.\n\n===Other championship contenders===\nThe surprising win of the first season by [[SC Tavriya Simferopol]] has never turned the club into a real contender for another title and the club was not always successful to secure a place among the top five. In the beginning of 1990s, [[FC Chornomorets Odessa]] and the two-time Soviet champions [[FC Dnipro]] were also among the main contenders. The 1972 Soviet champions [[FC Zorya Luhansk]] until 2013 really struggled to stay in the top league. Among other contenders there were [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]] that were the league's runners-up in 2012\u201313 and [[FC Metalurh Donetsk]] that showed some consistent form in the early 2000s.\n\n===Other rivalries===\nThere are few smaller regional rivalries such between Karpaty and Volyn, Metalist and Dnipro, Zorya and Shakhtar.\n\nAmong city derbies, there were no running city derbies in the league for the 2017\u201318 season. Among the most notable previously there were [[Zaporizhia derby]] between Metalurh and Torpedo, [[Kyiv derby]] between Dynamo and Arsenal (CSKA), [[Donetsk derby]] between Shakhtar and Metalurh. Other derbies existed in Lviv, Odesa, Kharkiv, [[West Ukrainian football derby]] and others.\n\n==Stadiums and attendance==\n{{more|List of football stadiums in Ukraine}}\nUkraine has several big stadiums with capacity of 30,000+ spectators and at least two stadiums with capacity of over 50,000 which also are considered to be by UEFA the elite stadiums.

Three of Ukrainian clubs reached European club competitions finals including Dynamo (as Soviet club), Shakhtar and [[FC Dnipro|Dnipro]]. Among Ukrainian fans the most popular Ukrainian clubs are [[Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[Shakhtar Donetsk]].<ref name=UCPUI27813/> Other popular clubs include [[Karpaty Lviv]] and [[Chornomorets Odesa]].<ref name=UCPUI27813>[http://www.interfax.co.uk/ukraine-news/poll-40-of-ukrainians-consider-themselves-football-supporters-most-against-idea-of-cis-league/ Poll: 40% of Ukrainians consider themselves football supporters, most against idea of CIS league], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (27 August 2013)</ref>\n\n==General overview and format==\nThe [[2019\u201320 Ukrainian Premier League|2019\u201320]] season is the league's twelfth after the restructuring of professional club football in 2008 and the 29th season since establishing of professional club's competition independent from the [[Soviet Union]]. As of 2019, [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] is the reigning Ukrainian Premier League champion. To summarise, [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] won the first championship, while all the subsequent titles have gone to either [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] or [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Only 2 teams, [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] have participated in all previous 28 Ukrainian Top League competitions. The central feature of the league is a game between the same Dynamo and Shakhtar which is developed into the [[Klasychne derby|Klasychne]] (''Classic'').\n\nOn 15 April 2008 the new Premier-Liha (''Premier League'') was formed. The new sports organization consists of 12 football club organizations that take control of the league's operations under the statues of [[Football Federation of Ukraine]], [[UEFA]], and [[FIFA]]. With the new reorganization the format of the League was preserved, while the changes that were made were exclusively administrative. Competitions continued to be conducted in a [[double round robin]] format among 16 clubs. There were couple seasons when the 14-clubs league's composition was experimented. Since the 2014 Russian aggression, the league was reduced to 12 members, while its format also has changed. The season is still being played in a double round robin in the first half of a season, after which the league splits in half into two groups of six (6) teams. Both the top six and the bottom six play another a double round robin tournament with the clubs of own group. For 2019-20 there was also introduced post season play-off for qualification for the European club competitions.\n\nThe teams that reach the top ranks of the competition table at the end of each season as always gain the chance to represent [[Ukraine]] internationally in several prestigious tournaments (continental club tournaments). Also at the end of the season, the bottom clubs (usually two) are relegated to the [[Ukrainian First League|First League]] (part of the lower [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|Professional Football League]]) and replaced by the top clubs from that league. All the participants of the Premier League enter the [[Ukrainian Cup|National Cup]] competition and enter it at the round of 32 (1/16th of the final) or Round of 16 stage. Also the winner of the League at the beginning of every next season plays against the winner of the National Cup for the [[Ukrainian Super Cup]] (under administration of the Premier Liha). Beside Super Cup game and championship among senior teams of the league's clubs, the league also conducts competitions among junior teams including under 21 and under 19. The champion of the under 19 championship qualifies for the [[UEFA Youth League]].\n\n===Emblem===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n\n | image1 = Ukrainian Premier League.png\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = \n | link1 = \n | caption1  = <center>Old emblem</center>\n\n | image2 = \u041e\u0444\u0456\u0446\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0435\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043c'\u0454\u0440-\u041b\u0456\u0433\u0438.png\n | width2 = 122\n | alt2 = \n | link2 = \n | caption2 = <center>New emblem</center>\n\n | image3 = \u041b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043f \u041b\u0456\u0433\u0438 \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0456-\u041c\u0430\u0442\u0447 (2016).png\n | width3 = 155\n | alt3 = \n | link3 = \n | caption3  = <center>Season's emblem in 2016<br>with Pari-Match as sponsor</center>\n\n | footer = \n}}\nThe old emblem depicts a [[Football (association football)|football]] that is wrapped around by the blue-yellow stripe (the national colors of [[Ukraine]]) on the blue background. Across the top and around the ball there are 16 stars that represent the league's participants (although in 2014 the league was shortened up to 14 teams the emblem was not changed). On the bottom the script says \"Premier-League - Union of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine\".\n\nAs the old emblem, the new emblem also contains 16 stars. For the 2016-17 season there was added the sponsor's name.\n\n===Season's format and regulations===\nSeason regulations is one of the two most important documents (other being the competition calendar) that are adopted by the Premier League prior to each season.\n\nPremier League directly organizes and conducts competitions among member clubs. Competitions are conducted on principle of \"Fair play\" and according to competitions calendar which is approved by the Premier League General Assembly and the FFU Executive Committee 30 days before start of competitions. Until 2019{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} all advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of games of championship and cup belong to the club that hosts them (the Super Cup of Ukraine and the \"Gold game\"). All advertisement, commercial rights and rights on TV and radio broadcasting of the game of Super Cup and the \"Gold game\". Before 2014 Premier League was also administering some rounds of the [[Ukrainian Cup]] (Round of 8, Quarterfinals, and Semifinals). The earlier rounds were administered by the Professional League and the final by the Federation. Since 2014 the organization of Ukrainian Cup competitions in full belongs exclusively to the Federation.\n\nThere are currently 12 club members of the league. All participants get approved by the Premier League General Assembly. Each club fields each team for senior competitions, and competitions for under 21 and under 19 teams (three teams). A club is required to have a stadium (registered with FFU) and an education and training facility (or center). A club is also obligated to finance its own youth sports institution and a complex scientific-methodical group as well as to own and finance a number of youth teams. A Premier League club needs to ensure participation of at least four youth teams (ages groups between 14 and 17) in the Youth Football League of Ukraine. A club cannot field more than one team for a certain competition.\n\nAll club's staff members (coaches, physicians, massage specialists) have to be contracted and be UEFA licensed. All coaches should have A-diploma, while head coaches - PRO-diploma. Football players are listed in \"A\" and \"B\" rosters. \"A\" roster contains no more than 25 players, while \"B\" roster has unlimited number of players no older than 21 who have professional contracts or agreements for sports training. The 25-players \"A\" roster includes the number of slots allotted for players developed by the club.\n\nDuring breaks in competitions in summer and winter there are two periods for registering players.\n\nBeside the main championship among senior teams, the Premier League also organizes youth championship which was adopted from the previous Vyshcha Liha championship of doubles (reserves). Since 2012 there was added another competition for junior teams, so the original youth championship was renamed into the Championship of U-21 teams and the new competition was named as the Championship of U-19 teams. Unlike the Championship of U-21 teams, in the Championship of U-19 teams beside all of the Premier League clubs' junior teams, there also compete teams of some lower leagues' clubs.\n\nThe league's championship among senior teams is conducted by manner of the [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] system in two cycles \"fall-spring\" with one game at home and another at opponent's field with each participant. A competition calendar is formed after a draw that is conducted based on the Premier League club rankings. The calendar of the second cycle repeats the first, while hosting teams are switched. There should be no less than two calendar days between official games of a club. All games take place between 12:00 and 22:00 local time. Any game postponement is allowed only in emergencies and on decision of the Premier League Administration (Dyrektsiya). Game forfeitures are controlled by technical win/loss nominations and fines, followed by additional sanctions of the FFU Control-Disciplinary Committee, and possible elimination from the league.\n\n===Competition calendar===\nClubs play each other twice (once at home and once away) in the 26-match season. The league begins in mid-July and ends in mid-June. After 13 rounds of fixtures, there is a winter break that lasts for three months (from early December to early March). Thus, the winter break is significantly longer than the interval between seasons. This schedule accounts for climatic conditions and matches that of most European leagues in terms of the beginning and the end of the season.\n\nThe [[1992 Ukrainian Premier League|first season]] of the League in 1992 was an exception, as it lasted only half a year. This was because the last [[Soviet Top League|Soviet league]] season ended in the autumn of 1991, and the [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] decided to shift the calendar from \u201cspring-fall\u201d to \u201cfall-spring\u201d football seasons. In the inaugural season, 20 clubs were divided into two 10-team groups. In both groups, each club played each other twice, and the championship was decided by a play-off match between the group winners, in which [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] surprised the pre-season favorite [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].\n\nAfter the first season, in each of the following seasons each team played each other team in the League twice. The number of participating teams fluctuated between 14 and 18, stabilizing since [[2002\u201303 Ukrainian Premier League|2002\u201303 season]] at 16.\n\nAs of the [[2005\u201306 Ukrainian Premier League|2005\u201306 season]], the golden match rule was introduced. According to the rule, if the first two teams obtain the same number of points, the championship is to be decided by an additional \"golden\" match between the two teams. In fact, in that season [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] had earned the same number of points and Shakhtar won the championship by winning the golden match (2&ndash;1 after extra time).\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Football in Ukraine|Soviet Top League|Championship of the Ukrainian SSR|Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR}}\n\n===Vyshcha Liha and Professional Football League (1992\u20131999)===\nSince the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], the inaugural independent championship took place hastily at the start of spring 1992 after the creation of the Ukrainian Higher League ({{lang-uk|\u0412\u0438\u0449\u0430 \u041b\u0456\u0433\u0430}}, Vyshcha Liha). The League was created out of the six teams that took part in the [[Soviet Top League]], two teams from the [[Soviet First League]], and nine out of the eleven Ukrainian teams from the [[Soviet Second League]]. The other two of that eleven were placed in the [[Ukrainian First League]] as they were to be relegated anyway. The two best teams of the [[Soviet Second League B]] of the ''Ukrainian Zone'' were also placed in the Higher League along with the winner of the 1991 Ukrainian Cup which finished ninth in the same group (Soviet Second League B).\n\nThe 20 participants were split into two groups with the winners playing for the championship title and the runners-up playing for third place. Three teams from each group were to be relegated. As expected, the five favorites, ''[[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]'', ''[[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]]'', ''[[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]'', ''[[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]]'', and ''[[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]]'' finished at the top of each group. In the championship play-off game in [[Lviv]], a sensation took place as [[SC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol]] beat [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] 1\u20130. The Crimeans earned the first Ukrainian title (thus far their only one), losing only once to [[FC Temp Shepetivka|Temp Shepetivka]].\n\nAfter being stunned in the first championship by the ''tragedy'' in [[Lviv]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] were anxious to earn their first title at the second opportunity. In the second Ukrainian championship, which had a regular League format of 16 teams, the main rivals of the Kyivians were [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], who were top after the first half of the season. By the end of the season both teams were neck and neck and at the end they finished with the same number of points. The championship title was awarded to [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] as they had a better goal difference. Neither the ''Golden match'', nor the fact that [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] had a better head-to-head record was considered.\n\nThe next seven years were known as the total domination of [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]]. During this period 'the main Soviet protagonists' had changed as some of the best teams were facing a crisis. After the [[1993\u201394 Ukrainian Premier League|1993\u201394]] season [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] were surprisingly relegated to the [[Ukrainian First League|First League]]. In the [[1995\u201396 Ukrainian Premier League|1995\u201396]] season [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] had the worst year in the club's history, coming tenth. [[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]] were relegated twice during that first decade after which manager [[Leonid Buryak]] was sacked. A few newly created teams have since emerged such as [[FC Arsenal Kyiv|Arsenal Kyiv]] and [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh Donetsk]], as well as [[FC Vorskla Poltava|Vorskla Poltava]], who surprisingly came third in the club's first season at the Top Level in the [[1996\u201397 Ukrainian Premier League|1997]].\n\n===Dynamo\u2013Shakhtar rivalry and Premier League (2000\u20132010)===\n{{see also|Ukrainian derby}}\nThe next decade was marked by fierce competition between [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Since 2000, [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] has proved to be the real challengers to Kiev's dominance. In 2000 Shakhtar earned their first qualification to the Champions League earning a place in the Group stage. Nonetheless, [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] is still considered to be the benchmark of excellence in the country and the primary feeder to the Ukrainian national football team. 2002 became the real cornerstone in the ''miners'' history when they earned their first national title under the management of the newly appointed Italian specialist, [[Nevio Scala]], who managed to secure the [[Ukrainian Cup]] title as well. Since that time the issue of foreign players has become particularly acute and brought a series of court cases. The [[Football Federation of Ukraine|FFU]] and [[Professional Football League of Ukraine|PFL]] worked together to solve that issue, coming up with a plan to force the ''transitional'' limitation of foreign players over time.\n\nThe clubs such as [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[FC Chornomorets Odesa|Chornomorets Odesa]], who were recent contenders for the title, had to put up a fierce fight against the newly established contenders [[FC Metalurh Donetsk|Metalurh Donetsk]] and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] to qualify for the European competitions. [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] shone brightly in the late 2000s (decade) by consistently finishing right behind [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] and [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]] in third place. Their most remarkable feat was their participation in the 2009 European season when they had to face [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]] to earn a place in the quarter-finals of the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]], but lost on the away goals rule. That same [[2009 UEFA Cup Final|2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]] competition was won for the first time by [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]], the first club of independent Ukraine to win the title. It was also the last UEFA cup title before it changed its name to the Europa league. In the 2008\u201309 season the league earned the highest [[UEFA coefficient#Current ranking|UEFA league coefficient]] in Europe for that season.\n\n[[File:Rakytskyy, Devich, Berezovchuk, Luiz Andriano, Fernandinho, Slyusar.jpg|thumb|Areal duel between players of Shakhtar and Metalist in September 2009 including [[Fernandinho (footballer, born May 1985)|Fernandinho]] and [[Marko Devic]]]]\nOn 15 November 2007 clubs' presidents of the Vyshcha Liha adopted a decision to create the Premier League (Premier Liha).<ref name=aftwad>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171118174829/http://www.upl.ua/news/view/1448 At first there was a decision...

Ukrainian Premier League. 16 November 2017</ref> At the same meeting session there was created a supervisory board that consisted of [[Ravil Safiullin]] (Professional Football League), [[Vitaliy Danilov]] (FC Kharkiv), [[Petro Dyminskyi]] (FC Karpaty), and [[Vadym Rabinovych]] (FC Arsenal).<ref name=aftwad/> During the next three months that body curated a process on creation of the Premier League's regulation and statute as well as a procedure of launching the championship starting from the 2008-09 season.<ref name=aftwad/> On 15 April 2008 at one of the meetings among the presidents of clubs there was signed a protocol about establishing the Association of Professional Football Clubs of Ukraine \"Premier-Liha\"<ref name=aftwad/> as an autonomous entity, parting away from the PFL. The Premier League has been split since the moment it was created in regards to its president. The dispute went as far as even canceling the 13th round of [[2009\u201310 Ukrainian Premier League|2009\u201310 season]] and moving it to the spring half, while having the 14th round still playing in the fall. The representatives of five clubs: [[FC Arsenal Kyiv|Arsenal Kyiv]], [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], [[FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]], [[FC Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih|Kryvbas Kryvyi Rih]], and [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] have been boycotting most of the League meetings, not complying with its financial obligations and giving the broadcasting rights to TV-channels other than the League official supplier. They justified their actions due to what they deem to be the illegal election of the Premier League president. The representatives of the above-mentioned clubs did not recognize the election in 2008 of [[Vitaliy Danilov]] as the president and believed that the elections should have been won by [[Vadim Rabinovich]].\n\nTo resolve this conflict [[Vitaliy Danilov]] instigated the re-election of the Premier League president in September 2009, and on 1 December 2009 won the election again with 11 clubs voting for his candidature, 3 were against, 1 abstained, and 1 was absent. This time most club presidents of the Premier League of Ukraine acknowledged [[Vitaliy Danilov]] legality. In the subsequent elections on 9 December 2011 [[Vitaliy Danilov]] was challenged by Andriy Kurhanskyi (through the proposal of [[FC Karpaty Lviv|Karpaty Lviv]]). The other available candidates, Miletiy Balchos (president of the Professional Football League of Ukraine) and Yuriy Kindzerskyi, were not picked by any members of the Premier League. [[Vitaliy Danilov]] managed to retain his seat with nine votes for him.\n\n===New challenges of the Premier League (2011\u2013present) ===\nStarting from 2010 and until 2015, FC Shakhtar led by Romanian coach [[Mircea Lucescu]] obtained five national league titles in a row and making Lucescu the most successful coach in the league. In the 2013-14 season FC Dynamo for the first time since Ukrainian independence placed fourth in league's season ranking and led to dismissal of former national team coach and the legend of Soviet football [[Oleh Blokhin]] as the club's manager.\n\n[[File:Shakhtar Donetsk 2017.jpg|thumb|The 2017 Liha Pari-Match champions [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] with a pennant (Hrayemo Chesno, We Play

The rivalry started ever since the end of 1990s when both teams started consistently to place the top two places from season to season. The rivalry became really established when Shakhtar obtained its first national title in 2002.\n\n===Other championship contenders===\nThe surprising win of the first season by [[SC Tavriya Simferopol]] has never turned the club into a real contender for another title and the club was not always successful to secure a place among the top five. In the beginning of 1990s, [[FC Chornomorets Odessa]] and the two-time Soviet champions [[FC Dnipro]] were also among the main contenders. The 1972 Soviet champions [[FC Zorya Luhansk]] until 2013 really struggled to stay in the top league. Among other contenders there were [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]] that were the league's runners-up in 2012\u201313 and [[FC Metalurh Donetsk]] that showed some consistent form in the early 2000s.\n\n===Other rivalries===\nThere are few smaller regional rivalries such between Karpaty and Volyn, Metalist and Dnipro, Zorya and Shakhtar.\n\nAmong city derbies, there were no running city derbies in the league for the 2017\u201318 season. Among the most notable previously there were [[Zaporizhia derby]] between Metalurh and Torpedo, [[Kyiv derby]] between Dynamo and Arsenal (CSKA), [[Donetsk derby]] between Shakhtar and Metalurh.

A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation]]s on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> A binary operation on {{mvar|F}} is a mapping {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}}, that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of ''F'' a uniquely determined element of {{mvar|F}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=16}}</ref> The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].</ref> One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation (the multiplicative inverse), and two constants {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (\u22121)}} and {{math|1=&minus;''a'' = (&minus;1)''a''}}.<ref group=nb>The a priori twofold use of the symbol \"\u2212\" for denoting one part of a constant and for the additive inverses is justified by this latter condition.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{main|Rational number}}\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}.

Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}. Equivalently {{math|''E''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that contains {{math|1}}, and is closed under addition, multiplication, additive inverse and multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element. This means that {{math|1 \u220a ''E''}}, that for all {{math|''a'', ''b'' \u220a ''E''}} both {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} and {{math|''a'' \u00b7 ''b''}} are in {{math|''E''}}, and that for all {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''E''}}, both {{math|\u2013''a''}} and {{math|1/''a''}} are in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n[[Field homomorphism]]s are maps {{math|''f'': ''E'' &rarr; ''F''}} between two fields such that {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub> + ''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>) + ''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, {{math|1=''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>) = ''f''(''e''<sub>1</sub>)''f''(''e''<sub>2</sub>)}}, and {{math|1=''f''(1<sub>E</sub>) = 1<sub>F</sub>}}, where {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''e''<sub>2</sub>}} are arbitrary elements of {{math|''E''}}.

Any field {{math|''F''}} contains a prime field. If the characteristic of {{math|''F''}} is {{math|''p''}} (a prime number), the prime field is isomorphic to the finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} introduced below. Otherwise the prime field is isomorphic to {{math|'''Q'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=p. 12}}</ref>\n\n==Finite fields==\n{{main|Finite field}}\n''Finite fields'' (also called ''Galois fields'') are fields with finitely many elements, whose number is also referred to as the order of the field. The above introductory example {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} is a field with four elements. Its subfield {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} is the smallest field, because by definition a field has at least two distinct elements {{math|1 \u2260 0}}.\n\n[[File:Clock_group.svg|thumb|In modular arithmetic modulo&nbsp;12, 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 since 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;13 in {{math|'''Z'''}}, which divided by 12 leaves remainder&nbsp;1. However, {{math|'''Z'''/12'''Z'''}} is not a field because 12 is not a prime number.]]\nThe simplest finite fields, with prime order, are most directly accessible using [[modular arithmetic]]. For a fixed positive integer {{math|''n''}}, arithmetic \"modulo {{math|''n''}}\" means to work with the numbers\n:{{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' = {0, 1, ..., ''n'' \u2212 1}.}}\nThe addition and multiplication on this set are done by performing the operation in question in the set {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, dividing by {{math|''n''}} and taking the remainder as result. This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are in {{math|''R''}}, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;{{math|\u2265}}. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\u221e}}) is zero.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Field !! Metric !! Completion !! zero sequence\n|-\n| {{math|'''Q'''}} || {{math|<nowiki>|</nowiki> ''x'' \u2013 ''y'' <nowiki>|</nowiki>}} (usual [[absolute value]]) || '''R''' || {{math|1/''n''}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''Q'''}} \n|| obtained using the [[p-adic valuation|''p''-adic valuation]], for a prime number {{math|''p''}}\n|| {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} ([[p-adic number|{{math|''p''}}-adic numbers]])\n|| {{math|''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|-\n| {{math|''F''(''t'')}}<br/> ({{math|''F''}} any field)\n|| obtained using the {{math|''t''}}-adic valuation\n|| {{math|''F''((''t''))}}\n|| {{math|''t''<sup>''n''</sup>}}\n|}\n\nThe field {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is used in number theory and [[p-adic analysis|{{math|''p''}}-adic analysis]]. The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields. On the other hand, these two fields, also called Archimedean local fields, share little similarity with the local fields considered here, to a point that {{harvtxt|Cassels|1986|loc=p. vi}} calls them \"completely anomalous\".</ref>\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic zero)\n* finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, the field of Laurent series over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} (local fields of characteristic {{math|''p''}}).\n\nThese two types of local fields share some fundamental similarities. In this relation, the elements {{math|''p'' \u2208 '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|''t'' \u2208 '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}} (referred to as [[uniformizer]]) correspond to each other. The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F'' \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem.

By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]].

[[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F'').

A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles).

In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical. It can be deduced from the [[hairy ball theorem]] illustrated at the right.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Wikibooks|Abstract algebra|Fields}}\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Citation|title=Introduction to Field Theory| last=Adamson|first=I.

A field is thus a fundamental [[algebraic structure]] which is widely used in [[algebra]], [[number theory]], and many other areas of mathematics.\n\nThe best known fields are the field of [[rational number]]s, the field of [[real number]]s and the field of [[complex number]]s. Many other fields, such as [[field of rational functions|fields of rational functions]], [[algebraic function field]]s, [[algebraic number field]]s, and [[p-adic number|''p''-adic fields]] are commonly used and studied in mathematics, particularly in number theory and [[algebraic geometry]]. Most [[cryptographic protocol]]s rely on [[finite field]]s, i.e., fields with finitely many [[element (set)|elements]].\n\nThe relation of two fields is expressed by the notion of a [[field extension]]. [[Galois theory]], initiated by [[\u00c9variste Galois]] in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions. Among other results, this theory shows that [[angle trisection]] and [[squaring the circle]] cannot be done with a [[compass and straightedge]]. Moreover, it shows that [[quintic equation]]s are algebraically unsolvable.\n\nFields serve as foundational notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of [[mathematical analysis]], which are based on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] for a [[vector space]], which is the standard general context for [[linear algebra]]. [[Number field]]s, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in [[number theory]]. [[Function field of an algebraic variety|Function fields]] can help describe properties of geometric objects.\n\n== Definition ==\nInformally, a field is a set, along with two [[binary operation|operation]]s defined on that set: an addition operation written as {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}, and a multiplication operation written as {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}, both of which behave similarly as they behave for [[rational number]]s and [[real number]]s, including the existence of an [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''a''}} for all elements {{mvar|a}}, and of a [[multiplicative inverse]] {{math|''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}} for every nonzero element {{mvar|b}}. This allows one to also consider the so-called ''inverse'' operations of [[Subtraction#Real numbers|subtraction]], {{math|''a'' &minus; ''b''}}, and [[Division (mathematics)|division]], {{math|''a'' / ''b''}}, by defining:\n:{{math|1=''a'' &minus; ''b'' = ''a'' + (&minus;''b'')}},\n:{{math|1=''a'' / ''b'' = ''a'' \u00b7 ''b''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.\n\n===Classic definition===\n\nFormally, a field is a [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{math|''F''}} together with two [[binary operation]]s on {{mvar|F}} called ''addition'' and ''multiplication''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=Definition 4.1.1, p.&nbsp;181}}</ref> A binary operation on {{mvar|F}} is a mapping {{math|''F'' &times; ''F'' &rarr; ''F''}}, that is, a correspondence that associates with each ordered pair of elements of ''F'' a uniquely determined element of {{mvar|F}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|McCoy|1968|p=16}}</ref> The result of the addition of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the sum of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''a'' + ''b''}}. Similarly, the result of the multiplication of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} is called the product of {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}}, and is denoted {{math|''ab''}} or {{math|''a'' \u22c5 ''b''}}. These operations are required to satisfy the following properties, referred to as ''[[Axiom#Non-logical axioms|field axioms]]''. In these axioms, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are arbitrary [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the field {{mvar|F}}.\n\n* [[Associativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' \u00b7 ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') \u00b7 ''c''}}.\n* [[Commutativity]] of addition and multiplication: {{math|1=''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a''}}, and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''b'' = ''b'' \u00b7 ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive identity|Additive]] and [[multiplicative identity]]: there exist two different elements {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} in {{math|''F''}} such that {{math|1=''a'' + 0 = ''a''}} and {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 1 = ''a''}}.\n* [[Additive inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted {{math|\u2212''a''}}, called the ''additive inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' + (\u2212''a'') = 0}}.\n* [[Multiplicative inverse]]s: for every {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}} in {{math|''F''}}, there exists an element in {{math|''F''}}, denoted by {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} or {{math|1/''a''}}, called the ''multiplicative inverse'' of ''a'', such that {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> = 1}}.\n* [[Distributivity]] of multiplication over addition: {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' \u00b7 ''b'') + (''a'' \u00b7 ''c'')}}.\n\nThis may be summarized by saying: a field has two operations, called addition and multiplication; it is an [[abelian group]] under addition with 0 as the additive identity; the nonzero elements are an abelian group under multiplication with 1 as the multiplicative identity; and multiplication distributes over addition.\n\n===Alternative definition===\nFields can also be defined in different, but equivalent ways. One can alternatively define a field by four binary operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and their required properties. [[Division by zero]] is, by definition, excluded.<ref>{{harvtxt|Clark|1984|loc=Chapter 3}}.</ref> In order to avoid [[existential quantifier]]s, fields can be defined by two binary operations (addition and multiplication), two unary operations (yielding the additive and multiplicative inverses respectively), and two [[arity#Nullary|nullary]] operations (the constants {{math|0}} and {{math|1}}). These operations are then subject to the conditions above. Avoiding existential quantifiers is important in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[computing]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mines|Richman|Ruitenburg|1988|loc=\u00a7II.2}}. See also [[Heyting field]].</ref> One may equivalently define a field by the same two binary operations, one unary operation (the multiplicative inverse), and two constants {{math|1}} and {{math|\u22121}}, since {{math|1=0 = 1 + (\u22121)}} and {{math|1=&minus;''a'' = (&minus;1)''a''}}.<ref group=nb>The a priori twofold use of the symbol \"\u2212\" for denoting one part of a constant and for the additive inverses is justified by this latter condition.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Rational numbers===\n{{main|Rational number}}\nRational numbers have been widely used a long time before the elaboration of the concept of field.\nThey are numbers that can be written as [[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]\n{{math|''a''/''b''}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are [[integer]]s, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. The additive inverse of such a fraction is {{math|\u2212''a''/''b''}}, and the multiplicative inverse (provided that {{math|''a'' \u2260 0}}) is {{math|''b''/''a''}}, which can be seen as follows:\n\n: <math> \\frac b a \\cdot \\frac a b = \\frac{ba}{ab} = 1.</math>\n\nThe abstractly required field axioms reduce to standard properties of rational numbers. For example, the law of distributivity can be proven as follows:<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref>\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac a b \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d + \\frac e f \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b  \\cdot \\left(\\frac c d  \\cdot \\frac f f + \\frac e f \\cdot \\frac d d \\right) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{cf}{df} + \\frac{ed}{fd}\\right) = \\frac{a}{b} \\cdot \\frac{cf + ed}{df} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac{a(cf + ed)}{bdf} = \\frac{acf}{bdf} +  \\frac{aed}{bdf} = \\frac{ac}{bd} +  \\frac{ae}{bf} \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac c d + \\frac a b \\cdot \\frac e f.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Real and complex numbers===\n\n[[File:Complex_multi.svg|thumb|255px|The multiplication of complex numbers can be visualized geometrically by rotations and scalings.]]\n\n{{main|Real number| Complex number}}\nThe [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication, also form a field. The [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}} consist of expressions\n:{{math|''a'' + ''bi'',}} with {{math|''a'', ''b''}} real,\nwhere {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], i.e., a (non-real) number satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\nAddition and multiplication of real numbers are defined in such a way that expressions of this type satisfy all field axioms and thus hold for {{math|'''C'''}}. For example, the distributive law enforces\n:{{math|1=(''a'' + ''bi'')(''c'' + ''di'') = ''ac'' + ''bci'' + ''adi'' + ''bdi''<sup>2</sup> = ''ac''\u2212''bd'' + (''bc'' + ''ad'')''i''.}}\nIt is immediate that this is again an expression of the above type, and so the complex numbers form a field. Complex numbers can be geometrically represented as points in the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], with [[Cartesian coordinates]] given by the real numbers of their describing expression, or as the arrows from the origin to these points, specified by their length and an angle enclosed with some distinct direction. Addition then corresponds to combining the arrows to the intuitive parallelogram (adding the Cartesian coordinates), and the multiplication is &ndash;less intuitively&ndash; combining rotating and scaling of the arrows (adding the angles and multiplying the lengths). The fields of real and complex numbers are used throughout mathematics, physics, engineering, statistics, and many other scientific disciplines.\n\n===Constructible numbers===\n[[File:Root_construction_geometric_mean5.svg|thumb|255px|The [[geometric mean theorem]] asserts that {{math|1=''h''<sup>2</sup> = ''pq''}}. Choosing {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1}} allows construction of the square root of a given constructible number {{math|''p''}}.]]\n{{main|Constructible numbers}}\n \nIn antiquity, several geometric problems concerned the (in)feasibility of constructing certain numbers with [[compass and straightedge]]. For example, it was unknown to the Greeks that it is in general impossible to trisect a given angle in this way. These problems can be settled using the field of [[constructible numbers]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Chapter 13.4}}</ref> Real constructible numbers are, by definition, lengths of line segments that can be constructed from the points 0 and 1 in finitely many steps using only [[compass]] and [[straightedge]]. These numbers, endowed with the field operations of real numbers, restricted to the constructible numbers, form a field, which properly includes the field {{math|'''Q'''}} of rational numbers. The illustration shows the construction of [[square root]]s of constructible numbers, not necessarily contained within {{math|'''Q'''}}. Using the labeling in the illustration, construct the segments {{math|''AB''}}, {{math|''BD''}}, and a [[semicircle]] over {{math|''AD''}} (center at the [[midpoint]] {{math|''C''}}), which intersects the [[perpendicular]] line through {{math|''B''}} in a point {{math|''F''}}, at a distance of exactly <math>h=\\sqrt p</math> from {{math|''B''}} when {{math|''BD''}} has length one.\n\nNot all real numbers are constructible. It can be shown that <math>\\sqrt[3] 2</math> is not a constructible number, which implies that it is impossible to construct with compass and straightedge the length of the side of a [[Doubling the cube|cube with volume 2]], another problem posed by the ancient Greeks.\n\n===A field with four elements===\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center;\"| Addition\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"float:text-align:center'\"| Multiplication\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| + !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"| {{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|}\n! scope=\"row\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| \u00b7 !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''O''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''I''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''A''}} !! style=\"width:20%;\"| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''O''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''I''}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''O''}}}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd;\"|{{color|blue| {{math|''I''}}}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|-\n! {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''O''}}\n|| {{math|''B''}}\n|| {{math|''I''}}\n|| {{math|''A''}}\n|}\n|}\n\nIn addition to familiar number systems such as the rationals, there are other, less immediate examples of fields. The following example is a field consisting of four elements called {{math|''O''}}, {{math|''I''}}, {{math|''A''}}, and {{math|''B''}}. The notation is chosen such that {{math|''O''}} plays the role of the additive identity element (denoted 0 in the axioms above), and I is the multiplicative identity (denoted 1 in the axioms above). The field axioms can be verified by using some more field theory, or by direct computation. For example,\n\n: {{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 (''B'' + ''A'') = ''A'' \u00b7 ''I'' = ''A''}}, which equals {{nowrap|1={{math|1=''A'' \u00b7 ''B'' + ''A'' \u00b7 ''A'' = ''I'' + ''B'' = ''A''}}}}, as required by the distributivity.\n\nThis field is called a [[finite field]] with four elements, and is denoted {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} or {{math|GF(4)}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Example 1.62}}</ref> The subset consisting of {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} (highlighted in red in the tables at the right) is also a field, known as the ''[[binary field]]'' {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} or {{math|GF(2)}}. In the context of [[computer science]] and [[Boolean algebra]], {{math|''O''}} and {{math|''I''}} are often denoted respectively by ''false'' and ''true'', the addition is then denoted [[XOR]] (exclusive or), and the multiplication is denoted [[Bitwise AND|AND]]. In other words, the structure of the binary field is the basic structure that allows computing with [[bit]]s.\n\n==Elementary notions==\nIn this section, {{math|''F''}} denotes an arbitrary field and {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary [[element (set theory)|elements]] of {{math|''F''}}.\n\n===Consequences of the definition===\nOne has {{math|1=''a'' \u00b7 0 = 0}} and {{math|1=\u2212''a'' = (\u22121) \u00b7 ''a''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Beachy|Blair|2006|loc=p. 120, Ch. 3}}</ref> In particular, one may deduce the additive inverse of every element as soon as one knows {{math|\u20131}}.\n\nIf {{math|1=''ab'' = 0}} then {{math|1=''a''}} or {{math|''b''}} must be 0. Indeed, if ''a''&nbsp;&ne;&nbsp;0, then \n{{math|1=0 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>\u22c50 = ''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>(''ab'') = (''a''<sup>\u20131</sup>''a'')''b'' = ''b''}}. This means that every field is an [[integral domain]].\n\n===The additive and the multiplicative group of a field===\nThe axioms of a field {{math|''F''}} imply that it is an [[abelian group]] under addition. This group is called the [[additive group]] of the field, and is sometimes denoted by {{math|(''F'', +)}} when denoting it simply as {{math|''F''}} could be confusing.\n\nSimilarly, the ''nonzero'' elements of {{math|''F''}} form an abelian group under multiplication, called the [[multiplicative group]], and denoted by {{math|(''F'' \\ {0}, \u00b7)}} or just {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} or {{math|''F''<sup>*</sup>}}. \n\nA field may thus be defined as set {{math|''F''}} equipped with two operations denoted as an addition and a multiplication such that {{math|''F''}} is an abelian group under addition, {{math|''F'' \\ {0}}} is an abelian group under multiplication (where 0 is the identity element of the addition), and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.<ref group=nb>Equivalently, a field is an [[algebraic structure]] {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u00b7, \u2212, <sup>\u22121</sup>, 0, 1\u27e9}} of type {{math|\u27e82, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0\u27e9}}, such that {{math|0<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is not defined, {{math|\u27e8''F'', +, \u2013, 0\u27e9}} and \n{{math|\u27e8''F'' \u2216 {0}, \u00b7, <sup>\u22121</sup>\u27e9}} are abelian groups, and \n\u00b7 is distributive over +. {{harvtxt|Wallace|1998|loc=Th. 2}}</ref> Some elementary statements about fields can therefore be obtained by applying general facts of [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. For example, the additive and multiplicative inverses {{math|\u2212''a''}} and {{math|''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} are uniquely determined by {{math|''a''}}.\n\nThe requirement {{math|1 \u2260 0}} follows, because 1 is the identity element of a group that does not contain 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sharpe|1987|loc=Theorem 1.3.2}}</ref> Thus, the [[trivial ring]], consisting of a single element, is not a field.\n\nEvery finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field is [[cyclic group|cyclic]] (see {{slink|Root of unity|Cyclic groups}}).\n\n===Characteristic===\nIn addition to the multiplication of two elements of ''F'', it is possible to define the product {{math|''n'' \u22c5 ''a''}} of an arbitrary element {{math|''a''}} of {{math|''F''}} by a positive [[integer]] {{math|''n''}} to be the {{math|''n''}}-fold sum\n:{{math|''a'' + ''a'' + ... + ''a''}} (which is an element of {{math|''F''}}.)\n\nIf there is no positive integer such that\n:{{math|1=''n'' \u22c5 1 = 0}},\nthen {{math|''F''}} is said to have [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.<ref>{{harvtxt|Adamson|2007|loc=\u00a7I.2, p.&nbsp;10}}</ref> For example, the field of rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} has characteristic 0 since no positive integer {{math|''n''}} is zero. Otherwise, if there ''is'' a positive integer {{math|''n''}} satisfying this equation, the smallest such positive integer can be shown to be a [[prime number]]. It is usually denoted by {{math|''p''}} and the field is said to have characteristic {{math|''p''}} then.\nFor example, the field {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} has characteristic 2 since (in the notation of the above addition table) {{math| 1= I + I = O }}.\n\nIf {{math|''F''}} has characteristic {{math|''p''}}, then {{math|1=''p'' \u22c5 ''a'' = 0}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}.

Therefore, the [[Frobenius map]]\n:{{math|Fr: ''F'' &rarr; ''F'', ''x'' \u27fc ''x''<sup>''p''</sup>}}\nis compatible with the addition in {{math|''F''}} (and also with the multiplication), and is therefore a field homomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Escofier|2012|loc=14.4.2}}</ref> The existence of this homomorphism makes fields in characteristic {{math|''p''}} quite different from fields of characteristic 0.\n\n===Subfields and prime fields===\nA ''[[Field extension|subfield]]'' {{math|''E''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a subset of {{math|''F''}} that is a field with respect to the field operations of {{math|''F''}}.

This construction yields a field precisely if {{math|''n''}} is a [[prime number]]. For example, taking the prime {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2}} results in the above-mentioned field {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}. For {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}} and more generally, for any [[composite number]] (i.e., any number {{math|''n''}} which can be expressed as a product {{math|1=''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r''\u22c5''s''}} of two strictly smaller natural numbers), {{math|1='''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} is not a field: the product of two non-zero elements is zero since {{math|1=''r''\u22c5''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0}} in {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}, which, as was explained [[#Consequences of the definition|above]], prevents {{math|'''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}} from being a field. The field {{math|'''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''}} with {{math|''p''}} elements ({{math|''p''}} being prime) constructed in this way is usually denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\nEvery finite field {{math|''F''}} has {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements, where {{math|1=''p''}} is prime and {{math|''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;1}}. This statement holds since {{math|''F''}} may be viewed as a [[vector space]] over its prime field. The [[dimension of a vector space|dimension]] of this vector space is necessarily finite, say {{math|''n''}}, which implies the asserted statement.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Lemma 2.1, Theorem 2.2}}</ref>\n\nA field with {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''<sup>''n''</sup>}} elements can be constructed as the [[splitting field]] of the polynomial \n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>''q''</sup> &minus; ''x''}}.\nSuch a splitting field is an extension of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} in which the polynomial {{math|''f''}} has {{math|''q''}} zeros. This means {{math|''f''}} has as many zeros as possible since the [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] of {{math|''f''}} is {{math|''q''}}. For {{math|1=''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4}}, it can be checked case by case using the above multiplication table that all four elements of {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub>}} satisfy the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''}}, so they are zeros of {{math|''f''}}. By contrast, in {{math|'''F'''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{math|''f''}} has only two zeros (namely 0 and 1), so {{math|''f''}} does not split into linear factors in this smaller field. Elaborating further on basic field-theoretic notions, it can be shown that two finite fields with the same order are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lidl|Niederreiter|2008|loc=Theorem 1.2.5}}</ref> It is thus customary to speak of ''the'' finite field with {{math|''q''}} elements, denoted by {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} or {{math|GF(''q'')}}.\n\n==History==\nHistorically, three algebraic disciplines led to the concept of a field: the question of solving polynomial equations, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 63}}</ref> A first step towards the notion of a field was made in 1770 by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], who observed that permuting the zeros {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>}} of a [[cubic polynomial]] in the expression\n:{{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub> + &omega;''x''<sub>2</sub> + &omega;<sup>2</sup>''x''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}}\n(with {{math|&omega;}} being a third [[root of unity]]) only yields two values. This way, Lagrange conceptually explained the classical solution method of [[Scipione del Ferro]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te]], which proceeds by reducing a cubic equation for an unknown {{math|''x''}} to an quadratic equation for {{math|''x''<sup>3</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Kiernan|1971|loc=p. 50}}</ref> Together with a similar observation for [[quartic polynomial|equations of degree 4]], Lagrange thus linked what eventually became the concept of fields and the concept of groups.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=pp. 75\u201376}}</ref> [[Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]], also in 1770, and to a fuller extent, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], in his ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' (1801), studied the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''p''</sup> = 1}}\nfor a prime {{math|''p''}} and, again using modern language, the resulting cyclic [[Galois group]]. Gauss deduced that a [[regular polygon|regular {{math|''p''}}-gon]] can be constructed if {{math|1=''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}. Building on Lagrange's work, [[Paolo Ruffini]] claimed (1799) that [[quintic equation]]s (polynomial equations of degree 5) cannot be solved algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1824.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p.24}}</ref> [[\u00c9variste Galois]], in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect what is known as [[Galois theory]] today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an [[algebraic number field]], but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.\n\nIn 1871 [[Richard Dedekind]] introduced, for a set of real or complex numbers that is closed under the four arithmetic operations, the [[German (language)|German]] word ''K\u00f6rper'', which means \"body\" or \"corpus\" (to suggest an organically closed entity). The English term \"field\" was introduced by {{harvtxt|Moore|1893}}.<ref>[http://jeff560.tripod.com/f.html ''Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (F)'']</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=By a field we will mean every infinite system of real or complex numbers so closed in itself and perfect that addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of any two of these numbers again yields a number of the system.\n|author=Richard Dedekind, 1871<ref>{{harvtxt|Dirichlet|1871|loc=p. 42}}, translation by {{harvtxt|Kleiner|2007|loc=p. 66}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1881 [[Leopold Kronecker]] defined what he called a ''domain of rationality'', which is a field of [[rational fraction]]s in modern terms. Kronecker's notion did not cover the field of all algebraic numbers (which is a field in Dedekind's sense), but on the other hand was more abstract than Dedekind's in that it made no specific assumption on the nature of the elements of a field. Kronecker interpreted a field such as {{math|'''Q'''(&pi;)}} abstractly as the rational function field {{math|'''Q'''(''X'')}}. Prior to this, examples of transcendental numbers were known since [[Joseph Liouville]]'s work in 1844, until [[Charles Hermite]] (1873) and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] (1882) proved the transcendence of {{math|''e''}} and {{math|&pi;}}, respectively.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 81}}</ref>\n\nThe first clear definition of an abstract field is due to {{harvtxt|Weber|1893}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Corry|2004|loc=p. 33}}. See also {{harvtxt|Fricke|Weber|1924}}.</ref> In particular, [[Heinrich Martin Weber]]'s notion included the field '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>. [[Giuseppe Veronese]] (1891) studied the field of formal power series, which led {{harvtxt|Hensel|1904}} to introduce the field of ''p''-adic numbers. {{harvtxt|Steinitz|1910}} synthesized the knowledge of abstract field theory accumulated so far. He axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field-theoretic concepts. The majority of the theorems mentioned in the sections [[#Galois theory|Galois theory]], [[#Constructing fields|Constructing fields]] and [[#Elementary notions|Elementary notions]] can be found in Steinitz's work. {{harvtxt|Artin|Schreier|1927}} linked the notion of [[ordered field|orderings in a field]], and thus the area of analysis, to purely algebraic properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1994|loc=p. 92}}</ref> [[Emil Artin]] redeveloped Galois theory from 1928 through 1942, eliminating the dependency on the [[primitive element theorem]].\n\n==Constructing fields==\n\n===Constructing fields from rings===\nA [[commutative ring]] is a set, equipped with an addition and multiplication operation, satisfying all the axioms of a field, except for the existence of multiplicative inverses {{math|''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7II.1}}</ref> For example, the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} form a commutative ring, but not a field: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of an integer {{math|''n''}} is not itself an integer, unless {{math|1=''n'' = \u00b11}}.\n\nIn the hierarchy of algebraic structures fields can be characterized as the commutative rings {{math|''R''}} in which every nonzero element is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] (which means every element is invertible). Similarly, fields are the commutative rings with precisely two distinct [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s, {{math|(0)}} and {{math|''R''}}. Fields are also precisely the commutative rings in which {{math|(0)}} is the only [[prime ideal]].\n\nGiven a commutative ring {{math|''R''}}, there are two ways to construct a field related to {{math|''R''}}, i.e., two ways of modifying {{math|''R''}} such that all nonzero elements become invertible: forming the field of fractions, and forming residue fields. The field of fractions of {{math|'''Z'''}} is {{math|'''Q'''}}, the rationals, while the residue fields of {{math|'''Z'''}} are the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n\n====Field of fractions====\n\nGiven an [[integral domain]] {{math|''R''}}, its [[field of fractions]] {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} is built with the fractions of two elements of {{math|''R''}} exactly as '''Q''' is constructed from the integers. More precisely, the elements of {{math|''Q''(''R'')}} are the fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are in {{math|''R''}}, and {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}. Two fractions {{math|''a''/''b''}} and {{math|''c''/''d''}} are equal if and only if {{math|1=''ad'' = ''bc''}}. The operation on the fractions work exactly as for rational numbers. For example, \n:<math>\\frac{a}{b}+\\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad+bc}{bd}.</math>\nIt is straightforward to show that, if the ring is an integral domain, the set of the fractions form a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 10.6}}</ref>\n\nThe field {{math|''F''(''x'')}} of the [[rational fraction]]s over a field (or an integral domain) {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the [[polynomial ring]] {{math|''F''[''x'']}}. The field {{math|''F''((''x''))}} of [[Laurent series]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=k}^\\infty a_i x^i \\ (k \\in \\Z, a_i \\in F)</math>\nover a field {{math|''F''}} is the field of fractions of the ring {{math|''F''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''x'']]}} of [[formal power series]] (in which {{math|''k'' &ge; 0}}). Since any Laurent series is a fraction of a power series divided by a power of {{math|''x''}} (as opposed to an arbitrary power series), the representation of fractions is less important in this situation, though.\n\n====Residue fields====\nIn addition to the field of fractions, which embeds {{math|''R''}} [[injective map|injectively]] into a field, a field can be obtained from a commutative ring {{math|''R''}} by means of a [[surjective map]] onto a field {{math|''F''}}. Any field obtained in this way is a [[quotient ring|quotient]] {{math|{{nowrap|''R'' / ''m''}}}}, where {{math|''m''}} is a [[maximal ideal]] of {{math|''R''}}. If {{math|''R''}} [[local ring|has only one maximal ideal]] {{math|''m''}}, this field is called the [[residue field]] of {{math|''R''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=p. 60}}</ref>\n\nThe [[principal ideal|ideal generated by a single polynomial]] {{math|''f''}} in the polynomial ring {{math|1=''R'' = ''E''[''X'']}} (over a field {{math|''E''}}) is maximal if and only if {{math|''f''}} is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] in {{math|''E''}}, i.e., if {{math|''f''}} cannot be expressed as the product of two polynomials in {{math|''E''[''X'']}} of smaller [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]. This yields a field\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / (''f''(''X'')).}}\nThis field {{math|''F''}} contains an element {{math|''x''}} (namely the [[residue class]] of {{math|''X''}}) which satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 0}}.\nFor example, {{math|'''C'''}} is obtained from {{math|'''R'''}} by [[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] the [[imaginary unit]] symbol {{mvar|i}}, which satisfies {{math|1=''f''(''i'') = 0}}, where {{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}}. Moreover, {{math|''f''}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}, which implies that the map that sends a polynomial {{math|''f''(''X'') \u220a '''R'''[''X'']}} to {{math|''f''(''i'')}} yields an isomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbf R[X]/\\left(X^2 + 1\\right) \\ \\stackrel \\cong \\longrightarrow \\ \\mathbf C.</math>\n\n===Constructing fields within a bigger field===\nFields can be constructed inside a given bigger container field. Suppose given a field {{math|''E''}}, and a field {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} as a subfield. For any element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''F''}}, there is a smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''x''}}, called the subfield of ''F'' generated by {{math|''x''}} and denoted {{math|''E''(''x'')}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jacobson|2009|loc=p. 213}}</ref> The passage from {{math|''E''}} to {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is referred to by ''[[adjunction (field theory)|adjoining]] an element'' to {{math|''E''}}. More generally, for a subset {{math|''S'' \u2282 ''F''}}, there is a minimal subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''S''}}, denoted by {{math|''E''(''S'')}}.\n\nThe [[compositum]] of two subfields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E' ''}} of some field {{math|''F''}} is the smallest subfield of {{math|''F''}} containing both {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''E'.''}} The compositum can be used to construct the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}} satisfying a certain property, for example the biggest subfield of {{math|''F''}}, which is, in the language introduced below, algebraic over {{math|''E''}}.<ref group=nb>Further examples include the maximal [[unramified extension]] or the maximal [[abelian extension]] within {{math|''F''}}.</ref>\n\n===Field extensions===\n{{See|Glossary of field theory}}\nThe notion of a subfield {{math|''E'' \u2282 ''F''}} can also be regarded from the opposite point of view, by referring to {{math|''F''}} being a ''[[field extension]]'' (or just extension) of {{math|''E''}}, denoted by\n:{{math|''F'' / ''E''}},\nand read \"{{math|''F''}} over {{math|''E''}}\".\n\nA basic datum of a field extension is its [[degree of a field extension|degree]] {{math|[''F'' : ''E'']}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''F''}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space. It satisfies the formula<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Theorem 13.3.4}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=[''G'' : ''E''] = [''G'' : ''F''] [''F'' : ''E'']}}.\nExtensions whose degree is finite are referred to as finite extensions. The extensions {{math|'''C''' / '''R'''}} and {{math|'''F'''<sub>4</sub> / '''F'''<sub>2</sub>}} are of degree 2, whereas {{math|'''R''' / '''Q'''}} is an infinite extension.\n\n====Algebraic extensions====\nA pivotal notion in the study of field extensions {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} are [[algebraic element]]s. An element {{tmath|x\\in F}} is ''algebraic'' over {{mvar|E}} if it is a [[zero of a function|root]] of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients in {{mvar|E}}, that is, if it satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''e''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0}},\nwith {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|E}}, and {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub> &ne; 0}}. \nFor example, the [[imaginary unit]] {{math|''i''}} in {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraic over {{math|'''R'''}}, and even over {{math|'''Q'''}}, since it satisfies the equation\n:{{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}.\nA field extension in which every element of {{math|''F''}} is algebraic over {{math|''E''}} is called an [[algebraic extension]]. Any finite extension is necessarily algebraic, as can be deduced from the above multiplicativity formula.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Corollary 13.3.6}}</ref>\n\nThe subfield {{math|''E''(''x'')}} generated by an element {{math|''x''}}, as above, is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} if and only if {{math|''x''}} is an algebraic element. That is to say, if {{math|''x''}} is algebraic, all other elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} are necessarily algebraic as well. Moreover, the degree of the extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}}, i.e., the dimension of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} as an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, equals the minimal degree {{math|''n''}} such that there is a polynomial equation involving {{math|''x''}}, as above. If this degree is {{math|''n''}}, then the elements of {{math|''E''(''x'')}} have the form \n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k x^k, \\ \\ a_k \\in E.</math>\n\nFor example, the field {{math|'''Q'''(''i'')}} of [[Gaussian rational]]s is the subfield of {{math|'''C'''}} consisting of all numbers of the form {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are rational numbers: summands of the form {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup>}} (and similarly for higher exponents) don't have to be considered here, since {{math|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''ci''<sup>2</sup>}} can be simplified to {{math|''a'' &minus; ''c'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n====Transcendence bases====\nThe above-mentioned field of [[rational fraction]]s {{math|''E''(''X'')}}, where {{math|''X''}} is an [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]], is not an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''}} since there is no polynomial equation with coefficients in {{math|''E''}} whose zero is {{math|''X''}}. Elements, such as {{math|''X''}}, which are not algebraic are called [[Algebraic element|transcendental]]. Informally speaking, the indeterminate {{math|''X''}} and its powers do not interact with elements of {{math|''E''}}. A similar construction can be carried out with a set of indeterminates, instead of just one.\n\nOnce again, the field extension {{math|''E''(''x'') / ''E''}} discussed above is a key example: if {{math|''x''}} is not algebraic (i.e., {{math|''x''}} is not a [[root of a function|root]] of a polynomial with coefficients in {{math|''E''}}), then {{math|''E''(''x'')}} is isomorphic to {{math|''E''(''X'')}}. This isomorphism is obtained by substituting {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''X''}} in rational fractions.\n\nA subset {{math|''S''}} of a field {{math|''F''}} is a [[transcendence basis]] if it is [[algebraically independent]] (don't satisfy any polynomial relations) over {{math|''E''}} and if {{math|''F''}} is an algebraic extension of {{math|''E''(''S'')}}. Any field extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} has a transcendence basis.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter V, \u00a714, No. 2, Theorem 1}}</ref> Thus, field extensions can be split into ones of the form {{math|''E''(''S'') / ''E''}} ([[transcendental extension|purely transcendental extensions]]) and algebraic extensions.\n\n===Closure operations===\nA field is [[algebraically closed]] if it does not have any strictly bigger algebraic extensions or, equivalently, if any [[polynomial equation]]\n:{{math|1=''f''<sub>''n''</sub>''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''f''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''f''<sub>1</sub>''x'' + ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0}}, with [[coefficient]]s {{math|''f''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>0</sub> \u2208 ''F'', ''n'' > 0}},\nhas a solution {{math|''x'' \u220a ''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=Section 13.9}}</ref> By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, i.e., ''any'' polynomial equation with complex coefficients has a complex solution. The rational and the real numbers are ''not'' algebraically closed since the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}\ndoes not have any rational or real solution. A field containing {{math|''F''}} is called an ''[[algebraic closure]]'' of {{math|''F''}} if it is [[algebraic extension|algebraic]] over {{math|''F''}} (roughly speaking, not too big compared to {{math|''F''}}) and is algebraically closed (big enough to contain solutions of all polynomial equations).\n\nBy the above, {{math|'''C'''}} is an algebraic closure of {{math|'''R'''}}. The situation that the algebraic closure is a finite extension of the field {{math|''F''}} is quite special: by the [[Artin-Schreier theorem]], the degree of this extension is necessarily 2, and {{math|''F''}} is [[elementarily equivalent]] to {{math|'''R'''}}. Such fields are also known as [[real closed field]]s.\n\nAny field {{math|''F''}} has an algebraic closure, which is moreover unique up to (non-unique) isomorphism. It is commonly referred to as ''the'' algebraic closure and denoted {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}}. For example, the algebraic closure {{math|{{Overline|'''Q'''}}}} of {{math|'''Q'''}} is called the field of [[algebraic number]]s. The field {{math|{{Overline|''F''}}}} is usually rather implicit since its construction requires the [[ultrafilter lemma]], a set-theoretic axiom that is weaker than the [[axiom of choice]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Banaschewski|1992}}. [https://mathoverflow.net/questions/46566/is-the-statement-that-every-field-has-an-algebraic-closure-known-to-be-equivalent Mathoverflow post]</ref> In this regard, the algebraic closure of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}}, is exceptionally simple. It is the union of the finite fields containing {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (the ones of order {{math|''q''<sup>''n''</sup>}}). For any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic 0, the algebraic closure of the field {{math|''F''((''t''))}} of [[Laurent series]] is the field of [[Puiseux series]], obtained by adjoining roots of {{math|''t''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ribenboim|1999|loc=p. 186, \u00a77.1}}</ref>\n\n==Fields with additional structure==\nSince fields are ubiquitous in mathematics and beyond, several refinements of the concept have been adapted to the needs of particular mathematical areas.\n\n===Ordered fields===\n{{main|Ordered field}}\nA field ''F'' is called an ''ordered field'' if any two elements can be compared, so that {{math|''x'' + ''y'' \u2265 0}} and {{math|''xy''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} whenever {{math|''x''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}} and {{math|''y''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0}}. For example, the reals form an ordered field, with the usual ordering&nbsp;{{math|\u2265}}. The [[Artin-Schreier theorem]] states that a field can be ordered if and only if it is a [[formally real field]], which means that any quadratic equation\n:<math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\dots + x_n^2 = 0</math>\nonly has the solution {{math|1=''x''<sub>1</sub> = ''x''<sub>2</sub> = \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 = ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = 0}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1988|loc=Chapter VI, \u00a72.3, Corollary 1}}</ref> The set of all possible orders on a fixed field {{math|''F''}} is isomorphic to the set of [[ring homomorphism]]s from the [[Witt ring (forms)|Witt ring]] {{math|W(''F'')}} of [[quadratic form]]s over {{math|''F''}}, to {{math|'''Z'''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lorenz|2008|loc=\u00a722, Theorem 1}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Archimedean field]] is an ordered field such that for each element there exists a finite expression\n:{{math|1 + 1 + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + 1}}\nwhose value is greater than that element, that is, there are no infinite elements. Equivalently, the field contains no [[infinitesimals]] (elements smaller than all rational numbers); or, yet equivalent, the field is isomorphic to a subfield of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n[[File:Illustration of supremum.svg|thumb|300px|Each bounded real set has a least upper bound.]]\nAn ordered field is [[Dedekind-complete]] if all [[upper bound]]s, [[lower bound]]s (see [[Dedekind cut]]) and limits, which should exist, do exist. More formally, each [[bounded set|bounded subset]] of {{math|''F''}} is required to have a least upper bound. Any complete field is necessarily Archimedean,<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Proposition 1.22}}</ref> since in any non-Archimedean field there is neither a greatest infinitesimal nor a least positive rational, whence the sequence {{math|1/2, 1/3, 1/4, &hellip;}}, every element of which is greater than every infinitesimal, has no limit.\n\nSince every proper subfield of the reals also contains such gaps, {{math|'''R'''}} is the unique complete ordered field, up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Prestel|1984|loc=Theorem 1.23}}</ref> Several foundational results in [[calculus]] follow directly from this characterization of the reals.\n\nThe [[hyperreals]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>*</sup>}} form an ordered field that is not Archimedean. It is an extension of the reals obtained by including infinite and infinitesimal numbers. These are larger, respectively smaller than any real number. The hyperreals form the foundational basis of [[non-standard analysis]].\n\n===Topological fields===\nAnother refinement of the notion of a field is a [[topological field]], in which the set {{math|''F''}} is a [[topological space]], such that all operations of the field (addition, multiplication, the maps {{math|''a'' \u21a6 &minus;''a''}} and {{math|''a'' \u21a6 ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>}}) are [[continuous map]]s with respect to the topology of the space.<ref>{{harvtxt|Warner|1989|loc=Chapter 14}}</ref>\nThe topology of all the fields discussed below is induced from a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]], i.e., a function\n:{{math|''d'' : ''F'' \u00d7 ''F'' \u2192 '''R''',}}\nthat measures a ''distance'' between any two elements of {{math|''F''}}.\n\nThe [[completion (metric space)|completion]] of {{math|''F''}} is another field in which, informally speaking, the \"gaps\" in the original field {{math|''F''}} are filled, if there are any. For example, any [[irrational number]] {{math|''x''}}, such as {{math|1=''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{radic|2}}}}, is a \"gap\" in the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} in the sense that it is a real number that can be approximated arbitrarily closely by rational numbers {{math|''p''/''q''}}, in the sense that distance of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''p''/''q''}} given by the [[absolute value]] {{math|{{!}} ''x'' \u2013 ''p''/''q'' {{!}}}} is as small as desired.\nThe following table lists some examples of this construction. The fourth column shows an example of a zero [[sequence]], i.e., a sequence whose limit (for {{math|''n''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\u221e}}) is zero.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Field !! Metric !!

The algebraic closure {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} carries a unique norm extending the one on {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, but is not complete. The completion of this algebraic closure, however, is algebraically closed. Because of its rough analogy to the complex numbers, it is sometimes called the field of [[p-adic number|Metric completions and algebraic closures|complex p-adic number]]s and is denoted by {{math|'''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|1997|loc=\u00a75.7}}</ref>\n\n====Local fields====\nThe following topological fields are called ''[[local field]]s'':<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1979}}</ref><ref group=nb>Some authors also consider the fields {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} to be local fields.

The first manifestation of this is at an elementary level: the elements of both fields can be expressed as power series in the uniformizer, with coefficients in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}. (However, since the addition in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is done using [[carry (arithmetic)|carry]]ing, which is not the case in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}, these fields are not isomorphic.) The following facts show that this superficial similarity goes much deeper:\n* Any [[first order logic|first order]] statement that is true for almost all {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} is also true for almost all {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}. An application of this is the [[Ax-Kochen theorem]] describing zeros of homogeneous polynomials in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}.\n* [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|Tamely ramified extension]]s of both fields are in bijection to one another.\n* Adjoining arbitrary {{math|''p''}}-power roots of {{math|''p''}} (in {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}), respectively of {{math|''t''}} (in {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}), yields (infinite) extensions of these fields known as [[perfectoid field]]s. Strikingly, the Galois groups of these two fields are isomorphic, which is the first glimpse of a remarkable parallel between these two fields:<ref>{{harvtxt|Scholze|2014}}</ref>\n::<math>\\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf Q_p\\left(p^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right) \\cong \\operatorname {Gal}\\left(\\mathbf F_p((t))\\left(t^{1/p^\\infty}\\right)\\right).</math>\n\n===Differential fields===\n[[Differential field]]s are fields equipped with a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]], i.e., allow to take derivatives of elements in the field.<ref>{{harvtxt|van der Put|Singer|2003|loc=\u00a71}}</ref> For example, the field '''R'''(''X''), together with the standard derivative of polynomials forms a differential field. These fields are central to [[differential Galois theory]], a variant of Galois theory dealing with [[linear differential equation]]s.\n\n==Galois theory==\n{{main|Galois theory}}\n\nGalois theory studies [[algebraic extension]]s of a field by studying the [[Symmetry group#Symmetry groups in general|symmetry]] in the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication. An important notion in this area are [[finite extension|finite]] [[Galois extension]]s {{math|''F'' / ''E''}}, which are, by definition, those that are [[separable extension|separable]] and [[normal extension|normal]]. The [[primitive element theorem]] shows that finite separable extensions are necessarily [[simple extension|simple]], i.e., of the form\n:{{math|1=''F'' = ''E''[''X''] / ''f''(''X'')}},\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is an irreducible polynomial (as above).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Theorem V.4.6}}</ref> For such an extension, being normal and separable means that all zeros of {{math|''f''}} are contained in {{math|''F''}} and that {{math|''f''}} has only simple zeros. The latter condition is always satisfied if {{math|''E''}} has characteristic 0.\n\nFor a finite Galois extension, the [[Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} is the group of [[field automorphism]]s of {{math|''F''}} that are trivial on {{math|''E''}} (i.e., the [[bijection]]s {{math|\u03c3 : ''F'' \u2192 ''F''}} that preserve addition and multiplication and that send elements of {{math|''E''}} to themselves). The importance of this group stems from the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], which constructs an explicit [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the set of [[subgroup]]s of {{math|Gal(''F''/''E'')}} and the set of intermediate extensions of the extension {{math|''F''/''E''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=\u00a7VI.1}}</ref> By means of this correspondence, group-theoretic properties translate into facts about fields. For example, if the Galois group of a Galois extension as above is not [[solvable group|solvable]] (cannot be built from [[abelian group]]s), then the zeros of {{math|''f''}} ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of addition, multiplication, and radicals, i.e., expressions involving <math>\\sqrt[n]{\\ }</math>. For example, the [[symmetric group]]s {{math|S<sub>''n''</sub>}} is not solvable for {{math|''n''&ge;5}}. Consequently, as can be shown, the zeros of the following polynomials are not expressible by sums, products, and radicals. For the latter polynomial, this fact is known as the [[Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem]]:\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>5</sup> &minus; 4''X'' + 2}} (and {{math|1=''E'' = '''Q'''}}),<ref>{{harvtxt|Lang|2002|loc=Example VI.2.6}}</ref>\n:{{math|1=''f''(''X'') = ''X''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>''X''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} (where {{math|''f''}} is regarded as a polynomial in {{math|''E''(''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>)}}, for some indeterminates {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, {{math|''E''}} is any field, and {{math|''n'' &ge; 5}}).\n\nThe [[tensor product of fields]] is not usually a field. For example, a finite extension {{math|''F'' / ''E''}} of degree {{math|''n''}} is a Galois extension if and only if there is an isomorphism of {{math|''F''}}-algebras\n:{{math|''F'' \u2297<sub>''E''</sub> ''F'' \u2245 ''F''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\nThis fact is the beginning of [[Grothendieck's Galois theory]], a far-reaching extension of Galois theory applicable to algebro-geometric objects.<ref>{{harvtxt|Borceux|Janelidze|2001}}. See also [[\u00c9tale fundamental group]].</ref>\n\n==Invariants of fields==\n\nBasic invariants of a field {{math|''F''}} include the characteristic and the [[transcendence degree]] of {{math|''F''}} over its prime field. The latter is defined as the maximal number of elements in {{math|''F''}} that are algebraically independent over the prime field. Two algebraically closed fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are isomorphic precisely if these two data agree.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gouv\u00eaa|2012|loc=Theorem 6.4.8}}</ref> This implies that any two [[uncountable]] algebraically closed fields of the same [[cardinality]] and the same characteristic are isomorphic. For example, {{math|{{overline|'''Q'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>, '''C'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are isomorphic (but ''not'' isomorphic as topological fields).\n\n===Model theory of fields===\nIn [[model theory]], a branch of [[mathematical logic]], two fields {{math|''E''}} and {{math|''F''}} are called [[elementarily equivalent]] if every mathematical statement that is true for {{math|''E''}} is also true for {{math|''F''}} and conversely. The mathematical statements in question are required to be [[first-order logic|first-order]] sentences (involving 0, 1, the addition and multiplication). A typical example is\n:{{math|&phi;(''E'')}} = \"for any {{math|''n'' > 0}}, any polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} in {{math|''E''}} has a zero in {{math|''E''}}\" (which amounts to saying that {{math|''E''}} is algebraically closed).\nThe [[Lefschetz principle]] states that {{math|'''C'''}} is elementarily equivalent to any algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} of characteristic zero. Moreover, any fixed statement {{math|&phi;}} holds in {{math|'''C'''}} if and only if it holds in any algebraically closed field of sufficiently high characteristic.<ref>{{harvtxt|Marker|Messmer|Pillay|2006|loc=Corollary 1.2}}</ref>\n\nIf {{math|''U''}} is an [[ultrafilter]] on a set {{math|''I''}}, and {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is a field for every {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''I''}}, the [[ultraproduct]] of the {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with respect to {{math|''U''}} is a field.<ref>{{harvtxt|Schoutens|2002|loc=\u00a72}}</ref> It is denoted by\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''i''&rarr;\u221e</sub> ''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}},\nsince it behaves in several ways as a limit of the fields {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}: [[\u0141o\u015b's theorem]] states that any first order statement that holds for all but finitely many {{math|''F''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, also holds for the ultraproduct. Applied to the above sentence {{math|&phi;}}, this shows that there is an isomorphism<ref group=nb>Both {{math|'''C'''}} and {{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> {{overline|'''F'''}}<sub>''p''</sub>}} are algebraically closed by \u0141o\u015b's theorem.

Finally, they are both uncountable, so that they are isomorphic.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{ulim}_{p \\to \\infty} \\overline \\mathbf F_p \\cong \\mathbf C.</math>\nThe Ax\u2013Kochen theorem mentioned above also follows from this and an isomorphism of the ultraproducts (in both cases over all primes {{math|''p''}})\n:{{math|ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> \u2245 ulim<sub>''p''</sub> '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>((''t''))}}.\nIn addition, model theory also studies the logical properties of various other types of fields, such as [[real closed field]]s or [[exponential field]]s (which are equipped with an exponential function {{math|exp : ''F'' &rarr; ''F''<sup>x</sup>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Kuhlmann|2000}}</ref>\n\n===The absolute Galois group===\nFor fields that are not algebraically closed (or not separably closed), the [[absolute Galois group]] {{math|Gal(''F'')}} is fundamentally important: extending the case of finite Galois extensions outlined above, this group governs ''all'' finite separable extensions of {{math|''F''}}. By elementary means, the group {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} can be shown to be the [[Pr\u00fcfer group]], the [[profinite completion]] of {{math|'''Z'''}}. This statement subsumes the fact that the only algebraic extensions of {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>)}} are the fields {{math|Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub>)}} for {{math|''n'' > 0}}, and that the Galois groups of these finite extensions are given by\n:{{math|1=Gal('''F'''<sub>''q''<sup>''n''</sup></sub> / '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) = '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''}}.\nA description in terms of generators and relations is also known for the Galois groups of {{math|''p''}}-adic number fields (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}).<ref>{{harvtxt|Jannsen|Wingberg|1982}}</ref>\n\n[[Galois representation|Representations of Galois groups]] and of related groups such as the [[Weil group]] are fundamental in many branches of arithmetic, such as the [[Langlands program]]. The cohomological study of such representations is done using [[Galois cohomology]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|2002}}</ref> For example, the [[Brauer group]], which is classically defined as the group of [[central simple algebra|central simple {{math|''F''}}-algebras]], can be reinterpreted as a Galois cohomology group, namely\n:{{math|1=Br(''F'') = H<sup>2</sup>(''F'', '''G'''<sub>m</sub>)}}.\n\n===K-theory===\n[[Milnor K-theory]] is defined as\n:<math>K_n^M(F) = F^\\times \\otimes \\cdots \\otimes F^\\times / \\langle x \\otimes (1-x)\\mid x \\in F \\smallsetminus \\{0, 1\\} \\rangle.</math>\nThe [[norm residue isomorphism theorem]], proved around 2000 by [[Vladimir Voevodsky]], relates this to Galois cohomology by means of an isomorphism\n:<math>K_n^M(F) / p = H^n(F, \\mu_l^{\\otimes n}).</math>\n[[Algebraic K-theory]] is related to the group of [[invertible matrix|invertible matrices]] with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the [[determinant (mathematics)|determinant]] of an invertible matrix leads to an isomorphism K<sub>1</sub>(''F'') = ''F''<sup>&times;</sup>. [[Matsumoto's theorem (K-theory)|Matsumoto's theorem]] shows that K<sub>2</sub>(''F'') agrees with K<sub>2</sub><sup>M</sup>(''F''). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Linear algebra and commutative algebra===\n[[File:euler2a.gif|thumb|[[Euler angles]] express the relation of different coordinate systems, i.e., bases of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}.

This observation, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of a field, is the essential ingredient used to show that any [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|1991|loc=\u00a73.3}}</ref> Roughly speaking, this allows choosing a coordinate system in any vector space, which is of central importance in [[linear algebra]] both from a theoretical point of view, and also for practical applications.\n\n[[module (mathematics)|Modules]] (the analogue of vector spaces) over most [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, including the ring {{math|'''Z'''}} of integers, have a more complicated structure. A particular situation arises when a ring {{math|''R''}} is a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} in its own right. Such rings are called [[algebra over a field|{{math|''F''}}-algebras]] and are studied in depth in the area of [[commutative algebra]]. For example, [[Noether normalization]] asserts that any [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated {{math|''F''}}-algebra]] is closely related to (more precisely, [[finitely generated module|finitely generated as a module]] over) a polynomial ring {{math|''F''[''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=Theorem 13.3}}</ref>\n\n===Finite fields: cryptography and coding theory===\n\n[[File:ECClines.svg|thumb|The sum of three points ''P'', ''Q'', and ''R'' on an elliptic curve ''E'' (red) is zero if there is a line (blue) passing through these points.]]\nA widely applied cryptographic routine uses the fact that discrete exponentiation, i.e., computing\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' \u22c5 ''a'' \u22c5 ... \u22c5 ''a''}} ({{math|''n''}} factors, for an integer {{math|''n'' \u2265 1}})\nin a (large) finite field {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} can be performed much more efficiently than the [[discrete logarithm]], which is the inverse operation, i.e., determining the solution {{math|''n''}} to an equation\n:{{math|1=''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''b''}}.\nIn [[elliptic curve cryptography]], the multiplication in a finite field is replaced by the operation of adding points on an [[elliptic curve]], i.e., the solutions of an equation of the form\n:{{math|1=''y''<sup>2</sup> = ''x''<sup>3</sup> + ''ax'' + ''b''}}.\n\nFinite fields are also used in [[coding theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\n===Geometry: field of functions===\n[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A compact Riemann surface of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] two (two handles). The genus can be read off the field of meromorphic functions on the surface.]]\n[[function (mathematics)|Functions]] on a suitable [[topological space]] {{math|''X''}} into a field {{mvar|k}} can be added and multiplied pointwise, e.g., the product of two functions is defined by the product of their values within the domain:\n:{{math|1={{nowrap|1=(''f'' \u22c5 ''g'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u22c5 ''g''(''x'')}}}}.\nThis makes these functions a {{mvar|k}}-[[associative algebra|commutative algebra]].\n\nFor having a ''field'' of functions, one must consider algebras of functions that are [[integral domains]]. In this case the ratios of two functions, i.e., expressions of the form\n:<math>\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)},</math>\nform a field, called field of functions.\n\nThis occurs in two main cases. When {{math|''X''}} is a [[complex manifold]] {{math|''X''}}. In this case, one considers the algebra of [[holomorphic functions]], i.e., complex differentiable functions. Their ratios form the field of [[meromorphic function]]s on {{math|''X''}}.\n\nThe [[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]] of an [[algebraic variety]] {{math|''X''}} (a geometric object defined as the common zeros of polynomial equations) consists of ratios of [[regular function]]s, i.e., ratios of polynomial functions on the variety. The function field of the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[affine space|space]] over a field {{math|''k''}} is {{math|''k''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, i.e., the field consisting of ratios of polynomials in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates. The function field of {{math|''X''}} is the same as the one of any [[Zariski topology|open]] dense subvariety. In other words, the function field is insensitive to replacing {{math|''X''}} by a (slightly) smaller subvariety.\n\nThe function field is invariant under [[isomorphism]] and [[birational equivalence]] of varieties. It is therefore an important tool for the study of [[abstract algebraic variety|abstract algebraic varieties]] and for the classification of algebraic varieties. For example, the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]], which equals the transcendence degree of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}, is invariant under birational equivalence.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=\u00a713, Theorem A}}</ref> For [[algebraic curve|curves]] (i.e., the dimension is one), the function field {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is very close to {{math|''X''}}: if {{math|''X''}} is [[smooth variety|smooth]] and [[proper map|proper]] (the analogue of being [[compact topological space|compact]]), {{math|''X''}} can be reconstructed, up to isomorphism, from its field of functions.<ref group=nb>More precisely, there is an [[equivalence of categories]] between smooth proper algebraic curves over an algebraically closed field {{math|''F''}} and finite field extensions of {{math|''F''(''T'')}}.</ref> In higher dimension the function field remembers less, but still decisive information about {{math|''X''}}. The study of function fields and their geometric meaning in higher dimensions is referred to as [[birational geometry]]. The [[minimal model program]] attempts to identify the simplest (in a certain precise sense) algebraic varieties with a prescribed function field.\n\n===Number theory: global fields===\n\n[[Global field]]s are in the limelight in [[algebraic number theory]] and [[arithmetic geometry]].\nThey are, by definition, [[number field]]s (finite extensions of {{math|'''Q'''}}) or function fields over {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>}} (finite extensions of {{math|'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'')}}). As for local fields, these two types of fields share several similar features, even though they are of characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, respectively. This [[function field analogy]] can help to shape mathematical expectations, often first by understanding questions about function fields, and later treating the number field case. The latter is often more difficult. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] concerning the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] (open as of 2017) can be regarded as being parallel to the [[Weil conjectures]] (proven in 1974 by [[Pierre Deligne]]).\n\n[[File:One5Root.svg|thumb|The fifth roots of unity form a [[regular pentagon]].]]\n[[Cyclotomic field]]s are among the most intensely studied number fields. They are of the form {{math|'''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, where {{math|\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>}} is a primitive {{math|''n''}}-th [[root of unity]], i.e., a complex number satisfying {{math|1={{nowrap begin}}\u03b6<sup>''n''</sup> = 1{{nowrap end}}}} and {{math|\u03b6<sup>''m''</sup> \u2260 1}} for all {{math|''m'' < ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Washington|1997}}</ref> For {{math|''n''}} being a [[regular prime]], [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] used cyclotomic fields to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]], which asserts the non-existence of rational nonzero solutions to the equation\n:{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''y''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nLocal fields are completions of global fields. [[Ostrowski's theorem]] asserts that the only completions of {{math|'''Q'''}}, a global field, are the local fields {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}} and {{math|'''R'''}}. Studying arithmetic questions in global fields may sometimes be done by looking at the corresponding questions locally. This technique is called the [[local-global principle]]. For example, the [[Hasse\u2013Minkowski theorem]] reduces the problem of finding rational solutions of quadratic equations to solving these equations in {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, whose solutions can easily be described.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1978|loc=Chapter IV}}</ref>\n\nUnlike for local fields, the Galois groups of global fields are not known. [[Inverse Galois theory]] studies the (unsolved) problem whether any finite group is the Galois group {{math|Gal(''F''/'''Q''')}} for some number field {{math|''F''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Serre|1992}}</ref> [[Class field theory]] describes the [[abelian extension]]s, i.e., ones with abelian Galois group, or equivalently the abelianized Galois groups of global fields. A classical statement, the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], describes the maximal abelian {{math|'''Q'''<sup>ab</sup>}} extension of {{math|'''Q'''}}: it is the field\n:{{math|'''Q'''(&zeta;<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n'' &ge; 2)}}\nobtained by adjoining all primitive {{math|''n''}}-th roots of unity. [[Kronecker Jugendtraum|Kronecker's Jugendtraum]] asks for a similarly explicit description of {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} of general number fields {{math|''F''}}. For [[imaginary quadratic field]]s, <math>F=\\mathbf Q(\\sqrt{-d})</math>, {{math|''d'' > 0}}, the theory of [[complex multiplication]] describes {{math|''F''<sup>ab</sup>}} using [[elliptic curves]]. For general number fields, no such explicit description is known.\n\n==Related notions==\n\nIn addition to the additional structure that fields may enjoy, fields admit various other related notions. Since in any field 0 &ne; 1, any field has at least two elements. Nonetheless, there is a concept of [[field with one element]], which is suggested to be a limit of the finite fields {{math|'''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, as {{math|''p''}} tends to 1.<ref>{{harvtxt|Tits|1957}}</ref> In addition to division rings, there are various other weaker algebraic structures related to fields such as [[quasifield]]s, [[Near-field (mathematics)|near-field]]s and [[semifield]]s.\n\nThere are also [[proper class]]es with field structure, which are sometimes called '''Fields''', with a capital F. The [[surreal number]]s form a Field containing the reals, and would be a field except for the fact that they are a proper class, not a set. The [[nimber]]s, a concept from [[game theory]], form such a Field as well.<ref>{{harvtxt|Conway|1976}}</ref>\n\n===Division rings===\n[[File:Hairy_ball.png|thumb|The hairy ball theorem states that a ball cannot be combed. More formally, there is no [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[tangent bundle|tangent vector field]] on the [[sphere]] {{math|S<sup>2</sup>}}, which is everywhere non-zero.]]\n\nDropping one or several axioms in the definition of a field leads to other algebraic structures. As was mentioned above, commutative rings satisfy all axioms of fields, except for multiplicative inverses. Dropping instead the condition that multiplication is commutative leads to the concept of a ''[[division ring]]'' or ''skew field''.<ref group=nb>Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields were called ''commutative fields''.</ref> The only division rings that are finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces are {{math|'''R'''}} itself, {{math|'''C'''}} (which is a field), the [[quaternion]]s {{math|'''H'''}} (in which multiplication is non-commutative), and the [[octonion]]s {{math|'''O'''}} (in which multiplication is neither commutative nor associative). This fact was proved using methods of [[algebraic topology]] in 1958 by [[Michel Kervaire]], [[Raoul Bott]], and [[John Milnor]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Baez|2002}}</ref> The non-existence of an odd-dimensional division algebra is more classical.
