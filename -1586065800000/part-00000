The opera takes place in [[Venice]] at the age of [[Alessandro Stradella]]. The Duke of Pesaro enters with Spadoni and his men to abduct the beautiful L\u00e9onor (scene I). However they are disturbed by the singer Stradella and his pupils who came to sing for L\u00e9onor (scene II). Left alone Stradella sings together with his beloved, who stays at her balcony (scene III). After they part, Stradella returns with his henchmen and takes the girl away (scene IV). They are stopped by a patrol, but the Duke comes to save the cause (scene V). The bright carnival comes in, and Spadoni escapes the guards (scene VI).\n\n'''Act II.''' L\u00e9onor finds herself at the Duke's apartments. She knows no one is going to save her, as she is an orphant (scene I). Spadoni appears with merchants, who bring precious presents from the Duke. She conseals herself (scene II). Called to make soften her heart with his singing, Stradella enters with Beppo and pupils. He tries some usual tunes, but soon finds that the girl in the room is no one else than L\u00e9onor (scene III). Stradella's attendants leave, and the lovers sing a desperate duet. In the middle of this a [[vocalise]] by Beppo is heard, which gives them an idea about how to escape together (scene IV). Unfortunately the Duke comes into the room. He tells the stunned L\u00e9onor about his love, while Stradella tries to keep himself still, singing only ''a parte''. The girl rejects the Duke, and after he begins to threaten her, the singer comes out to tell the truth. Thanks to his pistol, the lovers manage to get out (Scene V).\n\n'''Act III''' is set in [[Rome]]. The first tableau depicts a dining room in a hotel. After an aria sung by Stradella (scene I), enter two gangsters, Pietro and Michael. Spadoni, who is also here to find the runaways, asks them to kill Stradella. At first they refuse, but the gold makes them more agreeble (scene II). L\u00e9onor notices Spadoni as the three leave. This makes her much alarmed (scene III). The second tableau takes place in a church. It is the [[Holy Week]]. The people pray, while Stradella speaks with inspiration on sins and atonement. The killers attend the sermon too, and the words of the singer make them to decline the affair (scene IV). Enters the Duke and declares that he has forgiven L\u00e9onor and Stradella. The whole congregation praises the Lord (scene V).\n\n== Structure ==\n*Overture\n;Act I\n:Scene I\n:*Recitative (Spadoni, Duke) \"Nous y voila Monseigneur\"\n:*Choeur de bravi (male chorus, Duke, Spadoni) \"Nos bras sont \u00e0 vous\"\n:Scene II\n:*Choeur d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves (female chorus) \"L\u00e0 du sommeil l'ange\"\n:*Romance (Stradella; L\u00e9onor at the end) \"Venise est encore au bal\"\n:*[Choeurs d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves et de bravi] (mixed chorus) \"L\u00e0 du sommeil l'ange\"\n:Scene III\n:*Recitative (L\u00e9onor, Stradella) \"C'est donc vous, Stradella\"\n:*Nocturne (L\u00e9onor, Stradella) \"A demain les delices supremes\"\n:Scene IV\n:*Recitative (Spadoni, Duke, L\u00e9onor offstage) \"Amis, la place est libre!\"\n:Scene V\n:*Choeur des sbires (male chorus, Officer, Spadoni, Duke) \"Marchons serr\u00e9s et faisons\"\n:Scene VI \u2014 Final\n:*[Choeur] (Spadoni, Les masques [mixed chorus], Les sbires) \"Ah parbleu, mes enfants\"\n;Act II\n:Scene I\n:*[Introduction]\n:*Recitative (L\u00e9onor) \"Ah!

Other tasks include starting WindowServer, launching and bootstrapping applications and setting some of the device's settings on startup.\n\n==History==\nIn 2008, with [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] release of iPhone OS 1.1.3 and the January App Pack, the SpringBoard underwent some substantial changes. Holding a finger on any application for a few seconds causes all of the icons to wiggle. From this view, you can rearrange your icons, delete [[Web application|web apps]] and web clips, and create multiple pages by dragging an application to the side of the screen. If the Home button is pressed, the icons will stop wiggling and apps can be opened again.<ref>[https://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/features/homescreen.html Apple \u2013 iPod touch features] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823040035/https://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/features/homescreen.html |date=August 23, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2008, third-party applications were introduced with iPhone OS 2.0. These applications are installed through the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and deleted with the traditional \"wiggle mode\" method.\n\nIn June 2009, in iPhone OS 3, Spotlight Search was added to the SpringBoard. This allowed the user to search for applications and other files stored in the iPhone.<ref>{{cite news |title=Welcome to iPhone OS3.0 |url=https://www.iphonelife.com/issues/Summer09/WelcomeToIphone3.0 |work=iPhone Life |date=Summer 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2010, in iOS 4, home screen wallpapers were introduced to the SpringBoard. Folders were introduced as well: dragging an application on top of another application while in \"wiggle mode\" will result in a folder being created. After that, more applications may be added to that folder by dragging an application on top of the folder. Applications can be removed from a folder by simply dragging it out into the main home screen. Folders can be removed by removing every application from the folder.\n\nOn [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken devices]], unsigned applications (applications installed through [[Cydia]]) cannot be deleted by the traditional method of holding a finger on the application and selecting delete as they are installed as System applications. Instead, they need to be removed through Cydia, unless CyDelete is installed, which allows for that method to be used.\n\nResearchers found that on mobile devices users organize icons on their SpringBoards mainly based on usage-frequency and relatedness of the applications, as well as for reasons of usability and aesthetics.<ref>Matthias B\u00f6hmer, Antonio Kr\u00fcger.

This feature was based on the SpringBoard feature in iOS software. It included the same features (like folders) but was not made as the home screen, more an extension on the dock (like [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]]).\n\nBefore the Developer Preview of [[Mac OS X Lion]], SpringBoard was renamed Launchpad. Even though the name displayed in the dock remains the same, the images used to make up Launchpad are still named \"SpringBoard\" (or \"sb\"), and can be found in {{mono|/System/Library/CoreServices/Dock.app/Contents/Resources}}.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{iOS}}\n{{OS X}}\n\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2011}}\n{{Overly detailed|date=September 2019}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''SpringBoard''' is the standard application that manages the [[iOS]] home screen. Other tasks include starting WindowServer, launching and bootstrapping applications and setting some of the device's settings on startup.\n\n==History==\nIn 2008, with [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] release of iPhone OS 1.1.3 and the January App Pack, the SpringBoard underwent some substantial changes. Holding a finger on any application for a few seconds causes all of the icons to wiggle. From this view, you can rearrange your icons, delete [[Web application|web apps]] and web clips, and create multiple pages by dragging an application to the side of the screen. If the Home button is pressed, the icons will stop wiggling and apps can be opened again.<ref>[https://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/features/homescreen.html Apple \u2013 iPod touch features] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823040035/https://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/features/homescreen.html |date=August 23, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn July 2008, third-party applications were introduced with iPhone OS 2.0. These applications are installed through the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and deleted with the traditional \"wiggle mode\" method.\n\nIn June 2009, in iPhone OS 3, Spotlight Search was added to the SpringBoard. This allowed the user to search for applications and other files stored in the iPhone.<ref>{{cite news |title=Welcome to iPhone OS3.0 |url=https://www.iphonelife.com/issues/Summer09/WelcomeToIphone3.0 |work=iPhone Life |date=Summer 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2010, in iOS 4, home screen wallpapers were introduced to the SpringBoard. Folders were introduced as well: dragging an application on top of another application while in \"wiggle mode\" will result in a folder being created. After that, more applications may be added to that folder by dragging an application on top of the folder. Applications can be removed from a folder by simply dragging it out into the main home screen. Folders can be removed by removing every application from the folder.\n\nOn [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken devices]], unsigned applications (applications installed through [[Cydia]]) cannot be deleted by the traditional method of holding a finger on the application and selecting delete as they are installed as System applications. Instead, they need to be removed through Cydia, unless CyDelete is installed, which allows for that method to be used.\n\nResearchers found that on mobile devices users organize icons on their SpringBoards mainly based on usage-frequency and relatedness of the applications, as well as for reasons of usability and aesthetics.<ref>Matthias B\u00f6hmer, Antonio Kr\u00fcger.

Jailbroken applications are however stored in /Applications, instead of Apple's native third-party application folder of /var/mobile/Applications.\n\n===Customization===\n\n====Themes====\nThe SpringBoard on jailbroken devices can be customized with [[Theme (computing)|themes]] or [[Skin (computing)|skins]].

This specification satisfies homogeneity of order 1 in prices, and is a second order approximation of any cost function.\n\nFrom this, demand equations are derived (using [[Shephard's lemma]]), but are however simpler to put in term of budget shares:\n\n:<math> w_{i}=\\alpha_{i}+\\sum_{j}\\gamma_{ij}\\log(p_{j})+\\beta_{i}\\log\\{x/P\\}</math>\n\nwith '''x''' total expenditures, <math> \\gamma_{ij}=1/2(\\gamma^*_{ij}+\\gamma^*_{ji})</math>, and '''P''' is a price index:\n: <math>\\log(P)\\equiv\\alpha_{0}+\\sum_{k}\\alpha_{k}\\log(p_{k})+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k}\\sum_{j}\\gamma_{kj}\\log(p_{k})\\log(p_{j}) </math>. \nUnder relevant constraints on the parameters <math> \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma</math>, These budget shares equations share the properties of a demand function:\n* homogeneous of degree 0 in prices and total expenditure\n* sum of budget shares add up to 1 (i.e., <math> \\sum w_i=1</math>)\n* satisfy the symmetry of the [[Slutsky equation|Slutsky matrix]]\n\n==Origin==\nFirst developed by [[Angus Deaton]] and [[John Muellbauer]], the AIDS system is derived from the \"Price Invariant Generalized Logarithmic\" (PIGLOG) model<ref>[http://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/47216/36225_tb1872c.pdf?v=42487 ''The Piglog Model''] USDA Web site</ref> which allows researchers to treat aggregate consumer behavior as if it were the outcome of a single maximizing consumer.\n\n==Applications==\n\nMany studies have used the AIDS system to determine the optimal allocation of expenditure among broad commodity groups, i.e., at high levels of commodity aggregation.\n\nIn addition, the AIDS system has been used as a brand demand system to determine optimal consumption rates for each brand using product category spending and brand prices alone.  \n<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baltas|first1=George|title=An Applied Analysis of Brand Demand Structure|journal=Applied Economics|date=2002|volume=34|issue=9|pages=1171\u20131175|doi=10.1080/00036840110085996}}</ref> Assuming weak separability of consumer preferences, the optimal allocation of expenditure among the brands of a given product category can be determined independently of the allocation of expenditure within other product categories.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=R.L.|title=Applied Demand Analysis|date=1987|publisher=Longman|location=Essex}}</ref>\n\n==Extensions of the Almost Ideal Demand System==\nAn extension of the almost ideal demand system is the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System ('''QUAIDS''') which was developed by James Banks, Richard Blundell, and Arthur Lewbel.<ref>Banks, James, Richard Blundell, and Arthur Lewbel. \"Quadratic Engel curves and consumer demand.\" Review of Economics and statistics 79.4 (1997): 527-539.</ref> It considers the existence of non-linear engel curve which is not expressed in the standard almost ideal demand system.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Demand]]\n\n\n{{Econ-stub}}\n[[Category:Microeconomics]]\n[[Category:Mathematical economics]]\n", "name_user": "Mersenne56", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed stub designation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_ideal_demand_system"}

They were born on April 29, 1978, with Mike being the elder by two minutes. The Bryans have won multiple Olympic medals, including the gold in 2012 and have won more professional games, matches, tournaments and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] than any other men's pairing. They held the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked doubles players|World No. 1]] doubles ranking jointly for 438 weeks (Mike has been ranked Men's Doubles World No. 1 for a total of 506 weeks), which is longer than anyone else in doubles history, and have also enjoyed that World No. 1 ranking together for a record 139 consecutive weeks. They have finished as the ATP year-end number 1 doubles team a record 10 times. Between 2005 and 2006, they set an Open Era record by competing in seven consecutive men's doubles Grand Slam finals.\n\nThey are also well known for celebrating winning points by chest-bumping each other.<ref>Tom Weir, [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2008-06-22-bryan-twins_N.htm Chest-bumping Bryan brothers always a twosome on, off court], ''[[USA Today]]'', June 22, 2008; retrieved November 15, 2010.</ref> Some of their success is attributed to their particular brand of twinship: the Bryans are \"[[mirror twin]]s\", where one is right-handed (Mike) and the other left-handed (Bob).<ref>''Charlie Rose Show'', [interview], [https://www.bloomberg.com/video/bob-and-mike-bryan-charlie-rose-09-09-itF10v~PRPiMsq178tux2w.html \"Bob and Mike Bryan: The Most Successful Men's Doubles\"], September 9, 2014.

Following their triumph at the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships]], the Bryans became the only doubles pairing in the Open Era to hold all four major titles at once (but not in a single season). They also won an Olympic gold during this period. They are also the only doubles team in history to have won every major title, having won all four Grand Slams, Olympic Gold, every (12 versions of the 9 tournaments) ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, the ATP World Tour Finals and the Davis Cup during their careers.\n\nThe two have won a record 119 tour titles, surpassing [[The Woodies]] (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) who won 61, and have been finalists on 59 other occasions. They have a career Super Slam and 16 Grand Slam titles overall, which is more than any men's team in the Open Era. These include victories at the Australian Open (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013), the French Open (2003, 2013), [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] (2006, 2011, 2013), and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] (2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014). They are the only doubles pairing in history to have completed the \"Double Career Grand Slam\", having won all four Grand Slam titles at least twice as a team. They won the [[ATP World Tour Finals]] doubles tournament four times (2003, 2004, 2009 and 2014).\n\nThey won the gold medal at the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]] in London and the bronze medal at the [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]].

At the season's first Grand Slam, in Melbourne, the Australian Open, the brothers won the men's Doubles final, on Saturday, January 31, defeating India's [[Mahesh Bhupathi]] and [[Mark Knowles]] from the Bahamas in three sets. The outcome was historical in that it was the first time in tennis history that siblings had won both categories of Doubles titles \u2013 men's and women's \u2013 at a Major, as [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]] had won the Women's Doubles title at the Australian Open the previous night.

Charles \"Bob\" Bryan]] and [[Mike Bryan|Michael Carl \"Mike\" Bryan]], American professional doubles tennis players, and are the most successful duo of all time. They were born on April 29, 1978, with Mike being the elder by two minutes. The Bryans have won multiple Olympic medals, including the gold in 2012 and have won more professional games, matches, tournaments and [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slams]] than any other men's pairing. They held the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked doubles players|World No. 1]] doubles ranking jointly for 438 weeks (Mike has been ranked Men's Doubles World No. 1 for a total of 506 weeks), which is longer than anyone else in doubles history, and have also enjoyed that World No. 1 ranking together for a record 139 consecutive weeks. They have finished as the ATP year-end number 1 doubles team a record 10 times. Between 2005 and 2006, they set an Open Era record by competing in seven consecutive men's doubles Grand Slam finals.\n\nThey are also well known for celebrating winning points by chest-bumping each other.<ref>Tom Weir, [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/tennis/2008-06-22-bryan-twins_N.htm Chest-bumping Bryan brothers always a twosome on, off court], ''[[USA Today]]'', June 22, 2008; retrieved November 15, 2010.</ref> Some of their success is attributed to their particular brand of twinship: the Bryans are \"[[mirror twin]]s\", where one is right-handed (Mike) and the other left-handed (Bob).<ref>''Charlie Rose Show'', [interview], [https://www.bloomberg.com/video/bob-and-mike-bryan-charlie-rose-09-09-itF10v~PRPiMsq178tux2w.html \"Bob and Mike Bryan: The Most Successful Men's Doubles\"], September 9, 2014.

Following their triumph at the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships]], the Bryans became the only doubles pairing in the Open Era to hold all four major titles at once (but not in a single season). They also won an Olympic gold during this period. They are also the only doubles team in history to have won every major title, having won all four Grand Slams, Olympic Gold, every (12 versions of the 9 tournaments) ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, the ATP World Tour Finals and the Davis Cup during their careers.\n\nThe two have won a record 119 tour titles, surpassing [[The Woodies]] (Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde) who won 61, and have been finalists on 59 other occasions. They have a career Super Slam and 16 Grand Slam titles overall, which is more than any men's team in the Open Era. These include victories at the Australian Open (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2013), the French Open (2003, 2013), [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] (2006, 2011, 2013), and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] (2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014). They are the only doubles pairing in history to have completed the \"Double Career Grand Slam\", having won all four Grand Slam titles at least twice as a team. They won the [[ATP World Tour Finals]] doubles tournament four times (2003, 2004, 2009 and 2014).\n\nThey won the gold medal at the [[Tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]] in London and the bronze medal at the [[Tennis at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]]. They won the 2007 [[Davis Cup]], along with [[Andy Roddick]] and [[James Blake (tennis)|James Blake]]. The brothers were named ATP Team of the Decade for 2000\u20132009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2009/12/Decade-In-Review-Players.aspx|title=ATP Players of the Decade 2000\u20132009|publisher=ATP Tennis|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> and for 2010\u20132019.\n\nThe twins were part of the United States [[Davis Cup]] team, with a 25\u20135 record in doubles matches, the most wins ever by a USA doubles team.

However, Nestor and Zimonji\u0107 claimed the title. Then, two weeks later, the brothers entered the [[2008 French Open]]. Their second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] of the year looked to be a strong one, however they fell to [[Pablo Cuevas]] and [[Luis Horna]] in the quarter-finals. Again, they lost at the [[2008 Queen's Club Championships]] to [[Marcelo Melo]] and [[Andr\u00e9 S\u00e1]], whom they had beaten in Hamburg. Another Grand Slam setback occurred for them at the [[2008 Wimbledon Championships]], when the twins lost in the semi-finals in a tight match against [[Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman]] and [[Kevin Ullyett]]. They played opposite each other at the Wimbledon mixed doubles final. Bob and [[Samantha Stosur]] defeated Mike and [[Katarina Srebotnik]]. The brothers played their way into tournaments, as they reached the final of the [[2008 Canada Masters]], where they lost to Nestor and Zimonji\u0107. Their losses ended at the [[2008 Cincinnati Masters]], when they came from behind to beat Bhupathi and Knowles.

At [[2014 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters|Monte Carlo]], the brothers won their 29th Masters 1000 crown and 4th consecutive Masters 1000 tournament by beating [[Ivan Dodig]] and [[Marcelo Melo]] in the final. This title marked their 98th title as a team and Mike's 100th doubles title. The twins had now won five consecutive tournaments and were on a 21 match winning streak. However, this streak came to an end in the final of the [[2014 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid Masters]] where they were defeated by [[Daniel Nestor]] and [[Nenad Zimonji\u0107]].

The environmental data are most often climate data (e.g. temperature, precipitation), but can include other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover. SDMs are used in several research areas in [[conservation biology]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]]. These models can be used to understand how environmental conditions influence the occurrence or abundance of a species, and for predictive purposes ([[ecological forecasting]]). Predictions from an SDM may be of a species\u2019 future distribution under climate change, a species\u2019 past distribution in order to assess evolutionary relationships, or the potential future distribution of an invasive species. Predictions of current and/or future habitat suitability can be useful for management applications (e.g. reintroduction or translocation of vulnerable species, reserve placement in anticipation of climate change).\n\nThere are two main types of SDMs. '''Correlative SDMs''', also known as '''climate envelope models''', '''bioclimatic models''', or '''[[resource selection function]] models''', model the observed distribution of a species as a function of environmental conditions.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" /> '''Mechanistic SDMs''', also known as '''process-based models''' or '''biophysical models''', use independently derived information about a species' physiology to develop a model of the environmental conditions under which the species can exist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Michael|last2=Porter|first2=Warren|date=2009|title=Mechanistic niche modelling: combining physiological and spatial data to predict species' ranges|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=334\u2013350|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01277.x|issn=1461-0248|pmid=19292794}}</ref>\n\nThe extent to which such modelled data reflect real-world species distributions will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, complexity, and accuracy of the models used and the quality of the available environmental data layers; the availability of sufficient and reliable species distribution data as model input; and the influence of various factors such as barriers to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], geologic history, or [[biotic interaction]]s, that increase the difference between the [[realized niche]] and the fundamental niche. Environmental niche modelling may be considered a part of the discipline of [[biodiversity informatics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|A. F. W. Schimper]] used geographical and environmental factors to explain plant distributions in his 1898 ''Pflanzengeographie auf physiologischer Grundlage'' (''Plant Geography Upon a Physiological Basis''). [[Andrew Murray (naturalist)|Andrew Murray]] used to environment to explain the distribution of mammals in his 1866 ''The Geographical Distribution of Mammals''. [[Robert Whittaker|Robert Whittaker's]] work with plants and [[Robert H. MacArthur|Robert MacArthur's]] work with birds strongly established the role the environment plays in species distributions.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" /> Elgene O. Box constructed environmental envelope models to predict the range of tree species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Box|first=Elgene O.|date=1981-05-01|title=Predicting physiognomic vegetation types with climate variables|journal=Vegetatio|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=127\u2013139|doi=10.1007/BF00119222|issn=1573-5052}}</ref> His computer simulations were among the earliest uses of species distribution modelling.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" />\n\nThe adoption of more sophisticated [[generalised linear model]]s (GLMs) made it possible to create more sophisticated and realistic species distribution models. The expansion of [[remote sensing]] and the development of [[geographical information systems|GIS-based]] environmental modelling increase the amount of environmental information available for model-building and made it easier to use.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" />\n\n== Correlative vs mechanistic models ==\n\n=== Correlative SDMs ===\nSDMs originated as correlative models. Correlative SDMs model the observed distribution of a species as a function of geographically referenced climatic predictor variables using multiple regression approaches. Given a set of geographically referred observed presences of a species and a set of climate maps, an algorithm find the most likely environmental ranges within which a species lives. Correlative SDMs assume that species are at equilibrium with their environment and that the relevant environmental variables have been adequately sampled. The models allow for interpolation between a limited number of species occurrences.\n\nFor these algorithms to be effective, it is required to gather observations not only of species presences, but also of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often \"random background\" or \"pseudo-absence\" data are used to fit these models. If there are incomplete records of species occurrences, pseudo-absences can introduce bias. Since correlative SDMs are models of a species\u2019 observed distribution, they are models of the [[realized niche]] (the environments where a species ''is'' found), as opposed to the [[fundamental niche]] (the environments where a species ''can'' be found, or where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival). For a given species, the realized and fundamental niches might be the same, but if a species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitation or species interactions, the [[realized niche]] will be smaller than the [[fundamental niche]].\n\nCorrelative SDMs are easier and faster to implement than mechanistic SDMs, and can make ready use of available data. Since they are correlative however, they do not provide much information about causal mechanisms and are not good for extrapolation. They will also be inaccurate if the observed species range is not at equilibrium (e.g. if a species has been recently introduced and is actively expanding its range).\n\n=== Mechanistic SDMs ===\nMechanistic SDMs are more recently developed. In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic SDMs use physiological information about a species (taken from controlled field or laboratory studies) to determine the range of environmental conditions within which the species can persist.<ref name=\":0\" /> These models aim to directly characterize the fundamental niche, and to project it onto the landscape. A simple model may simply identify threshold values outside of which a species can't survive. A more complex model may consist of several sub-models, e.g. [[Microclimate|micro-climate]] conditions given macro-climate conditions, body temperature given micro-climate conditions, fitness or other biological rates (e.g. survival, fecundity) given body temperature (thermal performance curves), resource or energy requirements, and [[population dynamics]]. Geographically referenced environmental data are used as model inputs. Because the species distribution predictions are independent of the species\u2019 known range, these models are especially useful for species whose range is actively shifting and not at equilibrium, such as invasive species.\n\nMechanistic SDMs incorporate causal mechanisms and are better for extrapolation and non-equilibrium situations. However, they are more labor-intensive to create than correlational models and require the collection and validation of a lot of physiological data, which may not be readily available. The models require many assumptions and parameter estimates, and they can become very complicated.\n\nDispersal, biotic interactions, and evolutionary processes present challenges, as they aren\u2019t usually incorporated into either correlative or mechanistic models. \n\nCorrelational and mechanistic models can be used in combination to gain additional insights. For example, a mechanistic model could be used to identify areas that are clearly outside the species\u2019 fundamental niche, and these areas can be marked as absences or excluded from analysis. See <ref>{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=X.|author2=Thuiller|title=Comparing niche- and process-based models to reduce prediction uncertainty in species range shifts under climate change.|journal=Ecology|year=2009|volume=90|issue=5|pages=1301\u201313|doi=10.1890/08-0134.1|pmid=19537550}}</ref> for a comparison between mechanistic and correlative models.\n\n== Niche modelling algorithms (correlative) ==\nThere are a variety of mathematical methods that can be used for fitting, selecting, and evaluating correlative SDMs. Algorithms include \"profile\" methods, which are simple statistical techniques that use e.g. environmental distance to known sites of occurrence such as [http://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/publications/software/anuclim/doc/bioclim.html BIOCLIM]<ref name=\"Nix1986a\">{{cite journal|author=Nix HA|year=1986|title=BIOCLIM \u2014 a Bioclimatic Analysis and Prediction System|journal=Research Report, CSIRO Division of Water and Land Resources|volume=1983\u20131985|pages=59\u201360}}</ref><ref name=\"Nix1986b\">{{cite book|author=Nix HA|editor=Longmore|title=Atlas of Elapid Snakes of Australia.

The environmental data are most often climate data (e.g. temperature, precipitation), but can include other variables such as soil type, water depth, and land cover. SDMs are used in several research areas in [[conservation biology]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]]. These models can be used to understand how environmental conditions influence the occurrence or abundance of a species, and for predictive purposes ([[ecological forecasting]]). Predictions from an SDM may be of a species\u2019 future distribution under climate change, a species\u2019 past distribution in order to assess evolutionary relationships, or the potential future distribution of an invasive species. Predictions of current and/or future habitat suitability can be useful for management applications (e.g. reintroduction or translocation of vulnerable species, reserve placement in anticipation of climate change).\n\nThere are two main types of SDMs. '''Correlative SDMs''', also known as '''climate envelope models''', '''bioclimatic models''', or '''[[resource selection function]] models''', model the observed distribution of a species as a function of environmental conditions.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" /> '''Mechanistic SDMs''', also known as '''process-based models''' or '''biophysical models''', use independently derived information about a species' physiology to develop a model of the environmental conditions under which the species can exist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Michael|last2=Porter|first2=Warren|date=2009|title=Mechanistic niche modelling: combining physiological and spatial data to predict species' ranges|journal=Ecology Letters|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=334\u2013350|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01277.x|issn=1461-0248|pmid=19292794}}</ref>\n\nThe extent to which such modelled data reflect real-world species distributions will depend on a number of factors, including the nature, complexity, and accuracy of the models used and the quality of the available environmental data layers; the availability of sufficient and reliable species distribution data as model input; and the influence of various factors such as barriers to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]], geologic history, or [[biotic interaction]]s, that increase the difference between the [[realized niche]] and the fundamental niche. Environmental niche modelling may be considered a part of the discipline of [[biodiversity informatics]].\n\n== History ==\n[[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|A. F. W. Schimper]] used geographical and environmental factors to explain plant distributions in his 1898 ''Pflanzengeographie auf physiologischer Grundlage'' (''Plant Geography Upon a Physiological Basis''). [[Andrew Murray (naturalist)|Andrew Murray]] used to environment to explain the distribution of mammals in his 1866 ''The Geographical Distribution of Mammals''. [[Robert Whittaker|Robert Whittaker's]] work with plants and [[Robert H. MacArthur|Robert MacArthur's]] work with birds strongly established the role the environment plays in species distributions.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" /> Elgene O. Box constructed environmental envelope models to predict the range of tree species<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Box|first=Elgene O.|date=1981-05-01|title=Predicting physiognomic vegetation types with climate variables|journal=Vegetatio|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=127\u2013139|doi=10.1007/BF00119222|issn=1573-5052}}</ref>. His computer simulations were among the earliest uses of species distribution modelling.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" />\n\nThe adoption of more sophisticated [[generalised linear model]]s (GLMs) made it possible to create more sophisticated and realistic species distribution models. The expansion of [[remote sensing]] and the development of [[geographical information systems|GIS-based]] environmental modelling increase the amount of environmental information available for model-building and made it easier to use.<ref name=\"Elith & Leathwick\" />\n\n== Correlative vs mechanistic models ==\n\n=== Correlative SDMs ===\nSDMs originated as correlative models. Correlative SDMs model the observed distribution of a species as a function of geographically referenced climatic predictor variables using multiple regression approaches. Given a set of geographically referred observed presences of a species and a set of climate maps, an algorithm find the most likely environmental ranges within which a species lives. Correlative SDMs assume that species are at equilibrium with their environment and that the relevant environmental variables have been adequately sampled. The models allow for interpolation between a limited number of species occurrences.\n\nFor these algorithms to be effective, it is required to gather observations not only of species presences, but also of absences, that is, where the species does not live. Records of species absences are typically not as common as records of presences, thus often \"random background\" or \"pseudo-absence\" data are used to fit these models. If there are incomplete records of species occurrences, pseudo-absences can introduce bias. Since correlative SDMs are models of a species\u2019 observed distribution, they are models of the [[realized niche]] (the environments where a species ''is'' found), as opposed to the [[fundamental niche]] (the environments where a species ''can'' be found, or where the abiotic environment is appropriate for the survival). For a given species, the realized and fundamental niches might be the same, but if a species is geographically confined due to dispersal limitation or species interactions, the [[realized niche]] will be smaller than the [[fundamental niche]].\n\nCorrelative SDMs are easier and faster to implement than mechanistic SDMs, and can make ready use of available data. Since they are correlative however, they do not provide much information about causal mechanisms and are not good for extrapolation. They will also be inaccurate if the observed species range is not at equilibrium (e.g. if a species has been recently introduced and is actively expanding its range).\n\n=== Mechanistic SDMs ===\nMechanistic SDMs are more recently developed. In contrast to correlative models, mechanistic SDMs use physiological information about a species (taken from controlled field or laboratory studies) to determine the range of environmental conditions within which the species can persist.<ref name=\":0\" /> These models aim to directly characterize the fundamental niche, and to project it onto the landscape. A simple model may simply identify threshold values outside of which a species can't survive. A more complex model may consist of several sub-models, e.g. [[Microclimate|micro-climate]] conditions given macro-climate conditions, body temperature given micro-climate conditions, fitness or other biological rates (e.g. survival, fecundity) given body temperature (thermal performance curves), resource or energy requirements, and [[population dynamics]]. Geographically referenced environmental data are used as model inputs. Because the species distribution predictions are independent of the species\u2019 known range, these models are especially useful for species whose range is actively shifting and not at equilibrium, such as invasive species.\n\nMechanistic SDMs incorporate causal mechanisms and are better for extrapolation and non-equilibrium situations. However, they are more labor-intensive to create than correlational models and require the collection and validation of a lot of physiological data, which may not be readily available. The models require many assumptions and parameter estimates, and they can become very complicated.\n\nDispersal, biotic interactions, and evolutionary processes present challenges, as they aren\u2019t usually incorporated into either correlative or mechanistic models. \n\nCorrelational and mechanistic models can be used in combination to gain additional insights. For example, a mechanistic model could be used to identify areas that are clearly outside the species\u2019 fundamental niche, and these areas can be marked as absences or excluded from analysis.

Sparty is usually depicted as a muscular male [[Sparta]]n warrior/athlete dressed in stylized [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] costume. After changing the team name from \"Aggies\" to \"Spartans\" in 1925, various incarnations of a Spartan warrior with a prominent chin appeared at university events and in university literature. In 1943, MSU art professor [[Leonard D. Jungwirth]] designed a statue for the university, which had to be cast in [[terra cotta]] because of [[World War II]] rationing. In 2005, the university replaced Jungwirth's original statue with a bronze replica, moving the original indoors to protect it from the elements.\n\nSparty appears in several other incarnations. In printed literature, the university uses a copyrighted [[cartoon]] Spartan, usually drawn with a grimace and several days worth of whiskers, lending the nickname of \"Gruff\" Sparty. Finally, Sparty appears as a [[foam rubber]] mascot with an oversized head. The mascot costume, worn by an anonymous student, appears at most university sporting, alumni, and [[fundraising]] events; he is often portrayed in MSU notices and materials.\n\n==History==\nThough MSU is now a large university, in the 19th century it was a small [[agriculture|agricultural]] college known as the State Agricultural College of Michigan. Thus, when the college fielded its first intercollegiate sports teams in the 1880s, the teams were appropriately named the \"Aggies\". By 1925, the school had expanded beyond agriculture, becoming Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. To reduce the emphasis on agriculture, the college held a contest to choose a new team name. The chosen entry was the \"Michigan Staters.\"  George S. Alderton, then sports editor of the ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'', and Dale Stafford, sportswriter for the ''Lansing Capitol News'', felt the name was too unwieldy for newspaper headlines and searched the contest entries for a better choice.<ref>[http://enlightenedspartan.com/history/history.htm \"The Spartans &ndash; The Nickname.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509125549/http://www.enlightenedspartan.com/history/history.htm |date=2008-05-09 }} The Enlightened Spartan, Accessed August 16, 2008.</ref> They settled on the \"[[Spartan Army|Spartans]]\", a name submitted by former Aggie athlete Perry J. Fremont. Alderton and Stafford began using the name in their game accounts, and it soon caught on as the ''[[de facto]]'' team name.<ref name=\"Stanford\">{{Cite book|author=Stanford, Linda | title=MSU Campus: Buildings, Places, Spaces | location=East Lansing, Michigan| publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=2002 | isbn=0-87013-631-3}}</ref> Michigan State's teams have been the Spartans ever since.\n\n==Costumed mascot==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ncaa football sparty.jpg|thumb|250px|Sparty on the NCAA 09 for Wii cover.]] -->\nWhile MSU students and [[alumnus|alumni]] often refer to the ''Spartan'' statue as Sparty, the incarnation of Sparty with national visibility is that of a [[costume]]d [[mascot]] who appears at athletic events and other university-related functions. The first mascot appeared in 1955 and was a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Spartan head made by Theta Xi fraternity brothers Donald Pais, Kenneth Roberts, and Don Bauer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sparty History|url=https://alumni.msu.edu/traditions/sparty/history.cfm|website=MSU Alumni Association|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> By the 1956 Rose Bowl Game, the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head had been replaced by a fiberglass version that was thirty pounds lighter. In 1985, MSU Alumni Association Graphic Designer Dave Giordan was asked to draw a muscular Sparty in full body armor. Four years later, in 1989, a group came together to design and revamp the Sparty mascot. Research was conducted on Michigan State\u2019s mission, community, and traditions. The result was an \u201capproachable, fierce yet kind, man for all seasons\u201d mascot. Sparty would reflect the university\u2019s strength and character. To introduce MSU's new mascot, six billboards were positioned around East Lansing announcing his Spartan Stadium debut. The costume, with a [[cartoon]]ishly oversized [[head]], bulging [[muscle]]s, and a facial expression that treads a fine line between cute and pugnacious, was introduced to MSU fans during the 1989 [[American football|football]] season.  Sparty was an immediate hit, in part because the foam-rubber body parts, vinyl breastplate, and skirt have a freedom of movement that allow the [[anonymity|anonymous]] student who portrays Sparty to be quite expressive despite the costume's fixed stare. The student that portrays Sparty is a volunteer, despite rumors of financial compensation or a full scholarship.<ref name=\"Stanford\"/> Early every calendar year, tryouts are held for the student to portray Sparty for the upcoming school year.\nSparty represents an ancient [[Spartan army|Spartan]] warrior, but wears a late [[Imperial helmet|Imperial-style]] [[Roman legion|Roman legionary's helmet]], which was not invented until several centuries after [[Sparta]] was subdued by the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nSparty can be found entertaining MSU sporting event crowds with his antics during games. He is even lifted upon the shoulders of cheerleaders and does one-handed push ups. Besides sporting events, Sparty also attends many events around campus, the community, and the country throughout the year: alumni functions, charity events, weddings, bar mitzvahs, parades, and many other university events. Any revenues generated go to the upkeep of the Sparty Mascot Program, which is funded mainly by the MSU Alumni Association.<ref name=\"MSU Alumni Association\">{{cite web|title=Sparty Mascot Program|url=http://www.alumni.msu.edu/sparty|website=MSU Alumni Association|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref><ref>Bao, Robert. \"[http://msuspartans.cstv.com/trads/msu-trads-mascot.html MEET SPARTY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121072443/http://msuspartans.cstv.com/trads/msu-trads-mascot.html |date=2007-11-21 }}\".

Sparty is usually depicted as a muscular male [[Sparta]]n warrior/athlete dressed in stylized [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] costume. After changing the team name from \"Aggies\" to \"Spartans\" in 1925, various incarnations of a Spartan warrior with a prominent chin appeared at university events and in university literature. In 1943, MSU art professor [[Leonard D. Jungwirth]] designed a statue for the university, which had to be cast in [[terra cotta]] because of [[World War II]] rationing. In 2005, the university replaced Jungwirth's original statue with a bronze replica, moving the original indoors to protect it from the elements.\n\nSparty appears in several other incarnations. In printed literature, the university uses a copyrighted [[cartoon]] Spartan, usually drawn with a grimace and several days worth of whiskers, lending the nickname of \"Gruff\" Sparty. Finally, Sparty appears as a [[foam rubber]] mascot with an oversized head. The mascot costume, worn by an anonymous student, appears at most university sporting, alumni, and [[fundraising]] events; he is often portrayed in MSU notices and materials.\n\n==History==\nThough MSU is now a large university, in the 19th century it was a small [[agriculture|agricultural]] college known as the State Agricultural College of Michigan. Thus, when the college fielded its first intercollegiate sports teams in the 1880s, the teams were appropriately named the \"Aggies\". By 1925, the school had expanded beyond agriculture, becoming Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science. To reduce the emphasis on agriculture, the college held a contest to choose a new team name. The chosen entry was the \"Michigan Staters.\"  George S. Alderton, then sports editor of the ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'', and Dale Stafford, sportswriter for the ''Lansing Capitol News'', felt the name was too unwieldy for newspaper headlines and searched the contest entries for a better choice.<ref>[http://enlightenedspartan.com/history/history.htm \"The Spartans &ndash; The Nickname.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509125549/http://www.enlightenedspartan.com/history/history.htm |date=2008-05-09 }} The Enlightened Spartan, Accessed August 16, 2008.</ref> They settled on the \"[[Spartan Army|Spartans]]\", a name submitted by former Aggie athlete Perry J. Fremont. Alderton and Stafford began using the name in their game accounts, and it soon caught on as the ''[[de facto]]'' team name.<ref name=\"Stanford\">{{Cite book|author=Stanford, Linda | title=MSU Campus: Buildings, Places, Spaces | location=East Lansing, Michigan| publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=2002 | isbn=0-87013-631-3}}</ref> Michigan State's teams have been the Spartans ever since.\n\n==Costumed mascot==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ncaa football sparty.jpg|thumb|250px|Sparty on the NCAA 09 for Wii cover.]] -->\nWhile MSU students and [[alumnus|alumni]] often refer to the ''Spartan'' statue as Sparty, the incarnation of Sparty with national visibility is that of a [[costume]]d [[mascot]] who appears at athletic events and other university-related functions. The first mascot appeared in 1955 and was a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 Spartan head made by Theta Xi fraternity brothers Donald Pais, Kenneth Roberts, and Don Bauer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sparty History|url=https://alumni.msu.edu/traditions/sparty/history.cfm|website=MSU Alumni Association|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> By the 1956 Rose Bowl Game, the papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 head had been replaced by a fiberglass version that was thirty pounds lighter. In 1985, MSU Alumni Association Graphic Designer Dave Giordan was asked to draw a muscular Sparty in full body armor. Four years later, in 1989, a group came together to design and revamp the Sparty mascot. Research was conducted on Michigan State\u2019s mission, community, and traditions. The result was an \u201capproachable, fierce yet kind, man for all seasons\u201d mascot. Sparty would reflect the university\u2019s strength and character. To introduce MSU's new mascot, six billboards were positioned around East Lansing announcing his Spartan Stadium debut. The costume, with a [[cartoon]]ishly oversized [[head]], bulging [[muscle]]s, and a facial expression that treads a fine line between cute and pugnacious, was introduced to MSU fans during the 1989 [[American football|football]] season.  Sparty was an immediate hit, in part because the foam-rubber body parts, vinyl breastplate, and skirt have a freedom of movement that allow the [[anonymity|anonymous]] student who portrays Sparty to be quite expressive despite the costume's fixed stare. The student that portrays Sparty is a volunteer, despite rumors of financial compensation or a full scholarship.<ref name=\"Stanford\"/> Early every calendar year, tryouts are held for the student to portray Sparty for the upcoming school year.\nSparty represents an ancient [[Spartan army|Spartan]] warrior, but wears a late [[Imperial helmet|Imperial-style]] [[Roman legion|Roman legionary's helmet]], which was not invented until several centuries after [[Sparta]] was subdued by the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nSparty can be found entertaining MSU sporting event crowds with his antics during games. He is even lifted upon the shoulders of cheerleaders and does one-handed push ups. Besides sporting events, Sparty also attends many events around campus, the community, and the country throughout the year: alumni functions, charity events, weddings, bar mitzvahs, parades, and many other university events. Any revenues generated go to the upkeep of the Sparty Mascot Program, which is funded mainly by the MSU Alumni Association<ref name=\"MSU Alumni Association\">{{cite web|title=Sparty Mascot Program|url=http://www.alumni.msu.edu/sparty|website=MSU Alumni Association|accessdate=November 3, 2017}}</ref>.<ref>Bao, Robert. \"[http://msuspartans.cstv.com/trads/msu-trads-mascot.html MEET SPARTY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121072443/http://msuspartans.cstv.com/trads/msu-trads-mascot.html |date=2007-11-21 }}\".

Pete''' is the son of longtime Disney antagonist [[Pete (Disney)|Pete]] who first appears in the 1942 short \"[[Bellboy Donald]]\" as '''Pete Junior''', and was later reinvented as his modern incarnation in the 1992 animated TV series ''[[Goof Troop]]'', in which he featured prominently along with his mother Peg and younger sister Pistol. He also appears as a supporting character in the 1995 film ''[[A Goofy Movie]]'' and its 2000 sequel ''[[An Extremely Goofy Movie]].'' He was voiced by [[Clarence Nash]] in the original short and [[Rob Paulsen]] in all later appearances.\n\n==Background==\nIn all his appearances, P.J. is [[Max Goof]]'s best friend. Like Max, P.J ages throughout each of his appearances. P.J is shown to be nervous, insecure and often fears punishment from his father Pete. His relationship with his father is consistently shown to be based on fear and control as a stark contrast to the much more loving relationship between Max and Goofy, with him often calling his father \"sir.\"\nThough he is not usually the one to come up with ideas, P.J is shown to be helpful, polite, sensitive, honest and hard-working, and is usually the one to consider potential consequences. Physically he is strong and tough, capable of performing a lot of manual labor \u2013 a fact regularly exploited by his lazier father. He's also been shown to possess a pocketknife in Goof Troop. He enjoys casual sports like bike-riding and skateboarding, and video games and watching television but his father often bullies him into activities that are much more stereotypically 'manly'.\n\nHe is drawn to look very similar to his father, though less bulky. Due to the contrast between their personalities, he also has a far more genial appearance to his face. Throughout the series and movies he becomes increasingly larger in size, although he does not actually become fatter.\n\nP.J. is almost the complete opposite of his father behavior-wise. He often displays fear of his father, of spending time with him, and of disobeying or failing him. Pete seems to interpret this fear as respect. P.J. is eager to leave, and their father-son relationship clearly revolves around fear and control. With this thrown into even starker relief when compared to the much healthier relationship between Max and Goofy, it is speculated (though never confirmed) that Pete may be physically as well as emotionally abusive towards P.J.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Bellboy Donald===\nA early version of Pete Junior appears as the main antagonist in \"Bellboy Donald\".  Junior has a much more similar personality to Pete than the modern incarnation, and is bratty, provocative, and conniving.  His appearance is different, however, as he is much smaller and has larger ears.\n\n===''Goof Troop''===\nIn ''[[Goof Troop]]'', P.J is 11 years old and lives next door to Goofy and Max. Throughout the series P.J.'s relationship with his father Pete is clearly based on fear and control, with P.J often being bullied into doing thankless chores, manipulated, insulted and punished over minor failings. It is far more frequent for P.J to be shown to fear his father than to love him, and he repeatedly displays a strong need for his father's approval despite his fear. In the first episode, P.J gloomily tells Max that he is not allowed to play with anything in his room because they are all collector's items bought by Pete. In the second, Pete forbids him to play with Max. In one episode, P.J is shown counting down the days until he can leave home. In another, Pete actually pretends he is seriously ill to manipulate P.J into doing his job just to get a day off work.\n\nP.J. is usually seen hanging out with Max, and at one point, P.J states that Max is the only friend that he has ever had. P.J is usually talked into assisting with Max's schemes, but does prove himself to be brave whenever Max or even his father really need him. He also shows a lot more self-control than Pete, capable of understanding when a plan is going too far and when it's sensible to concede defeat.\n\n===''A Goofy Movie''===\nIn ''A Goofy Movie'', P.J is a high school-aged teenager and helps Max to try and impress Roxanne by videotaping him dance along to Powerline's new song, even though he was terrified of doing so in case his dad found out (which he did). While leaving the principal's office after they are caught he drones, \"Oh man, my dad is gonna smash me like a bug.\"\nAfter school is let out, he later appears briefly, when Max and Goofy are in the woods, cleaning up Pete's RV with a floor-buffer. Max is shown to envy P.J as he gets to travel in Pete's luxurious RV, but P.J tells Max that he is the lucky one because everyone in town has heard that Max will be on stage with Powerline. Max reveals to P.J that it was a lie to impress Roxanne and has not told Goofy about it.\n\nPete and P.J meet up with Goofy & Max again when they stop off at a motel. During this time, Max confides in P.J that he has changed the map to go to L.A. Their discussion is overheard by Pete, who tells Goofy. He makes a final, very brief appearance when Max is on stage, cleaning the R.V while watching Max on TV. Even though the series ''Goof Troop'' gave all characters equal importance throughout the show, P.J. and Pete's roles were heavily overshadowed by Goofy and Max's.\n\n===''An Extremely Goofy Movie''===\nIn ''An Extremely Goofy Movie'', P.J. is a college-aged teenager. He gains more size, being almost as big as Pete and almost as tall as Goofy. P.J. is seen prominently throughout the movie, sharing a dorm with Max and Bobby, as well as being on their team for the College X Games. He, Max and Bobby travel to college in Bobby's van. When they arrive, they are followed by Bradley Uppercrust III, college X Games 'king' to a caf\u00e9 called the Bean Scene, with an offer for Max to join, but not P.J. and Bobby. Max declines. When Tank, Bradley's right-hand-man, threatens Bobby, P.J. defends him with a biscotti, and later remarks \"Moo, Moo?! Who'd want to join a herd of cows?!\" when he hears the name of Bradley's fraternity (Gamma Mu Mu), which is punished by Tank giving him a wedgie. His personality doesn't really change until he meets the Beret Girl at the disco. After speaking poetically to her (which surprises Max & Bobby) she asks him to dance. After this, he becomes a sort of beatnik, and his casual clothes change from blue T-shirt and green shorts to black turtle neck, black trousers and a beret. He and his team make it to the finals, but P.J can't participate in the final race because Bradley straps rockets to his boots and blasts him out of the arena. His best event is shown to be bike riding. P.J. is seen at the very end of the film reading poetry to Beret Girl.\n\n===''DuckTales''===\nP.J. appears in a cameo in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode \"Quack Pack\", in one of Goofy's wallet photos.\n\n==Appearances in other media==\n===Video games===\nHe appeared in the ''[[Goof Troop (video game)|Goof Troop]]'' video game released on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] gaming system. In the game, P.J. and Pete are captured by pirates, and Goofy and Max must save them. P.J. has a minor, [[Non-player character|NPC]] role.\n\n===Comic books===\nP.J.'s first comic book appearance was in [[Disney Comics (company)|Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]] No. 21 (June 1942), which was an adaptation of the cartoon \"Bellboy Donald\". He also appeared in several of the comic strips based upon the series Goof Troop, as well as the 1996 comic book adaptation of ''A Goofy Movie''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coa.inducks.org/character.php?c=PJ&view=4&c1=date |title=PJ |publisher=Coa.inducks.org |accessdate=6 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Merchandise==\nIn 1991, [[Kellogg's]] had a P.J. figure as part of a set of ''Goof Troop'' 2.5\" figures that could be found in packs of their cereal. Kellogg's also released ''Goof Troop'' 'squirters', that squirted water when squeezed, as part of a set that could be obtained by buying their cereal, and sending them the proof of purchase and money for shipping. In 1992, [[Burger King]] released a figure of P.J., as part of their 'Goof Troop Bowlers' set, that when pulled back, would race forward. Other merchandise made of P.J. include a 'bendem', which was part of a set that also included Max, [[Goofy]], and Pistol.

Maryland Steel Company established the Sparrow's Point yard in 1889, and it delivered its first ship in 1891. Bethlehem Steel Corporation acquired the Sparrow's Point shipyard in 1917. During the mid-twentieth century, [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel Shipbuilding]] (BethShip)'s Sparrow's Point yard was one of the most active shipbuilders in the United States, delivering 116 ships in the seven-year period between 1939 and 1946.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bethlehem Steel invested millions of dollars in upgrades and improvements to the Sparrow's Point yard, making it one of the most modern shipbuilding facilities in the country. This included the construction of a large [[dry dock#Graving|graving dock]] to allow for the construction of [[supertanker]]s up to {{convert|1200|ft|m}} in length and {{convert|265,000|ST|t}} (gross) in size.\n\nBethlehem Steel lurched from one financial crisis to another throughout the 1980s and 1990s, selling the Sparrow's Point yard to Baltimore Marine Industries Inc., a subsidiary of Veritas Capital, in 1997 as part of an unsuccessful restructuring attempt. Baltimore Marine operated the facility as a ship repair and refurbishment yard until 2003, when Baltimore Marine Industries collapsed in bankruptcy.\n\nThe Sparrow's Point shipyard complex was sold at auction to Barletta Industries Inc. in 2004. Barletta is attempting a redevelopment of the site for use as a business and technology park, and plans to revive shipbuilding on at least part of the site, making use of the modern graving dock added in the 1970s.\n\n==Liquefied natural gas==\nIn 2007, the international energy company [[AES Corporation]] applied to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for a certificate to build and operate a [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) terminal at Sparrow's Point.

Maryland Steel Company established the Sparrow's Point yard in 1889, and it delivered its first ship in 1891. Bethlehem Steel Corporation acquired the Sparrow's Point shipyard in 1917. During the mid-twentieth century, [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation|Bethlehem Steel Shipbuilding]] (BethShip)'s Sparrow's Point yard was one of the most active shipbuilders in the United States, delivering 116 ships in the seven-year period between 1939 and 1946.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Bethlehem Steel invested millions of dollars in upgrades and improvements to the Sparrow's Point yard, making it one of the most modern shipbuilding facilities in the country. This included the construction of a large [[dry dock#Graving|graving dock]] to allow for the construction of [[supertanker]]s up to {{convert|1200|ft|m}} in length and {{convert|265,000|ST|t}} (gross) in size.\n\nBethlehem Steel lurched from one financial crisis to another throughout the 1980s and 1990s, selling the Sparrow's Point yard to Baltimore Marine Industries Inc., a subsidiary of Veritas Capital, in 1997 as part of an unsuccessful restructuring attempt. Baltimore Marine operated the facility as a ship repair and refurbishment yard until 2003, when Baltimore Marine Industries collapsed in bankruptcy.\n\nThe Sparrow's Point shipyard complex was sold at auction to Barletta Industries Inc. in 2004. Barletta is attempting a redevelopment of the site for use as a business and technology park, and plans to revive shipbuilding on at least part of the site, making use of the modern graving dock added in the 1970s.\n\n==Liquefied natural gas==\nIn 2007, the international energy company [[AES Corporation]] applied to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] for a certificate to build and operate a [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) terminal at Sparrow's Point. The AES Sparrow's Point LNG development would consist of three 160,000-cubic meter storage tanks and vessel offloading systems for LNG tankers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aessparrowspointlng.com/|title=\u539a\u6728\u30a8\u30ea\u30a2\u3067\u9593\u9055\u3044\u306a\u3044\u6d77\u8fd1\u304f\u306e\u4e00\u6238\u5efa\u3066\u3092\u5efa\u3066\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306b\u5b88\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3001\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u304a\u304f\u3079\u304d\u8c46\u77e5\u8b58 -|website=www.aessparrowspointlng.com}}</ref> AES would also construct a new natural gas pipeline, the Mid-Atlantic Express, which would run north from Maryland into [[Pennsylvania]], crossing under the [[Susquehanna River]] to connect with existing natural gas pipelines.

The plot revolves around three [[gunslinger]]s competing to find fortune in a buried cache of [[Confederate gold]] amid the violent chaos of the [[American Civil War]] (specifically the [[New Mexico Campaign]] in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way.<ref name=\"Yezbick\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Yezbick |first=Daniel |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly |encyclopedia=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture |publisher=Gale Group |year=2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |accessdate=23 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012154144/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |archivedate=12 October 2007}}</ref> The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef.\n\n''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was marketed as the third and final instalment in the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'', following ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.

''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' is now seen as one of the greatest and most influential [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], a trio of [[bounty hunter]]s attempt to kill fugitive [[Mexican people|Mexican]] bandit Tuco Ram\u00edrez. Tuco shoots the three bounty hunters and escapes on horseback. Elsewhere, [[mercenary]] Angel Eyes interrogates former [[Army of New Mexico|Confederate]] soldier Stevens, whom Angel Eyes is contracted to kill, about Jackson, a fugitive who stole a cache of [[Confederate gold]]. Angel Eyes makes Stevens tell him the new name Jackson is using: Bill Carson. Stevens offers Angel Eyes $1,000 to kill Baker, Angel Eyes's employer. Angel Eyes accepts the new commission, but also kills Stevens as he leaves, fulfilling his contract with Baker. He then returns to Baker, collects his fee for killing Stevens, and then, shoots Baker, fulfilling his commission from Stevens. Meanwhile, Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by a nameless drifter whom Tuco refers to as \"[[Man with No Name|Blondie]]\", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs Tuco's noose by shooting it, and sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. Tuco manages to walk to a village, and then tracks Blondie to a town occupied by Confederate troops. Tuco holds Blondie at gunpoint, planning to force him to hang himself, but [[Department of New Mexico|Union]] forces shell the town, allowing Blondie to escape.\n\nFollowing an arduous search, Tuco recaptures Blondie and force-marches him across a [[desert]] until Blondie collapses from [[dehydration]]. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in [[Sad Hill Cemetery]]<!-- Please do not change this to Sand Hill. The subtitles and closed captions both are written Sad. See talk page for further discussion -->. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died and Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson recovered and told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco, who now has strong motivation to keep Blondie alive, gives him water and takes him to a nearby [[Catholic missionary|frontier mission]], where his brother is the Abbot, to recover.\n\nAfter Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, only to be captured by Union soldiers and remanded to the [[prisoner of war camp]] of Batterville. At roll call, Tuco answers for \"Bill Carson\", getting the attention of Angel Eyes, now a disguised Union [[sergeant]] at the camp. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Realizing that Blondie will not yield to torture, Angel Eyes offers him an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes.\n\n[[File:Mexican standoff.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.36|The iconic [[Mexican standoff]], with Tuco seen on the left, Angel Eyes in the middle, and Blondie on the right. The scene is accompanied by [[Ennio Morricone]]'s \"The Trio\".]]\n\nBlondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town. Tuco, having fled to the same town, takes a bath in a ramshackle hotel and is surprised by Elam, one of the three bounty hunters who tried to kill him. Tuco shoots Elam, causing Blondie to investigate the gunshots. He finds Tuco, and they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but discover that Angel Eyes himself has escaped.\n\nTuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by Union troops on one side of a strategic bridge, with Confederates on the other. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies to allow access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with [[Explosive material|explosives]], Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse, and Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. He finds Arch Stanton's grave and begins digging. Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. A moment later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing only a skeleton, no gold. Blondie states that he lied about the name on the grave, and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock. Placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, he challenges Tuco and Angel Eyes to a [[Truel|three-way duel]].\n\nThe trio stare each other down. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked \"Unknown\". Tuco is initially elated to find bags of gold, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint and orders him into a [[hangman's noose]] beneath a tree. Blondie binds Tuco's hands and forces him to stand balanced precariously atop an unsteady grave marker while he takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. Blondie severs the rope with a rifle shot, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== The trio ===\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as \"Blondie\" (a.k.a. the [[Man with No Name]]): The Good, a taciturn, confident [[bounty hunter]] who teams up with Tuco, and Angel Eyes temporarily, to find the buried gold. Blondie and Tuco have an [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. In spite of this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the War is evident. \"I've never seen so many men wasted so badly,\" he remarks. He also comforts a dying soldier by laying his coat over him and letting him smoke his cigar. ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' had ended its run as a series in 1966, and at that point neither ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' nor ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' had been released in the United States. When Leone offered Clint Eastwood a role in his next movie, it was the only big film offer he had; however, Eastwood still needed to be convinced to do it. Leone and his wife travelled to California to persuade him. Two days later, he agreed to make the film upon being paid $250,000<ref name=\"Hughes12\">Hughes, p.12</ref> and getting 10% of the profits from the North American markets\u2014a deal with which Leone was not happy.<ref>[[Sergio Leone]], C'era una volta il Cinema. [[Radio 24 (Italy)|Radio 24]]. Retrieved on 17 September 2014.</ref> In the original Italian script for the film, he is named \"Joe\" (his nickname in ''A Fistful of Dollars''), but is referred to as Blondie in the Italian and English dialogue.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n* [[Lee Van Cleef]] as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, confident, borderline-sadistic mercenary that takes a pleasure in killing, who always finishes a job he is paid for; usually tracking and assassination. When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and has Tuco tortured, eventually learning the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance. Originally, Leone wanted [[Enrico Maria Salerno]] (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the ''Dollars Trilogy'' films)<ref name=Cox /> or [[Charles Bronson]] to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: \"I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in ''For a Few Dollars More''. The idea of getting him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> In the original working script, Angel Eyes was named \"Banjo\", but is referred to as \"Sentenza\" (meaning \"Sentence\" or \"Judgement\") in the Italian version. Eastwood came up with the name Angel Eyes on the set, for his gaunt appearance and expert marksmanship.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as Tuco Benedicto Pac\u00edfico Juan Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez (known as \"The Rat\" according to Blondie): The Ugly, a fast-talking, comically oafish yet also cunning, cagey, resilient and resourceful [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[bandit]] who is wanted by the authorities for a long list of crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie. The director originally considered [[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with \"natural comic talent\". In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), in particular, his performance in \"The Railroads\" scene.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> In Los Angeles, Leone met Wallach, who was sceptical about playing this type of character again, but after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from ''For a Few Dollars More'', Wallach said: \"When do you want me?\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> The two men got along famously, sharing the same bizarre sense of humor. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realized that the character of Tuco was close to Leone's heart, and the director and Wallach became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, \"Tuco is the only one of the trio the audience gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. But Clint's and Lee's characters remain mysteries.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco, The Bad.<ref name=\"Hughes15\">Hughes, p.15</ref> This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates to \"The Good [one], the Ugly [one], the Bad [one]\".\n\n=== Supporting cast ===\n{{columnslist|\n* [[Aldo Giuffr\u00e8]] as Alcoholic Union Captain Clinton\n* [[Mario Brega]] as Corporal Wallace\n* [[Luigi Pistilli]] as Father Pablo Ram\u00edrez\n* [[Al Mulock]] as Elam, one-Armed Bounty Hunter\n* [[Antonio Casas]] as Stevens\n* [[Antonio Casale]] as Jackson/Bill Carson\n* [[Antonio Molino Rojo]] as Captain Harper\n* [[Rada Rassimov]] as Maria\n* [[Enzo Petito]] as Storekeeper\n* [[Chelo Alonso]] as Stevens' Wife\n* [[Claudio Scarchilli]] as Mexican Peon\n* [[John Bartha]] as Sheriff\n* [[Livio Lorenzon]] as Baker\n* [[Sandro Scarchilli]] as Mexican Peon\n* [[Benito Stefanelli]] as Member of Angel Eyes' Gang\n* Angelo Novi as Monk\n* [[Aldo Sambrell]] as Member of Angel Eyes' Gang\n* Sergio Mendiz\u00e1bal as Blonde Bounty Hunter\n* [[Lorenzo Robledo]] as Clem\n* Richard Alagich as Soldato Unione all'Arresto\n* [[Fortunato Arena]] as 1st Sombrero Onlooker at Tuco's 1st Hanging\n* [[Rom\u00e1n Ariznavarreta]] as Bounty Hunter\n* Silvana Bacci as Messicana con Biondo\n* Joseph Bradley as Old Soldier\n* [[Frank Bra\u00f1a]] as Bounty Hunter #2\n* Amerigo Castrighella as 2nd Sombrero Onlooker at Tuco's 1st Hanging\n* Saturno Cerra as Bounty Hunter\n* [[Luigi Ciavarro]] as Member of Angel Eyes' Gang\n* William Conroy as Confederate Soldier\n* Antonio Contreras as Violinista al Campo\n* Axel Darna as Soldato Confederato Morente\n* Tony Di Mitri as Deputy\n* Alberigo Donadeo as Spettatore Prima Impiccagione\n* [[Attilio Dottesio]] as 3rd Sombrero Onlooker at Tuco's 1st Hanging\n* Luis Fern\u00e1ndez de Eribe as Soldier Coat\n* [[Veriano Ginesi]] as Bald Onlooker at Tuco's 1st Hanging\n* [[Joyce Gordon]] as Maria (voice)\n* [[Bernard Grant|Bernie Grant]] as Clinton \u2013 Alcoholic Union Captain (voice)\n* [[Jes\u00fas Guzm\u00e1n (actor)|Jes\u00fas Guzm\u00e1n]] as Pardue the Hotel Owner\n* [[V\u00edctor Israel]] as Sergeant at Confederate Fort\n* [[Nazzareno Natale]] as Mexican Bounty Hunter\n* [[Ricardo Palacios]] as Barista a Socorro\n* Antonio Palombi as Vecchio Sergente\n* Julio Mart\u00ednez Piernavieja as Corista al Campo<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.tuvozenpinares.com/articulo/sociedad/sei-attenti-tutti-pronti/20151202163350006832.html |title=\"\u00a1Sei attenti! \u00a1Tutti pronti\"\u2026 |date=2 December 2015 |access-date=19 November 2019 |work=Tu Voz en Pinares |language=es}}</ref>\n* Jes\u00fas Porras as Suonatore Armonica al Campo\n* [[Romano Puppo]] as Member of Angel Eyes' Gang\n* [[Anto\u00f1ito Ruiz]] as Stevens' Youngest Son\n* [[Aysanoa Runachagua]] as Pistolero Recruited by Tuco in the Cave\n* Enrique Santiago as Mexican Bounty Hunter\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Terr\u00f3n]] as Thomas 'Shorty' Larson\n* Franco Tocci as Soldato Unione con Sigaro\n}}\n\n== Development ==\n=== Pre-production ===\nAfter the success of ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', executives at [[United Artists]] approached the film's screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, to sign a contract for the rights to the film and for the next one. He, producer Alberto Grimaldi and Sergio Leone had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about \"a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure at the time of the American Civil War\".<ref name=\"Frayling\">Frayling, 2000</ref> The studio agreed, but wanted to know the cost for this next film. At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to broker his own deal, but Vincenzoni's idea was more lucrative. The two men struck an agreement with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 up front and 50% of the box office takings outside of Italy. The total budget would eventually be $1.2 million.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nLeone built upon the screenwriter's original concept to \"show the absurdity of war&nbsp;... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> An avid history buff, Leone said, \"I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as [[Andersonville prison|Andersonville]]. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by [[Mathew Brady]]. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.<ref name=\"Munn59\">Munn, p. 59</ref>\n\nWhile Leone developed Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter recommended the comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli to work on it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, \"I couldn't use a single thing they'd written. It was the grossest deception of my life.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Donati agreed, saying, \"There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, \"[''Sentenza''] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I'd be nearer ''il Biondo'' (''Blondie''): but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the ''Tuco'' side&nbsp;... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> [[Film director]] [[Alex Cox]] suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the [[anti-Communist]] [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] terrorists, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.<ref name=Cox>Cox, 2009</ref>\n\nEastwood received a percentage-based salary, unlike the first two films where he received a straight fee salary. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another ''Dollars'' film, he joked \"the only reason they brought me back was because they forgot to kill me off in ''For A Few Dollars More''\".<ref name=\"Munn59\" />\n\nThe film's working title was ''I due magnifici straccioni'' (''The Two Magnificent Tramps''). It was changed just before shooting began when Vincenzoni thought up ''Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo'' (''The Good, the Ugly, the Bad''), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, ''River of Dollars'', or ''The Man With No Name'', but decided on ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''.<ref name=\"Hughes15\" />\n\n=== Production ===\n[[File:Almeria 3.jpg|thumb|right|Set of ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' with the distinctive rugged terrain in the background.]]\n[[File:Cementerio Sad Hill 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sad Hill Cemetery]] as it was in 2016.]]\nFilming began at the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, including the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco for the first time and sends him to jail.<ref name=\"McGillagan153\" /> The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near [[Burgos]] in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in [[province of Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]] in the south of Spain.<ref name=\"McGillagan154\">Patrick McGillagan (1999). Clint: the life and legend. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0312290320}} p.154</ref> This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand gravestones to resemble an ancient [[Circus (building)|Roman circus]].<ref name=\"McGillagan154\" /> For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice, as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion.<ref>Munn, p. 62</ref> Eastwood remembers, \"They would care if you were doing a story about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Top Italian cinematographer [[Tonino Delli Colli]] was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final [[Mexican stand-off]] scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like \"the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs\", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet.<ref name=\"McGillagan154\" /> Filming concluded in July 1966.<ref name=\"Hughes12\" />\n\nEastwood was not initially pleased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach. \"In the first film I was alone,\" he told Leone. \"In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry.\"<ref name=\"McGillagan152\">McGillagan (1999), p.152</ref> As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another [[Ferrari]]<ref name=\"Eliot250Ferar\">Eliot (2009), p. 81</ref> and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the [[William Morris Agency]] and [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]], who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor.<ref name=\"McGillagan152\" /> Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career, and he was forced to sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells.<ref name=\"McGillagan152\" /> For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam.<ref name=\"McGillagan153\">McGillagan (1999), p.153</ref> Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor [[Franco Nero]], who was filming ''[[Texas, Adios]]'' at the time.<ref name=\"Nero\">{{Cite AV media |title=Texas, Adios (Franco Nero: Back In The Saddle) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Blue Underground]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=1966}}</ref>\n\nWallach and Eastwood flew to [[Madrid]] together and, between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\">McGillagan (1999), p.155</ref> Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank from a bottle of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography<ref>[[Eli Wallach|Wallach, Eli]] (2005). ''The Good, the Bad and Me: In My Anecdotage'', p. 255</ref> and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during dangerous scenes.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega\u2014who are chained together\u2014jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.<ref name=\"Frayling\" />\n\nThe bridge in the film was reconstructed twice by [[sapper]]s of the Spanish army after being rigged for on-camera explosive demolition. The first time, an Italian camera operator signalled that he was ready to shoot, which was misconstrued by an army captain as the similar-sounding Spanish word meaning \"start\". Nobody was injured in the erroneous mistiming. The army rebuilt the bridge while other shots were filmed. As the bridge was not a prop, but a rather heavy and sturdy structure, powerful explosives were required to destroy it.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Leone said that this scene was, in part, inspired by [[Buster Keaton]]'s silent film ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]''.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nAs an international cast was employed, actors performed in their native languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach spoke English, and were dubbed into Italian for the debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English.<ref>Cumbow (2008) p.121</ref> The result is noticeable in the bad synchronization of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with [[synchronized sound]].<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-blu-ray-review |title=The Good, The Bad and the Ugly Blu-ray Review |website=[[IGN]] |author=Shaffer, R.L.|access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403152156/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-blu-ray-review|archive-date=3 April 2015|url-status=live}} 28 May 2009</ref> Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play [[Ennio Morricone|Morricone]]'s music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to get them in the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited, at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, it would have been difficult to record the sound cleanly in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in post-production.<ref>Cumbow (2008) p.122</ref>\n\nLeone was unable to find an actual cemetery for the Sad Hill shootout scene, so the Spanish pyrotechnics chief hired 250 Spanish soldiers to build one in Carazo near [[Salas de los Infantes]], which they completed in two days (at {{nowrap|{{coord|41|59|25|N|3|24|29|W|scale:50000|display=inline}}}}).<ref>''[[Daily Mail]]'' (6 May 2005). \"On the Graveyard Shift\".</ref>\n\nBy the end of filming, Eastwood had finally had enough of Leone's perfectionist directorial traits. Leone, often forcefully, insisted on shooting scenes from many different angles, paying attention to the most minute of details, which would often exhaust the actors.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\" /> Leone, who was obese, was also a source of amusement for his excesses, and Eastwood found a way to deal with the stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him \"[[Yosemite Sam]]\" for his bad temperament.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\" /> After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role of Harmonica in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to [[Charles Bronson]].<ref name=\"McGillagan158\">McGillagan (1999), p. 158</ref> Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984) when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of [[Robert De Niro]], saying, \"Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same\u2014a block of marble. Bobby first of all is an actor, Clint first of all is a star.

In ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', the New Mexico Campaign and more specifically Sibley's retreat following the aftermath of the Battle of Glorieta Pass provides the backdrop to the narrative of the story. \n \nIn 1862, hoping to expand westward, the Confederate government and local secessionists sought to enforce their claim to the Confederate Arizona Territory, which included the southern halves of modern-day Arizona and New Mexico and overlapped the Union New Mexico Territory. Confederate sympathizers there had requested help from Rebel forces in Texas, both to remove the Union army elements from Arizona and to protect settlers from Apache Indian raids. In response, Confederate General Henry H. Sibley had captured Santa Fe and Albuquerque with his victory at Valverde earlier in the year. Sibley hoped to control the Santa Fe Trail stagecoach route through the passes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the north. Sibley's men met a Union column at Glorieta Pass on 28 March. Forced from the field and short of supplies, the Confederates retreated from the area back to Santa Fe. At Glorieta Pass, Federal forces were finally able to turn back the Confederate invasion of the southwest and dashed the hopes of a Confederacy reaching west to California.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sibley's New Mexico Campaign |url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/sibleys-new-mexico-campaign |website=American Battlefield Trust |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nConfederate success in this failed campaign would have denied the Union a major source of the gold and silver necessary to finance its war effort, and the Union navy would have had the additional difficulty of attempting to blockade several hundred miles of coastline in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whitlock |first1=Flint |title=Distant Bugles, Distant Drums: The Union Response to the Confederate Invasion of New Mexico |date=2006 |publisher=University Press of Colorado |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-0-87081-835-6}}</ref> A Confederate victory would have also diverted Union troops which, following the invasion, were used to fight Native American tribes on the plains and in the Rockies. Sibley's strategy called for an invasion along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, seizing the Colorado Territory (then at the height of the Colorado Gold Rush) and Fort Laramie (the most important United States Army garrison along the Oregon Trail), before turning westward to attack the mineral-rich Nevada and California. He planned to take minimal supplies along with him, intending to live off the land and to capture the stockpiles of supplies at Union forts and depots along the Santa Fe Trail. Once these territories had been secured, Sibley intended to take the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua, Sonora, and Lower California, either through purchase or by invasion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frazier |first1=Donald S. |title=Blood & Treasure: Confederate Empire in the Southwest |date=1995 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=0-89096-639-7 |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSibley's strategic advance in the New Mexico Campaign culminated in the Battle of Glorieta Pass.

He has noted the film's theme of [[Aestheticization of violence|emphasis on violence]] and the deconstruction of [[Old West]] [[romanticism]]. The emphasis on violence being seen in how the three leads (Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco) are set up with various acts of violence. With Blondie, it is seen in his attempt to free Tuco which results in a gun battle. He does not kill anyone in this battle (fulfilling his title as \u2018The Good\u2019) but succeeds in freeing Tuco. Angel Eyes is set up in a scene in which he carries out a hit on a former confederate soldier called Stevens. After getting the information he needs from Stevens he is given money to kill Baker (his employer). He then proceeds to kill Stevens and his son. Upon returning to Baker he kills him too (fulfilling his title as \u2018The Bad\u2019). Tuco is set up in a scene in which three bounty hunters try to kill him. In the film's opening scene three bounty hunters enter a building in which Tuco is hiding in. After the sound of gunfire is heard Tuco escapes through a window. We then get a shot of the three corpses (fulfilling his title as \u2018The Ugly\u2019). They are all after gold and will stop at nothing until they get it. Richard T. Jameson writes \u201cLeone narrates the search for a cache of gold by three grotesquely unprincipled men sardonically classified by the movie\u2019s title (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach, respectively)\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=Richard T.|date=March\u2013April 1973|title=SOMETHING TO DO WITH DEATH: A Fistful of Sergio Leone|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43450586?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Film Comment|volume=9|issue=2|pages=8\u201316|accessdate=2 March 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe film deconstructs Old West Romanticism by portraying the characters as antiheroes. Even the character considered by the film as \u2018The Good\u2019 can still be considered as not living up to that title in a moral sense. Critic Drew Marton describes it as a \u201cbaroque manipulation\u201d that criticizes the American Ideology of the Western,<ref name=\"Drew\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pajiba.com/pajiba_blockbusters/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-review-happiness-is-a-warm-gun.php |title=''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' review |publisher=Pajiba |author=Marton, Drew|access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120832/http://www.pajiba.com/pajiba_blockbusters/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-review-happiness-is-a-warm-gun.php|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}} 22 October 2010</ref> by replacing the heroic [[cowboy]] popularized by [[John Wayne]] with morally complex [[anti-hero|antiheroes]].\n\nNegative themes such as cruelty and greed are also given focus and are traits shared by the three leads in the story. Cruelty is shown in the character of Blondie in how he treats Tuco throughout the film. He is seen to sometimes be friendly with him and in other scenes double-cross him and throw him to the side. It is shown in Angel Eyes through his attitudes in the film and his tendency for committing violent acts throughout the film. For example, when he kills Stevens he also kills his son. It is also seen when he is violently torturing Tuco later in the film. It is shown in Tuco with how he shows concern for Blondie when he is heavily dehydrated but in truth, he is only keeping him alive to find the gold. It is also shown in his conversation with his brother which reveals that a life of cruelty is all he knows. Richard Aquila writes \u201cThe violent antiheroes of Italian westerns also fit into a folk tradition in southern Italy that honoured mafioso and vigilante who used any means to combat corrupt government of church officials who threatened the peasants of the Mezzogiorno\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aquila|first1=Richard|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sagebrush-Trail-Western-Twentieth-Century-American-ebook/dp/B00UHFWI3A|title=The Sagebush Trail: Western Movies and Twentieth Century America|date=2015|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=|isbn=978-0816531547|location=Tuscon, Arizona|page=203|pages=|accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nGreed is shown in the film through its main core plotline of the three characters wanting to find the $200,000 that Bill Carson has said is buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. The main plot concerns their greed as there is a series of double crossings and changing allegiances in order to get the gold. Russ Hunter writes that the film will \u201cstress the formation of homosocial relationships as being functional only in the pursuit of wealth\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunter |first1=Russ |title=The Ecstasy of Gold: Love, Greed and Homosociality in the Dollars Trilogy |journal=Studies in European Cinema |date=2012 |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=77 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261668091_The_ecstasy_of_gold_Love_greed_and_homosociality_in_the_Dollars_trilogy |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> This all culminating in the film's final set-piece which takes place in the cemetery. After the death of Angel Eyes; Tuco is strung up with a rope precariously placed around his neck as Blondie leaves with his share of the money.\n\nMany critics have also noticed the film's [[list of anti-war films|anti-war]] theme.<ref name=\"Culture\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colesmithey.com/capsules/2013/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html |title=''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''- Classic Film Pick |publisher=Colesmithey \u2013 Capsules |author=Smithey, Coley|access-date=6 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093105/http://www.colesmithey.com/capsules/2013/02/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}} 10 February 2013</ref> Taking place in the American Civil War, the film takes the viewpoint of people such as civilians, bandits, and most notably soldiers, and presents their daily hardships during the war. This is seen in how the film has a rugged and rough esthetic. The film has an air of dirtiness that can be attributed to the Civil War and in turn it affects the actions of people. It shows how the war deep down has affected the lives of lots of people.\n\nAs Brian Jenkins states \u201cA union cordial enough to function peacefully could not be reconstructed after a massive blood-letting that left the North crippled by depopulation and debt and the south devastated\u201d.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jenkins |first1=Brian |title=Lord Lyons: A Diplomat in an Age of Nationalism and War |date=2014 |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal, Canada |isbn=978-0-7735-4409-3 |page=151 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7zt1j2.11?refreqid=excelsior%3A41fcf0bc47320cd39314c739f1c95aa7&seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> Although not fighting in the war, the three gunslingers gradually become entangled in the battles that ensue (similar to [[The Great War (1959 Film)|The Great War]], a film that screenwriters Luciano Vincenzoni and Age & Scarpelli had contributed to).<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />  An example of this is how Tuco and Blondie blow up a bridge in order to disperse two sides of the battle. They need to clear a way to the cemetery and succeed in doing so. It is also seen in how Angel Eyes disguises himself as a union sergeant so he can attack and torture Tuco in order to get the information he needs. By doing this he is intertwining himself in the battle.\n\n== Spaghetti Westerns ==\n\n[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]] is the definitive Spaghetti western. A [[spaghetti western]] are westerns produced and directed by Italians, often in collaboration with other European countries, especially Spain and Germany. The name \u2018spaghetti western\u2019 originally was a depreciative term, given by foreign critics to these films because they thought they were inferior to American westerns.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone |url=https://www.spaghetti-western.net/index.php/The_Spaghetti_Westerns_of_Sergio_Leone |website=The Spaghetti Western Database |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> Most of the films were made with low budgets, but several still managed to be innovative and artistic, although at the time they didn't get much recognition, even in Europe. The genre is unmistakably a Catholic genre, with a visual style strongly influenced by the Catholic iconography of, for instance, the crucifixion or the last supper. The outdoor scenes of many spaghetti westerns, especially those with a relatively higher budget, were shot in Spain, in particular the Tabernas desert of Almeria and Colmenar Viejo and Hoyo de Manzanares. In Italy, the province of Lazio was a favourite location.\n\nThe genre expanded and became an international sensation with the success of Sergio Leone's [[A Fistful of Dollars]], an adaptation of a Japanese Samurai movie called [[Yojimbo]]. But a handful of westerns were made in Italy before Leone redefined the genre, and the Italians were not the first to make westerns in Europe in the sixties. But it was Sergio Leone who defined the look and attitude of the genre with his first western and the two that soon were to follow: [[For a Few Dollars More]] and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Together these films are called \u2018The [[Dollars Trilogy]]\u2019. Leone's West in the latter wasn't concerned with ideas of the frontier or good vs. evil, but rather interested in how the world is unmistakably more complicated than that, and how the western world is one of kill or be killed. These films featured knifings, beatings, shootouts, or other violent action every five to ten minutes. \u201cThe issue of morality belongs to the American western,\u201d explains Italian director Ferdinando Baldi. \u201cThe violence in our movies is more gratuitous than in the American films. There was very little morality because often the protagonist was a bad guy.\u201d Eastwood is a violent and ruthless killer who murders opponents for fun and profit. Behind his cold and stony stare is a cynical mind powered by a dubious morality. Unlike earlier cowboy heroes, Eastwood's character constantly smokes a small cigar and hardly ever shaves. He wears a flat-topped hat and Mexican poncho instead of more traditional western costuming. He never introduces himself when he meets anyone, and nobody ever asks his name. Furthermore, Spaghetti Westerns redefined the western genre to fit the everchanging times of the 1960s and \u201970s. Rather than portraying the traditional mythic West as an exotic and beautiful land of opportunity, hope, and redemption, they depicted a desolate and forsaken West. In these violent and troubled times, Spaghetti Westerns, with their antiheroes, ambiguous morals, brutality, and anti-Establishment themes, resonated with audiences. The films\u2019 gratuitous violence, surrealistic style, gloomy look, and eerie sound captured the era's melancholy. It is this new approach to the genre that defined the revisionist western of the late \u201970s and early \u201980s; a movement started by this moral ambiguity of the spaghetti westerns, as well as a westerns placement in the context of historical events; both attributes defined and set by The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aquila |first1=Richard |title=The Sagebrush Trail: Western Movies and Twentieth-Century America |date=2015 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=978-0816531547 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt183gxp6.12.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_SYC-4946%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3A7f0a5f32fa5ff68742caec539c051893 |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThese films were undeniably stylish. With grandiose wide shots, and close ups that peered into the eyes and souls of the characters, [[The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly]], had the defining cinematographic techniques of the spaghetti western. This was Leone\u2019s signature technique, using long drawn shots interspersed with extreme close ups that build tension as well as develop characters. However, Leone\u2019s movies weren\u2019t just influenced by style. As Tarantino notes, \u201cthere was also a realism to them: those shitty Mexican towns, the little shacks \u2014 a bit bigger to accommodate the camera \u2014 all the plates they put the beans on, the big wooden spoons. The films were so realistic, which had always seemed to be missing in the westerns of the 1930s, 40s and 50s, in the brutality and the different shades of grey and black. Leone found an even darker black and off-white. There is realism in Leone\u2019s presentation of the Civil War in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that was missing from all the Civil War movies that happened before him. Leone\u2019s film, and the genre that he defined within it, shows a west that is more violent, less talky, more complex, more theatrical, and just overall more iconic through the use of music, appearing operatic as the music is an illustrative ingredient of the narrative\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frayling |first1=Christopher |title=Shooting Star |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/quentin-tarantino-on-how-spaghetti-westerns-shaped-modern-cinema/ |website=The Spectator |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> With a greater sense of operatic violence than their American cousins, the cycle of spaghetti westerns lasted just a few short years, but before hanging up its spurs in the late 70s, it completely rewrote the genre.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Towlson |first1=Jon |title=10 great spaghetti westerns |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-spaghetti-westerns |website=BFI |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Cinematography ===\n\nIn its depiction of violence, Leone used his signature [[Long shot|long drawn]] and [[close-up]] style of filming, which he did by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching for a holstered gun.<ref name=\"Culture\">{{cite web |url=http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-might-just-be-the-greatest-film-of-all-time |title=50 Reasons Why The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Might Just Be The Greatest Film of all Time |publisher=What Culture |author=Leigh, Stephen |date=28 November 2011 | access-date=3 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601075045/http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-might-just-be-the-greatest-film-of-all-time | archive-date=1 June 2016 | url-status=live}}</ref> This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to savour the performances and character reactions, creating a feeling of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful [[landscape]]s.<ref name=\"Culture\" /> Leone also incorporated music to heighten the tension and pressure before and during the film's many gunfights.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nIn filming the pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes dialogue to focus more on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic [[Mexican standoff]]. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (aka [[The Man with No Name]]), which is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words.<ref name=\"Drew\" /> All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes, killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed stylistic [[trick shooting]], such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person's head and severing a [[hangman's noose]] with a well-placed shot, in many of its iconic shootouts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mondo70.blogspot.com/2014/08/on-big-screen-good-bad-and-ugly-il.html |title=On the Big Screen: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Il buono, il bruto, il cattivo, 1966) |publisher=Mondo 70: A Wild World of Cinema |author=Wilson, Samuel|access-date=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402215653/http://mondo70.blogspot.com/2014/08/on-big-screen-good-bad-and-ugly-il.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}} 2 August 2014</ref>\n\n== Releases ==\n''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' opened in Italy on 23 December 1966,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=Catalog Of Copyright Entries \u2013 Motion Pictures And Filmstrips, 1968 |url=https://archive.org/details/catalogofc19683221213libr |website=Archive.org |publisher=Library Of Congress, Copyright Office |accessdate=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917041327/https://archive.org/details/catalogofc19683221213libr|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Good, The Bad And The Ugly \u2013 Release Info |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105084921/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf|archive-date=5 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and grossed $6.3 million at that time.<ref name=\"Eliot88\">Eliot (2009), p. 88</ref>\n\nIn the United States, ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was released 18 January 1967 (28 months after its initial Italian release);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fistfulofdollars.htm |title=''A Fistful of Dollars'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511212702/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fistfulofdollars.htm|archive-date=11 May 2013|url-status=live}} 6 October 2014</ref> ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' was released 10 May 1967 (17 months);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=forafewdollarsmore.htm |title=''For A Few Dollars More'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216114757/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=forafewdollarsmore.htm|archive-date=16 February 2013|url-status=live}} 6 October 2014</ref> and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was released 29 December 1967 (12 months).<ref name=\"GBUMojo\" /> Thus, all three of Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in the United States during the same year.

However, screenwriter [[Luciano Vincenzoni]] stated on numerous occasions that he had written a treatment for a sequel, tentatively titled ''Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo n. 2'' ''(The Good, the Bad and the Ugly 2)''. According to Vincenzoni and Eli Wallach, the film would have been set 20 years after the original, and would have followed Tuco pursuing Blondie's grandson for the gold. Clint Eastwood expressed interest in taking part in the film's production, including acting as narrator. [[Joe Dante]] and Leone were also approached to direct and produce the film respectively. Eventually, however, the project was vetoed by Leone, as he did not want the original film's title or characters to be reused, nor did he want to be involved in another Western film.<ref name=sed>Giusti, 2007</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of films considered the best]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite book |last=[[Alex Cox|Cox, Alex]] |title=10,000 Ways to Die: A Director's Take on the Spaghetti Western |publisher=Oldcastle Books |date=2009 |isbn=978-1-84243-304-1}}\n* {{cite book |last=Eliot |first=Marc |title=American Rebel: The Life of Clint Eastwood |publisher=[[Harmony Books]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-307-33688-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/americanrebellif00elio}}\n* {{cite book |last=Frayling |first=Christopher |title=Sergio Leone: Something To Do With Death |publisher=Faber & Faber |year=2000 |location= |pages= |isbn=0-571-16438-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/sergioleonesomet00fray}}\n* {{cite book |last=Giusti |first=Marco |title=Dizionario del western all'italiana |publisher=Mondadori |date=2007 |isbn=88-04-57277-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Howard |title=Aim for the Heart |publisher=[[I.B.

It is an [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]]-led production with co-producers in Spain, West Germany and the United States.\n\nThe film is known for Leone's use of [[long shots]] and [[close-up]] cinematography, as well as his distinctive use of [[Aestheticization of violence|violence]], [[Suspense|tension]], and stylistic [[Gunfighter|gunfights]]. The plot revolves around three [[gunslinger]]s competing to find fortune in a buried cache of [[Confederate gold]] amid the violent chaos of the [[American Civil War]] (specifically the [[New Mexico Campaign]] in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way.<ref name=\"Yezbick\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Yezbick |first=Daniel |title=The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly |encyclopedia=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture |publisher=Gale Group |year=2002 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |accessdate=23 May 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012154144/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_tov/ai_2419100524 |archivedate=12 October 2007}}</ref> The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef.\n\n''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was marketed as the third and final instalment in the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'', following ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' and ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]''.

''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' is now seen as one of the greatest and most influential [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], a trio of [[bounty hunter]]s attempt to kill fugitive [[Mexican people|Mexican]] bandit Tuco Ram\u00edrez. Tuco shoots the three bounty hunters and escapes on horseback. Elsewhere, [[mercenary]] Angel Eyes interrogates former [[Army of New Mexico|Confederate]] soldier Stevens, whom Angel Eyes is contracted to kill, about Jackson, a fugitive who stole a cache of [[Confederate gold]]. Angel Eyes makes Stevens tell him the new name Jackson is using: Bill Carson. Stevens offers Angel Eyes $1,000 to kill Baker, Angel Eyes's employer. Angel Eyes accepts the new commission, but also kills Stevens as he leaves, fulfilling his contract with Baker. He then returns to Baker, collects his fee for killing Stevens, and then, shoots Baker, fulfilling his commission from Stevens. Meanwhile, Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by a nameless drifter whom Tuco refers to as \"[[Man with No Name|Blondie]]\", who delivers him to the local sheriff to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie severs Tuco's noose by shooting it, and sets him free. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. Tuco manages to walk to a village, and then tracks Blondie to a town occupied by Confederate troops. Tuco holds Blondie at gunpoint, planning to force him to hang himself, but [[Department of New Mexico|Union]] forces shell the town, allowing Blondie to escape.\n\nFollowing an arduous search, Tuco recaptures Blondie and force-marches him across a [[desert]] until Blondie collapses from [[dehydration]]. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson, who promises Tuco $200,000 in Confederate gold, buried in a grave in [[Sad Hill Cemetery]]<!-- Please do not change this to Sand Hill. The subtitles and closed captions both are written Sad. See talk page for further discussion -->. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died and Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson recovered and told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco, who now has strong motivation to keep Blondie alive, gives him water and takes him to a nearby [[Catholic missionary|frontier mission]], where his brother is the Abbot, to recover.\n\nAfter Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, only to be captured by Union soldiers and remanded to the [[prisoner of war camp]] of Batterville. At roll call, Tuco answers for \"Bill Carson\", getting the attention of Angel Eyes, now a disguised Union [[sergeant]] at the camp. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Realizing that Blondie will not yield to torture, Angel Eyes offers him an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes.\n\n[[File:Mexican standoff.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.36|The iconic [[Mexican standoff]], with Tuco seen on the left, Angel Eyes in the middle, and Blondie on the right. The scene is accompanied by [[Ennio Morricone]]'s \"The Trio\".]]\n\nBlondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town. Tuco, having fled to the same town, takes a bath in a ramshackle hotel and is surprised by Elam, one of the three bounty hunters who tried to kill him. Tuco shoots Elam, causing Blondie to investigate the gunshots. He finds Tuco, and they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but discover that Angel Eyes himself has escaped.\n\nTuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by Union troops on one side of a strategic bridge, with Confederates on the other. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies to allow access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with [[Explosive material|explosives]], Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse, and Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself. He finds Arch Stanton's grave and begins digging. Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. A moment later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing only a skeleton, no gold. Blondie states that he lied about the name on the grave, and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock. Placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, he challenges Tuco and Angel Eyes to a [[Truel|three-way duel]].\n\nThe trio stare each other down. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked \"Unknown\". Tuco is initially elated to find bags of gold, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint and orders him into a [[hangman's noose]] beneath a tree. Blondie binds Tuco's hands and forces him to stand balanced precariously atop an unsteady grave marker while he takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. Blondie severs the rope with a rifle shot, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== The trio ===\n* [[Clint Eastwood]] as \"Blondie\" (a.k.a. the [[Man with No Name]]): The Good, a taciturn, confident [[bounty hunter]] who teams up with Tuco, and Angel Eyes temporarily, to find the buried gold. Blondie and Tuco have an [[ambivalence|ambivalent]] partnership. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery where the gold is hidden, but Blondie knows the name of the grave where it is buried, forcing them to work together to find the treasure. In spite of this greedy quest, Blondie's pity for the dying soldiers in the chaotic carnage of the War is evident. \"I've never seen so many men wasted so badly,\" he remarks. He also comforts a dying soldier by laying his coat over him and letting him smoke his cigar. ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'' had ended its run as a series in 1966, and at that point neither ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' nor ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' had been released in the United States. When Leone offered Clint Eastwood a role in his next movie, it was the only big film offer he had; however, Eastwood still needed to be convinced to do it. Leone and his wife travelled to California to persuade him. Two days later, he agreed to make the film upon being paid $250,000<ref name=\"Hughes12\">Hughes, p.12</ref> and getting 10% of the profits from the North American markets\u2014a deal with which Leone was not happy.<ref>[[Sergio Leone]], C'era una volta il Cinema. [[Radio 24 (Italy)|Radio 24]]. Retrieved on 17 September 2014.</ref> In the original Italian script for the film, he is named \"Joe\" (his nickname in ''A Fistful of Dollars''), but is referred to as Blondie in the Italian and English dialogue.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n* [[Lee Van Cleef]] as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, confident, borderline-sadistic mercenary that takes a pleasure in killing, who always finishes a job he is paid for; usually tracking and assassination. When Blondie and Tuco are captured while posing as Confederate soldiers, Angel Eyes is the Union sergeant who interrogates and has Tuco tortured, eventually learning the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but not the name on the tombstone. Angel Eyes forms a fleeting partnership with Blondie, but Tuco and Blondie turn on Angel Eyes when they get their chance. Originally, Leone wanted [[Enrico Maria Salerno]] (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the ''Dollars Trilogy'' films)<ref name=Cox /> or [[Charles Bronson]] to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: \"I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in ''For a Few Dollars More''. The idea of getting him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> In the original working script, Angel Eyes was named \"Banjo\", but is referred to as \"Sentenza\" (meaning \"Sentence\" or \"Judgement\") in the Italian version. Eastwood came up with the name Angel Eyes on the set, for his gaunt appearance and expert marksmanship.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n* [[Eli Wallach]] as Tuco Benedicto Pac\u00edfico Juan Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez (known as \"The Rat\" according to Blondie): The Ugly, a fast-talking, comically oafish yet also cunning, cagey, resilient and resourceful [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[bandit]] who is wanted by the authorities for a long list of crimes. Tuco manages to discover the name of the cemetery where the gold is buried, but he does not know the name of the grave. This state of affairs forces Tuco to become reluctant partners with Blondie. The director originally considered [[Gian Maria Volont\u00e9]] for the role of Tuco, but felt that the role required someone with \"natural comic talent\". In the end, Leone chose Eli Wallach, based on his role in ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), in particular, his performance in \"The Railroads\" scene.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> In Los Angeles, Leone met Wallach, who was sceptical about playing this type of character again, but after Leone screened the opening credit sequence from ''For a Few Dollars More'', Wallach said: \"When do you want me?\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> The two men got along famously, sharing the same bizarre sense of humor. Leone allowed Wallach to make changes to his character in terms of his outfit and recurring gestures. Both Eastwood and Van Cleef realized that the character of Tuco was close to Leone's heart, and the director and Wallach became good friends. They communicated in French, which Wallach spoke badly and Leone spoke well. Van Cleef observed, \"Tuco is the only one of the trio the audience gets to know all about.

He, producer Alberto Grimaldi and Sergio Leone had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni pitched an idea about \"a film about three rogues who are looking for some treasure at the time of the American Civil War\".<ref name=\"Frayling\">Frayling, 2000</ref> The studio agreed, but wanted to know the cost for this next film. At the same time, Grimaldi was trying to broker his own deal, but Vincenzoni's idea was more lucrative. The two men struck an agreement with UA for a million-dollar budget, with the studio advancing $500,000 up front and 50% of the box office takings outside of Italy. The total budget would eventually be $1.2 million.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nLeone built upon the screenwriter's original concept to \"show the absurdity of war&nbsp;... the Civil War which the characters encounter. In my frame of reference, it is useless, stupid: it does not involve a 'good cause.'\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> An avid history buff, Leone said, \"I had read somewhere that 120,000 people died in Southern camps such as [[Andersonville prison|Andersonville]]. I was not ignorant of the fact that there were camps in the North. You always get to hear about the shameful behavior of the losers, never the winners.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> The Batterville Camp where Blondie and Tuco are imprisoned was based on steel engravings of Andersonville. Many shots in the film were influenced by archival photographs taken by [[Mathew Brady]]. As the film took place during the Civil War, it served as a prequel for the other two films in the trilogy, which took place after the war.<ref name=\"Munn59\">Munn, p. 59</ref>\n\nWhile Leone developed Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter recommended the comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli to work on it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, \"I couldn't use a single thing they'd written. It was the grossest deception of my life.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Donati agreed, saying, \"There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, \"[''Sentenza''] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I'd be nearer ''il Biondo'' (''Blondie''): but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the ''Tuco'' side&nbsp;... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> [[Film director]] [[Alex Cox]] suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the [[anti-Communist]] [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]] terrorists, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.<ref name=Cox>Cox, 2009</ref>\n\nEastwood received a percentage-based salary, unlike the first two films where he received a straight fee salary. When Lee Van Cleef was again cast for another ''Dollars'' film, he joked \"the only reason they brought me back was because they forgot to kill me off in ''For A Few Dollars More''\".<ref name=\"Munn59\" />\n\nThe film's working title was ''I due magnifici straccioni'' (''The Two Magnificent Tramps''). It was changed just before shooting began when Vincenzoni thought up ''Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo'' (''The Good, the Ugly, the Bad''), which Leone loved. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, ''River of Dollars'', or ''The Man With No Name'', but decided on ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly''.<ref name=\"Hughes15\" />\n\n=== Production ===\n[[File:Almeria 3.jpg|thumb|right|Set of ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' with the distinctive rugged terrain in the background.]]\n[[File:Cementerio Sad Hill 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sad Hill Cemetery]] as it was in 2016.]]\nFilming began at the [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, including the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco for the first time and sends him to jail.<ref name=\"McGillagan153\" /> The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near [[Burgos]] in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in [[province of Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]] in the south of Spain.<ref name=\"McGillagan154\">Patrick McGillagan (1999). Clint: the life and legend. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0312290320}} p.154</ref> This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand gravestones to resemble an ancient [[Circus (building)|Roman circus]].<ref name=\"McGillagan154\" /> For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice, as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion.<ref>Munn, p. 62</ref> Eastwood remembers, \"They would care if you were doing a story about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is.\"<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Top Italian cinematographer [[Tonino Delli Colli]] was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final [[Mexican stand-off]] scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like \"the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs\", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet.<ref name=\"McGillagan154\" /> Filming concluded in July 1966.<ref name=\"Hughes12\" />\n\nEastwood was not initially pleased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach. \"In the first film I was alone,\" he told Leone. \"In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry.\"<ref name=\"McGillagan152\">McGillagan (1999), p.152</ref> As Eastwood played hard-to-get in accepting the role (inflating his earnings up to $250,000, another [[Ferrari]]<ref name=\"Eliot250Ferar\">Eliot (2009), p. 81</ref> and 10% of the profits in the United States when eventually released there), Eastwood was again encountering publicist disputes between Ruth Marsh, who urged him to accept the third film of the trilogy, and the [[William Morris Agency]] and [[Irving Leonard (financial adviser)|Irving Leonard]], who were unhappy with Marsh's influence on the actor.<ref name=\"McGillagan152\" /> Eastwood banished Marsh from having any further influence in his career, and he was forced to sack her as his business manager via a letter sent by Frank Wells.<ref name=\"McGillagan152\" /> For some time after, Eastwood's publicity was handled by Jerry Pam of Gutman and Pam.<ref name=\"McGillagan153\">McGillagan (1999), p.153</ref> Throughout filming, Eastwood regularly socialized with actor [[Franco Nero]], who was filming ''[[Texas, Adios]]'' at the time.<ref name=\"Nero\">{{Cite AV media |title=Texas, Adios (Franco Nero: Back In The Saddle) |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Blue Underground]] |location=Los Angeles, California |date=1966}}</ref>\n\nWallach and Eastwood flew to [[Madrid]] together and, between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice his golf swing.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\">McGillagan (1999), p.155</ref> Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank from a bottle of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography<ref>[[Eli Wallach|Wallach, Eli]] (2005). ''The Good, the Bad and Me: In My Anecdotage'', p. 255</ref> and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring the safety of his actors during dangerous scenes.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega\u2014who are chained together\u2014jump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.<ref name=\"Frayling\" />\n\nThe bridge in the film was reconstructed twice by [[sapper]]s of the Spanish army after being rigged for on-camera explosive demolition. The first time, an Italian camera operator signalled that he was ready to shoot, which was misconstrued by an army captain as the similar-sounding Spanish word meaning \"start\". Nobody was injured in the erroneous mistiming. The army rebuilt the bridge while other shots were filmed. As the bridge was not a prop, but a rather heavy and sturdy structure, powerful explosives were required to destroy it.<ref name=\"Frayling\" /> Leone said that this scene was, in part, inspired by [[Buster Keaton]]'s silent film ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]''.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nAs an international cast was employed, actors performed in their native languages. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach spoke English, and were dubbed into Italian for the debut release in Rome. For the American version, the lead acting voices were used, but supporting cast members were dubbed into English.<ref>Cumbow (2008) p.121</ref> The result is noticeable in the bad synchronization of voices to lip movements on screen; none of the dialogue is completely in sync because Leone rarely shot his scenes with [[synchronized sound]].<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-blu-ray-review |title=The Good, The Bad and the Ugly Blu-ray Review |website=[[IGN]] |author=Shaffer, R.L.|access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403152156/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/05/29/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-blu-ray-review|archive-date=3 April 2015|url-status=live}} 28 May 2009</ref> Various reasons have been cited for this: Leone often liked to play [[Ennio Morricone|Morricone]]'s music over a scene and possibly shout things at the actors to get them in the mood. Leone cared more for visuals than dialogue (his English was limited, at best). Given the technical limitations of the time, it would have been difficult to record the sound cleanly in most of the extremely wide shots Leone frequently used. Also, it was standard practice in Italian films at this time to shoot silently and post-dub. Whatever the actual reason, all dialogue in the film was recorded in post-production.<ref>Cumbow (2008) p.122</ref>\n\nLeone was unable to find an actual cemetery for the Sad Hill shootout scene, so the Spanish pyrotechnics chief hired 250 Spanish soldiers to build one in Carazo near [[Salas de los Infantes]], which they completed in two days (at {{nowrap|{{coord|41|59|25|N|3|24|29|W|scale:50000|display=inline}}}}).<ref>''[[Daily Mail]]'' (6 May 2005). \"On the Graveyard Shift\".</ref>\n\nBy the end of filming, Eastwood had finally had enough of Leone's perfectionist directorial traits. Leone, often forcefully, insisted on shooting scenes from many different angles, paying attention to the most minute of details, which would often exhaust the actors.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\" /> Leone, who was obese, was also a source of amusement for his excesses, and Eastwood found a way to deal with the stresses of being directed by him by making jokes about him and nicknamed him \"[[Yosemite Sam]]\" for his bad temperament.<ref name=\"McGillagan155\" /> After the film was completed, Eastwood never worked with Leone again, later turning down the role of Harmonica in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), for which Leone had personally flown to Los Angeles to give him the script. The role eventually went to [[Charles Bronson]].<ref name=\"McGillagan158\">McGillagan (1999), p. 158</ref> Years later, Leone exacted his revenge upon Eastwood during the filming of ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'' (1984) when he described Eastwood's abilities as an actor as being like a block of marble or wax and inferior to the acting abilities of [[Robert De Niro]], saying, \"Eastwood moves like a sleepwalker between explosions and hails of bullets, and he is always the same\u2014a block of marble. Bobby first of all is an actor, Clint first of all is a star. Bobby suffers, Clint yawns.\"<ref name=\"McGillagan159\">McGillagan (1999), p. 159</ref> Eastwood later gave a friend the [[Poncho#Film|poncho]] he wore in the three films, where it was hung in a Mexican restaurant in [[Carmel, California]].<ref>Munn, p. 63</ref>\n\n== Historical context ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n{{Coatrack section|date=March 2020}}\n}}\nThe New Mexico Campaign played an important role in the Trans-Mississippi Theatre of the [[American Civil War]]. The Campaign resulted in a decisive victory for the Union Army and the retreat of the Confederate Army from the New Mexico Territory and the loss of the Arizona Territory. In ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'', the New Mexico Campaign and more specifically Sibley's retreat following the aftermath of the Battle of Glorieta Pass provides the backdrop to the narrative of the story. \n \nIn 1862, hoping to expand westward, the Confederate government and local secessionists sought to enforce their claim to the Confederate Arizona Territory, which included the southern halves of modern-day Arizona and New Mexico and overlapped the Union New Mexico Territory. Confederate sympathizers there had requested help from Rebel forces in Texas, both to remove the Union army elements from Arizona and to protect settlers from Apache Indian raids. In response, Confederate General Henry H. Sibley had captured Santa Fe and Albuquerque with his victory at Valverde earlier in the year. Sibley hoped to control the Santa Fe Trail stagecoach route through the passes of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the north. Sibley's men met a Union column at Glorieta Pass on 28 March. Forced from the field and short of supplies, the Confederates retreated from the area back to Santa Fe. At Glorieta Pass, Federal forces were finally able to turn back the Confederate invasion of the southwest and dashed the hopes of a Confederacy reaching west to California.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sibley's New Mexico Campaign |url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/sibleys-new-mexico-campaign |website=American Battlefield Trust |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nConfederate success in this failed campaign would have denied the Union a major source of the gold and silver necessary to finance its war effort, and the Union navy would have had the additional difficulty of attempting to blockade several hundred miles of coastline in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Whitlock |first1=Flint |title=Distant Bugles, Distant Drums: The Union Response to the Confederate Invasion of New Mexico |date=2006 |publisher=University Press of Colorado |location=Boulder, Colorado |isbn=978-0-87081-835-6}}</ref> A Confederate victory would have also diverted Union troops which, following the invasion, were used to fight Native American tribes on the plains and in the Rockies. Sibley's strategy called for an invasion along the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, seizing the Colorado Territory (then at the height of the Colorado Gold Rush) and Fort Laramie (the most important United States Army garrison along the Oregon Trail), before turning westward to attack the mineral-rich Nevada and California. He planned to take minimal supplies along with him, intending to live off the land and to capture the stockpiles of supplies at Union forts and depots along the Santa Fe Trail. Once these territories had been secured, Sibley intended to take the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua, Sonora, and Lower California, either through purchase or by invasion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frazier |first1=Donald S. |title=Blood & Treasure: Confederate Empire in the Southwest |date=1995 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |location=College Station, Texas |isbn=0-89096-639-7 |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nSibley's strategic advance in the New Mexico Campaign culminated in the Battle of Glorieta Pass.

He has noted the films theme of [[Aestheticization of violence|emphasis on violence]] and the deconstruction of [[Old West]] [[romanticism]]. The emphasis on violence being seen in how the three leads (Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco) are set up with various acts of violence. With Blondie, it is seen in his attempt to free Tuco which results in a gun battle. He does not kill anyone in this battle (fulfilling his title as \u2018The Good\u2019) but succeeds in freeing Tuco. Angel Eyes is set up in a scene in which he carries out a hit on a former confederate soldier called Stevens. After getting the information he needs from Stevens he is given money to kill Baker (his employer). He then proceeds to kill Stevens and his son. Upon returning to Baker he kills him too (fulfilling his title as \u2018The Bad\u2019). Tuco is set up in a scene in which three bounty hunters try to kill him. In the film's opening scene three bounty hunters enter a building in which Tuco is hiding in. After the sound of gunfire is heard Tuco escapes through a window. We then get a shot of the three corpses (fulfilling his title as \u2018The Ugly\u2019). They are all after gold and will stop at nothing until they get it. Richard T. Jameson writes \u201cLeone narrates the search for a cache of gold by three grotesquely unprincipled men sardonically classified by the movie\u2019s title (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach, respectively)\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=James|first1=Richard T.|date=March\u2013April 1973|title=SOMETHING TO DO WITH DEATH: A Fistful of Sergio Leone|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/43450586?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Film Comment|volume=9|issue=2|pages=8\u201316|accessdate=2 March 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe film deconstructs Old West Romanticism by portraying the characters as antiheroes. Even the character considered by the film as \u2018The Good\u2019 can still be considered as not living up to that title in a moral sense. Critic Drew Marton describes it as a \u201cbaroque manipulation\u201d that criticizes the American Ideology of the Western,<ref name=\"Drew\">{{cite web |url=http://www.pajiba.com/pajiba_blockbusters/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-review-happiness-is-a-warm-gun.php |title=''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' review |publisher=Pajiba |author=Marton, Drew|access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120832/http://www.pajiba.com/pajiba_blockbusters/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-review-happiness-is-a-warm-gun.php|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}} 22 October 2010</ref> by replacing the heroic [[cowboy]] popularized by [[John Wayne]] with morally complex [[anti-hero|antiheroes]].\n\nNegative themes such as cruelty and greed are also given focus and are traits shared by the three leads in the story. Cruelty is shown in the character of Blondie in how he treats Tuco throughout the film. He is seen to sometimes be friendly with him and in other scenes double-cross him and throw him to the side. It is shown in Angel Eyes through his attitudes in the film and his tendency for committing violent acts throughout the film. For example, when he kills Stevens he also kills his son. It is also seen when he is violently torturing Tuco later in the film. It is shown in Tuco with how he shows concern for Blondie when he is heavily dehydrated but in truth, he is only keeping him alive to find the gold. It is also shown in his conversation with his brother which reveals that a life of cruelty is all he knows. Richard Aquila writes \u201cThe violent antiheroes of Italian westerns also fit into a folk tradition in southern Italy that honoured mafioso and vigilante who used any means to combat corrupt government of church officials who threatened the peasants of the Mezzogiorno\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aquila|first1=Richard|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sagebrush-Trail-Western-Twentieth-Century-American-ebook/dp/B00UHFWI3A|title=The Sagebush Trail: Western Movies and Twentieth Century America|date=2015|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=|isbn=978-0816531547|location=Tuscon, Arizona|page=203|pages=|accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nGreed is shown in the film through its main core plotline of the three characters wanting to find the $200,000 that Bill Carson has said is buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. The main plot concerns their greed as there is a series of double crossings and changing allegiances in order to get the gold. Russ Hunter writes that the film will \u201cstress the formation of homosocial relationships as being functional only in the pursuit of wealth\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hunter |first1=Russ |title=The Ecstasy of Gold: Love, Greed and Homosociality in the Dollars Trilogy |journal=Studies in European Cinema |date=2012 |volume=9 |issue=1 |page=77 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261668091_The_ecstasy_of_gold_Love_greed_and_homosociality_in_the_Dollars_trilogy |accessdate=2 March 2020}}</ref> This all culminating in the film's final set-piece which takes place in the cemetery.

This is seen in how the film has a rugged and rough esthetic. The film has an air of dirtiness that can be attributed to the Civil War and in turn it affects the actions of people.

They need to clear a way to the cemetery and succeed in doing so. It is also seen in how Angel Eyes disguises himself as a union sergeant so he can attack and torture Tuco in order to get the information he needs.

A [[spaghetti western]] are westerns produced and directed by Italians, often in collaboration with other European countries, especially Spain and Germany. The name \u2018spaghetti western\u2019 originally was a depreciative term, given by foreign critics to these films because they thought they were inferior to American westerns.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone |url=https://www.spaghetti-western.net/index.php/The_Spaghetti_Westerns_of_Sergio_Leone |website=The Spaghetti Western Database |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> Most of the films were made with low budgets, but several still managed to be innovative and artistic, although at the time they didn't get much recognition, even in Europe. The genre is unmistakably a Catholic genre, with a visual style strongly influenced by the Catholic iconography of, for instance, the crucifixion or the last supper. The outdoor scenes of many spaghetti westerns, especially those with a relatively higher budget, were shot in Spain, in particular the Tabernas desert of Almeria and Colmenar Viejo and Hoyo de Manzanares. In Italy, the province of Lazio was a favourite location.\n\nThe genre expanded and became an international sensation with the success of Sergio Leone's [[A Fistful of Dollars]], an adaptation of a Japanese Samurai movie called [[Yojimbo]]. But a handful of westerns were made in Italy before Leone redefined the genre, and the Italians were not the first to make westerns in Europe in the sixties. But it was Sergio Leone who defined the look and attitude of the genre with his first western and the two that soon were to follow: [[For a Few Dollars More]] and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Together these films are called \u2018The [[Dollars Trilogy]]\u2019. Leone's West in the latter wasn't concerned with ideas of the frontier or good vs. evil, but rather interested in how the world is unmistakably more complicated than that, and how the western world is one of kill or be killed. These films featured knifings, beatings, shootouts, or other violent action every five to ten minutes. \u201cThe issue of morality belongs to the American western,\u201d explains Italian director Ferdinando Baldi. \u201cThe violence in our movies is more gratuitous than in the American films. There was very little morality because often the protagonist was a bad guy.\u201d Eastwood is a violent and ruthless killer who murders opponents for fun and profit. Behind his cold and stony stare is a cynical mind powered by a dubious morality. Unlike earlier cowboy heroes, Eastwood's character constantly smokes a small cigar and hardly ever shaves. He wears a flat-topped hat and Mexican poncho instead of more traditional western costuming. He never introduces himself when he meets anyone, and nobody ever asks his name. Furthermore, Spaghetti Westerns redefined the western genre to fit the everchanging times of the 1960s and \u201970s. Rather than portraying the traditional mythic West as an exotic and beautiful land of opportunity, hope, and redemption, they depicted a desolate and forsaken West. In these violent and troubled times, Spaghetti Westerns, with their antiheroes, ambiguous morals, brutality, and anti-Establishment themes, resonated with audiences. The films\u2019 gratuitous violence, surrealistic style, gloomy look, and eerie sound captured the era's melancholy. It is this new approach to the genre that defined the revisionist western of the late \u201970s and early \u201980s; a movement started by this moral ambiguity of the spaghetti westerns, as well as a westerns placement in the context of historical events; both attributes defined and set by The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aquila |first1=Richard |title=The Sagebrush Trail: Western Movies and Twentieth-Century America |date=2015 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson, Arizona |isbn=978-0816531547 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/j.ctt183gxp6.12.pdf?ab_segments=0%252Fbasic_SYC-4946%252Fcontrol&refreqid=excelsior%3A7f0a5f32fa5ff68742caec539c051893 |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThese films were undeniably stylish. With grandiose wide shots, and close ups that peered into the eyes and souls of the characters, [[The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly]], had the defining cinematographic techniques of the spaghetti western. This was Leone\u2019s signature technique, using long drawn shots interspersed with extreme close ups that build tension as well as develop characters. However, Leone\u2019s movies weren\u2019t just influenced by style. As Tarantino notes, \u201cthere was also a realism to them: those shitty Mexican towns, the little shacks \u2014 a bit bigger to accommodate the camera \u2014 all the plates they put the beans on, the big wooden spoons. The films were so realistic, which had always seemed to be missing in the westerns of the 1930s, 40s and 50s, in the brutality and the different shades of grey and black. Leone found an even darker black and off-white. There is realism in Leone\u2019s presentation of the Civil War in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly that was missing from all the Civil War movies that happened before him. Leone\u2019s film, and the genre that he defined within it, shows a west that is more violent, less talky, more complex, more theatrical, and just overall more iconic through the use of music, appearing operatic as the music is an illustrative ingredient of the narrative\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Frayling |first1=Christopher |title=Shooting Star |url=https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/06/quentin-tarantino-on-how-spaghetti-westerns-shaped-modern-cinema/ |website=The Spectator |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref> With a greater sense of operatic violence than their American cousins, the cycle of spaghetti westerns lasted just a few short years, but before hanging up its spurs in the late 70s, it completely rewrote the genre.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Towlson |first1=Jon |title=10 great spaghetti westerns |url=https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-spaghetti-westerns |website=BFI |accessdate=3 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Cinematography ===\n\nIn its depiction of violence, Leone used his signature [[Long shot|long drawn]] and [[close-up]] style of filming, which he did by mixing extreme face shots and sweeping long shots. By doing so, Leone managed to stage epic sequences punctuated by extreme eyes and face shots, or hands slowly reaching for a holstered gun.<ref name=\"Culture\">{{cite web |url=http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-might-just-be-the-greatest-film-of-all-time |title=50 Reasons Why The Good, The Bad and The Ugly Might Just Be The Greatest Film of all Time |publisher=What Culture |author=Leigh, Stephen |date=28 November 2011 | access-date=3 September 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601075045/http://whatculture.com/film/50-reasons-why-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-might-just-be-the-greatest-film-of-all-time | archive-date=1 June 2016 | url-status=live}}</ref> This builds up the tension and suspense by allowing the viewers to savour the performances and character reactions, creating a feeling of excitement, as well as giving Leone the freedom to film beautiful [[landscape]]s.<ref name=\"Culture\" /> Leone also incorporated music to heighten the tension and pressure before and during the film's many gunfights.<ref name=\"The Good 2014\" />\n\nIn filming the pivotal gunfights, Leone largely removes dialogue to focus more on the actions of the characters, which was important during the film's iconic [[Mexican standoff]]. This style can also be seen in one of the film's protagonists, Blondie (aka [[The Man with No Name]]), which is described by critics as more defined by his actions than his words.<ref name=\"Drew\" /> All three characters can be seen as anti-heroes, killing for their personal gain. Leone also employed stylistic [[trick shooting]], such as Blondie shooting the hat off a person's head and severing a [[hangman's noose]] with a well-placed shot, in many of its iconic shootouts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mondo70.blogspot.com/2014/08/on-big-screen-good-bad-and-ugly-il.html |title=On the Big Screen: THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Il buono, il bruto, il cattivo, 1966) |publisher=Mondo 70: A Wild World of Cinema |author=Wilson, Samuel|access-date=5 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402215653/http://mondo70.blogspot.com/2014/08/on-big-screen-good-bad-and-ugly-il.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}} 2 August 2014</ref>\n\n== Releases ==\n''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' opened in Italy on 23 December 1966,<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |title=Catalog Of Copyright Entries \u2013 Motion Pictures And Filmstrips, 1968 |url=https://archive.org/details/catalogofc19683221213libr |website=Archive.org |publisher=Library Of Congress, Copyright Office |accessdate=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917041327/https://archive.org/details/catalogofc19683221213libr|archive-date=17 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Good, The Bad And The Ugly \u2013 Release Info |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105084921/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060196/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ov_inf|archive-date=5 January 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and grossed $6.3 million at that time.<ref name=\"Eliot88\">Eliot (2009), p. 88</ref>\n\nIn the United States, ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' was released 18 January 1967 (28 months after its initial Italian release);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fistfulofdollars.htm |title=''A Fistful of Dollars'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511212702/http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fistfulofdollars.htm|archive-date=11 May 2013|url-status=live}} 6 October 2014</ref> ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'' was released 10 May 1967 (17 months);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=forafewdollarsmore.htm |title=''For A Few Dollars More'' |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]|access-date=6 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216114757/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=forafewdollarsmore.htm|archive-date=16 February 2013|url-status=live}} 6 October 2014</ref> and ''The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' was released 29 December 1967 (12 months).<ref name=\"GBUMojo\" /> Thus, all three of Leone's Dollars Trilogy films were released in the United States during the same year.
