He has been Minister of Planning and Strategic Investment since February 2015.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGusm\u00e3o was born in [[Manatuto]], in what was then [[Portuguese Timor]], to parents of mixed Portuguese-Timorese ancestry, both of whom were school teachers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=First Globalization: The Eurasian Exchange, 1500\u20131800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gQV2V01Y6UC&dq=Geoffrey+C.+Gunn+(2003).+First+Globalization:+The+Eurasian+Exchange,+1500-1800.&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false|author=Geoffrey C. Gunn|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|pages=282|year=2003|isbn=0-7425-2661-5}}</ref> He attended a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] high school just outside [[Dili]]. After leaving high-school for financial reasons at the age of fifteen, he held a variety of unskilled jobs, while continuing his education at night school. In 1965, at the age of 19, he met Emilia Batista, who was later to become his wife. His nickname, \"Xanana\", was taken from the name of the American rock and roll band [[Sha Na Na]], who in turn were named after a lyric from a doo-wop song of 1957 by [[the Silhouettes]].\n\nIn 1966, Gusm\u00e3o obtained a position with the public service, which allowed him to continue his education. This was interrupted in 1968 when Gusm\u00e3o was recruited by the [[Portuguese Army]] for national service. He served for three years, rising to the rank of corporal. During this time, he married Emilia Batista, with whom he had a son Eugenio, and a daughter Zenilda. He has since divorced Emilia, and in 2000, he married Australian [[Kirsty Sword Gusm\u00e3o|Kirsty Sword]], with whom he had three sons: Alexandre, Kay Olok and Daniel. In 1971, Gusm\u00e3o completed his national service, his son was born, and he became involved with a nationalist organisation headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta]]. For the next three years he was actively involved in peaceful protests directed at the colonial system.\n\nIt was in 1974 that a [[Carnation Revolution|coup in Portugal]] resulted in the beginning of decolonisation for Portuguese Timor, and shortly afterwards the Governor [[M\u00e1rio Lemos Pires]] announced plans to grant the colony independence. Plans were drawn up to hold general elections with a view to independence in 1978. During most of 1975 a bitter internal struggle occurred between two rival factions in Portuguese Timor. Gusm\u00e3o became deeply involved with the [[Fretilin]] faction, and as a result he was arrested and imprisoned by the rival faction the Timorese Democratic Union ([[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]]) in mid-1975. Taking advantage of the internal disorder, and with an eye to absorbing the colony, [[Indonesia]] immediately began a campaign of destabilisation, and frequent raids into Portuguese Timor were staged from Indonesian [[West Timor]]. By late 1975 the Fretilin faction had gained control of Portuguese Timor and Gusm\u00e3o was released from prison. He was given the position of Press Secretary within the Fretilin organisation. On 28 November 1975, Fretilin declared the independence of Portuguese Timor as \"The Democratic Republic of East Timor\", and Gusm\u00e3o was responsible for filming the ceremony. Nine days later, [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesia invaded East Timor]]. At the time Gusm\u00e3o was visiting friends outside of Dili and he witnessed the invasion from the hills. For the next few days he searched for his family.\n\n==Indonesian occupation==\n{{Main|Indonesian occupation of East Timor}}\nAfter the appointment of the \"Provisional Government of East Timor\" by Indonesia, Gusm\u00e3o became heavily involved in resistance activities. Gusm\u00e3o was largely responsible for the level of organisation that evolved in the resistance, which ultimately led to its success. The early days featured Gusm\u00e3o walking from village to village to obtain support and recruits. But after Fretilin suffered some major setbacks in the early 1980s, including a failed 1984 coup attempt against Gusm\u00e3o led by four senior [[Falintil]] officers, including [[Mauk Moruk]].<ref name=lowy>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Xanana Gusmao-Mauk Moruk: Timor struggles with its past and future |url=http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2013/12/05/Gusmao-Mauk-Moruk-Timor-struggles-with-its-past-and-future.aspx |work=[[Lowy Institute for International Policy]] |date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> Gusm\u00e3o left Fretilin and supported various centrist coalitions, eventually becoming a leading opponent of Fretilin. By the mid-1980s, he was a major leader. During the early 1990s, Gusm\u00e3o became deeply involved in diplomacy and media management, and was instrumental in alerting the world to the [[Dili Massacre|massacre in Dili]] that occurred in Santa Cruz on 12 November 1991. Gusm\u00e3o was interviewed by many major media channels and obtained worldwide attention.\n\nAs a result of his high profile, Gusm\u00e3o became a prime target of the Indonesian government. A campaign for his capture was finally successful in November 1992. In May 1993, Gusm\u00e3o was tried, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Indonesian government. He was found guilty under Article 108 of the Indonesian Penal Code (rebellion), Law no. 12 of 1951 (illegal possession of firearms) and Article 106 (attempting to separate part of the territory of Indonesia).<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA210581997?open&of=ENG-312 Amnesty International briefing on Xanana Gusmao] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914135828/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA210581997?open&of=ENG-312 |date=14 September 2007 }}</ref> He spoke in his own defence and he was appointed with defence lawyers before the commencement of his trial. The sentence was commuted to 20 years by [[President of Indonesia|Indonesian President]] [[Suharto]] in August 1993. Although not released until late 1999, Gusm\u00e3o successfully led the resistance from within prison with the help of Kirsty Sword. By the time of his release, he was regularly visited by United Nations representatives, and dignitaries such as [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\n==Transition to independence==\n{{main|United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor}}\n\n[[File:Aileu Falintilcamp Okt '99, Xanana kehrt zur\u00fcck-01.jpg|thumb|Return of Gusm\u00e3o to [[Aileu]] after Indonesian arrest]]\n\nOn 30 August 1999, a [[East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum|referendum]] was held in East Timor and an overwhelming majority voted for independence. The Indonesian military commenced a campaign of terror as a result, with terrible consequences. Although the Indonesian government denied ordering this offensive, they were widely condemned for failing to prevent it. As a result of overwhelming diplomatic pressure from the United Nations, promoted by [[Portugal]] since the late 1970s and also by the United States and Australia in the 1990s, a UN-sanctioned, Australian-led international peace-keeping force ([[International Force for East Timor|INTERFET]]) entered East Timor, and Gusm\u00e3o was finally released. Upon his return to his native East Timor, he began a campaign of reconciliation and rebuilding.\n\nGusm\u00e3o was appointed to a senior role in the UN administration that governed East Timor until 20 May 2002. During this time he continually campaigned for unity and peace within East Timor, and was generally regarded as the ''de facto'' leader of the emerging nation. Elections were held in late 2001 and Gusm\u00e3o, endorsed by nine parties but not by Fretilin, ran as an independent and was comfortably elected leader. As a result, he became the first President of East Timor when it became formally independent on 20 May 2002. Gusm\u00e3o has published an autobiography with selected writings entitled ''To Resist Is to Win''. He is the main narrator of the film ''A Hero's Journey''/''Where the Sun Rises'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luxlucis.sg/index.swf |title=A Hero's Journey }}</ref> a 2006 documentary about him and East Timor. According to director Grace Phan, it's an \"intimate insight into the personal transformation\" of the man who helped shape and liberate East Timor.\n\n==Independent East Timor==\n[[File:Xanana-Dilma 2011-1.jpg|thumb|left|270px|Gusm\u00e3o with [[President of Brazil|Brazilian President]] [[Dilma Rousseff]] ]] On 21 June 2006, Gusm\u00e3o called for Prime Minister [[Mari Alkatiri]] to resign or else he would, as allegations that Alkatiri had ordered a [[Guerrilla warfare|hit squad]] to threaten and kill his political opponents led to a large backlash.<ref>ABC News Online (2006).

He has been Minister of Planning and Strategic Investment since February 2015.\n\n==Early life and career==\nGusm\u00e3o was born in [[Manatuto]], in what was then [[Portuguese Timor]], to parents of mixed Portuguese-Timorese ancestry, both of whom were school teachers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=First Globalization: The Eurasian Exchange, 1500\u20131800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4gQV2V01Y6UC&dq=Geoffrey+C.+Gunn+(2003).+First+Globalization:+The+Eurasian+Exchange,+1500-1800.&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false|author=Geoffrey C. Gunn|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|pages=282|year=2003|isbn=0-7425-2661-5}}</ref> He attended a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] high school just outside [[Dili]]. After leaving high-school for financial reasons at the age of fifteen, he held a variety of unskilled jobs, while continuing his education at night school. In 1965, at the age of 19, he met Emilia Batista, who was later to become his wife. His nickname, \"Xanana\", was taken from the name of the American rock and roll band [[Sha Na Na]], who in turn were named after a lyric from a doo-wop song of 1957 by [[the Silhouettes]].\n\nIn 1966, Gusm\u00e3o obtained a position with the public service, which allowed him to continue his education. This was interrupted in 1968 when Gusm\u00e3o was recruited by the [[Portuguese Army]] for national service. He served for three years, rising to the rank of corporal. During this time, he married Emilia Batista, with whom he had a son Eugenio, and a daughter Zenilda. He has since divorced Emilia, and in 2000, he married Australian [[Kirsty Sword Gusm\u00e3o|Kirsty Sword]], with whom he had three sons: Alexandre, Kay Olok and Daniel. In 1971, Gusm\u00e3o completed his national service, his son was born, and he became involved with a nationalist organisation headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Ramos-Horta]]. For the next three years he was actively involved in peaceful protests directed at the colonial system.\n\nIt was in 1974 that a [[Carnation Revolution|coup in Portugal]] resulted in the beginning of decolonisation for Portuguese Timor, and shortly afterwards the Governor [[M\u00e1rio Lemos Pires]] announced plans to grant the colony independence. Plans were drawn up to hold general elections with a view to independence in 1978. During most of 1975 a bitter internal struggle occurred between two rival factions in Portuguese Timor. Gusm\u00e3o became deeply involved with the [[Fretilin]] faction, and as a result he was arrested and imprisoned by the rival faction the Timorese Democratic Union ([[Timorese Democratic Union|UDT]]) in mid-1975. Taking advantage of the internal disorder, and with an eye to absorbing the colony, [[Indonesia]] immediately began a campaign of destabilisation, and frequent raids into Portuguese Timor were staged from Indonesian [[West Timor]]. By late 1975 the Fretilin faction had gained control of Portuguese Timor and Gusm\u00e3o was released from prison. He was given the position of Press Secretary within the Fretilin organisation. On 28 November 1975, Fretilin declared the independence of Portuguese Timor as \"The Democratic Republic of East Timor\", and Gusm\u00e3o was responsible for filming the ceremony. Nine days later, [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesia invaded East Timor]]. At the time Gusm\u00e3o was visiting friends outside of Dili and he witnessed the invasion from the hills. For the next few days he searched for his family.\n\n==Indonesian occupation==\n{{Main|Indonesian occupation of East Timor}}\nAfter the appointment of the \"Provisional Government of East Timor\" by Indonesia, Gusm\u00e3o became heavily involved in resistance activities. Gusm\u00e3o was largely responsible for the level of organisation that evolved in the resistance, which ultimately led to its success. The early days featured Gusm\u00e3o walking from village to village to obtain support and recruits. But after Fretilin suffered some major setbacks in the early 1980s, including a failed 1984 coup attempt against Gusm\u00e3o led by four senior [[Falintil]] officers, including [[Mauk Moruk]].<ref name=lowy>{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Xanana Gusmao-Mauk Moruk: Timor struggles with its past and future |url=http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2013/12/05/Gusmao-Mauk-Moruk-Timor-struggles-with-its-past-and-future.aspx |work=[[Lowy Institute for International Policy]] |date=3 December 2013 |accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> Gusm\u00e3o left Fretilin and supported various centrist coalitions, eventually becoming a leading opponent of Fretilin. By the mid-1980s, he was a major leader. During the early 1990s, Gusm\u00e3o became deeply involved in diplomacy and media management, and was instrumental in alerting the world to the [[Dili Massacre|massacre in Dili]] that occurred in Santa Cruz on 12 November 1991. Gusm\u00e3o was interviewed by many major media channels and obtained worldwide attention.\n\nAs a result of his high profile, Gusm\u00e3o became a prime target of the Indonesian government. A campaign for his capture was finally successful in November 1992. In May 1993, Gusm\u00e3o was tried, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Indonesian government. He was found guilty under Article 108 of the Indonesian Penal Code (rebellion), Law no. 12 of 1951 (illegal possession of firearms) and Article 106 (attempting to separate part of the territory of Indonesia).<ref>[http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA210581997?open&of=ENG-312 Amnesty International briefing on Xanana Gusmao] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914135828/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA210581997?open&of=ENG-312 |date=14 September 2007 }}</ref> He spoke in his own defence and he was appointed with defence lawyers before the commencement of his trial. The sentence was commuted to 20 years by [[President of Indonesia|Indonesian President]] [[Suharto]] in August 1993. Although not released until late 1999, Gusm\u00e3o successfully led the resistance from within prison with the help of Kirsty Sword. By the time of his release, he was regularly visited by United Nations representatives, and dignitaries such as [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\n==Transition to independence==\n{{main|United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor}}\n\n[[File:Aileu Falintilcamp Okt '99, Xanana kehrt zur\u00fcck-01.jpg|thumb|Return of Gusm\u00e3o to [[Aileu]] after Indonesian arrest]]\n\nOn 30 August 1999, a [[East Timor Special Autonomy Referendum|referendum]] was held in East Timor and an overwhelming majority voted for independence. The Indonesian military commenced a campaign of terror as a result, with terrible consequences. Although the Indonesian government denied ordering this offensive, they were widely condemned for failing to prevent it. As a result of overwhelming diplomatic pressure from the United Nations, promoted by [[Portugal]] since the late 1970s and also by the United States and Australia in the 1990s, a UN-sanctioned, Australian-led international peace-keeping force ([[International Force for East Timor|INTERFET]]) entered East Timor, and Gusm\u00e3o was finally released. Upon his return to his native East Timor, he began a campaign of reconciliation and rebuilding.\n\nGusm\u00e3o was appointed to a senior role in the UN administration that governed East Timor until 20 May 2002. During this time he continually campaigned for unity and peace within East Timor, and was generally regarded as the ''de facto'' leader of the emerging nation. Elections were held in late 2001 and Gusm\u00e3o, endorsed by nine parties but not by Fretilin, ran as an independent and was comfortably elected leader. As a result, he became the first President of East Timor when it became formally independent on 20 May 2002. Gusm\u00e3o has published an autobiography with selected writings entitled ''To Resist Is to Win''. He is the main narrator of the film ''A Hero's Journey''/''Where the Sun Rises'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luxlucis.sg/index.swf |title=A Hero's Journey }}</ref> a 2006 documentary about him and East Timor.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time. [[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|The Tale of Ragnar's Sons]], on the other hand, mentions that the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army was aimed at avenging the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary Viking ruler of Sweden and Denmark.{{efn|name=son2|There is nothing in the annals to suggest that the brothers invaded England to avenge their father's killing.

Excavations at the site between 1974\u20131988 found a D-shaped earthwork on the river bank, incorporated into the church. Burials of Viking type were made at the east end of the church, and an existing building was cut down and converted into the chamber of a burial mound that revealed the disarticulated remains of at least 249 people, with their long bones pointing towards the centre of the burial. A large stone coffin was found in the middle of the mass grave; however, the remains of this individual did not survive. A study of the skeletal remains revealed that at least 80% of the individuals were male, and were between the ages of 15 and 45.<ref name=biddle36>{{cite journal|last1=Biddle|first1= M|last2= Kj\u00f8lbye-Biddle|first2=B|year=1992|title= Repton and the Vikings|journal= Antiquity|volume= 66|number=250|pages= 36\u201351| doi=10.1017/S0003598X00081023}}</ref> Further investigation of the male skeletal remains revealed that they were dissimilar to the local population of Repton, most likely of Scandinavian descent, and many showed signs of violent injury.

The Great Heathen Army was distinct from these raids in that it was much larger and formed to occupy and conquer large territories.\n\nThe name Great Heathen Army is derived from the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' of 865. Legend has it that the force was led by four of the five sons of [[Ragnar Lodbrok]], including [[Hvitserk]], [[Ivar the Boneless]], [[Bjorn Ironside]] and possibly [[Ubba]].{{efn|name=sons|The Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] gives Ragnar no less than 10 sons; however, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that only three took part in the invasion.

Surviving sources give no firm indication of its numbers, but it was amongst the largest forces of its kind.\n\nThe invaders initially landed in East Anglia, where the [[Edmund the Martyr|king]] provided them with horses for their campaign in return for peace. They spent the winter of 865\u201366 at [[Thetford]], before marching north to capture [[Scandinavian York|York]] in November 866. York had been founded as the Roman legionary fortress of [[Eboracum]] and revived as the Anglo-Saxon trading port of [[Scandinavian York|Eoforwic]].\n\nDuring 867, the army marched deep into [[Mercia]] and wintered in [[Nottingham]].  The Mercians agreed to terms with the Viking army, which moved back to York for the winter of 868\u201369. In 869, the Great Army returned to East Anglia, conquering it and killing its king. The army moved to winter quarters in Thetford.\n\nIn 871, the Vikings moved on to Wessex, where [[Alfred the Great]] paid them to leave.  The army then marched to [[London]] to overwinter in 871-2. The following campaigning season the army first moved to York, where it gathered reinforcements. This force campaigned in northeastern Mercia, after which it spent the winter at [[Torksey]], on the Trent close to the Humber.<ref name=hadley23/> The following campaigning season it seems to have subdued much of Mercia. Burgred, the king of Mercia, fled overseas and Coelwulf, described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as 'a foolish king's thegn' was imposed in his place. The army spent the following winter at [[Repton]] on the middle Trent, after which the army seems to have divided. One group seems to have returned to Northumbria, where they settled in the area, while another group seems to have turned to invade Wessex.<ref name=richards2004>{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Julian D. |author-link=Julian D.

In May of 878 Alfred the Great defeated the Vikings at the [[Battle of Edington]], and a treaty was agreed whereby the Vikings were able to remain in control of much of northern and eastern England.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle does not mention the reason for this invasion, perhaps because Viking raids were fairly common during that period of time. [[Tale of Ragnar's Sons|The Tale of Ragnar's Sons]], on the other hand, mentions that the invasion of England by the Great Heathen Army was aimed at avenging the death of Ragnar Lodbrok, a legendary Viking ruler of Sweden and Denmark.{{efn|name=son2|There is nothing in the annals to suggest that the brothers invaded England to avenge their father's killing.

Before being accepted at RADA, Payne worked as a joiner, a salesman, and a landscape gardener. Payne graduated from RADA in 1981 with seven major prizes for acting, comedy (Payne won the [[Fabia Drake]] Prize for Comedy) and physical presence.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nPayne was part of a 'new wave' of actors to emerge from the academy. Others included [[Jonathan Pryce]], [[Juliet Stevenson]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Anton Lesser]], [[Kenneth Branagh]], and [[Fiona Shaw]]. In 1980 the Principal of RADA, [[Hugh Cruttwell]], selected a scene from an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'', which Payne co-wrote with [[Paul McGann]], to be performed in front of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], in one of her rare visits to the academy. Payne directed the scene in which he and McGann acted. Payne played Macbeth and wielded a baseball bat on stage instead of a sword.

The primary [[arteries]] (the [[aorta]] and the [[pulmonary artery]]) are [[wiktionary:transpose|transpose]]d.\n\nIt is called a [[cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic]] [[congenital]] [[congenital heart defect|heart defect]] ('''CHD''') because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen. In [[segmental analysis (biology)|segmental analysis]], this condition is described as '''[[wiktionary:ventriculoarterial|ventriculoarterial]] [[wiktionary:discordant|discordance]] with [[wiktionary:atrioventricular|atrioventricular]] [[wiktionary:concordance|concordance]]''', or just '''ventriculoarterial discordance'''.d-TGA is often referred to simply as '''[[transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''TGA'''); however, TGA is a more general term which may also refer to '''[[levo-transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''l-TGA''').Another term commonly used to refer to both d-TGA and l-TGA is '''[[transposition of the great vessels]]''' ('''TGV'''), although this term might have an even broader meaning than TGA.\n\n[[wiktionary:Prenatal|Prenatal]]ly, a [[baby]] with d-TGA experiences no [[symptoms]] as the lungs will not be used until after [[childbirth|birth]], and oxygen is provided by the [[mother]] via the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]]; in order for the red blood to bypass the lungs [[in utero]], the [[fetal]] heart has two shunts that begin to close when the [[newborn]] starts [[breath]]ing; these are the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] and the [[ductus arteriosus]]. The foramen ovale is a hole in the atrial septum which allows blood from the [[right atrium]] to flow into the [[left atrium]]; after birth, the left atrium will be filled with blood returning from the lungs and the foramen ovale will close. The ductus arteriosus is a small, artery-like structure which allows blood to flow from the trunk of the pulmonary artery into the aorta; after birth, the blood in the pulmonary artery will flow into the lungs and the ductus arteriosus will close. Sometimes these shunts will fail to close after birth; these defects are called [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] and [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and either may occur independently, or in combination with one another, or with d-TGA or other heart and/or general defects.\n\n==Symptoms and signs==\n[[Image:cyanotic neonate.jpg|thumb|right|cyanotic d-TGA + VSD neonate (unpalliated and pre-operative).]]\nDue to the low [[oxygen saturation]] of the blood, [[cyanosis]] will appear in [[wiktionary:peripheral|peripheral]] areas: around the mouth and lips, fingertips, and toes; these areas are furthest from the heart, and since the circulated blood is not fully oxygenated to begin with, very little oxygen reaches the [[peripheral arteries]]. A d-TGA baby will exhibit indrawing beneath the [[ribcage]] and \"comfortable [[tachypnea]]\" (rapid breathing); this is likely a [[homeostatic]] [[reflex]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in response to [[hypoxic hypoxia]]. The infant will be easily [[fatigue (physical)|fatigued]] and may experience weakness, particularly during feeding or playing; this interruption to feeding combined with hypoxia can cause [[failure to thrive]]. If d-TGA is not [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]]d and corrected early on, the infant may eventually experience [[fainting|syncopic episodes]] and develop [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers and toes.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nd-TGA can sometimes be diagnosed in utero with an [[ultrasound]] after 18 weeks [[gestation]]. However, if it is not diagnosed in utero, cyanosis of the newborn ([[blue baby]]) should immediately indicate that there is a problem with the [[cardiovascular]] system. Normally, the lungs are examined first, then the heart is examined if there are no apparent problems with the lungs. These examinations are typically performed using ultrasound, known as an [[echocardiogram]] when performed on the heart. [[Chest x-ray]]s and [[electrocardiogram]]s ('''EKG''') may also be used in reaching or confirming a diagnosis; however, an [[x-ray]] may appear normal immediately following birth. If d-TGA is accompanied by both a VSD and pulmonary [[stenosis]], a [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[heart murmur|murmur]] will be present.\n\nOn the rare occasion (when there is a large [[Ventricular septal defect|VSD]] with no significant left [[ventricular outflow tract obstruction]]), initial symptoms may go unnoticed, resulting in the infant being discharged without treatment in the event of a [[Obstetrics|hospital]] or [[birthing center]] birth, or a delay in bringing the infant for diagnosis in the event of a [[home birth]]. On these occasions, a layperson is likely not to recognize symptoms until the infant is experiencing moderate to serious [[congestive heart failure]] ('''CHF''') as a result of the heart working harder in a [[wiktionary: futile|futile]] attempt to increase oxygen flow to the body; this overworking of the heart muscle eventually leads to [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and may result in [[cardiac arrest]] if left untreated.\n\n[[Image:d-TGA.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Normal heart anatomy compared to d-TGA]]\n\n===Description===\nIn a normal [[heart]], [[oxygen]]-depleted (\"blue\") blood is pumped from the [[right heart|right side of the heart]], through the pulmonary artery, to the [[lung]]s where it is oxygenated. The oxygen-rich (\"red\") blood then returns to the [[left heart]], via the [[pulmonary veins]], and is pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body, including the heart [[muscle]] itself.\n\nWith d-TGA, deoxygenated blood from the right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to the body and the heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps oxygenated blood continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. In effect, two separate \"circular\" (parallel) circulatory systems are created, rather than the \"figure 8\" (in series) circulation of a normal [[Heart|cardio]]-[[pulmonary]] system.\n\n===Variations and similar defects===\n\n====Arterial spatial relationships====\nDifferences in the shape of the [[atrial septum]] and/or [[ventricular outflow tract]]s affect the [[anatomical position|relative positions]] of the aorta and pulmonary artery. In the majority of d-TGA cases, the aorta is [[anatomical position#Coronal plane|anterior]] and to the right of the pulmonary artery, but it can also be directly anterior or anterior and to the left. The aorta and pulmonary artery can also be side by side, with aorta on either side. This is a less common variant, and with this arrangement, an unusual [[coronary artery]] pattern is common. There are also some cases with aorta to the right and posterior to the pulmonary artery.<ref>'''Valdes-Cruz LM and Cayre RO''': Chapter 24 in ''Echocardiographic diagnosis of congenital heart disease''. Philadelphia 1998.</ref>\n\n====Simple and complex d-TGA====\nd-TGA is often accompanied by other heart defects, the most common type being [[wiktionary:intracardiac|intracardiac]] [[shunt (medical)|shunts]] such as [[atrial septal defect]] ('''ASD''') including [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] ('''PFO'''), [[ventricular septal defect]] ('''VSD'''), and [[patent ductus arteriosus]] ('''PDA'''). [[Stenosis]] of [[heart valve|valves]] or [[blood vessel|vessels]] may also be present.\n\nWhen no other heart defects are present it is called 'simple' d-TGA; when other defects are present it is called 'complex' d-TGA.\n\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, complex d-TGA presents better chance of survival and less [[child development|developmental]] risks than simple d-TGA, as well as usually requiring fewer invasive [[palliative]] procedures. This is because the left-to-right and bidirectional [[Cardiac shunt|shunting]] caused by the defects common to complex d-TGA allow a higher amount of oxygen-rich blood to enter the [[systemic circulation]]. However, complex d-TGA may cause a very slight increase to length and risk of the corrective [[surgery]], as most or all other heart defects will normally be repaired at the same time, and the heart becomes \"[[irritation|irritated]]\" the more it is manipulated.\n\n==Treatment==\n{{cleanup |section |reason=this section is poorly formatted and disorganised. Too few references are given and many acronyms are obscure and not identified |date=December 2013}}\nIf the diagnosis is made in a standard [[hospital]] or other [[clinic|clinical facility]], the baby will be transferred to a [[children's hospital]], if such facilities are available, for specialized [[paediatric]] treatment and equipment.\n\nThe patient will require constant monitoring and care in an [[intensive care unit]] ('''ICU''').\n\n===Palliative===\n[[Palliative]] treatment is normally administered prior to corrective surgery in order to reduce the symptoms of d-TGA (and any other complications), giving the newborn or infant a better chance of surviving the surgery. Treatment may include any combination of:\n\n====Surgery====\n\n=====Minor=====\n*[[Cardiac catheterization]]\n**[[Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy]]\n**[[Balloon angioplasty]]\n**[[Endovascular stent]]ing\n**[[Angiography]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nCardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure which provides a means of performing a number of other procedures.\n\nA balloon atrial septostomy is performed with a [[balloon catheter]], which is inserted into a [[patent foramen ovale]] ( PFO ), or [[atrial septal defect]] ( ASD )  and inflated to enlarge the opening in the atrial septum; this creates a shunt which allows a larger amount of oxygenated (\"red\") blood to enter the systemic circulation.\n\nAngioplasty also requires a balloon catheter, which is used to stretch open a [[stenosis|stenotic]] vessel; this relieves restricted blood flow, which could otherwise lead to [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF).\n\nAn endovascular stent is sometimes placed in a stenotic vessel immediately following a balloon angioplasty to maintain the widened passage.\n\nAngiography involves using the catheter to release a [[contrast medium]] into the [[heart chamber|chambers]] and/or vessels of the heart; this process facilitates examining the flow of blood through the chambers during an echocardiogram, or shows the vessels clearly on a chest x-ray, MRI, or CT scan - this is of particular importance, as the coronary arteries must be carefully examined and \"mapped out\" prior to the corrective surgery.\n\nIt is commonplace for any of these palliations to be performed on a d-TGA patient.\n\n=====Moderate=====\n*[[Left anterior thoracotomy]]\n**Isolated [[pulmonary artery banding]] ('''PAB''')\n*[[Left lateral thoracotomy]]\n**PAB (when coarctation or aortic arch repair also required)\n*[[Right lateral thoracotomy]]\n**[[Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nEach of these procedures is performed through an [[Surgical incision|incision]] between the [[ribs]] and visualized by echocardiogram; these are far less common than heart cath procedures.\n\nPulmonary artery banding is used in a small number of cases of d-TGA, usually when the corrective surgery needs to be delayed, to create an artificial stenosis in order to control pulmonary [[blood pressure]]; PAB involves placing a band around the [[pulmonary trunk]], this band can then be quickly and easily adjusted when necessary.\n\nAn atrial septectomy is the surgical removal of the atrial septum; this is performed when a [[patent foramen ovale]] ( PFO ), or [[atrial septal defect]] ( ASD ) are not present and additional shunting is required to raise the oxygen saturation of the blood flowing eventually into the [[aorta]].\n\n=====Major=====\n*[[Median sternotomy]]\n**PAB (when intracardiac procedures also required)\n**Concomitant atrial septectomy\n{{Dynamic list}}\nIn recent years, it is quite rare for palliative procedures to be done via median sternotomy. However, if a sternotomy is required for a different procedure, in most cases all procedures that are immediately required will be performed at the same time.\n\n====Monitoring and maintenance====\n[[Image:Palliated neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Palliated pre-operative d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n*[[Nasogastric tube]] ('''NG tube''' or simply '''NG''')\n*[[Intubation]], [[oxygen mask]], or [[nasal cannula]]\n*[[Intravenous drip]] ('''IV''')\n*[[Arterial line]]\n*[[Central venous catheter]]\n*[[Fingerprick]]\n*[[Sphygmomanometer]]\n*[[Pulse oximeter]]\n*[[electrocardiogram|EKG]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nAn NG tube is used to deliver [[nourishment]], and occasionally [[medication]], to the patient. Since the tube extends right into the [[stomach]], it can also be used to monitor how well the patient is [[digestion|digesting]] their \"food\". [[Paediatric]] units normally provide facilities and equipment for mothers of infant patients to [[breast pump|pump]] their [[breastmilk]], which can then be fed to the infant through the NG tube, and/or stored for later use.\n\n[[Oxygen therapy]] is commonplace for hospitalized d-TGA patients. This may range from an oxygen mask resting on the bed nearby their head to intubation. In some cases, patients are intubated as a precaution; the machine can monitor [[Control of respiration|breathing]] and supplement the patient as much or as little as they need.\n\nIV's are used to deliver medication, blood products, or other fluids to the patient. Arterial lines provide a constant monitor of [[blood pressure]], as well as a method of obtaining samples for [[blood gas]] tests; central lines can also monitor blood pressure and provide blood samples, as well as provide a means to deliver medication and nourishment; fingerpricks (or heelpricks on small babies) are used to obtain blood samples for certain tests.\n\nA sphygmomanometer may be used for intermittent blood pressure monitoring even if a patient is being otherwise monitored using a central or arterial line.\n\nA pulse oximeter is attached to a finger or toe and provides constant or intermittent monitoring of the blood's oxygen saturation level.\n\nAn EKG creates a visual readout of how well the heart rhythm is functioning.\n\n====Medication====\n*[[Prostaglandin]] ('''PGE''')\n*[[Antibiotics]]\n*[[Diuretics]]\n*[[Analgesics]]\n*[[Cardiac glycoside]]s\n*[[Sedatives]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nWhen PGE is administered to a newborn, it prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, therefore providing an additional shunt through which to provide the systemic circulation with a higher level of oxygen.\n\nAntibiotics may be administered preventatively. However, due to the physical strain caused by uncorrected d-TGA, as well as the potential for introduction of bacteria via arterial and central lines, infection is not uncommon in pre-operative patients.\n\nDiuretics aid in flushing excess fluid from the body, thereby easing strain on the heart.\n\nAnalgesics normally are not used pre-operatively, but they may be used in certain cases. They are occasionally used partially for their sedative effects.\n\nCardiac glycosides are used to maintain proper heart rhythm while increasing the strength of each [[muscle contraction|contraction]].\n\nSedatives may be used palliatively to prevent a young child from thrashing about or pulling out any of their lines.\n\n===Corrective===\n\n====Nikaidoh====\nIt was Bex who introduced in 1980 the possibility of aortic translocation. But Nikaidoh has put the procedure in practice in 1984. It results in an anatomical normal heart, even better than with an ASO, because also the cones are switched instead of only the arteries as with an ASO. \nThe procedure is contra-indicated by certain coronary anomalies.\n\nIn 1984, Nikaidoh introduced a surgical approach for the management of TGA, VSD, and pulmonary stenosis (PS), which he called \u201caortic translocation and biventricular outflow tract reconstruction.\u201d The repair consisted of harvesting the aortic root from the right ventricle, with or without the coronary arteries attached, and relieving the LVOTO by dividing the outlet septum and pulmonary valve annulus. The LVOT is then restored by posteriorly\ntranslocating the aortic root and closing the VSD. Finally, the right ventricular outflow tract is reconstructed with a pericardial patch.\nThis is a technically challenging procedure, but results in a more \u201cnormal\u201d anatomic repair. The main thing is the repositioning of the native aortic root over to the LV cavity, avoiding the creation of a long tortuous intraventricular tunnel. This technique appears to prevent the development of LVOTO, which is a frequent complication of the Rastelli repair. The addition of the Lecompte maneuver may prevent branch pulmonary artery stenosis that may occur secondary to compression of the PA by the posteriorly displaced, translocated aortic root. It creates a direct RV to PA anastomosis and avoiding the use of a conduit, which should decrease the incidence of RVOT reinterventions.\n\n====Lecompte====\nSince 1981 LeCompte has put his [[LeCompte manoeuvre]] in use. This is used with the REV (R\u00e9paration \u00e0 l'Etage Ventriculaire). This surgery is like the Rastelli procedure, but with the use of the pulmonary artery without a conduit.\n\n====Rastelli====\nWhen an arterials switch operation (ASO) is not possible e.g. in case of LVOTO an option is the Rastelli procedure. The pulmonal artery is shifted with help of  conduit to the right ventricle. It has been used since 1960s. It has a disadvantage that the conduit does not grow, so re-operation is necessary.\n\n====Arterial switch====\n[[File:Blausen_0046_ArterialSwitchOperation_01.png|thumb|150px|left|Arterial switch procedure.]]\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Immediate post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\nThe '''[[Jatene procedure]]''' surgery is the preferred, and most frequently used, method of correcting d-TGA; ideally, it is performed on an infant between 8\u201314 days old.\n\nThe heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy, and a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine is used; as this machine needs its \"circulation\" to be filled with blood, a child will require a [[blood transfusion]] for this surgery. The procedure involves [[wiktionary:transect|transect]]ing both the aorta and pulmonary artery; the coronary arteries are then detached from the aorta and reattached to the [[neo-]]aorta, before \"swapping\" the upper portion of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the opposite arterial [[root]]. Including the [[anaesthesia]] and immediate [[post operative]] recovery, this surgery takes an average of approximately six to eight hours to complete.\n\nSome arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary [[stent]]ing via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or [[xenograft]].\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate2.jpg|thumb|right|One day post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n\n====Atrial switch====\nIn some cases, it is not possible to perform an arterial switch, either because of late diagnosis, [[sepsis]], or a [[contraindication|contraindicative]] coronary artery pattern. In the case of sepsis or late diagnosis, a delayed Arterial Switch can sometimes be made possible by PAB, which may also require a concomitant construction of an aortic-to-pulmonary artery shunt.\n\nWhen an arterial switch is impossible, an atrial switch will be attempted using either the '''[[Senning procedure|Senning]]''' or '''[[Mustard procedure|Mustard]]''' procedure. Both methods involve creating a [[Baffle (medical)|baffle]] to redirect red and blue blood flow to the appropriate artery. Since the late 1970s the Mustard procedure has been preferred.\n\n===Post-operative===\nFollowing corrective surgery but prior to cessation of anaesthesia, two small incisions are made immediately below the sternotomy incision which provide exit points for [[chest tube]]s used to drain fluid from the thoracic cavity, with one tube placed at the front and another at the rear of the heart.\n\nThe patient returns to the ICU post-operatively for recovery, maintenance, and close observation; recovery time may vary, but tends to average approximately two weeks, after which the patient may be transferred to a [[Transitional Care Unit]] ('''TCU'''), and eventually to a [[cardiac ward]].\n\nPost-operative care is very similar to the palliative care received, with the exception that the patient no longer requires PGE or the surgical palliation procedures. Additionally, the patient is kept on a cooling blanket for a period of time to prevent [[fever]], which could cause [[brain damage]]. The sternum is not closed immediately which allows extra space in the [[thoracic cavity]], preventing excess pressure on the heart, which [[Edema|swells]] considerably following the surgery; the sternum and incision are closed after a few days, when swelling is sufficiently reduced.\n\n===Follow-up===\nThe infant will continue to see a [[cardiologist]] on a regular basis. Although these appointments are required less frequently as time goes on, they will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual, and may increase in the event of complications or as the individual approaches [[middle age]].\n\nThe cardiology exam may include an echocardiogram, EKG, and/or [[cardiac stress test]] in addition to consultation.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals may require ongoing medication therapy at home, which may include diuretics (such as [[furosemide]] or [[spironolactone]]), analgesics (such as [[paracetamol]]), cardiac glycosides (such as [[digoxin]]), [[anticoagulant]]s (such as [[heparin]] or [[aspirin]]), or other medications. If the individual has undergone stenting, an anticoagulant will be a necessity to prevent build-up around the stent(s), as the body will perceive the foreign body as a wound and attempt to heal it.\n\nSome patients who had alternate corrective surgery, such as the Mustard or Senning procedure, may have issues with SA and VA nodal transmissions in later life. Typical symptoms include palpitations and problems with low heart rates.

The primary [[arteries]] (the [[aorta]] and the [[pulmonary artery]]) are [[wiktionary:transpose|transpose]]d.\n\nIt is called a [[cyanotic heart defect|cyanotic]] [[congenital]] [[congenital heart defect|heart defect]] ('''CHD''') because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen.In [[segmental analysis (biology)|segmental analysis]], this condition is described as '''[[wiktionary:ventriculoarterial|ventriculoarterial]] [[wiktionary:discordant|discordance]] with [[wiktionary:atrioventricular|atrioventricular]] [[wiktionary:concordance|concordance]]''', or just '''ventriculoarterial discordance'''.d-TGA is often referred to simply as '''[[transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''TGA'''); however, TGA is a more general term which may also refer to '''[[levo-transposition of the great arteries]]''' ('''l-TGA''').Another term commonly used to refer to both d-TGA and l-TGA is '''[[transposition of the great vessels]]''' ('''TGV'''), although this term might have an even broader meaning than TGA.\n\n[[wiktionary:Prenatal|Prenatal]]ly, a [[baby]] with d-TGA experiences no [[symptoms]] as the lungs will not be used until after [[childbirth|birth]], and oxygen is provided by the [[mother]] via the [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]]; in order for the red blood to bypass the lungs [[in utero]], the [[fetal]] heart has two shunts that begin to close when the [[newborn]] starts [[breath]]ing; these are the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale]] and the [[ductus arteriosus]]. The foramen ovale is a hole in the atrial septum which allows blood from the [[right atrium]] to flow into the [[left atrium]]; after birth, the left atrium will be filled with blood returning from the lungs and the foramen ovale will close. The ductus arteriosus is a small, artery-like structure which allows blood to flow from the trunk of the pulmonary artery into the aorta; after birth, the blood in the pulmonary artery will flow into the lungs and the ductus arteriosus will close. Sometimes these shunts will fail to close after birth; these defects are called [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] and [[patent ductus arteriosus]], and either may occur independently, or in combination with one another, or with d-TGA or other heart and/or general defects.\n\n==Symptoms and signs==\n[[Image:cyanotic neonate.jpg|thumb|right|cyanotic d-TGA + VSD neonate (unpalliated and pre-operative).]]\nDue to the low [[oxygen saturation]] of the blood, [[cyanosis]] will appear in [[wiktionary:peripheral|peripheral]] areas: around the mouth and lips, fingertips, and toes; these areas are furthest from the heart, and since the circulated blood is not fully oxygenated to begin with, very little oxygen reaches the [[peripheral arteries]]. A d-TGA baby will exhibit indrawing beneath the [[ribcage]] and \"comfortable [[tachypnea]]\" (rapid breathing); this is likely a [[homeostatic]] [[reflex]] of the [[autonomic nervous system]] in response to [[hypoxic hypoxia]]. The infant will be easily [[fatigue (physical)|fatigued]] and may experience weakness, particularly during feeding or playing; this interruption to feeding combined with hypoxia can cause [[failure to thrive]]. If d-TGA is not [[medical diagnosis|diagnose]]d and corrected early on, the infant may eventually experience [[fainting|syncopic episodes]] and develop [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the fingers and toes.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nd-TGA can sometimes be diagnosed in utero with an [[ultrasound]] after 18 weeks [[gestation]]. However, if it is not diagnosed in utero, cyanosis of the newborn ([[blue baby]]) should immediately indicate that there is a problem with the [[cardiovascular]] system. Normally, the lungs are examined first, then the heart is examined if there are no apparent problems with the lungs. These examinations are typically performed using ultrasound, known as an [[echocardiogram]] when performed on the heart. [[Chest x-ray]]s and [[electrocardiogram]]s ('''EKG''') may also be used in reaching or confirming a diagnosis; however, an [[x-ray]] may appear normal immediately following birth. If d-TGA is accompanied by both a VSD and pulmonary [[stenosis]], a [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] [[heart murmur|murmur]] will be present.\n\nOn the rare occasion (when there is a large [[Ventricular septal defect|VSD]] with no significant left [[ventricular outflow tract obstruction]]), initial symptoms may go unnoticed, resulting in the infant being discharged without treatment in the event of a [[Obstetrics|hospital]] or [[birthing center]] birth, or a delay in bringing the infant for diagnosis in the event of a [[home birth]]. On these occasions, a layperson is likely not to recognize symptoms until the infant is experiencing moderate to serious [[congestive heart failure]] ('''CHF''') as a result of the heart working harder in a [[wiktionary: futile|futile]] attempt to increase oxygen flow to the body; this overworking of the heart muscle eventually leads to [[Organ hypertrophy|hypertrophy]] and may result in [[cardiac arrest]] if left untreated.\n\n[[Image:d-TGA.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Normal heart anatomy compared to d-TGA]]\n\n===Description===\nIn a normal [[heart]], [[oxygen]]-depleted (\"blue\") blood is pumped from the [[right heart|right side of the heart]], through the pulmonary artery, to the [[lung]]s where it is oxygenated. The oxygen-rich (\"red\") blood then returns to the [[left heart]], via the [[pulmonary veins]], and is pumped through the aorta to the rest of the body, including the heart [[muscle]] itself.\n\nWith d-TGA, deoxygenated blood from the right heart is pumped immediately through the aorta and circulated to the body and the heart itself, bypassing the lungs altogether, while the left heart pumps oxygenated blood continuously back into the lungs through the pulmonary artery. In effect, two separate \"circular\" (parallel) circulatory systems are created, rather than the \"figure 8\" (in series) circulation of a normal [[Heart|cardio]]-[[pulmonary]] system.\n\n===Variations and similar defects===\n\n====Arterial spatial relationships====\nDifferences in the shape of the [[atrial septum]] and/or [[ventricular outflow tract]]s affect the [[anatomical position|relative positions]] of the aorta and pulmonary artery. In the majority of d-TGA cases, the aorta is [[anatomical position#Coronal plane|anterior]] and to the right of the pulmonary artery, but it can also be directly anterior or anterior and to the left. The aorta and pulmonary artery can also be side by side, with aorta on either side. This is a less common variant, and with this arrangement, an unusual [[coronary artery]] pattern is common. There are also some cases with aorta to the right and posterior to the pulmonary artery.<ref>'''Valdes-Cruz LM and Cayre RO''': Chapter 24 in ''Echocardiographic diagnosis of congenital heart disease''. Philadelphia 1998.</ref>\n\n====Simple and complex d-TGA====\nd-TGA is often accompanied by other heart defects, the most common type being [[wiktionary:intracardiac|intracardiac]] [[shunt (medical)|shunts]] such as [[atrial septal defect]] ('''ASD''') including [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] ('''PFO'''), [[ventricular septal defect]] ('''VSD'''), and [[patent ductus arteriosus]] ('''PDA'''). [[Stenosis]] of [[heart valve|valves]] or [[blood vessel|vessels]] may also be present.\n\nWhen no other heart defects are present it is called 'simple' d-TGA; when other defects are present it is called 'complex' d-TGA.\n\nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive, complex d-TGA presents better chance of survival and less [[child development|developmental]] risks than simple d-TGA, as well as usually requiring fewer invasive [[palliative]] procedures. This is because the left-to-right and bidirectional [[Cardiac shunt|shunting]] caused by the defects common to complex d-TGA allow a higher amount of oxygen-rich blood to enter the [[systemic circulation]]. However, complex d-TGA may cause a very slight increase to length and risk of the corrective [[surgery]], as most or all other heart defects will normally be repaired at the same time, and the heart becomes \"[[irritation|irritated]]\" the more it is manipulated.\n\n==Treatment==\n{{cleanup |section |reason=this section is poorly formatted and disorganised. Too few references are given and many acronyms are obscure and not identified |date=December 2013}}\nIf the diagnosis is made in a standard [[hospital]] or other [[clinic|clinical facility]], the baby will be transferred to a [[children's hospital]], if such facilities are available, for specialized [[paediatric]] treatment and equipment.\n\nThe patient will require constant monitoring and care in an [[intensive care unit]] ('''ICU''').\n\n===Palliative===\n[[Palliative]] treatment is normally administered prior to corrective surgery in order to reduce the symptoms of d-TGA (and any other complications), giving the newborn or infant a better chance of surviving the surgery. Treatment may include any combination of:\n\n====Surgery====\n\n=====Minor=====\n*[[Cardiac catheterization]]\n**[[Rashkind balloon atrial septostomy]]\n**[[Balloon angioplasty]]\n**[[Endovascular stent]]ing\n**[[Angiography]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nCardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure which provides a means of performing a number of other procedures.\n\nA balloon atrial septostomy is performed with a [[balloon catheter]], which is inserted into a [[patent foramen ovale]] ( PFO ), or [[atrial septal defect]] ( ASD )  and inflated to enlarge the opening in the atrial septum; this creates a shunt which allows a larger amount of oxygenated (\"red\") blood to enter the systemic circulation.\n\nAngioplasty also requires a balloon catheter, which is used to stretch open a [[stenosis|stenotic]] vessel; this relieves restricted blood flow, which could otherwise lead to [[congestive heart failure]] (CHF).\n\nAn endovascular stent is sometimes placed in a stenotic vessel immediately following a balloon angioplasty to maintain the widened passage.\n\nAngiography involves using the catheter to release a [[contrast medium]] into the [[heart chamber|chambers]] and/or vessels of the heart; this process facilitates examining the flow of blood through the chambers during an echocardiogram, or shows the vessels clearly on a chest x-ray, MRI, or CT scan - this is of particular importance, as the coronary arteries must be carefully examined and \"mapped out\" prior to the corrective surgery.\n\nIt is commonplace for any of these palliations to be performed on a d-TGA patient.\n\n=====Moderate=====\n*[[Left anterior thoracotomy]]\n**Isolated [[pulmonary artery banding]] ('''PAB''')\n*[[Left lateral thoracotomy]]\n**PAB (when coarctation or aortic arch repair also required)\n*[[Right lateral thoracotomy]]\n**[[Blalock-Hanlon atrial septectomy]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nEach of these procedures is performed through an [[Surgical incision|incision]] between the [[ribs]] and visualized by echocardiogram; these are far less common than heart cath procedures.\n\nPulmonary artery banding is used in a small number of cases of d-TGA, usually when the corrective surgery needs to be delayed, to create an artificial stenosis in order to control pulmonary [[blood pressure]]; PAB involves placing a band around the [[pulmonary trunk]], this band can then be quickly and easily adjusted when necessary.\n\nAn atrial septectomy is the surgical removal of the atrial septum; this is performed when a [[patent foramen ovale]] ( PFO ), or [[atrial septal defect]] ( ASD ) are not present and additional shunting is required to raise the oxygen saturation of the blood flowing eventually into the [[aorta]].\n\n=====Major=====\n*[[Median sternotomy]]\n**PAB (when intracardiac procedures also required)\n**Concomitant atrial septectomy\n{{Dynamic list}}\nIn recent years, it is quite rare for palliative procedures to be done via median sternotomy. However, if a sternotomy is required for a different procedure, in most cases all procedures that are immediately required will be performed at the same time.\n\n====Monitoring and maintenance====\n[[Image:Palliated neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Palliated pre-operative d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n*[[Nasogastric tube]] ('''NG tube''' or simply '''NG''')\n*[[Intubation]], [[oxygen mask]], or [[nasal cannula]]\n*[[Intravenous drip]] ('''IV''')\n*[[Arterial line]]\n*[[Central venous catheter]]\n*[[Fingerprick]]\n*[[Sphygmomanometer]]\n*[[Pulse oximeter]]\n*[[electrocardiogram|EKG]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nAn NG tube is used to deliver [[nourishment]], and occasionally [[medication]], to the patient. Since the tube extends right into the [[stomach]], it can also be used to monitor how well the patient is [[digestion|digesting]] their \"food\". [[Paediatric]] units normally provide facilities and equipment for mothers of infant patients to [[breast pump|pump]] their [[breastmilk]], which can then be fed to the infant through the NG tube, and/or stored for later use.\n\n[[Oxygen therapy]] is commonplace for hospitalized d-TGA patients. This may range from an oxygen mask resting on the bed nearby their head to intubation. In some cases, patients are intubated as a precaution; the machine can monitor [[Control of respiration|breathing]] and supplement the patient as much or as little as they need.\n\nIV's are used to deliver medication, blood products, or other fluids to the patient. Arterial lines provide a constant monitor of [[blood pressure]], as well as a method of obtaining samples for [[blood gas]] tests; central lines can also monitor blood pressure and provide blood samples, as well as provide a means to deliver medication and nourishment; fingerpricks (or heelpricks on small babies) are used to obtain blood samples for certain tests.\n\nA sphygmomanometer may be used for intermittent blood pressure monitoring even if a patient is being otherwise monitored using a central or arterial line.\n\nA pulse oximeter is attached to a finger or toe and provides constant or intermittent monitoring of the blood's oxygen saturation level.\n\nAn EKG creates a visual readout of how well the heart rhythm is functioning.\n\n====Medication====\n*[[Prostaglandin]] ('''PGE''')\n*[[Antibiotics]]\n*[[Diuretics]]\n*[[Analgesics]]\n*[[Cardiac glycoside]]s\n*[[Sedatives]]\n{{Dynamic list}}\nWhen PGE is administered to a newborn, it prevents the ductus arteriosus from closing, therefore providing an additional shunt through which to provide the systemic circulation with a higher level of oxygen.\n\nAntibiotics may be administered preventatively. However, due to the physical strain caused by uncorrected d-TGA, as well as the potential for introduction of bacteria via arterial and central lines, infection is not uncommon in pre-operative patients.\n\nDiuretics aid in flushing excess fluid from the body, thereby easing strain on the heart.\n\nAnalgesics normally are not used pre-operatively, but they may be used in certain cases. They are occasionally used partially for their sedative effects.\n\nCardiac glycosides are used to maintain proper heart rhythm while increasing the strength of each [[muscle contraction|contraction]].\n\nSedatives may be used palliatively to prevent a young child from thrashing about or pulling out any of their lines.\n\n===Corrective===\n\n====Nikaidoh====\nIt was Bex who introduced in 1980 the possibility of aortic translocation. But Nikaidoh has put the procedure in practice in 1984. It results in an anatomical normal heart, even better than with an ASO, because also the cones are switched instead of only the arteries as with an ASO. \nThe procedure is contra-indicated by certain coronary anomalies.\n\nIn 1984, Nikaidoh introduced a surgical approach for the management of TGA, VSD, and pulmonary stenosis (PS), which he called \u201caortic translocation and biventricular outflow tract reconstruction.\u201d The repair consisted of harvesting the aortic root from the right ventricle, with or without the coronary arteries attached, and relieving the LVOTO by dividing the outlet septum and pulmonary valve annulus. The LVOT is then restored by posteriorly\ntranslocating the aortic root and closing the VSD. Finally, the right ventricular outflow tract is reconstructed with a pericardial patch.\nThis is a technically challenging procedure, but results in a more \u201cnormal\u201d anatomic repair. The main thing is the repositioning of the native aortic root over to the LV cavity, avoiding the creation of a long tortuous intraventricular tunnel. This technique appears to prevent the development of LVOTO, which is a frequent complication of the Rastelli repair. The addition of the Lecompte maneuver may prevent branch pulmonary artery stenosis that may occur secondary to compression of the PA by the posteriorly displaced, translocated aortic root. It creates a direct RV to PA anastomosis and avoiding the use of a conduit, which should decrease the incidence of RVOT reinterventions.\n\n====Lecompte====\nSince 1981 LeCompte has put his [[LeCompte manoeuvre]] in use. This is used with the REV (R\u00e9paration \u00e0 l'Etage Ventriculaire). This surgery is like the Rastelli procedure, but with the use of the pulmonary artery without a conduit.\n\n====Rastelli====\nWhen an arterials switch operation (ASO) is not possible e.g. in case of LVOTO an option is the Rastelli procedure. The pulmonal artery is shifted with help of  conduit to the right ventricle. It has been used since 1960s. It has a disadvantage that the conduit does not grow, so re-operation is necessary.\n\n====Arterial switch====\n[[File:Blausen_0046_ArterialSwitchOperation_01.png|thumb|150px|left|Arterial switch procedure.]]\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate.jpg|thumb|right|Immediate post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\nThe '''[[Jatene procedure]]''' surgery is the preferred, and most frequently used, method of correcting d-TGA; ideally, it is performed on an infant between 8\u201314 days old.\n\nThe heart and vessels are accessed via median sternotomy, and a [[cardiopulmonary bypass]] machine is used; as this machine needs its \"circulation\" to be filled with blood, a child will require a [[blood transfusion]] for this surgery. The procedure involves [[wiktionary:transect|transect]]ing both the aorta and pulmonary artery; the coronary arteries are then detached from the aorta and reattached to the [[neo-]]aorta, before \"swapping\" the upper portion of the aorta and pulmonary artery to the opposite arterial [[root]]. Including the [[anaesthesia]] and immediate [[post operative]] recovery, this surgery takes an average of approximately six to eight hours to complete.\n\nSome arterial switch recipients may present with post-operative pulmonary stenosis, which would then be repaired with angioplasty, pulmonary [[stent]]ing via heart cath or median sternotomy, and/or [[xenograft]].\n[[Image:Postop Jatene neonate2.jpg|thumb|right|One day post-operative (Jatene procedure) d-TGA + VSD neonate.]]\n\n====Atrial switch====\nIn some cases, it is not possible to perform an arterial switch, either because of late diagnosis, [[sepsis]], or a [[contraindication|contraindicative]] coronary artery pattern. In the case of sepsis or late diagnosis, a delayed Arterial Switch can sometimes be made possible by PAB, which may also require a concomitant construction of an aortic-to-pulmonary artery shunt.\n\nWhen an arterial switch is impossible, an atrial switch will be attempted using either the '''[[Senning procedure|Senning]]''' or '''[[Mustard procedure|Mustard]]''' procedure. Both methods involve creating a [[Baffle (medical)|baffle]] to redirect red and blue blood flow to the appropriate artery. Since the late 1970s the Mustard procedure has been preferred.\n\n===Post-operative===\nFollowing corrective surgery but prior to cessation of anaesthesia, two small incisions are made immediately below the sternotomy incision which provide exit points for [[chest tube]]s used to drain fluid from the thoracic cavity, with one tube placed at the front and another at the rear of the heart.\n\nThe patient returns to the ICU post-operatively for recovery, maintenance, and close observation; recovery time may vary, but tends to average approximately two weeks, after which the patient may be transferred to a [[Transitional Care Unit]] ('''TCU'''), and eventually to a [[cardiac ward]].\n\nPost-operative care is very similar to the palliative care received, with the exception that the patient no longer requires PGE or the surgical palliation procedures. Additionally, the patient is kept on a cooling blanket for a period of time to prevent [[fever]], which could cause [[brain damage]]. The sternum is not closed immediately which allows extra space in the [[thoracic cavity]], preventing excess pressure on the heart, which [[Edema|swells]] considerably following the surgery; the sternum and incision are closed after a few days, when swelling is sufficiently reduced.\n\n===Follow-up===\nThe infant will continue to see a [[cardiologist]] on a regular basis. Although these appointments are required less frequently as time goes on, they will continue throughout the lifetime of the individual, and may increase in the event of complications or as the individual approaches [[middle age]].\n\nThe cardiology exam may include an echocardiogram, EKG, and/or [[cardiac stress test]] in addition to consultation.\n\nAdditionally, some individuals may require ongoing medication therapy at home, which may include diuretics (such as [[furosemide]] or [[spironolactone]]), analgesics (such as [[paracetamol]]), cardiac glycosides (such as [[digoxin]]), [[anticoagulant]]s (such as [[heparin]] or [[aspirin]]), or other medications. If the individual has undergone stenting, an anticoagulant will be a necessity to prevent build-up around the stent(s), as the body will perceive the foreign body as a wound and attempt to heal it.\n\nSome patients who had alternate corrective surgery, such as the Mustard or Senning procedure, may have issues with SA and VA nodal transmissions in later life. Typical symptoms include palpitations and problems with low heart rates. This is commonly solved with a Pacemaker unit, providing scar tissue from the original operation does not block its functionality.\n\nMore recently, ACE inhibitors have been prescribed to patients in the hope of relieving stress on the heart.\n==Prognosis==\nWith simple d-TGA, if the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are allowed to close naturally, the newborn will likely not survive long enough to receive corrective surgery. With complex d-TGA, the infant will fail to thrive and is unlikely to survive longer than a year if corrective surgery is not performed. In most cases, the patient's condition will deteriorate to the point of inoperability  if the defect is not corrected in the first year.\n\nWhile the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus are open after birth, some mixing of red and blue blood occurs allowing a small amount of oxygen to be delivered to the body; if ASD, VSD, PFO, and/or PDA are present, this will allow a higher amount of the red and blue blood to be mixed, therefore delivering more oxygen to the body, but can complicate and lengthen the corrective surgery and/or be [[symptomatic]].\n\nModern repair procedures within the ideal timeframe and without additional complications have a very high success rate.\n\n==Epidemiology==\n*Heart defects are the most common [[congenital disorder|birth defect]], occurring in approximately 1% of live births\n*Approximately one million people worldwide are currently living with a CHD\n*Having a child with a CHD increases an individual\u2019s chances of having another child with a CHD from 1% to 3%.

He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nIn late 2018 to early 2019, the band went for recording their debut album in a studio based in their hometown Ranchi. They were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India | Eastern India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants. The band was booked to judge Fuego of KIIT Fest 2019 in [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Highway 69 as the judges for Fuego.|url=https://www.facebook.com/kiitfest/photos/a.754450924636786/2076640085751190/|website=Facebook page of KIIT Fest|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Avalanche of [[Srijan]] 2019 in [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]] and twice at Rhapsody of Bitotsav 2019 and 2020 in [[Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The local metal band of Ranchi, Highway 69 performed in the Fusion Arena|url=https://bitmesra.ac.in/naps/11813-2/|website=NAPS of BIT Mesra|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> They even got headliner shows in [[Jorhat]], twice in [[Jalpaiguri]], opening for [[Jubin Nautiyal]], a Bollywood singer at [[Srijan]] of [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]], Bitotsav of [[Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Plethora of events enthuse participants at BITOTSAV 2020|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/plethora-of-events-enthuse-participants-at-bitotsav-2020.html|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and shows in Ranchi.<ref>{{cite web|title=State to celebrate its 19th year of foundation on November 15|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/state-to-celebrate-its-19th-year-of-foundation-on-november-15.html|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Despite their decision of 2018, which meant to not take part in any competitions, the band went to register for Wacken Metal Battle which is organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]]. It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nIn late 2018 to early 2019, the band went for recording their debut album in a studio based in their hometown Ranchi. They were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:1 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/2013\n at:01/01/2014\n at:01/01/2015\n at:01/01/2016\n at:01/01/2017\n at:01/01/2018\n at:01/01/2019\n at:01/01/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

Whilst the Party was officially established in July 1921, the Chinese Socialist Youth League was organized with the Party being set up throughout the country. In May 1922, the 1st National Congress ({{zh|s=\u5168\u56fd\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u4f1a|t=\u5168\u570b\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u6703|p=Qu\u00e1ngu\u00f3 D\u00e0ibi\u01ceo D\u00e0hu\u00ec}}) of the League was held under the leadership of the Party, and therefore became a unified organization in China. In the 3rd National Congress in January 1925, the Chinese Socialist Youth League was renamed as the Chinese Communist Youth League. After the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]], in order to adapt to the new social and political situation, it was officially renamed as the '''Chinese New Democracy Youth League''' in April 1949.\n\nLater in May 1957, its name as the Chinese Communist Youth League was resumed, historically combining the congresses of all three leagues (the Chinese Socialist Youth League, the Chinese Communist Youth League as well as the Chinese New Democracy Youth League). During the 10 years of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the functioning of the League was blocked and the Central Committee was disbanded as it was accused of revisionism; its functions were partly resumed in the early 1970s. From 1978 to 2008, six congresses were held.\n\nThe Communist Youth League has contributed a number of top echelon leaders of the Communist Party-led government of the People's Republic of China. The proliferation of leaders with a Youth League background has led to the informal name \"[[Tuanpai|Youth League faction]]\" being used to describe certain members of the leadership at different times. The first \"Youth League faction\" was represented by [[Hu Yaobang]] (party chairman 1981-1982, party general secretary 1982-1987 following the abolition of the chairman position). The second \"Youth League faction\" is represented by [[Hu Jintao]] (General secretary 2002-2012, President 2003-2013). While there is no direct political lineage between the two Hus, Hu Jintao's administration has formally elevated the memory of the earlier Hu.

Whilst the Party was officially established in July 1921, the Chinese Socialist Youth League was organized with the Party being set up throughout the country. In May 1922, the 1st National Congress ({{zh|s=\u5168\u56fd\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u4f1a|t=\u5168\u570b\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u6703|p=Qu\u00e1ngu\u00f3 D\u00e0ibi\u01ceo D\u00e0hu\u00ec}}) of the League was held under the leadership of the Party, and therefore became a unified organization in China. In the 3rd National Congress in January 1925, the Chinese Socialist Youth League was renamed as the Chinese Communist Youth League. After the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945)|Sino-Japanese War]], in order to adapt to the new social and political situation, it was officially renamed as the '''Chinese New Democracy Youth League''' in April 1949.\n\nLater in May 1957, its name as the Chinese Communist Youth League was resumed, historically combining the congresses of all three leagues (the Chinese Socialist Youth League, the Chinese Communist Youth League as well as the Chinese New Democracy Youth League). During the 10 years of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the functioning of the League was blocked and the Central Committee was disbanded as it was accused of revisionism; its functions were partly resumed in the early 1970s. From 1978 to 2008, six congresses were held.\n\nThe Communist Youth League has contributed a number of top echelon leaders of the Communist Party-led government of the People's Republic of China. The proliferation of leaders with a Youth League background has led to the informal name \"[[Tuanpai|Youth League faction]]\" being used to describe certain members of the leadership at different times. The first \"Youth League faction\" was represented by [[Hu Yaobang]] (party chairman 1981-1982, party general secretary 1982-1987 following the abolition of the chairman position). The second \"Youth League faction\" is represented by [[Hu Jintao]] (General secretary 2002-2012, President 2003-2013). While there is no direct political lineage between the two Hus, Hu Jintao's administration has formally elevated the memory of the earlier Hu.
