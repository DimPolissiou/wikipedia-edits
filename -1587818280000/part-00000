The song describes the [[Battle of New Orleans]] from the perspective of an American soldier; the song tells the tale of the battle with a light tone and provides a rather comical version of what actually happened at the battle.

It was first broadcast on [[Adult Swim]] in the United States on December 18, 2005. In the episode, protagonist [[Huey Freeman]] seizes complete creative control of his elementary school's annual [[Christmas]] play, but runs into trouble with administration when he wishes to portray [[Jesus]] as [[dark skin|black]]. Meanwhile, [[Riley Freeman]] rekindles an old grudge he has against [[Santa Claus]].\n\n\"A Huey Freeman Christmas\" was directed by Seung Eun Kim and the script was written by series creator [[Aaron McGruder]].\n\n==Plot==\nHuey's culturally sensitive teacher, Mr. Uberwitz, offers him a chance to direct the school's Christmas play in the hope of seeing an African-American perspective on the holiday. Huey is skeptical at first, thinking that Uberwitz will get fired for making this offer, but accepts on the condition that Uberwitz sign an agreement giving him full creative control. He begins writing a new play that adheres to his unique vision, sets up an office to manage the organizational work, and hires [[Quincy Jones]] as music director.\n\nFinding that the students cast in the play are goofing off instead of rehearsing, Huey angrily fires all of them and consults with Jones about bringing in high-profile movie stars to fill the roles. He ignores protests from the Woodcrest [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] over the children's dismissal. When Huey refuses the school principal's demand that Jesus not be portrayed as black, the principal tears up Huey's agreement with Uberwitz. Demoralized and exhausted, Huey turns control over to Uberwitz, asking only to have his name removed from the production.\n\nUberwitz stages the play exactly as Huey wrote it, but only ten people show up to see the play. It is well-received by the local theater critics who attend, but almost no one else in Woodcrest is there to see it due to the PTA protests. Huey considers the play a success, but he regrets his decision to exclude his classmates and is disappointed that the public did not want to see his artistic vision. His vision was never made into a TV special nor a movie which Huey accepted out of arrogance. Uberwitz loses his job as Huey had predicted, but eventually becomes a college professor specializing in African-American studies.\n\nMeanwhile, Riley feuds with a shopping mall Santa, attacking him first with a folding chair and golf club and later with his airsoft guns. Riley is angry over not getting a set of wheel rims for Christmas in the past.

It was first broadcast on [[Adult Swim]] in the United States on December 18, 2005. In the episode, protagonist [[Huey Freeman]] seizes complete creative control of his elementary school's annual [[Christmas]] play, but runs into trouble with administration when he wishes to portray [[Jesus]] as [[dark skin|black]]. Meanwhile, [[Riley Freeman]] rekindles an old grudge he has against [[Santa Claus]].\n\n\"A Huey Freeman Christmas\" was directed by Seung Eun Kim and the script was written by series creator [[Aaron McGruder]].\n\n==Plot==\nHuey's culturally sensitive teacher, Mr. Uberwitz, offers him a chance to direct the school's Christmas play in the hope of seeing an African-American perspective on the holiday. Huey is skeptical at first, thinking that Uberwitz will get fired for making this offer, but accepts on the condition that Uberwitz sign an agreement giving him full creative control. He begins writing a new play that adheres to his unique vision, sets up an office to manage the organizational work, and hires [[Quincy Jones]] as music director. \n\nFinding that the students cast in the play are goofing off instead of rehearsing, Huey angrily fires all of them and consults with Jones about bringing in high-profile movie stars to fill the roles. He ignores protests from the Woodcrest [[parent-teacher association|PTA]] over the children's dismissal. When Huey refuses the school principal's demand that Jesus not be portrayed as black, the principal tears up Huey's agreement with Uberwitz. Demoralized and exhausted, Huey turns control over to Uberwitz, asking only to have his name removed from the production.\n\nUberwitz stages the play exactly as Huey wrote it, but only ten people show up to see the play. It is well-received by the local theater critics who attend, but almost no one else in Woodcrest is there to see it due to the PTA protests. Huey considers the play a success, but he regrets his decision to exclude his classmates and is disappointed that the public did not want to see his artistic vision. His vision was never made into a TV special nor a movie which Huey accepted out of arrogance. Uberwitz loses his job as Huey had predicted, but eventually becomes a college professor specializing in African-American studies.\n\nMeanwhile, Riley feuds with a shopping mall Santa, attacking him first with a folding chair and golf club and later with his airsoft guns. Riley is angry over not getting a set of wheel rims for Christmas in the past. [[Uncle Ruckus]] is hired by the mall to provide security for Santa, but proves inept at the job when Riley attacks again. Ruckus eventually becomes the new Santa, causing Jazmine to lose faith in the idea of Santa Claus until Ruckus claims that the real Santa had secretly chosen him to fill in after seeing how dangerous the mall could be. Jazmine accepts this story and attends Huey's play with Riley and Granddad, applauding enthusiastically as they sleep through it.\n\n==Reception==\nCurt Fields of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' deemed the episode \"excellent,\" writing, \"With a knowing spin on ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'', the story is a laugh-out-loud take on the holiday, consumerism and earnestly liberal white folks.\"<ref name=\"WP\">{{cite news|author=Curt Fields|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072700562_pf.html|title='Boondocks': Uncensored And Unbelievably Funny|date=July 28, 2006|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist |colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{imdb episode|0530298}}\n* {{tv.com episode|the-boondocks/a-huey-freeman-christmas-594201/}}\n\n{{The Boondocks}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Huey Freeman Christmas, A}}\n[[Category:The Boondocks (TV series) episodes]]\n[[Category:2006 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Christmas television episodes]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Huey_Freeman_Christmas"}

Made by [[Hammer Film Productions|Hammer Films]], it was adapted by [[Nigel Kneale]] from the novel ''The Devil's Own'' by [[Norah Lofts]], published under the pseudonym Peter Curtis.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|film|date=March 2018}}\n\nGwen Mayfield, an English schoolteacher recovering from a nervous breakdown in Africa, takes a job from the Reverend Alan Bax. Bax runs a school for young children in the remote village of Heddaby. It soon becomes apparent that Bax is neither a minister nor is the school associated with any church: Bax's sister, Stephanie, describes his wearing of the clerical collar as \"a harmless pretense\" and the only church nearby is an old ruin. Bax claims he wears clerical garb \"for security\", but refuses to elaborate.\n\nGwen finds that two of her students, Ronnie Dowsett and Linda Rigg, are beginning a juvenile romance that seems opposed by adults in the village. Ronnie secretly tells Gwen that Linda is physically abused by the grandmother who raises her. Gwen visits their home to investigate and is told that Linda has injured her hand in a household accident. When the grandmother is out of the room, Linda insists her grandmother injured her hand in a laundry wringer.\n\nRonnie is a gifted student. Bax wants to send him to a special \"cramming\" school that will better prepare him for university, but the boy's father is opposed to sending Ronnie away. Gwen volunteers to give the boy additional tutoring to compensate.\n\nRonnie presents Linda with a male doll as a mate to her female one, suggesting that the dolls represent them as a couple. The new doll goes missing. The next day, Ronnie falls into a coma and is hospitalized.\n\nGwen finds the missing doll in the fork of a tree. Pins have been stuck through it and the head is missing. She shows it to Linda, who suggests it is witchcraft. When Gwen tries to remove the pins, Linda insists that trying to undo magic reinforces one's belief in it, giving power to the witch. Gwen concedes to this wisdom. Impressed by Gwen's knowledge of witchcraft in Africa, Stephanie invites Gwen to assist her with an article about witchcraft in contemporary England.\n\nMrs. Dowsett, described by her husband as having \"silly\" beliefs, once came down with [[shingles]] after an argument with Mrs. Rigg about Ronnie. When Gwen asks her about the possible cause of Ronnie's coma, Mrs. Dowsett becomes upset and confronts Rigg. The next day, Ronnie is out of the coma. Mrs. Dowsett takes him away to family in Wales. Suspecting some kind of arrangement with Rigg, Mr. Dowsett confronts Rigg and is later found drowned on the beach.\n\nCircumstantial evidence suggests to Gwen that real witches are behind the Dowsetts' troubles. She announces her plans to testify to this at the inquest into Dowsett's death. Following an injury from Stephanie's dogs, Gwen is taken to the Baxes' home where she is treated by the local doctor. Frightened in the night by an African totem, she suffers another nervous breakdown. \n\nRecovering weeks later in a special care hospital, Gwen has no memory of leaving Africa or ever hearing of Heddaby. Her memory is jogged days later when a little girl with a doll visits another patient. Convinced that something dire may happen to Linda, she escapes the hospital and hitchhikes to Heddaby. Gwen is warmly welcomed by the villagers, but one of them confides that \"they\" have taken Linda. Waylaid by the Baxes, who had paid for her care at the hospital, Gwen is not able to check on Linda for several days. Mrs. Rigg nervously tells her that Linda is staying with relatives elsewhere.\n\nSeeing from the Baxes' window a group of people scurrying toward the ruined church, Gwen slips away to investigate. Alan appears and tries to ward her back to the house, but Gwen enters to ruin and finds a witches circle. Stephanie arrives and reveals herself as the priestess of the local coven, her long-term plan to initiate Gwen into their ranks. The coven members emerge from the shadows and a ceremony begins.\n\nStephanie explains that she has learned a ritual that extends life through the ritual sacrifice of a pure maiden. Ronnie had to be sent away so that Linda could be used in the ritual. Planned for the next night, the place of sacrifice is to be kept spiritually clean or the power of the ritual will turn upon the witch. Unable to find where they are hiding Linda, Gwen waits for the ceremony. Linda is there but in a trance, unable to assist in her own rescue. As Stephanie raises the ritual knife to kill the girl, Gwen cuts herself and smears her blood on Stephanie's robe, defiling it. Seized with convulsions, Stephanie tries to remove her soiled garb, but falls dead.\n\nThe villagers, magically enslaved by Stephanie, were not willing members of the coven. Freed of her control, Heddaby returns to normal over the next several weeks.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Joan Fontaine]] as Gwen Mayfield\n*[[Kay Walsh]] as Stephanie Bax\n*[[Alec McCowen]] as Alan Bax\n*[[Ann Bell]] as Sally Benson\n*[[Ingrid Boulting|Ingrid Brett]] as Linda Rigg \n*[[John Collin (actor)|John Collin]] as Dowsett\n*[[Michele Dotrice]] as Valerie Creek\n*[[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies]] as Granny Rigg\n*[[Duncan Lamont]] as Bob Curd\n*[[Leonard Rossiter]] as Dr. Wallis\n*[[Martin Stephens (actor)|Martin Stephens]] as Ronnie Dowsett\n*[[Carmel McSharry]] as Mrs. Dowsett\n*[[Viola Keats]] as Mrs. Curd\n*[[Shelagh Fraser]] as Mrs. Creek\n*[[Bryan Marshall]] as Tom\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nThe village of [[Hambleden]], [[Buckinghamshire]], was the [[filming location]] for the fictional village of Heddaby.

The coven members emerge from the shadows and a ceremony begins.\n\nStephanie explains that she has learned a ritual that extends life through the ritual sacrifice of a pure maiden. Ronnie had to be sent away so that Linda could be used in the ritual. Planned for the next night, the place of sacrifice is to be kept spiritually clean or the power of the ritual will turn upon the witch. Unable to find where they are hiding Linda, Gwen waits for the ceremony. Linda is there but in a trance, unable to assist in her own rescue. As Stephanie raises the ritual knife to kill the girl, Gwen cuts herself and smears her blood on Stephanie's robe, defiling it. Seized with convulsions, Stephanie tries to remove her soiled garb, but falls dead.\n\nThe villagers, magically enslaved by Stephanie, were not willing members of the coven. Freed of her control, Heddaby returns to normal over the next several weeks.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Joan Fontaine]] as Gwen Mayfield\n*[[Kay Walsh]] as Stephanie Bax\n*[[Alec McCowen]] as Alan Bax\n*[[Ann Bell]] as Sally Benson\n*[[Ingrid Boulting|Ingrid Brett]] as Linda Rigg \n*[[John Collin (actor)|John Collin]] as Dowsett\n*[[Michele Dotrice]] as Valerie Creek\n*[[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies]] as Granny Rigg\n*[[Duncan Lamont]] as Bob Curd\n*[[Leonard Rossiter]] as Dr. Wallis\n*[[Martin Stephens (actor)|Martin Stephens]] as Ronnie Dowsett\n*[[Carmel McSharry]] as Mrs. Dowsett\n*[[Viola Keats]] as Mrs. Curd\n*[[Shelagh Fraser]] as Mrs. Creek\n*[[Bryan Marshall]] as Tom\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}\nThe village of [[Hambleden]], [[Buckinghamshire]], was the [[filming location]] for the fictional village of Heddaby.

Don't Tell Me!''''' is an hour-long weekly [[news]]-based radio [[panel show]] produced by [[WBEZ]] and [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. On the program, panelists and contestants are quizzed in humorous ways about that week's news. It is distributed by NPR in the United States, internationally on NPR Worldwide and on the [[Internet]] via [[podcast]], and typically broadcast on weekends by member stations. The show averages about 6 million weekly listeners on air and via podcast.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Steve|title=NPR's 'Wait Wait' is even more fun live|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-1220-wait-wait-taping-20161219-story.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=December 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Wait Wait...

The show also often travels to various cities in the United States and produces a road show in front of a live audience for promotional and station-related purposes. In situations where shows cannot be recorded in front of an audience, shows are recorded at the studios of WBEZ with panelists using [[videotelephony]] to appear, a situation which has occurred during the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]]. A show previous to the halting of traveling and Chase Auditorium shows at [[Atlanta]]'s [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta)|Fox Theatre]] was recorded with no audience due to public health concerns after all on-air and recording personnel had arrived.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxtheatre.org/events/detail/wait-wait-dont-tell-me|title=Event Information|date=12 March 2020|publisher=Fox Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe show is hosted by playwright and actor [[Peter Sagal]]. When the program had its debut in January 1998, Dan Coffey of ''[[Ask Dr. Science]]'' was the original host, but a revamping of the show led to his replacement in May of that year. The show has also been guest-hosted by [[Tom Bodett]], [[Luke Burbank]], [[Adam Felber]], [[Peter Grosz]], [[Mike Pesca]], [[Says You!|Richard Sher]], [[Bill Radke]], [[Susan Stamberg]], [[Robert Siegel]], [[Brian Unger]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Helen Hong]], [[Jessi Klein]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=35&prgDate=08-12-2006 |title=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!- August 12, 2006|publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2005/aug/050827.waitwait.html |title=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!- August 27, 2005 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2004/aug/040814.waitwait.html |title=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!- August 14, 2004 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Roti|first1=Jessi|title=Tom Hanks to guest host 'Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me' in Chicago|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chicagoinc/ct-tom-hanks-to-guest-host-on-npr-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref>[https://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/519656715/wait-wait-for-march-11-2017-with-not-my-job-guest-neal-brennan?showDate=2017-03-11 {{\"'}}Wait Wait' For March 11, 2017: Guest Host Jessi Klein with Not My Job Guest Neal Brennan\"]</ref> and [[Faith Salie]] when Sagal was on vacation.\n\n[[Carl Kasell]], who also served as the newsreader on ''[[Morning Edition]]'', was the show's official judge and scorekeeper until his retirement on May 17, 2014, after which the role was taken over permanently by journalist [[Bill Kurtis]]. In addition to Kurtis, Korva Coleman, [[Corey Flintoff]], Jean Cochran and Chioke L'Anson among others, have also served this role in the past. \n\n''Wait Wait...'' listeners also participate by telephoning or sending [[email]]s to nominate themselves as contestants.  The producers select several listeners for each show and call them to appear on the program, playing various games featuring questions based on the week's news. Prior to October 21, 2017, the usual prize for winning any game was to have Kasell (named \"Scorekeeper Emeritus\" following his retirement) record a greeting on the contestant's home [[answering machine]] or [[voice mail]] system.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/article/carl-kasell-steps-down-wait-wait-dont-tell-me-201796 | title = Carl Kasell steps down from Wait Wait\u2026 Don't Tell Me | first = Erik | last = Adams | date = March 4, 2014 | accessdate = 2017-07-11 | work = [[The A.V.

Don't Tell Me!.jpg|thumb|right|Kurtis and Sagal, 2017]]\nThough there are some deviations from time to time, episodes of ''Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!'' feature the following format:\n\n===Opening tease===\nAs with other NPR programs, ''Wait Wait'' offers a one-minute top-of-hour billboard teasing the program that will follow the network's hourly newscast (which traditionally starts at 1 minute past the hour).  In this minute, the host offers a humorous comment on the week's news, mentions the identity of the week's interview guest, and sets up an out-of-context reading by Kurtis of a quote or game title from the episode.\n\n===Who's Bill This Time?===\nThe contestant is asked to identify the speaker or explain the context of three quotations from that week's major news stories as read by Bill Kurtis. Each answer is followed by a humorous discussion of the story by the host and the panelists. Two correct answers constitute a win for the contestant. Prior to Kasell's retirement, the segment was known as \"Who's Carl This Time?\" and he read the quotations.\n\n===Panel questions===\nIn two separate segments each week, the host asks the panelists questions regarding less serious stories in the week's news, awarding them one point for each correct answer.  The questions are phrased similarly to those featured on ''[[The Match Game]]'' or ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' to allow the panelists to offer a comedic answer in addition to their real guess as well as a hint from the host if needed.  The answer is often followed by a discussion of the story.\n\n===Bluff the Listener===\nEach panelist reads an unusual story, all sharing a common theme. Only one of the three stories is genuine; the contestant wins the prize by choosing it. A sound bite from a person connected to the genuine story is played to reveal whether the contestant's guess is correct. Regardless of the outcome, the panelist whose story is chosen scores one point.\n\n===Not My Job===\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right |  audio1 = [https://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/2006/11/04/13109791/ Jimmy Wales plays \"Not my job\"], 10:19, [[NPR]], November 4, 2006<ref name=\"w8w8\">{{cite web | title =Not My Job: Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales | work = Wait Wait...

Don't Tell Me! guests}}\n\nA celebrity guest calls in (or occasionally appears on stage) to be interviewed by the host and the panelists as well as take a three-question multiple-choice quiz. In ''Wait Wait''{{'}}s early years, \"Not My Job\" guests were mainly culled from NPR's roster of personalities and reporters; the pool of guests later expanded to include guests of greater celebrity.  As the segment's title suggests, the guests are quizzed on topics that are not normally associated with their field of work.  For example, former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked questions on the history of [[Hugh Hefner]] and ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite interview | subject=Madeleine Albright | interviewer=Peter Sagal |title=Not My Job! | url=https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2003/dec/031206.waitwait.html | type=Interview: Audio | work=Wait Wait...

The contestant wins the prize by correctly completing any two of them. The limericks are written by Philipp Goedicke;<ref>[https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/features/2001/011116.limerick.html Limerick Lesson by Philipp Goedicke] Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me.</ref> after the contestant answers each one, Sagal provides a humorous summary of the relevant story.\n\n===Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank===\nIn the final round, each panelist is given a series of eight fill-in-the-blank questions about news stories, both serious and frivolous, and must answer as many as he or she can in one minute (though given the show's loose format, the time limit is sometimes extended or ignored altogether), scoring two points for each correct answer.  The questions often begin with \"serious\" news topics for the first few questions, but often degenerate into more and more unusual topics, with the eighth and final question often being particularly humorous.  After the quiz, the panelist with the highest score is declared the week's champion (in the event of a tie for first place, the tying contestants are declared co-champions). Panelists do not receive prizes for winning.\n\n=== Panelists' Predictions ===\nFollowing the credits at the end of the show, the three panelists are asked to offer a comic \"prediction\" about an ongoing news story, often one discussed earlier in the program.\n\n==Television==\nIn 2008, National Public Radio reached an agreement with CBS Entertainment to create a [[television pilot]] of ''Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!''<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-tue-phil-rosenthal-0909sep09,0,2782717.column 'Wait' may soon get answer on TV vision], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', September 9, 2008</ref> Peter Sagal and Carl Kasell would be in the pilot, and Doug Berman would be the executive producer.<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/radio/wait_wait_to_become_tv_show_93640.asp \"Wait, Wait\" To Become TV Show? - mediabistro.com]</ref> The pilot was not picked up for regular production.\n\nOn November 16, 2011, [[BBC America]] announced that the show would make its television debut with a \"2011 Year in Review\" special airing on December 23, to be retransmitted by [[NPR]] stations on the 24th and 25th.

Don't Tell Me!''''' is an hour-long weekly [[news]]-based radio [[panel show]] produced by [[WBEZ]] and [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. On the program, panelists and contestants are quizzed in humorous ways about that week's news. It is distributed by NPR in the United States, internationally on NPR Worldwide and on the [[Internet]] via [[podcast]], and typically broadcast on weekends by member stations. The show averages about 6 million weekly listeners on air and via podcast.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Steve|title=NPR's 'Wait Wait' is even more fun live|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-ent-1220-wait-wait-taping-20161219-story.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=December 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Wait Wait...

Don't Tell Me!'' is usually recorded in front of a live audience in [[Chicago]] at the Chase Auditorium beneath the [[Chase Tower (Chicago)|Chase Tower]] on Thursday nights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me Ticketing|url=https://www.wbez.org/events/wait-wait-dont-tell-me-tickets |publisher=[[WBEZ]] Chicago}}</ref> Until May 2005, the show was recorded in one of Chicago Public Radio's studios, with no audience and often with one or more panelists calling in from other locations. The show also often travels to various cities in the United States and produces a road show in front of a live audience for promotional and station-related purposes. In situations where shows cannot be recorded in front of an audience, shows are recorded at the studios of WBEZ with panelists using [[videotelephony]] to appear, a situation which has occurred during the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]] (a show previous to the halting of traveling and Chase Auditorium shows at [[Atlanta]]'s [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta)|Fox Theatre]] was recorded with no audience due to public health concerns after all on-air and recording personnel had arrived).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foxtheatre.org/events/detail/wait-wait-dont-tell-me|title=Event Information|date=12 March 2020|publisher=Fox Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe show is hosted by playwright and actor [[Peter Sagal]]. When the program had its debut in January 1998, Dan Coffey of ''[[Ask Dr. Science]]'' was the original host, but a revamping of the show led to his replacement in May of that year. The show has also been guest-hosted by [[Tom Bodett]], [[Luke Burbank]], [[Adam Felber]], [[Peter Grosz]], [[Mike Pesca]], [[Says You!|Richard Sher]], [[Bill Radke]], [[Susan Stamberg]], [[Robert Siegel]], [[Brian Unger]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Tom Hanks]], [[Helen Hong]], [[Jessi Klein]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=35&prgDate=08-12-2006 |title=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!- August 12, 2006|publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2005/aug/050827.waitwait.html |title=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!- August 27, 2005 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2004/aug/040814.waitwait.html |title=Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!- August 14, 2004 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2011-02-03 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Roti|first1=Jessi|title=Tom Hanks to guest host 'Wait, Wait...Don't Tell Me' in Chicago|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chicagoinc/ct-tom-hanks-to-guest-host-on-npr-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref>[https://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/519656715/wait-wait-for-march-11-2017-with-not-my-job-guest-neal-brennan?showDate=2017-03-11 {{\"'}}Wait Wait' For March 11, 2017: Guest Host Jessi Klein with Not My Job Guest Neal Brennan\"]</ref> and [[Faith Salie]] when Sagal was on vacation.\n\n[[Carl Kasell]], who also served as the newsreader on ''[[Morning Edition]]'', was the show's official judge and scorekeeper until his retirement on May 17, 2014, after which the role was taken over permanently by journalist [[Bill Kurtis]]. In addition to Kurtis, Korva Coleman, [[Corey Flintoff]], Jean Cochran and Chioke L'Anson among others, have also served this role in the past. \n\n''Wait Wait...'' listeners also participate by telephoning or sending [[email]]s to nominate themselves as contestants.  The producers select several listeners for each show and call them to appear on the program, playing various games featuring questions based on the week's news. Prior to October 21, 2017, the usual prize for winning any game was to have Kasell (named \"Scorekeeper Emeritus\" following his retirement) record a greeting on the contestant's home [[answering machine]] or [[voice mail]] system.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/article/carl-kasell-steps-down-wait-wait-dont-tell-me-201796 | title = Carl Kasell steps down from Wait Wait\u2026 Don't Tell Me | first = Erik | last = Adams | date = March 4, 2014 | accessdate = 2017-07-11 | work = [[The A.V.

Don't Tell Me!.jpg|thumb|right|Kurtis and Sagal, 2017]]\nThough there are some deviations from time to time, episodes of ''Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!'' feature the following format:\n\n===Opening tease===\nAs with other NPR programs, ''Wait Wait'' offers a one-minute top-of-hour billboard teasing the program that will follow the network's hourly newscast (which traditionally starts at 1 minute past the hour).  In this minute, the host offers a humorous comment on the week's news, mentions the identity of the week's interview guest, and sets up an out-of-context reading by Kurtis of a quote or game title from the episode.\n\n===Who's Bill This Time?===\nThe contestant is asked to identify the speaker or explain the context of three quotations from that week's major news stories as read by Bill Kurtis. Each answer is followed by a humorous discussion of the story by the host and the panelists. Two correct answers constitute a win for the contestant. Prior to Kasell's retirement, the segment was known as \"Who's Carl This Time?\" and he read the quotations.\n\n===Panel questions===\nIn two separate segments each week, the host asks the panelists questions regarding less serious stories in the week's news, awarding them one point for each correct answer.  The questions are phrased similarly to those featured on ''[[The Match Game]]'' or ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'' to allow the panelists to offer a comedic answer in addition to their real guess as well as a hint from the host if needed.  The answer is often followed by a discussion of the story.\n\n===Bluff the Listener===\nEach panelist reads an unusual story, all sharing a common theme. Only one of the three stories is genuine; the contestant wins the prize by choosing it. A sound bite from a person connected to the genuine story is played to reveal whether the contestant's guess is correct. Regardless of the outcome, the panelist whose story is chosen scores one point.\n\n===Not My Job===\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right |  audio1 = [https://www.npr.org/programs/wait-wait-dont-tell-me/2006/11/04/13109791/ Jimmy Wales plays \"Not my job\"], 10:19, [[NPR]], November 4, 2006<ref name=\"w8w8\">{{cite web | title =Not My Job: Wikipedia Founder Jimmy Wales | work = Wait Wait...

Don't Tell Me! guests}}\n\nA celebrity guest calls in (or occasionally appears on stage) to be interviewed by the host and the panelists as well as take a three-question multiple-choice quiz. In ''Wait Wait''{{'}}s early years, \"Not My Job\" guests were mainly culled from NPR's roster of personalities and reporters; the pool of guests later expanded to include guests of greater celebrity.  As the segment's title suggests, the guests are quizzed on topics that are not normally associated with their field of work.  For example, former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked questions on the history of [[Hugh Hefner]] and ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite interview | subject=Madeleine Albright | interviewer=Peter Sagal |title=Not My Job! | url=https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2003/dec/031206.waitwait.html | type=Interview: Audio | work=Wait Wait...

The contestant wins the prize by correctly completing any two of them. The limericks are written by Philipp Goedicke;<ref>[https://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/features/2001/011116.limerick.html Limerick Lesson by Philipp Goedicke] Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me.</ref> after the contestant answers each one, Sagal provides a humorous summary of the relevant story.\n\n===Lightning Fill-in-the-Blank===\nIn the final round, each panelist is given a series of eight fill-in-the-blank questions about news stories, both serious and frivolous, and must answer as many as he or she can in one minute (though given the show's loose format, the time limit is sometimes extended or ignored altogether), scoring two points for each correct answer.  The questions often begin with \"serious\" news topics for the first few questions, but often degenerate into more and more unusual topics, with the eighth and final question often being particularly humorous.  After the quiz, the panelist with the highest score is declared the week's champion (in the event of a tie for first place, the tying contestants are declared co-champions). Panelists do not receive prizes for winning.\n\n=== Panelists' Predictions ===\nFollowing the credits at the end of the show, the three panelists are asked to offer a comic \"prediction\" about an ongoing news story, often one discussed earlier in the program.\n\n==Television==\nIn 2008, National Public Radio reached an agreement with CBS Entertainment to create a [[television pilot]] of ''Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!''<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/columnists/chi-tue-phil-rosenthal-0909sep09,0,2782717.column 'Wait' may soon get answer on TV vision], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', September 9, 2008</ref> Peter Sagal and Carl Kasell would be in the pilot, and Doug Berman would be the executive producer.<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/radio/wait_wait_to_become_tv_show_93640.asp \"Wait, Wait\" To Become TV Show? - mediabistro.com]</ref> The pilot was not picked up for regular production.\n\nOn November 16, 2011, [[BBC America]] announced that the show would make its television debut with a \"2011 Year in Review\" special airing on December 23, to be retransmitted by [[NPR]] stations on the 24th and 25th.
