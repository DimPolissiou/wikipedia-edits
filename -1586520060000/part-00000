Created in 1536, the franchise expanded in the late 19th century and on the enfranchisement of women. Its boundaries remained virtually unchanged until 1983. From 1536 until 1885 the area had two seats (electing MPs): a [[county constituency]] (Cardiganshire) comprising the rural areas, the other the borough constituency known as the [[Cardigan Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardigan District of Boroughs]] comprising a few separate towns; in 1885 the latter was abolished, its towns and electors incorporated into the former, reduced to one MP. The towns which comprised the Boroughs varied slightly over this long period, but primarily consisted of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Lampeter]] and [[Adpar]], the latter now a suburb of [[Newcastle Emlyn]] across the [[River Teifi|Teifi]], in [[Carmarthenshire]].\n\nThe county constituency (a distinction from borough class remains, namely as to type of returning officer and permissible electoral expenses) was merged in 1983 with part of [[Pembrokeshire]], making a new constituency named [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]]. In 1997 it was recreated and its non-Anglicised name became its formal name, ''Ceredigion''.\n\nThe [[Ceredigion (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Ceredigion Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe boundaries of this constituency mirror almost exactly those of the county of [[Ceredigion]].\n\n=== Proposed constituency changes ===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat's boundaries will be extended. The seat, which has the proposed name of Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire, includes all of the current Ceredigion constituency, the northern part of the current [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]] constituency, a small part of [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]] around the village of [[Dre-fach Felindre]], as well the south-western part of [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] around [[Llanidloes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ceredigion could return to south constituency boundary|work=Cambrian News|date=19 September 2016|url=http://cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920131235/http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 September 2016|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|title=2018 Review of Parliamentary Constituencies \u2014 Initial Proposals Report|publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales|date=September 2016|section=Ceredigion a Gogledd Sir Benfro (Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire)|page=80|access-date=<!--30 October 2016-->}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Ceredigion]], formerly known by the anglicised version of its name as ''Cardiganshire'', was first enfranchised in 1536 when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] incorporated [[Wales]] within England. The county was given one member, who was to be elected by each person who owned property of a sufficient value. In addition the inhabitants of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Adpar]] and [[Lampeter]] were given the right to elect one MP between them, with the vote restricted to the [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]]. The [[1715 British general election|general election of 1715]] saw the return of [[Lewis Pryse]], who was expelled from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the following year for refusing to attend the House to take oaths of loyalty to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] after the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rising]], with which he sympathised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/expulsions.html|title=Members expelled from the House of Commons since the Restoration|work=demon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformed elections ===\nFrom 1832 the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] changed the electoral system so that householders of homes worth over \u00a310 were enfranchised in the boroughs. The Borough constituency was still dominated by the [[Pryse baronets|Loveden-Pryse]] family based in [[Gogerddan]] who were supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]; Pryse Pryse held the seat unopposed from 1818 until his death in 1849, except for the 1841 election when he narrowly retained the seat after a controversial contest. The Cardiganshire county constituency, however, was dominated by the Powell family of [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] who were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. [[William Edward Powell]] held the seat from 1816 until shortly before his death in 1854. By agreement between the followers of Gogerddan and Nanteos, neither challenged the others' nomination and as a result there were no contested elections in the county until 1859.\n\nFollowing Powell's retirement, the representation fell to [[Ernest Vaughan, 4th Earl of Lisburne|Ernest Vaughan]] of Trawscoed, whose politics were Conservative.\n\nThe county saw its first contest in the [[1859 United Kingdom general election|1859 general election]] when Colonel [[William Thomas Rowland Powell|W.T.R. Powell]] of Nanteos sought to re-establish the family's claim to the county seat. He was opposed by Arthur Saunders-Davies of Pentre but prevailed by a narrow margin. Both candidates held conservative views but Powell sat as a Liberal-Conservative.\n\nHowever, the era where Nanteos could claim the seat were numbered, and [[Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Lloyd]] of Bronwydd was mooted as a potential Liberal candidate at the 1854 by-election,<ref name=\"W edit 17-2-54\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4348090/4348092/19|accessdate=24 January 2019 |newspaper=Welshman |date=17 February 1854 |page=2}}</ref> and again at the General Elections of 1857<ref name=\"W edit 27-3-57\">{{cite news|title=Editorial [untitled]|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4349354/4349357/7|accessdate=6 February 2019|newspaper=Welshman|date=27 March 1857|page=3}}</ref> and 1859.<ref name=\"W 22-4-59 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4350326/4350331/40 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=22 April 1859 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865 general election]], Powell had indicated some twelve months prior to the election that he would retire and Lloyd of Bronwydd was selected as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] offered themselves as candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw and came within 361 votes of victory.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=16}}\n\nLloyd transferred to the borough in the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 election]] when the seat was captured by Swansea industrialist, [[Evan Mathew Richards|E.M. Richards]]. This election is often regarded as a landmark when tenant farmers allegedly refused to follow patterns of age-old deference and vote in line with the wishes of their landlords. Following this election there were claims of intimidation by Conservative landlords and a national fund was set up to support those purportedly evicted from their farms. In reality, however, Richards' victory owed much to the support of the powerful Pryse family of [[Pryse baronets|Gogerddan]].\n\nIn 1874, the Conservative candidate [[Thomas Edward Lloyd]] of Coedmore captured the seat for the Conservatives, defeating Richards by 215 votes. The result was greeted with disbelief in Liberal ranks, particularly since the introduction of the secret ballot was expected to have favoured the Liberals.<ref name=\"CN edit 13-2-74\">{{cite news|title=Liberal Defeat in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3343745/3343751/58|accessdate=18 January 2018|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=13 February 1874|page=6}}</ref> However, the Conservatives had chosen a candidate who was popular in his locality and not been involved in conflicts with his tenants. The Liberals were also caught unprepared for the contest, with Lloyd's candidature kept secret until nomination day.<ref name=\"SWDN edit 5-2-74\">{{cite news|title=The Cardiganshire Election (editorial)|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3499558/3499560/24|accessdate=19 January 2018|newspaper=South Wales Daily News|date=5 February 1874|page=2}}</ref> Much capital was also made of the fact that Lloyd was a Cardiganshire man, in contrast to Richards, a Swansea industrialist.<ref name=\"AO edit 14-2-74\">{{cite news|title=The Conservative Victory in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3040206/3040210/27|accessdate=20 January 2018|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=14 February 1874|page=2}}</ref> The result was reversed in 1880 although there were close contests for the county thereafter, on a slightly widened franchise.\n\n===Single constituency===\nIn a redistribution of seats for the [[1885 United Kingdom general election|1885 general election]], the borough constituency was abolished and absorbed into the county. This brought into the county seat the more radical politics of urban voters in the boroughs of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Lampeter]] and Adpar. More significantly, the further widening of the franchise in 1884 added between five and six thousand new voters to the register by extending the pattern of household suffrage to the counties. The majority of these voters would have been tenant farmers, the more prosperous agricultural labourers, and householders in small towns or large villages such as Tregaron, Aberaeron, New Quay, Aberporth, Tal-y-bont and Borth, which had not been part of the old Cardigan Boroughs constituency. The impact of the widening of the franchise and boundary changes was to increase the electorate from 5,026 in 1883 to 12,308 by 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=313}}</ref> It was assumed that these changes would make the county a reasonably safe bet for the Liberal Party and that supporters of Gladstone would be comfortably returned at every election. These structural changes to the political arrangements of the county were also taking place against wider social and economic developments which affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life. Traditional industries were in decline, agriculture was increasingly in crisis and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still-increasing population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities. As a result, there were two major consequences. Firstly there was a significant population shift as a result of emigration, in the majority of cases to the south Wales valleys. Secondly, the great landed estates of the county, which had for so long dominated the politics of the county, were in many cases heavily in debt. This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the politics of the county, a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|Cardiganshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=314\u201318; 319\u201320}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the predictions that Gladstonian Liberals would dominate county politics were realised, in 1885, [[David Davies (Liberal politician)|David Davies]] was elected to represent the constituency with a majority of 2,323 (24.2%) on a turnout of 78%, heavily defeating the Conservative, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]]. Although David Davies was no public speaker, he drew substantial support in Cardiganshire as a generous benefactor of the new university college at Aberystwyth and also through his links with Calvinistic Methodism, which had over 13,000 members in the county. Allied to this was a particularly effective Liberal association which paid close attention to the registration of voters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=322\u20133}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|David Davies (industrialist)}}\n\nIn 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland in 1886 and a number of his associates such as [[Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr]] followed him into the [[Liberal Unionist]] camp.<ref name=\"AO 18860626\">{{cite news|title=Meeting in support of Mr D.

This election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=323\u20134}}</ref> The result of the election was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations, although the more effective canvassing of supporters by the Liberal Association was also identified as an important factor.<ref name=\"AO 18870717\">{{cite news|title=Cardiganshire Election and its lessons (editorial)|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3301611/3301615/39|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=17 July 1886}}</ref>\n\nEven though Bowen Rowlands's victory was by the closest of margins it was a decisive moment in the political history of Cardiganshire. It proved that a Gladstonian Liberal candidate, even an Anglican with strong Irish Nationalist sympathies, could triumph in Cardiganshire even against the resources and religious connections of a candidate such as David Davies. Although Liberal Unionism continued to be championed by a relatively small group, led by the journalist Henry Tobit Evans, who published a newspaper, ''Y Brython'', at Lampeter, most of the leading Liberals who had defected to Davies eventually returned to the fold, in some cases to contest the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|1889 County Council]] elections. The demise of Liberal Unionism was confirmed at the 1892 general election when, William Jones, a self-made Birmingham draper who had a small estate in Cardiganshire and was a member of the [[Cardiganshire County Council]] ran with the support of Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain had sponsored a number of Nonconformist unionist candidates in Wales in the hope of capitalising upon perceived antipathy towards Irish Nationalism. Despite spending heavily and producing a farmer evicted at the 1868 Election on his platform, Jones was heavily defeated by Bowen Rowlands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=324\u20135}}</ref> Rowlands served until 1895.\n\nOnce Rowlands's intention not to stand again was known, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]] of [[Tan-y-Bwlch, Aberystwyth|Tan-y-Bwlch]], who had been the Conservative candidate in the seat in 1885, but who had subsequently joined the Liberal Party, emerged as a contender for the nomination and was eventually chosen by a delegate conference, defeating [[John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids|Wynford Phillips]] by 160 votes to 111.<ref name=\"AO 4-7-95 LibCand\">{{cite news|title=Representation of Cardiganshire.

His closest electoral call came in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|'Khaki election' of 1900]] when he had a majority of 781 (9.4%) over [[J.C. Harford]] of Falcondale. Thereafter, Vaughan Davies was comfortably returned at each election but the vitality of the Liberal Association was in serious decline. During this time the ''Cambrian News'' had tempered its opposition to him and grudgingly admitted that Vaughan-Davies had won friends and supporteres by his adherence to Liberal policies.<ref name=\"CN 27-10-00 edit\">{{cite news|title=The Two Cardiganshire Candidates (editorial)|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3317276/ART27|accessdate=27 October 2014|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=5 October 1900}}</ref>\n\nBy 1914 the Liberal Association was heavily dependent on Vaughan Davies's role as treasurer to keep it going. In the meantime, Vaughan Davies remained on poor terms with prominent Liberals, including [[John Gibson (editor and journalist)|John Gibson]], editor of the ''Cambrian News'' until his death in 1915.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=328\u20139}}</ref>\n\nLike most Welsh Liberals, he supported [[David Lloyd George]] in the split in the Liberal Party, and not [[H. H. Asquith]], and was therefore returned unopposed as a Coalition Liberal in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]].\n\n===Liberal infighting (1921\u20131950)===\nIn many ways the Liberals had become the new elite in Cardiganshire by the time of the First World War. This was demonstrated in 1919 when [[John Humphreys Davies]], the nonconformist squire of Cwrtmawr, was appointed Principal of the University College, Aberystwyth, at the expense of [[Thomas Jones (T. J.)|Thomas Jones]], who was championed by Lord Davies of Llandinam, grandson of [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|page=330}}</ref>\n\nWith Vaughan Davies known to be a supporter of Lloyd George, it was natural that Lloyd George looked to him to boost his support in the [[House of Lords]] and awarded him a peerage in the New Years' Honours list in 1921. Although he would have preferred to be called 'Lord Ceredigion', the Garter King of Arms refused this as an inappropriate title for a Baron, and so Vaughan Davies took his title from the [[River Ystwyth]] which ran past his home. The peerage created a vacancy in a historically Liberal seat and the Asquithites decided to take the Lloyd Georgeites on in their 'backyard' in what became a memorable [[1921 Cardiganshire by-election|by-election]].\n\n[[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], who asserted on his election posters that he was 'THE Liberal candidate', was a Barrister from Aberystwyth and had been Private Secretary to Lloyd George himself, and therefore had the blessing of the Coalition and official support from the Conservatives. A number of possible Asquithian Liberal candidates were approached to contest the seat against Evans and eventually the choice fell upon [[W. Llewelyn Williams]] who was sponsored by the Asquithite 'Welsh Liberal Federation'. No other candidate stood and in the straight fight, Evans won with a majority of 3,590 (14.6%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=332\u20135}}</ref>\n\nEvans held on as a 'National Liberal' (as Lloyd George's supporters called themselves) in the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] but with a slim majority of 515 votes (2.0%) over [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]].\n\nThe sudden shotgun merger of the two factions in the Liberal Party led to Evans getting the official approval of the unified party for the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]]. However, the Conservatives decided to fight and this deprived him of their votes. Hopkin Morris decided to fight again as an unofficial Liberal and won with a 5,078 vote majority. Hopkin Morris was lucky to survive the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], a disaster for the Liberals, by being returned unopposed.\n\nThe first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate stood against [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] and polled 24% of the vote in a straight fight against Morris, who had a 13,752 (52.0%) majority.\n\nIn 1932, Morris left Parliament temporarily (he was later to return as MP for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]]) when he was appointed as a Metropolitan Police magistrate. The byelection on 22 September 1932 saw the first three-way fight between the parties, but was won by [[Owen Evans (politician)|Owen Evans]] for the Liberals. Like many of the Liberal MPs he had been a barrister. Evans died shortly before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], but the seat was easily held by his successor [[Roderic Bowen]]. Unusually the Labour vote actually fell in percentage terms compared with the previous election despite the Labour landslide in the country at large.\n\n===Labour challenge (1950\u20131972)===\nLabour established itself as the main challenger to the Liberals at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] in a three-way contest, and the Conservatives opted out of the contest thereafter until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. This was partly a move to keep the seat from going Labour. [[Plaid Cymru]] first fought the seat in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] and kept their deposit (just, with 12.8% of the vote).\n\nWith a four-way contest involving the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru at the 1964 general election, and a national swing to Labour, Roderic Bowen suffered a precipitate decline in his share of the vote to only 38.4%; he was re-elected with a majority of 2,219 (7.4%) over Labour. After the death of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] in 1965, Bowen accepted the offer to become a Deputy Speaker, which prevented him from speaking on behalf of his constituency. For the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]], Labour selected [[Elystan Morgan]] who had been a member of Plaid Cymru until 1964; with a further national swing and Morgan making a credible bid for the Welsh-speaking vote, Labour won the seat by 523 votes.\n\n===1974 onwards===\nIn boundary changes in 1983, the constituency was merged with a northern area of [[Pembrokeshire]] and also took a Welsh version of its name, becoming known as [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]].\n\nCeredigion was recreated for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] as it reverted to its former borders, having lost the part of North Pembrokeshire in boundary changes.\n\nMark Williams, first elected in 2005, was the first non-Welsh speaking Member of Parliament elected to represent the constituency since Bowen Rowlands (MP from 1886 until 1892, who declared at a meeting in Aberystwyth when adopted as candidate that he could not speak Welsh).<ref>{{cite news|title=The County Election|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3301595/ART95|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=3 July 1886}}</ref> At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], he received a massive increase in his vote, polling over 50% of the votes cast and raising his majority from 219 to 8,324 over the Plaid Cymru candidate, Penri James.\n\nIn [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], Williams suffered a decline of over 14% in his vote share, in common with other Liberal Democrat incumbents across the UK. However, after a campaign which made national headlines due to prior controversial comments by both the Plaid Cymru<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32227229|title=Election 2015: 'Baptism of fire' for Plaid candidate|date=9 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and Labour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32249455|title=Election 2015: Candidate suggested cars be damaged|date=10 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> candidates, Plaid Cymru were unable to capitalise as their vote share went down slightly. The Conservative vote also declined, while UKIP, Labour and the Greens all improved on their 2010 performance. Williams retained the seat to become the only Liberal Democrat MP in Wales, and one of only eight across the UK.\n\nIn [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], Williams lost his seat to [[Ben Lake]] by 104 votes (0.2%). Labour moved from fifth to third in the seat and were roughly 3,000 votes behind Williams and Lake, their best result in Ceredigion since 1997, and the Tories fell to fourth but increased their vote by more than 3,000. The 29.2% won by Plaid Cymru in 2017 was the lowest winning vote share of the election and the only seat won with less than 30% of the vote. At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]] Lake substantially increased both his majority and vote share, with the Liberal Democrats falling to third place.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1541\u20131640===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1541\u20131543|| [[Morgan ap Rice ap Philip]]\n|-\n|1543\u20131544|| [[Thomas Gynns]]\n|-\n|1545\u20131547|| [[David ap Llewellin Lloid of Llan Dissill]]\n|-\n|1547|| [[William Devereux (MP)|William Devereux]]\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1555|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1558|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1563|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1571|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1584|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1586|| [[Griffith Lloyd]]\n|-\n|1588|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1593|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1597|| [[Thomas Pryse]]\n|-\n|1601|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1604\u20131611|| [[John Lewis (of Abernant)|Sir John Lewis]]\n|-\n|1614\u20131622|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Sir Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1625\u20131629|| [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n|-\n|1629\u20131640|| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n===MPs after 1640===\n\n'''[[Short Parliament]]'''\n*1640: [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n\n'''[[Long Parliament]]'''\n* 1640\u20131644: [[Walter Lloyd]] ([[Cavalier|Royalist]]) \u2013 ''disabled to sit, 5 February 1644''\n* 1646\u20131648: [[Sir Richard Pryse, 1st Baronet]] \u2013 ''excluded in [[Pride's Purge]], December 1648''\n\n''Cardiganshire was unrepresented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n\n'''[[First Protectorate Parliament]]'''\n*1654\u20131655: [[James Philipps|Col.

Created in 1536, the franchise expanded in the late 19th century and on the enfranchisement of women. Its boundaries remained virtually unchanged until 1983. From 1536 until 1885 the area had two seats (electing MPs): a [[county constituency]] (Cardiganshire) comprising the rural areas, the other the borough constituency known as the [[Cardigan Boroughs (UK Parliament constituency)|Cardigan District of Boroughs]] comprising a few separate towns; in 1885 the latter was abolished, its towns and electors incorporated into the former, reduced to one MP. The towns which comprised the Boroughs varied slightly over this long period, but primarily consisted of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Lampeter]] and [[Adpar]], the latter now a suburb of [[Newcastle Emlyn]] across the [[River Teifi|Teifi]], in [[Carmarthenshire]].\n\nThe county constituency (a distinction from borough class remains, namely as to type of returning officer and permissible electoral expenses) was merged in 1983 with part of [[Pembrokeshire]], making a new constituency named [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]]. In 1997 it was recreated and its non-Anglicised name became its formal name, ''Ceredigion''.\n\nThe [[Ceredigion (National Assembly for Wales constituency)|Ceredigion Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n== Boundaries ==\nThe boundaries of this constituency mirror almost exactly those of the county of [[Ceredigion]].\n\n=== Proposed constituency changes ===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat's boundaries will be extended. The seat, which has the proposed name of Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire, includes all of the current Ceredigion constituency, the northern part of the current [[Preseli Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Preseli Pembrokeshire]] constituency, a small part of [[Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire]] around the village of [[Dre-fach Felindre]], as well the south-western part of [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]] around [[Llanidloes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ceredigion could return to south constituency boundary|work=Cambrian News|date=19 September 2016|url=http://cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920131235/http://www.cambrian-news.co.uk/article.cfm?id=108475&headline=Ceredigion%20could%20return%20to%20south%20constituency%20boundary&sectionIs=news&searchyear=2016|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 September 2016|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite report|title=2018 Review of Parliamentary Constituencies \u2014 Initial Proposals Report|publisher=Boundary Commission for Wales|date=September 2016|section=Ceredigion a Gogledd Sir Benfro (Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire)|page=80|access-date=<!--30 October 2016-->}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Ceredigion]], formerly known by the anglicised version of its name as ''Cardiganshire'', was first enfranchised in 1536 when [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] incorporated [[Wales]] within England. The county was given one member, who was to be elected by each person who owned property of a sufficient value. In addition the inhabitants of [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Aberystwyth]], [[Adpar]] and [[Lampeter]] were given the right to elect one MP between them, with the vote restricted to the [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]]. The [[1715 British general election|general election of 1715]] saw the return of [[Lewis Pryse]], who was expelled from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in the following year for refusing to attend the House to take oaths of loyalty to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] after the [[Jacobite rising of 1715|Jacobite rising]], with which he sympathised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.election.demon.co.uk/expulsions.html|title=Members expelled from the House of Commons since the Restoration|work=demon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n=== Reformed elections ===\nFrom 1832 the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Act]] changed the electoral system so that householders of homes worth over \u00a310 were enfranchised in the boroughs. The Borough constituency was still dominated by the [[Pryse baronets|Loveden-Pryse]] family based in [[Gogerddan]] who were supporters of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]; Pryse Pryse held the seat unopposed from 1818 until his death in 1849, except for the 1841 election when he narrowly retained the seat after a controversial contest. The Cardiganshire county constituency, however, was dominated by the Powell family of [[Nanteos Mansion|Nanteos]] who were [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. [[William Edward Powell]] held the seat from 1816 until shortly before his death in 1854. By agreement between the followers of Gogerddan and Nanteos, neither challenged the others' nomination and as a result there were no contested elections in the county until 1859.\n\nFollowing Powell's retirement, the representation fell to [[Ernest Vaughan, 4th Earl of Lisburne|Ernest Vaughan]] of Trawscoed, whose politics were Conservative.\n\nThe county saw its first contest in the [[1859 United Kingdom general election|1859 general election]] when Colonel [[William Thomas Rowland Powell|W.T.R.

Both candidates held conservative views but Powell sat as a Liberal-Conservative.\n\nHowever, the era where Nanteos could claim the seat were numbered, and [[Sir Thomas Lloyd, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Lloyd]] of Bronwydd was mooted as a potential Liberal candidate at the 1854 by-election,<ref name=\"W edit 17-2-54\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4348090/4348092/19|accessdate=24 January 2019 |newspaper=Welshman |date=17 February 1854 |page=2}}</ref> and again at the General Elections of 1857<ref name=\"W edit 27-3-57\">{{cite news|title=Editorial [untitled]|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4349354/4349357/7|accessdate=6 February 2019|newspaper=Welshman|date=27 March 1857|page=3}}</ref> and 1859.<ref name=\"W 22-4-59 edit\">{{cite news |title=Editorial [untitled] |url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/4350326/4350331/40 |accessdate=14 September 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=22 April 1859 |page=5}}</ref>\n\nBy the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|1865 general election]], Powell had indicated some twelve months prior to the election that he would retire and Lloyd of Bronwydd was selected as the Liberal candidate. However, when Powell reversed his decision, Lloyd issued an address stating that he would not oppose the sitting member. The result was that both [[Henry Richard]] and [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]] offered themselves as candidates. A selection meeting was arranged to be held at Aberaeron, but shortly before this took place, Powell announced his retirement. Lloyd now stated that he would now fight the seat after all and Richard withdrew in his favour. David Davies, however, did not withdraw and came within 361 votes of victory.{{sfn|Jones|1964|p=16}}\n\nLloyd transferred to the borough in the [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868 election]] when the seat was captured by Swansea industrialist, [[Evan Mathew Richards|E.M. Richards]]. This election is often regarded as a landmark when tenant farmers allegedly refused to follow patterns of age-old deference and vote in line with the wishes of their landlords. Following this election there were claims of intimidation by Conservative landlords and a national fund was set up to support those purportedly evicted from their farms. In reality, however, Richards' victory owed much to the support of the powerful Pryse family of [[Pryse baronets|Gogerddan]].\n\nIn 1874, the Conservative candidate [[Thomas Edward Lloyd]] of Coedmore captured the seat for the Conservatives, defeating Richards by 215 votes. The result was greeted with disbelief in Liberal ranks, particularly since the introduction of the secret ballot was expected to have favoured the Liberals.<ref name=\"CN edit 13-2-74\">{{cite news|title=Liberal Defeat in Cardiganshire (editorial).|url=http://newspapers.library.wales/view/3343745/3343751/58|accessdate=18 January 2018|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=13 February 1874|page=6}}</ref> However, the Conservatives had chosen a candidate who was popular in his locality and not been involved in conflicts with his tenants.

This brought into the county seat the more radical politics of urban voters in the boroughs of [[Aberystwyth]], [[Cardigan, Ceredigion|Cardigan]], [[Lampeter]] and Adpar. More significantly, the further widening of the franchise in 1884 added between five and six thousand new voters to the register by extending the pattern of household suffrage to the counties. The majority of these voters would have been tenant farmers, the more prosperous agricultural labourers, and householders in small towns or large villages such as Tregaron, Aberaeron, New Quay, Aberporth, Tal-y-bont and Borth, which had not been part of the old Cardigan Boroughs constituency. The impact of the widening of the franchise and boundary changes was to increase the electorate from 5,026 in 1883 to 12,308 by 1886.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=313}}</ref> It was assumed that these changes would make the county a reasonably safe bet for the Liberal Party and that supporters of Gladstone would be comfortably returned at every election. These structural changes to the political arrangements of the county were also taking place against wider social and economic developments which affected all aspects of Cardiganshire life. Traditional industries were in decline, agriculture was increasingly in crisis and it was becoming increasingly difficult for a still-increasing population to earn a living within their native parishes and communities. As a result, there were two major consequences. Firstly there was a significant population shift as a result of emigration, in the majority of cases to the south Wales valleys. Secondly, the great landed estates of the county, which had for so long dominated the politics of the county, were in many cases heavily in debt. This second factor contributed to the loss of landowner influence in the politics of the county, a trend that became very apparent at the first elections to the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|Cardiganshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=314\u201318; 319\u201320}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the predictions that Gladstonian Liberals would dominate county politics were realised, in 1885, [[David Davies (Liberal politician)|David Davies]] was elected to represent the constituency with a majority of 2,323 (24.2%) on a turnout of 78%, heavily defeating the Conservative, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]]. Although David Davies was no public speaker, he drew substantial support in Cardiganshire as a generous benefactor of the new university college at Aberystwyth and also through his links with Calvinistic Methodism, which had over 13,000 members in the county. Allied to this was a particularly effective Liberal association which paid close attention to the registration of voters.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=322\u20133}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|David Davies (industrialist)}}\n\nIn 1886, however, Davies broke with Gladstone over home rule for Ireland in 1886 and a number of his associates such as [[Robert J. Davies, Cwrtmawr]] followed him into the [[Liberal Unionist]] camp.<ref name=\"AO 18860626\">{{cite news|title=Meeting in support of Mr D.

This election split the Liberal Party in Cardiganshire and the election was hotly contested with almost all the landowners, including those previously regarded as having Liberal sympathies, supporting Davies. He also received the support of several prominent Liberals, especially from his own Methodist denomination.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=323\u20134}}</ref> The result of the election was largely attributed to the influence of nonconformist ministers over their congregations, although the more effective canvassing of supporters by the Liberal Association was also identified as an important factor.<ref name=\"AO 18870717\">{{cite news|title=Cardiganshire Election and its lessons (editorial)|url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3301611/3301615/39|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=17 July 1886}}</ref>\n\nEven though Bowen Rowlands's victory was by the closest of margins it was a decisive moment in the political history of Cardiganshire. It proved that a Gladstonian Liberal candidate, even an Anglican with strong Irish Nationalist sympathies, could triumph in Cardiganshire even against the resources and religious connections of a candidate such as David Davies. Although Liberal Unionism continued to be championed by a relatively small group, led by the journalist Henry Tobit Evans, who published a newspaper, ''Y Brython'', at Lampeter, most of the leading Liberals who had defected to Davies eventually returned to the fold, in some cases to contest the [[1889 Cardiganshire County Council elections|1889 County Council]] elections. The demise of Liberal Unionism was confirmed at the 1892 general election when, William Jones, a self-made Birmingham draper who had a small estate in Cardiganshire and was a member of the [[Cardiganshire County Council]] ran with the support of Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain had sponsored a number of Nonconformist unionist candidates in Wales in the hope of capitalising upon perceived antipathy towards Irish Nationalism. Despite spending heavily and producing a farmer evicted at the 1868 Election on his platform, Jones was heavily defeated by Bowen Rowlands.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=324\u20135}}</ref> Rowlands served until 1895.\n\nOnce Rowlands's intention not to stand again was known, [[Matthew Lewis Vaughan-Davies, 1st Baron Ystwyth|Matthew Vaughan Davies]] of [[Tan-y-Bwlch, Aberystwyth|Tan-y-Bwlch]], who had been the Conservative candidate in the seat in 1885, but who had subsequently joined the Liberal Party, emerged as a contender for the nomination and was eventually chosen by a delegate conference, defeating [[John Philipps, 1st Viscount St Davids|Wynford Phillips]] by 160 votes to 111.<ref name=\"AO 4-7-95 LibCand\">{{cite news|title=Representation of Cardiganshire.

His closest electoral call came in the [[1900 United Kingdom general election|'Khaki election' of 1900]] when he had a majority of 781 (9.4%) over [[J.C. Harford]] of Falcondale. Thereafter, Vaughan Davies was comfortably returned at each election but the vitality of the Liberal Association was in serious decline. During this time the ''Cambrian News'' had tempered its opposition to him and grudgingly admitted that Vaughan-Davies had won friends and supporteres by his adherence to Liberal policies.<ref name=\"CN 27-10-00 edit\">{{cite news|title=The Two Cardiganshire Candidates (editorial)|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3317276/ART27|accessdate=27 October 2014|newspaper=Cambrian News|date=5 October 1900}}</ref>\n\nBy 1914 the Liberal Association was heavily dependent on Vaughan Davies's role as treasurer to keep it going. In the meantime, Vaughan Davies remained on poor terms with prominent Liberals, including [[John Gibson (editor and journalist)|John Gibson]], editor of the ''Cambrian News'' until his death in 1915.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=328\u20139}}</ref>\n\nLike most Welsh Liberals, he supported [[David Lloyd George]] in the split in the Liberal Party, and not [[H. H. Asquith]], and was therefore returned unopposed as a Coalition Liberal in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]].\n\n===Liberal infighting (1921\u20131950)===\nIn many ways the Liberals had become the new elite in Cardiganshire by the time of the First World War. This was demonstrated in 1919 when [[John Humphreys Davies]], the nonconformist squire of Cwrtmawr, was appointed Principal of the University College, Aberystwyth, at the expense of [[Thomas Jones (T. J.)|Thomas Jones]], who was championed by Lord Davies of Llandinam, grandson of [[David Davies (industrialist)|David Davies]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|page=330}}</ref>\n\nWith Vaughan Davies known to be a supporter of Lloyd George, it was natural that Lloyd George looked to him to boost his support in the [[House of Lords]] and awarded him a peerage in the New Years' Honours list in 1921. Although he would have preferred to be called 'Lord Ceredigion', the Garter King of Arms refused this as an inappropriate title for a Baron, and so Vaughan Davies took his title from the [[River Ystwyth]] which ran past his home. The peerage created a vacancy in a historically Liberal seat and the Asquithites decided to take the Lloyd Georgeites on in their 'backyard' in what became a memorable [[1921 Cardiganshire by-election|by-election]].\n\n[[Ernest Evans (politician)|Ernest Evans]], who asserted on his election posters that he was 'THE Liberal candidate', was a Barrister from Aberystwyth and had been Private Secretary to Lloyd George himself, and therefore had the blessing of the Coalition and official support from the Conservatives. A number of possible Asquithian Liberal candidates were approached to contest the seat against Evans and eventually the choice fell upon [[W. Llewelyn Williams]] who was sponsored by the Asquithite 'Welsh Liberal Federation'. No other candidate stood and in the straight fight, Evans won with a majority of 3,590 (14.6%).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Morgan|title=Cardiganshire Politics|pages=332\u20135}}</ref>\n\nEvans held on as a 'National Liberal' (as Lloyd George's supporters called themselves) in the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]] but with a slim majority of 515 votes (2.0%) over [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]].\n\nThe sudden shotgun merger of the two factions in the Liberal Party led to Evans getting the official approval of the unified party for the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]]. However, the Conservatives decided to fight and this deprived him of their votes. Hopkin Morris decided to fight again as an unofficial Liberal and won with a 5,078 vote majority. Hopkin Morris was lucky to survive the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|1924 election]], a disaster for the Liberals, by being returned unopposed.\n\nThe first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate stood against [[Rhys Hopkin Morris]] at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] and polled 24% of the vote in a straight fight against Morris, who had a 13,752 (52.0%) majority.\n\nIn 1932, Morris left Parliament temporarily (he was later to return as MP for [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]]) when he was appointed as a Metropolitan Police magistrate. The byelection on 22 September 1932 saw the first three-way fight between the parties, but was won by [[Owen Evans (politician)|Owen Evans]] for the Liberals. Like many of the Liberal MPs he had been a barrister. Evans died shortly before the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], but the seat was easily held by his successor [[Roderic Bowen]]. Unusually the Labour vote actually fell in percentage terms compared with the previous election despite the Labour landslide in the country at large.\n\n===Labour challenge (1950\u20131972)===\nLabour established itself as the main challenger to the Liberals at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]] in a three-way contest, and the Conservatives opted out of the contest thereafter until [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964]]. This was partly a move to keep the seat from going Labour. [[Plaid Cymru]] first fought the seat in [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] and kept their deposit (just, with 12.8% of the vote).\n\nWith a four-way contest involving the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru at the 1964 general election, and a national swing to Labour, Roderic Bowen suffered a precipitate decline in his share of the vote to only 38.4%; he was re-elected with a majority of 2,219 (7.4%) over Labour. After the death of the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] in 1965, Bowen accepted the offer to become a Deputy Speaker, which prevented him from speaking on behalf of his constituency. For the [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966 election]], Labour selected [[Elystan Morgan]] who had been a member of Plaid Cymru until 1964; with a further national swing and Morgan making a credible bid for the Welsh-speaking vote, Labour won the seat by 523 votes.\n\n===1974 onwards===\nIn boundary changes in 1983, the constituency was merged with a northern area of [[Pembrokeshire]] and also took a Welsh version of its name, becoming known as [[Ceredigion and Pembroke North (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion and Pembroke North]].\n\nCeredigion was recreated for the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 election]] as it reverted to its former borders, having lost the part of North Pembrokeshire in boundary changes.\n\nMark Williams, first elected in 2005, was the first non-Welsh speaking Member of Parliament elected to represent the constituency since Bowen Rowlands (MP from 1886 until 1892, who declared at a meeting in Aberystwyth when adopted as candidate that he could not speak Welsh).<ref>{{cite news|title=The County Election|url=http://welshnewspapers.llgc.org.uk/en/page/view/3301595/ART95|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=Aberystwyth Observer|date=3 July 1886}}</ref> At the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], he received a massive increase in his vote, polling over 50% of the votes cast and raising his majority from 219 to 8,324 over the Plaid Cymru candidate, Penri James.\n\nIn [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], Williams suffered a decline of over 14% in his vote share, in common with other Liberal Democrat incumbents across the UK. However, after a campaign which made national headlines due to prior controversial comments by both the Plaid Cymru<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32227229|title=Election 2015: 'Baptism of fire' for Plaid candidate|date=9 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> and Labour<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-wales-32249455|title=Election 2015: Candidate suggested cars be damaged|date=10 April 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> candidates, Plaid Cymru were unable to capitalise as their vote share went down slightly. The Conservative vote also declined, while UKIP, Labour and the Greens all improved on their 2010 performance. Williams retained the seat to become the only Liberal Democrat MP in Wales, and one of only eight across the UK.\n\nIn [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017]], Williams lost his seat to [[Ben Lake]] by 104 votes (0.2%). Labour moved from fifth to third in the seat and were roughly 3,000 votes behind Williams and Lake, their best result in Ceredigion since 1997, and the Tories fell to fourth but increased their vote by more than 3,000. The 29.2% won by Plaid Cymru in 2017 was the lowest winning vote share of the election and the only seat won with less than 30% of the vote. At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]] Lake substantially increased both his majority and vote share, with the Liberal Democrats falling to third place.\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n===MPs 1541\u20131640===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1541\u20131543|| [[Morgan ap Rice ap Philip]]\n|-\n|1543\u20131544|| [[Thomas Gynns]]\n|-\n|1545\u20131547|| [[David ap Llewellin Lloid of Llan Dissill]]\n|-\n|1547|| [[William Devereux (MP)|William Devereux]]\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[John Pryse|John Pryse II]]\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[James Williams (MP)|James Williams]]\n|-\n|1555|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1558|| [[Henry Jones (MP for Carmarthenshire)|Sir Henry Jones of Abermarlais]]\n|-\n|1563|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1571|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Pryse (of Gogerddan)|John Pryse]]\n|-\n|1584|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1586|| [[Griffith Lloyd]]\n|-\n|1588|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1593|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1597|| [[Thomas Pryse]]\n|-\n|1601|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1604\u20131611|| [[John Lewis (of Abernant)|Sir John Lewis]]\n|-\n|1614\u20131622|| [[Richard Pryse (of Gogerddan)|Sir Richard Pryse]]\n|-\n|1625\u20131629|| [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n|-\n|1629\u20131640|| ''No Parliaments summoned''\n|}\n\n===MPs after 1640===\n\n'''[[Short Parliament]]'''\n*1640: [[James Lewis (MP for Cardiganshire)|James Lewis]]\n\n'''[[Long Parliament]]'''\n* 1640\u20131644: [[Walter Lloyd]] ([[Cavalier|Royalist]]) \u2013 ''disabled to sit, 5 February 1644''\n* 1646\u20131648: [[Sir Richard Pryse, 1st Baronet]] \u2013 ''excluded in [[Pride's Purge]], December 1648''\n\n''Cardiganshire was unrepresented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n\n'''[[First Protectorate Parliament]]'''\n*1654\u20131655: [[James Philipps|Col.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]].

This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had. This is evidenced by a list of people involved in the story in the first seven [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the draft text, and who are known to have been actual courtiers.<ref name=Silver64/>\n\n===Illuminated manuscript tournament book===\n[[File:Freydal 02.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Freydal in a \u201cjoust of war with flying and exploding shields\u201d (''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'') with Sigmund von Welsperg (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 29, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|pp=175\u2013176}}</ref>]]\nThe miniatures in the tournament book manuscript illustrate the types of [[jousting]] popular at the time, both on horse and on foot.<ref name=McLaren/> Freydal features in each illustrated combat and his opponent is an historical figure with whom Maximilian actually jousted.<ref name=McLaren/> Each picture, in the lower margin, identifies the name of the opponent and the other courtiers depicted.<ref name=Locke123>{{harvnb|Locke|2015|p=123}}</ref> Other tournament books exist, but ''Freydal'' is the largest from the late Middle Ages<ref name=moma120/> and is considered the best executed; it is also the only one to show spectacular falls.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nTwo types of joust, ''Rennen'' (or \u201cjousts of war\u201d where the lance has a sharpened tip<ref name= joust>{{harvnb|Jeep|2001|p=759}}; {{harvnb|Silver|2002|p=63}}</ref>) and ''Stechen'' (or \u201cjousts of peace\u201d where the lance has a blunted tip<ref name= joust/>) are depicted for each tournament.<ref name=Clephan87/><ref name=moma121/> Within these two broad groupings, eleven sub-types are shown.<ref name=moma121/> In the ''Welsches Gestecht'' (Italian joust of peace) a board separates the jousters so that they can ride more closely to each other and strike their opponent frontally with greater force. This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat.

An industry insider believed the idea would not work and would be pulled by Christmas 1988, but despite ''This Morning'' being launched with no publicity, its ratings quickly rose to a daily average of two million viewers.\n\nIn the first few series', the show's \"experts\" were weatherman [[Fred Talbot]], [[Advice column |agony aunt]] [[Denise Robertson]], medic [[Chris Steele (doctor)|Dr Chris Steele]], cook Susan Brookes, beauty presenter [[Liz Earle]], hair and make-up artists Andrew and Liz Collinge, and wine expert Charles Metcalfe. The theme tune was by David Pringle, who also wrote opening music for ''[[Wheel of Fortune (UK game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'', ''[[Fun House (UK game show)|Fun House]]'' and ''[[The Pyramid Game]]''.\n\nTo end the first series, in 1989, the show was presented via satellite from Disneyland, California. Produced by Granada's Field Producer, Brian Thomas, the set was built directly in front of 'Sleeping Beauty Castle', a first for Disney. The 'special' week achieved the highest daytime viewing audiences outside of a Royal Wedding.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nAs part of the show, weather presenter [[Fred Talbot]] used a floating map of the [[British Isles]] to report the forecast.<ref>{{cite web |last=Warwick |first=Dave |title=Fred Talbot |url=http://www.davewarwick.co.uk/dave_warwick_fred_talbot.htm |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201111106/http://www.davewarwick.co.uk/dave_warwick_fred_talbot.htm |archivedate=1 December 2008  }}</ref> A clip of [[Mark Roberts (streaker)|Mark Roberts]], a prolific [[streaking|streaker]], running onto Talbot's weather map in 1995 is regularly shown on clip shows.<ref name=RJMem>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8125210.stm Richard and Judy's memorable moments] BBC News, 1 July 2009</ref>\n\nIn 1996, the show was moved to [[the London Studios]] on the grounds that it was difficult to get celebrity guests to travel from London to Liverpool.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Opinion: Alex Connock |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/comment/blogs/s/1301990_opinion_alex_connock |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> In the summer of 2001, Madeley and Finnigan left ''This Morning'' to present [[Richard & Judy|their own series on Channel 4]].\n\nThe show proved newsworthy on several occasions.
