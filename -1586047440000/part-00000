A whey starter is added from the previous batch that contains thermophilic bacteria, and the milk is left to ripen so the bacteria can multiply. Then, [[rennet]] is added to coagulate the milk. After coagulation, the curd is cut into large, 1\"\u20132\" pieces, and left to sit so the curds firm up in a process known as healing.\n\nAfter the curd heals, it is further cut into 3/8\"\u20131/2\" large pieces. The curds are stirred and heated to separate the curds from the whey. The whey is then drained from the curds and the curds are placed in a hoop to form a solid mass. The curd mass is left until the pH is at around 5.2\u20135.5, which is the point when the cheese can be stretched and kneaded to produce a delicate consistency\u2014this process is generally known as [[pasta filata]]. According to the Mozzarella di Bufala trade association, \"The cheese-maker kneads it with his hands, like a baker making bread, until he obtains a smooth, shiny paste, a strand of which he pulls out and lops off, forming the individual mozzarella.\"<ref>{{cite web |author= Staff |url= http://www.mozzarelladibufala.org/allestimento.htm |title= Campana Buffalo's Mozzarella Cheese |publisher= Mozzarella di Bufala Campana Trade Organization |accessdate=8 May 2007}}</ref> It is then typically formed into cylinder shapes or in [[Braid|plait]].

It was introduced as the WWE Women's Championship on April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]] to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]] and has a unique title history separate from the original [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]]. As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft|2016 draft]], the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] created the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]] as a counterpart title.\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champion was [[Charlotte Flair]], then known simply as Charlotte, who won the title at WrestleMania 32. [[Becky Lynch]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Ronda Rousey]] and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Winner takes all match|winner takes all]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination match|triple threat match]] to win both titles at [[WrestleMania 35]] on April 8, 2019 (though lost the SmackDown title [[Money in the Bank (2019)|the following month]]).\n\nOverall, there have been 15 reigns between 7 champions. Charlotte Flair is tied with [[Sasha Banks]] for the most reigns at four. [[Becky Lynch]]'s current reign is the longest at {{age in days nts|April 8, 2019}}+ days whiles Banks' fourth reign is the shortest at 8 days (9 days as recognized by WWE). [[Alexa Bliss]] has the longest combined reign at 398 days (396 days as recognized by WWE).

It was introduced as the WWE Women's Championship on April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]] to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]] and has a unique title history separate from the original [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]]. As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft|2016 draft]], the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] created the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]] as a counterpart title.\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champion was [[Charlotte Flair]], then known simply as Charlotte, who won the title at WrestleMania 32. [[Becky Lynch]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Ronda Rousey]] and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Winner takes all match|winner takes all]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination match|triple threat match]] to win both titles at [[WrestleMania 35]] on April 8, 2019 (though lost the SmackDown title [[Money in the Bank (2019)|the following month]]).\n\nOverall, there have been 15 reigns between 7 champions. Charlotte Flair is tied with [[Sasha Banks]] for the most reigns at four. [[Becky Lynch]]'s current reign is the longest at {{age in days nts|April 8, 2019}}+ days whiles Banks' fourth reign is the shortest at 8 days (9 days as recognized by WWE). [[Alexa Bliss]] has the longest combined reign at 398 days (396 days as recognized by WWE). [[Nia Jax]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at the age of 33, while Banks is the youngest, first winning the title at 24.\n\n== Title history ==\n=== Names ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|WWE Women's Championship\n|April 3, 2016 \u2013 September 4, 2016\n|-\n|'''WWE Raw Women's Championship'''\n|September 5, 2016 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n=== Reigns ===\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|dayless=yes|unrecognized=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|sort number = 0.5\n|type = promotion\n|name = [[WWE]] (unbranded)\n}}{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname||Charlotte|Charlotte Flair}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|April 3, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|April 3, 2016|July 25, 2016}}\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington, TX]]\n|event    = [[WrestleMania 32]]\n|notes    = On the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show, the title was established as the WWE Women's Championship to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship]], which was originally to be defended in this match.
