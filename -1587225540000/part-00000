The system currently consists of 11 fully operating rail lines; two [[commuter rail]] lines, five [[rapid transit]] lines, one [[bus rapid transit]] line and two [[airport rail link|airport rail links]] to the [[Kuala&nbsp;Lumpur International Airport]] (and its low-cost terminal [[klia2]]) and another one to the [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport]]. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Klang_Valley_Rail_Transit_System_Timeline_-_2018.gif|Klang Valley Integrated Transit System Timeline|alt=|left|frame]]\nInitially, different competing companies had operated the various systems and had developed these rail systems separately and at different times. \n\nAs a result, many of these rail lines do not integrate well with the others or with the overall rail system itself, making transferring from system to system inconvenient for the passengers. \n\nAggravated by Kuala Lumpur's poor pedestrian network, moving from one rail system to another often require a lot of walking, stair-climbing and escalator-use. \n\nThe integrated ticket for all rail-based systems, such as {{TnG}} cards, would help any passenger transfer seamlessly across all stations in the rail system.\n\n==Integration==\nSince 28 November 2011, the paid areas of shared stations along the [[Rapid KL]] system for the {{KLRT line|5}}, {{KLRT line|3}}, {{KLRT line|4}} as well as the {{KLRT line|8}} from 1 March 2012, has been integrated physically under a common ticketing system, effectively making those stations into interchange stations. \n\nThis enables commuters to transfer between lines the interchange stations without buying a new ticket each time, provided that they do not exit the paid area.

railway network that primarily serves the area of [[Klang Valley]] and [[Greater Kuala&nbsp;Lumpur]]. The system currently consists of 11 fully operating rail lines; two [[commuter rail]] lines, five [[rapid transit]] lines, one [[bus rapid transit]] line and two [[airport rail link|airport rail links]] to the [[Kuala&nbsp;Lumpur International Airport]] (and its low-cost terminal [[klia2]]) and another one to the [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport]]. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Klang_Valley_Rail_Transit_System_Timeline_-_2018.gif|Klang Valley Integrated Transit System Timeline|alt=|left|frame]]\nInitially, different competing companies had operated the various systems and had developed these rail systems separately and at different times. \n\nAs a result, many of these rail lines do not integrate well with the others or with the overall rail system itself, making transferring from system to system inconvenient for the passengers. \n\nAggravated by Kuala Lumpur's poor pedestrian network, moving from one rail system to another often require a lot of walking, stair-climbing and escalator-use. \n\nThe integrated ticket for all rail-based systems, such as {{TnG}} cards, would help any passenger transfer seamlessly across all stations in the rail system.\n\n==Integration==\nSince 28 November 2011, the paid areas of shared stations along the [[Rapid KL]] system for the {{KLRT line|5}}, {{KLRT line|3}}, {{KLRT line|4}} as well as the {{KLRT line|8}} from 1 March 2012, has been integrated physically under a common ticketing system, effectively making those stations into interchange stations. \n\nThis enables commuters to transfer between lines the interchange stations without buying a new ticket each time, provided that they do not exit the paid area. This is currently possible at the {{stn|Titiwangsa}}, {{stn|Hang Tuah}}, {{lrts|Putra Heights}} and {{lrts|Masjid Jamek}} stations.

It was directed by [[Tim Story]], and released by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film stars [[Ioan Gruffudd]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Michael Chiklis]], [[Julian McMahon]] and [[Kerry Washington]].\n\nThis was the second live-action ''Fantastic Four'' film to be filmed. A previous attempt, titled ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', was a [[B-movie]] produced by [[Roger Corman]] that ultimately went unreleased. ''Fantastic Four'' was released in the United States on July 8, 2005. It received mixed reviews but was a commercial success. A sequel, ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', was released in 2007. [[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|A reboot]] was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mister Fantastic|Dr. Reed Richards]], a genius but timid and bankrupt [[physicist]], is convinced that evolution was triggered millions of years ago on earth by clouds of cosmic energy in space, and has calculated that one of these clouds is soon going to pass near Earth. Together with his friend, the gruff yet gentle astronaut [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], Reed convinces his equally brilliant but conceited [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] classmate [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Victor von Doom]], now CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow him access to his privately-owned space station to test the effects of exposure to the cloud on biological samples. Von Doom agrees, in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings. He brings aboard his beautiful chief genetics researcher (and Reed's ex-girlfriend from MIT) [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] and her hot-headed brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], a private astronaut who was Ben's subordinate at NASA but is his superior on the mission.\n\nThe quintet travels to space to observe the cosmic energy clouds, but Reed has miscalculated and the clouds materialize well ahead of schedule. Reed, Susan, and Johnny leave the shielded station to rescue Ben who has gone on a space-walk to place the samples, and Victor closes the shield behind them. Ben receives full exposure out in space, while the others receive a more limited dose within the station. They return home but soon begin to develop strange powers. Reed is able to stretch like rubber; Susan can become invisible and create force fields, especially when angered; Johnny can engulf himself in fire at temperatures in excess of 4000 [[Kelvin|K]] (erroneously described as [[supernova]]-like in the film), and is able to fly; and Ben is transformed into a large, rock-like creature with superhuman strength and durability. Victor meanwhile faces a backlash from his stockholders due to the publicity from the failed mission and has a scar on his face from an exploding control console he was near during the cloud's pass.\n\nBen returns home to see his fianc\u00e9e Debbie, but she cannot handle his new appearance and flees. He goes to brood on [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and accidentally causes a traffic pile-up while stopping a man from committing suicide. The four use their various powers to contain the damage and prevent anyone from being hurt. During this, Susan decides to become invisible to help and realizes she needs to remover her clothes to do so. But her plan fails and she is left in her underwear in front of the public. While the public cheer them for their efforts, Ben sees his fianc\u00e9e leave her engagement ring on the ground and run. Reed hands a heartbroken Ben the ring and vows to find a way to turn him back to normal. The media dubs them \"The Fantastic Four\" for their efforts. Victor watches the news story and is told that his company is lost now, the group's fame overriding the company's fate with the media. The four move into Reed's lab in the [[Baxter Building]] to study their abilities and find a way to return Ben to normal. Victor offers his support in their efforts but blames Reed for the mission's failure, the lights flickering as he grows enraged.\n\nReed tells the group he will construct a machine to re-create the storm and reverse its effect on their bodies, but warns it could possibly accelerate them instead. Meanwhile, Victor continues to mutate, his arm turning into an organic metal and allowing him to produce bolts of electricity, and he begins plotting to use his new powers to take his revenge. Victor drives a wedge between Ben and Reed by telling Ben Reed has no desire to change himself back, as the group's research has allowed him to rekindle his relationship with Susan. Reed and Ben argue, with Ben walking out in a rage. This motivates Reed to attempt the machine on himself, but he cannot generate the power needed to push the storm to critical mass. Doom hears Reed tell Susan this through security cameras and has Ben brought to the lab. Ben is placed in the machine and Doom uses his abilities to produce the electricity needed to power it, turning Ben back to normal and accelerating Doom's condition, causing much of his body to turn to metal. Victor knocks the human Ben unconscious and kidnaps Reed.\n\nVictor\u2014now calling himself '[[Doctor Doom|Doom]]'\u2014dons a metal mask to hide his physical disfigurations and incapacitates Reed using a super-cooling unit. Doom fires a heat-seeking missile at the Baxter Building to kill Johnny, and Johnny flies through the city to evade it, lighting a garbage barge on fire to trick it. Susan rushes to confront Doom as Ben begins to regret his decision to turn normal. Susan frees Reed and battles Doom but is outmatched - Ben arrives to save her, transformed into The Thing again by reusing the machine. The battle spills into the streets, and the four assemble to battle Doom. Johnny and Susan combine their powers to wrap Doom in an inferno of intense heat, and Ben and Reed douse him with cold water, inducing [[thermal shock]] and freezing Doom in place.\n\nAs an [[epilogue]], Ben informs Reed that he has accepted his condition with the help of [[Alicia Masters]], a blind artist for whom he has developed feelings, and the team decide to embrace their roles as superheroes and unite officially as the Fantastic Four. Reed proposes marriage to Susan, who accepts and they share a kiss. Meanwhile, Doom's statuesque remains are being transported back to his homeland of [[Latveria]] when the dockmaster's electronic manifest briefly experiences electronic interference.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Mister Fantastic|Dr. Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic]]\n*[[Jessica Alba]] as [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm / Invisible Woman]]\n*[[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm / Human Torch]]\n*[[Michael Chiklis]] as [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm / The Thing]]\n*[[Julian McMahon]] as [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom]] (was based on the creature called [[Darth Vader]])\n*[[Hamish Linklater]] as Leonard\n*[[Kerry Washington]] as [[Alicia Masters]]\n*[[Laurie Holden]] as Debbie McIlvane\n*[[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Jimmy O'Hoolihan\n*[[Maria Menounos]] as Nurse\n*[[Michael Kopsa]] as Ned Cecil\n*[[Stan Lee]] as [[Willie Lumpkin]]\n\n[[Rachel McAdams]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2004/06/23/ign-interviews-rachel-mcadams?page=4 |title=IGN INTERVIEWS RACHEL MCADAMS |website=IGN |date=June 23, 2004 |accessdate=November 1, 2014 |page=4 }}</ref> [[Ali Larter]]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} and [[Keri Russell]] were considered for Sue Storm.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave McNary|url=http://variety.com/2004/film/news/fox-near-to-quorum-for-fantastic-quartet-1117907470/|title=Fox near to quorum for \u2018Fantastic\u2019 quartet|work=Variety|date=2004-07-07|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref>\n\nAs in almost all of the previous Marvel Comics-based films, ''Fantastic Four'' co-creator Stan Lee makes a [[cameo appearance]].

This version had some changes from the one shown in cinemas. Some of these changes included the following:\n* There is a scene where Reed and Sue are in a storage room of the Baxter Building. On one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]] from the [[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|''Fantastic Four'' animated cartoon series from 1978]].\n* The biggest change is of the scene with Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd's characters looking toward the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Similar lines are used in the DVD version, but the version on DVD replaces that with the pair in the [[planetarium]], where they discuss their feelings for each other without an argumentative tone. The DVD includes the theatrical version as a bonus feature, but instead of Reed forming a square jaw, as he does in the theatrical version, he makes his skin look like that of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of the [[X-Men]] [[comics]]. The actor Gruffudd breaks the [[fourth wall]] and looks directly at the camera as he does this.

It was directed by [[Tim Story]], and released by [[20th Century Fox]]. The film stars [[Ioan Gruffudd]], [[Jessica Alba]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Michael Chiklis]], [[Julian McMahon]] and [[Kerry Washington]].\n\nThis was the second live-action ''Fantastic Four'' film to be filmed. A previous attempt, titled ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]'', was a [[B-movie]] produced by [[Roger Corman]] that ultimately went unreleased. ''Fantastic Four'' was released in the United States on July 8, 2005. It received mixed reviews but was a commercial success. A sequel, ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'', was released in 2007. [[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|A reboot]] was released in 2015.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Mister Fantastic|Dr. Reed Richards]], a genius but timid and bankrupt [[physicist]], is convinced that evolution was triggered millions of years ago on earth by clouds of cosmic energy in space, and has calculated that one of these clouds is soon going to pass near Earth. Together with his friend, the gruff yet gentle astronaut [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]], Reed convinces his equally brilliant but conceited [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] classmate [[Doctor Doom|Dr. Victor von Doom]], now CEO of Von Doom Industries, to allow him access to his privately-owned space station to test the effects of exposure to the cloud on biological samples. Von Doom agrees, in exchange for control over the experiment and a majority of the profits from whatever benefits it brings. He brings aboard his beautiful chief genetics researcher (and Reed's ex-girlfriend from MIT) [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]] and her hot-headed brother [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]], a private astronaut who was Ben's subordinate at NASA but is his superior on the mission.\n\nThe quintet travels to space to observe the cosmic energy clouds, but Reed has miscalculated and the clouds materialize well ahead of schedule. Reed, Susan, and Johnny leave the shielded station to rescue Ben who has gone on a space-walk to place the samples, and Victor closes the shield behind them. Ben receives full exposure out in space, while the others receive a more limited dose within the station. They return home but soon begin to develop strange powers. Reed is able to stretch like rubber; Susan can become invisible and create force fields, especially when angered; Johnny can engulf himself in fire at temperatures in excess of 4000 [[Kelvin|K]] (erroneously described as [[supernova]]-like in the film), and is able to fly; and Ben is transformed into a large, rock-like creature with superhuman strength and durability. Victor meanwhile faces a backlash from his stockholders due to the publicity from the failed mission and has a scar on his face from an exploding control console he was near during the cloud's pass.\n\nBen returns home to see his fianc\u00e9e Debbie, but she cannot handle his new appearance and flees. He goes to brood on [[Brooklyn Bridge]] and accidentally causes a traffic pile-up while stopping a man from committing suicide. The four use their various powers to contain the damage and prevent anyone from being hurt. During this, Susan decides to become invisible to help and realizes she needs to remover her clothes to do so. But her plan fails and she is left in her underwear in front of the public. While the public cheer them for their efforts, Ben sees his fianc\u00e9e leave her engagement ring on the ground and run. Reed hands a heartbroken Ben the ring and vows to find a way to turn him back to normal. The media dubs them \"The Fantastic Four\" for their efforts. Victor watches the news story and is told that his company is lost now, the group's fame overriding the company's fate with the media. The four move into Reed's lab in the [[Baxter Building]] to study their abilities and find a way to return Ben to normal. Victor offers his support in their efforts but blames Reed for the mission's failure, the lights flickering as he grows enraged.\n\nReed tells the group he will construct a machine to re-create the storm and reverse its effect on their bodies, but warns it could possibly accelerate them instead. Meanwhile, Victor continues to mutate, his arm turning into an organic metal and allowing him to produce bolts of electricity, and he begins plotting to use his new powers to take his revenge. Victor drives a wedge between Ben and Reed by telling Ben Reed has no desire to change himself back, as the group's research has allowed him to rekindle his relationship with Susan. Reed and Ben argue, with Ben walking out in a rage. This motivates Reed to attempt the machine on himself, but he cannot generate the power needed to push the storm to critical mass. Doom hears Reed tell Susan this through security cameras and has Ben brought to the lab. Ben is placed in the machine and Doom uses his abilities to produce the electricity needed to power it, turning Ben back to normal and accelerating Doom's condition, causing much of his body to turn to metal. Victor knocks the human Ben unconscious and kidnaps Reed.\n\nVictor\u2014now calling himself '[[Doctor Doom|Doom]]'\u2014dons a metal mask to hide his physical disfigurations and incapacitates Reed using a super-cooling unit. Doom fires a heat-seeking missile at the Baxter Building to kill Johnny, and Johnny flies through the city to evade it, lighting a garbage barge on fire to trick it. Susan rushes to confront Doom as Ben begins to regret his decision to turn normal. Susan frees Reed and battles Doom but is outmatched - Ben arrives to save her, transformed into The Thing again by reusing the machine. The battle spills into the streets, and the four assemble to battle Doom. Johnny and Susan combine their powers to wrap Doom in an inferno of intense heat, and Ben and Reed douse him with cold water, inducing [[thermal shock]] and freezing Doom in place.\n\nAs an [[epilogue]], Ben informs Reed that he has accepted his condition with the help of [[Alicia Masters]], a blind artist for whom he has developed feelings, and the team decide to embrace their roles as superheroes and unite officially as the Fantastic Four. Reed proposes marriage to Susan, who accepts and they share a kiss. Meanwhile, Doom's statuesque remains are being transported back to his homeland of [[Latveria]] when the dockmaster's electronic manifest briefly experiences electronic interference.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ioan Gruffudd]] as [[Mister Fantastic|Dr. Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic]]\n*[[Jessica Alba]] as [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm / Invisible Woman]]\n*[[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm / Human Torch]]\n*[[Michael Chiklis]] as [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm / The Thing]]\n*[[Julian McMahon]] as [[Doctor Doom|Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom]]\n*[[Hamish Linklater]] as Leonard\n*[[Kerry Washington]] as [[Alicia Masters]]\n*[[Laurie Holden]] as Debbie McIlvane\n*[[Kevin McNulty (actor)|Kevin McNulty]] as Jimmy O'Hoolihan\n*[[Maria Menounos]] as Nurse\n*[[Michael Kopsa]] as Ned Cecil\n*[[Stan Lee]] as [[Willie Lumpkin]]\n\n[[Rachel McAdams]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2004/06/23/ign-interviews-rachel-mcadams?page=4 |title=IGN INTERVIEWS RACHEL MCADAMS |website=IGN |date=June 23, 2004 |accessdate=November 1, 2014 |page=4 }}</ref> [[Ali Larter]]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} and [[Keri Russell]] were considered for Sue Storm.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave McNary|url=http://variety.com/2004/film/news/fox-near-to-quorum-for-fantastic-quartet-1117907470/|title=Fox near to quorum for \u2018Fantastic\u2019 quartet|work=Variety|date=2004-07-07|accessdate=2014-10-11}}</ref>\n\nAs in almost all of the previous Marvel Comics-based films, ''Fantastic Four'' co-creator Stan Lee makes a [[cameo appearance]].

This version had some changes from the one shown in cinemas. Some of these changes included the following:\n* There is a scene where Reed and Sue are in a storage room of the Baxter Building. On one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be [[H.E.R.B.I.E.]] from the [[Fantastic Four (1978 TV series)|''Fantastic Four'' animated cartoon series from 1978]].\n* The biggest change is of the scene with Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd's characters looking toward the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Similar lines are used in the DVD version, but the version on DVD replaces that with the pair in the [[planetarium]], where they discuss their feelings for each other without an argumentative tone. The DVD includes the theatrical version as a bonus feature, but instead of Reed forming a square jaw, as he does in the theatrical version, he makes his skin look like that of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of the [[X-Men]] [[comics]]. The actor Gruffudd breaks the [[fourth wall]] and looks directly at the camera as he does this. The extended cut includes this as part of the movie, along with a longer version of the scene in the [[planetarium]].<ref name=\"extended\"/>\n\nThe movie was also released on [[VHS]] the same day, it was later released on [[Blu-ray]] on November 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fantastic Four Blu-ray review |url=https://bluray.highdefdigest.com/205/fantasticfour.html |website=HighDefDigest.com |date=November 13, 2006 |accessdate=December 2, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Extended cut===\nIn June 2007, an extended cut DVD of ''Fantastic Four'' was released.

{"title_page": "Dissenting opinion", "text_new": "{{Judicial opinions}}\nA '''dissenting opinion''' (or '''dissent''') is an [[Legal opinion|opinion]] in a [[legal case]] in certain legal systems written by one or more [[judge]]s expressing disagreement with the [[majority opinion]] of the [[court]] which gives rise to its judgment. When not necessarily referring to a legal decision, this can also be referred to as a '''minority report'''.<ref>[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/minority%2Breport Definition of ''\"minority report\"'']. ''[[OED|Oxford Dictionaries Online]]''. Retrieved Nov 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/minority-report Definition of ''\"minority report\"''], ''[[Macmillan Dictionary]] Retrieved Nov 2012.</ref>\n\nDissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any [[concurring opinion]]s, and are also delivered and published at the same time.  A dissenting opinion does not create [[binding precedent]] nor does it become a part of [[case law]], though they can sometimes be cited as a form of [[persuasive authority]] in subsequent cases when arguing that the court's [[Holding (law)|holding]] should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law, and a later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular understanding of the law formerly advocated in dissent.  As with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often illuminate the precise holding of the majority opinion.\n\nThe dissent may disagree with the majority for any number of reasons: a different interpretation of the existing case law, the application of different principles, or a different interpretation of the facts. Many legal systems do not provide for a dissenting opinion and provide the decision without any information regarding the discussion between judges or its outcome.\n\n==Types of dissenting opinions==\n{{Expand section|1=additional examples|section=1|date=June 2019}}\nA '''dissent in part''' is a dissenting opinion that disagrees selectively\u2014specifically, with one part of the majority holding. In decisions that require holdings with multiple parts due to multiple legal claims or consolidated cases, judges may write an opinion \"concurring in part and dissenting in part\".\n\n==Dissenting opinions by region==\n{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|section=1|date=June 2019}}\n===United States of America===\nIn some courts, such as the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the majority opinion may be broken down into numbered or lettered parts, which allows those judges \"dissenting in part\" to easily identify which parts they join with the majority, and which sections they do not.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, it became customary for the members of the U.S. Supreme Court and many [[state supreme court]]s to end their dissenting opinions with a variation on the phrase \"I respectfully dissent.\" In turn, the omission of the word \"respectfully\" or of the entire phrase altogether is now taken as a signal that the dissenting justice is particularly furious at the majority over the issue dissented upon.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Auerbach |first1=David |title=R-E-S-P-E-C-T, Find Out What It Means to Scalia |url=https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/06/the-surprising-history-of-the-respectful-dissent-at-the-supreme-court.html |accessdate=10 March 2019 |work=Slate |publisher=Slate Group LLC |date=26 June 2015}}</ref>\n===Germany===\n\nIn the proceedings before the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] (BVerfG), the fourth amendment to the Federal Constitutional Court Act of 21 December 1970 - in Section 30 (2) BVerfGG - introduced the possibility of a special vote. Since then, the decisions of the BVerfG can be accompanied by a minority opinion with the signature of the differing judge votes. The aim of the reform was to achieve greater transparency in court decisions and to strengthen the position of the individual judge.\nSpecial votes are also possible at some state constitutional courts in Germany. So z. B. Section 12 (1) of the Lower Saxony Law on the State Court provides for the corresponding application of Section 30 (2) BVerfGG. The Hessian State Court Law provides for an independent regulation on the possibility of a special vote in section 16 (3). Special votes are also permitted in arbitration proceedings. \n\nThe special vote is only permitted at constitutional courts. A minority opinion may not be published in all other courts. A judicial confidentiality obligation arises from \u00a7 43 DRiG, which protects the confidentiality of advice. The introduction of special votes in all courts was discussed in detail at the 47th German Lawyers' Day in 1968.\n\n===Italy===\nA minority opinion cannot be published in judgements of Italian courts.

The group combines traditional [[Merengue t\u00edpico|merengue]] with elements of other genres such as [[House music|house]], [[Latin hip hop|hip hop]], and [[bachata (music)|bachata]] among others. With over five million albums sold throughout the world, they were at one time the top selling act in [[Colombia]], and were placed on other charts including those of [[Japan]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]], and [[Chile]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Their name means \"Little John Doe\" (i.e. unknown) in Spanish (see ''[[wikt:Fulano|Fulano]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ito|-ito]]''). Members of Fulanito had previously been in popular groups such as [[740 Boyz]] and [[2 in a Room]].\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Album !! Year !!

Vargas grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in [[Manhattan, New York]], and Winston grew up in the [[South Bronx]].  They met in 1992 during a studio session where Winston was working as a recording engineer on one of Rafael\u2019s earlier projects.  Their first album, \u201cEl Hombre Mas Famoso De La Tierra\u201d gained international fame with the hit singles \u201cGuallando\u201d, \u201cEl Cepillo\u201d and \u201cLa Novela,. The album sold over 500,000 units worldwide.   They further gained international notoriety with their second album, \u201cEl Padrino\u201d which garnered them their first Grammy nomination.  Their third album, \u201cAmericanizao\u201d (2001) would be the last production both Vargas and Rosa would work on together.\n\n===Influences===\nFulanito\u2019s influences trace back to the early days of Tropical Latin music in New York. \u201cGrowing up in New York City during the late 70\u2019s,and 80\u2019s, our generation has been influenced by the sounds of classic dance music and Hip-hop, all while the classic tropical sounds waved through our ears\u201d states Vargas.  From their Latin roots, Vargas and Rosa were driven by the likes of [[Hector Lavoe]], [[Willie Col\u00f3n]], [[Johnny Pacheco]], [[Johnny Ventura]], and [[Fernandito Villalona]].  Their more youthful roots go as far back as [[Run DMC]], [[T La Rock]], and [[LL Cool J]], among others.\n\n===2 in a Room===\nVargas began his quest in the music business when he first collaborated on a compilation project headed by Aldo Marin and his record label Cutting Records.  The compilation was to consist of various producers bring in their very own sounds in dance music.  Vargas and then partner, Roger Pauletta submitted a House/Hip-hop fused track \"Do What you Wanna Do\", the song gain notoriety in the underground House Music industry for its unique flow of Rap mixed in with a dance-friendly House beat. The song's popularity prompted Marin to suggest that Vargas collaborate his rap style on another single from the album.  Vargas would team up with DJ/producer George Morel on the international hit \"Wiggle It\".  With the immediate success of \"Wiggle It\", Vargas was eventually stapled as the frontman to the group ''2 in a Room'', releasing the album \"Wiggle It\" (Cutting/Charisma, 1990).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fraser Delgado|first=Celeste|title=What's in A Name|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2001-06-07/music/what-s-his-name/|publisher=Miami New Times|accessdate=June 7, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Vargas met Winston Rosa while Rosa was engineering one of his featured singles.  Having similar music styles and influences in common, they hit it off very well, eventually teaming up and forming their production company, WinDose International.  Following the success of \"Wiggle It\", Vargas was looking to bring in something new. With the help of Rosa, he released the album \"World Party\" (Cutting Records, 1994), which added the Latin element to his already popular House/Hip-Hop blend.  Vargas recruited his classmate Elvin Ovalles as his lyrical partner.  The first single on \"World Party\" was the Latin Urban club hit \"El Trago\", produced by the dance music DJ duo of Victor and Danny Vargas (No relation to Rafael)\n\n===740 Boyz===\nThe sound and popularity from \"World Party\" was the motivation that both Vargas and Rosa needed to build on a new sound in the ever changing Dance music circuit.  WIth the addition of Jose \"Pickles\" Fuentes, their friend and local club promoter and DJ from Vargas' neighborhood, they went on to form the [[740 Boyz]].  Their self-titled album was released in 1995, gaining a worldwide following with the international hit \"Shimmy Shake\".  The group gained greater popularity in Europe, specifically in France. 740 Boyz was the precursor to what defined the legacy of Fulanito, where Vargas first utilized his signature high-pitched chanted choruses and rap style.\n\n===El Hombre M\u00e1s Famoso de la Tierra (1997-1999)===\nAs the popularity of the 740 Boyz began to wind down, Vargas was once again in search of a new sound and market to exploit his talents.  With the growing success of many young urban Latin groups such as [[Proyecto Uno|Proyect Uno]], [[Ilegales]] and [[Sandy & Papo|Sandy y Papo]] surging in South America, Vargas and Rosa were eager to tap in.  Vargas was well aware of the rising success of the grassroots traditional merengue genre known as Perico Ripiao (Spanish for \"ripe parrot\"). Vargas found a way to keep his previous projects together by bringing Ovalles, Fuentes and adding Marino Paredes to the mix.  Rosa, being very close to the genre, enlisted the talents of his father, Arcenio De La Rosa, an accomplished well-known traditional merengue artist in his own right, to add to the authenticity of the sound.  They merged their hip hop styles with the sounds of merengue, as well as samba and cumbia, and released \"El Hombre Mas Famoso De La Tierra\" in 1997.  The album gained immediate worldwide recognition selling over 500,000 units.  The first single off the album, \"Guallando,\" became a household chant, gaining song of the year honors in Colombia in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ross|first = Karl|title = The Dominican Squeezebox Goes Digital|url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2000-04-06/music/the-dominican-squeezebox-goes-digital/|publisher = Miami New Times|accessdate = April 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===El Padrino (1999-2001)===\nFulanito's second studio album, \"El Padrino\" (Cutting, 1999) used many of the same elements that garnered them international fame, with only minor changes to the sound and the frontline.  Rosa decided to step down as one of the frontmen to concentrate on the production end.  Vargas would add Welington Belen to replace Rosa.  Belen, born and raised in the Dominican Republic and a student of merengue genre, was very instrumental in the production of \"El Padrino\". Vargas and Rosa were able to incorporate more of the authentic merengue sound while adding their American urban element with ease.  The album received a Grammy nomination in 1999, and had several songs featured in [[John Singleton|John Singelton]]'s modern day film release of [[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]].\n\n===Americanizao (2001-2004)===\nThe release of \"Americanizao\" (Cutting, 2001) saw the group becoming a quartet.  Belen left the group and Vargas would focus on a more urban dance feel for the album.  With its hit single \"Callate\", hip-hop tracks \"Otra Vez\" and \"Eight Million Ways\", the sound that Fulanito producing was making waves for a change, while still staying grounded in its merengue roots with \"Pecho A Pechuga\", \"La Tiembladera\" and \"El Generalissimo\", a song that created slight controversy in the Dominican Republic.  \"El Generalissimo\" was eventually prohibited from the nations airwaves just days after the album's release.  Officials cited the use of the title \"Generalissimo\" as a certain glorification to the country's last dictator, [[Rafael Trujillo]].\n\n===La Verdad (2004-2007)===\nIn 2004, Fulanito had a slight change in its front staff. Vargas would replace Ovalles and Paredes, and add Jesus Martinez and Daniel Fernandez to fill in.\n\n===Vacaner\u00eda! (2007-2009)===\nThe release of \"Vacaner\u00eda!\" saw the emergence of Rafael Vargas as he was solidifying his staple as a solo artist. Other artists and producers were invited to participate in the construction of the album to insure variety, depth and a breath of fresh air for Latin hip hop listeners everywhere. Music producers and brothers, Cristian Mendez and Cleyton Mendez, a.k.a. Guary & Cleyton, were among the contributors to the new album. The duo produced a salsa hip-hop track titled \"Pa Que Sepa\", properly utilizing a piece of the Roberto Ruena composition \"Que Se Sepa\", and also the track \"Mataron El Negro\", cleverly embodying a portion of the composition \"El Negron Bembon\", performed by legendary salsero [[Ismael Rivera]]. The first single release from the album was \"Mira\", which features vocals from Rhingo 'Truko' Fernandez. Truko is also featured alongside Magic Juan (former vocalist of the group Proyecto Uno) in the song \"Ajena\". \"No Hay Otro Como Yo\" features salsero [[Kevin Ceballo]] singing the hook in Spanglish. \"Sabado en La Noche\", a merengue-influenced reggaeton track, was produced by and features Tonny Tun Tun. Two other reggaeton songs on the album are the tracks \"Contigo\" and \"Sigue (Oh Oh)\". The Arabian-flavored club track \"Culebrita\" was produced by Rahdeekhal. In 2007, the album garnered Rafael his second Grammy Nomination in the best Latin Urban Urban Album category<ref>{{cite web|title=Complete List of Grammy  Nominees for 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/06grammylist.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Merengue music groups]]\n[[Category:American rappers of Dominican Republic descent]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American rappers]]\n", "text_old": "{{citations needed|date=December 2015}}\n{{POV|date=August 2012}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name            = Fulanito\n| image           = Fulanito En La Puerta Grande.jpg\n| image_size      = \n| landscape       = \n| alt             = \n| caption         = Fulanito En La Puerta Grande\n| background      = group_or_band\n| alias           = \"El Hombre M\u00e1s Famoso De La Tierra\"\n| origin          = [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]\n| genre           = {{flatlist|\n* [[Merengue music|Merengue]]\n* [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]\n* [[Dance music|dance]]\n* [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]\n}}\n| years_active    = 1996\u2013present\n| label           = {{flatlist|\n* Cutting Records (1997\u20132007)\n* Verdugo Entertainment (2008\u2013present)\n}}\n| associated_acts = {{flatlist|\n* [[740 Boyz]]\n* [[2 in a Room]]\n}}\n| current_members = \n* Winston Rosa (founder)\n* Rafael Vargas (founder)\n| past_members    = \n* Jos\u00e9 \"Pickles\" Fuentes (1997\u20132007)\n* Elvin Ovalles (1997\u20132002)\n* Marino Paredes (1997\u20132002)\n* Wellington Belen (1999\u20132000)\n* Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez (2003\u20132006)\n* Daniel Fern\u00e1ndez (2003\u20132005)\n}}\n\n'''Fulanito''' is an American musical group based in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] in New York City.

Vargas and then partner, Roger Pauletta submitted a House/Hip-hop fused track \"Do What you Wanna Do\", the song gain notoriety in the underground House Music industry for its unique flow of Rap mixed in with a dance-friendly House beat. The song's popularity prompted Marin to suggest that Vargas collaborate his rap style on another single from the album.  Vargas would team up with DJ/producer George Morel on the international hit \"Wiggle It\".  With the immediate success of \"Wiggle It\", Vargas was eventually stapled as the frontman to the group ''2 in a Room'', releasing the album \"Wiggle It\" (Cutting/Charisma, 1990).<ref>{{cite web|last=Fraser Delgado|first=Celeste|title=What's in A Name|url=http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2001-06-07/music/what-s-his-name/|publisher=Miami New Times|accessdate=June 7, 2001}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Vargas met Winston Rosa while Rosa was engineering one of his featured singles.  Having similar music styles and influences in common, they hit it off very well, eventually teaming up and forming their production company, WinDose International.  Following the success of \"Wiggle It\", Vargas was looking to bring in something new. With the help of Rosa, he released the album \"World Party\" (Cutting Records, 1994), which added the Latin element to his already popular House/Hip-Hop blend.  Vargas recruited his classmate Elvin Ovalles as his lyrical partner.  The first single on \"World Party\" was the Latin Urban club hit \"El Trago\", produced by the dance music DJ duo of Victor and Danny Vargas (No relation to Rafael)\n\n===740 Boyz===\nThe sound and popularity from \"World Party\" was the motivation that both Vargas and Rosa needed to build on a new sound in the ever changing Dance music circuit.  WIth the addition of Jose \"Pickles\" Fuentes, their friend and local club promoter and DJ from Vargas' neighborhood, they went on to form the [[740 Boyz]].  Their self-titled album was released in 1995, gaining a worldwide following with the international hit \"Shimmy Shake\".  The group gained greater popularity in Europe, specifically in France. 740 Boyz was the precursor to what defined the legacy of Fulanito, where Vargas first utilized his signature high-pitched chanted choruses and rap style.\n\n===El Hombre M\u00e1s Famoso de la Tierra (1997-1999)===\nAs the popularity of the 740 Boyz began to wind down, Vargas was once again in search of a new sound and market to exploit his talents.  With the growing success of many young urban Latin groups such as [[Proyecto Uno|Proyect Uno]], [[Ilegales]] and [[Sandy & Papo|Sandy y Papo]] surging in South America, Vargas and Rosa were eager to tap in.  Vargas was well aware of the rising success of the grassroots traditional merengue genre known as Perico Ripiao (Spanish for \"ripe parrot\"). Vargas found a way to keep his previous projects together by bringing Ovalles, Fuentes and adding Marino Paredes to the mix.  Rosa, being very close to the genre, enlisted the talents of his father, Arcenio De La Rosa, an accomplished well-known traditional merengue artist in his own right, to add to the authenticity of the sound.  They merged their hip hop styles with the sounds of merengue, as well as samba and cumbia, and released \"El Hombre Mas Famoso De La Tierra\" in 1997.  The album gained immediate worldwide recognition selling over 500,000 units.  The first single off the album, \"Guallando,\" became a household chant, gaining song of the year honors in Colombia in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|last = Ross|first = Karl|title = The Dominican Squeezebox Goes Digital|url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2000-04-06/music/the-dominican-squeezebox-goes-digital/|publisher = Miami New Times|accessdate = April 6, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===El Padrino (1999-2001)===\nFulanito's second studio album, \"El Padrino\" (Cutting, 1999) used many of the same elements that garnered them international fame, with only minor changes to the sound and the frontline.  Rosa decided to step down as one of the frontmen to concentrate on the production end.  Vargas would add Welington Belen to replace Rosa.  Belen, born and raised in the Dominican Republic and a student of merengue genre, was very instrumental in the production of \"El Padrino\". Vargas and Rosa were able to incorporate more of the authentic merengue sound while adding their American urban element with ease.  The album received a Grammy nomination in 1999, and had several songs featured in [[John Singleton|John Singelton]]'s modern day film release of [[Shaft (2000 film)|Shaft]].\n\n===Americanizao (2001-2004)===\nThe release of \"Americanizao\" (Cutting, 2001) saw the group becoming a quartet.  Belen left the group and Vargas would focus on a more urban dance feel for the album.  With its hit single \"Callate\", hip-hop tracks \"Otra Vez\" and \"Eight Million Ways\", the sound that Fulanito producing was making waves for a change, while still staying grounded in its merengue roots with \"Pecho A Pechuga\", \"La Tiembladera\" and \"El Generalissimo\", a song that created slight controversy in the Dominican Republic.  \"El Generalissimo\" was eventually prohibited from the nations airwaves just days after the album's release.  Officials cited the use of the title \"Generalissimo\" as a certain glorification to the country's last dictator, [[Rafael Trujillo]].\n\n===La Verdad (2004-2007)===\nIn 2004, Fulanito had a slight change in its front staff. Vargas would replace Ovalles and Paredes, and add Jesus Martinez and Daniel Fernandez to fill in.\n\n===Vacaner\u00eda! (2007-2009)===\nThe release of \"Vacaner\u00eda!\" saw the emergence of Rafael Vargas as he was solidifying his staple as a solo artist. Other artists and producers were invited to participate in the construction of the album to insure variety, depth and a breath of fresh air for Latin hip hop listeners everywhere. Music producers and brothers, Cristian Mendez and Cleyton Mendez, aka Guary & Cleyton, were among the contributors to the new album. The duo produced a salsa hip-hop track titled \"Pa Que Sepa\", properly utilizing a piece of the Roberto Ruena composition \"Que Se Sepa\", and also the track \"Mataron El Negro\", cleverly embodying a portion of the composition \"El Negron Bembon\", performed by legendary salsero [[Ismael Rivera]]. The first single release from the album was \"Mira\", which features vocals from Rhingo 'Truko' Fernandez. Truko is also featured alongside Magic Juan (former vocalist of the group Proyecto Uno) in the song \"Ajena\". \"No Hay Otro Como Yo\" features salsero [[Kevin Ceballo]] singing the hook in Spanglish. \"Sabado en La Noche\", a merengue-influenced reggaeton track, was produced by and features Tonny Tun Tun. Two other reggaeton songs on the album are the tracks \"Contigo\" and \"Sigue (Oh Oh)\". The Arabian-flavored club track \"Culebrita\" was produced by Rahdeekhal. In 2007, the album garnered Rafael his second Grammy Nomination in the best Latin Urban Urban Album category<ref>{{cite web|title=Complete List of Grammy  Nominees for 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/06grammylist.html?pagewanted=all|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Merengue music groups]]\n[[Category:American rappers of Dominican Republic descent]]\n[[Category:Hispanic and Latino American rappers]]\n", "name_user": "Vanisaac", "label": "safe", "comment": "Correcting spelling: aka->a.k.a.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulanito"}

She was the [[Australian House of Representatives|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Division of Curtin|Curtin]] from 1998 to 2019. She has been the [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of [[Australian National University]] from January 2020.\n\nBishop was born in [[Lobethal]], [[South Australia]], and studied law at the [[University of Adelaide]]. Prior to entering politics she worked as a commercial lawyer in [[Perth, Western Australia]]; she was the local managing partner of [[Clayton Utz]]. She was a delegate to the [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998 constitutional convention]], and also served as a director of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) and as a member of the [[Murdoch University]] senate. Bishop was elected to parliament at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], representing the [[Division of Curtin]] in Perth's western suburbs. In the [[Howard Government]], she served as [[Minister for Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Ageing]] (2003\u20132006), [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Minister for Education and Science]] (2006\u20132007), and [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]] (2006\u20132007).\n\nAfter the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] lost the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 election]], Bishop was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party. She was the first woman to hold the position, and was re-elected to the post at multiple [[leadership spill]]s following her initial election. During her time as deputy, there were three different Liberal leaders\u2014[[Brendan Nelson]], [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and [[Tony Abbott]]. When the Coalition returned to power at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 election]], Bishop was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the [[Abbott Government]]. She was Australia's first female foreign minister. Issues that arose during her tenure included changes to the [[Australian Aid|Australian foreign aid program]], the [[international military intervention against ISIL]], the shooting down of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], and the execution of Australian citizens by Indonesia.\n\nIn August 2018, [[Peter Dutton]] challenged Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party, due to dissatisfaction from the party's conservative wing. Turnbull defeated Dutton in a leadership ballot, but tensions continued to mount and the party voted in favour of holding [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills, 2018|a second spill]]; Bishop chose to be a candidate. In the second vote, Bishop was eliminated in the first round by [[Peter Dutton]] and [[Scott Morrison]], with Morrison elected as party leader (and thus prime minister) in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scott Morrison wins Liberal party leadership spill|url=https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/23/13/57/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-scott-morrison|work=Nine News|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref> She declined to retain the foreign affairs portfolio in the [[First Morrison Ministry|Morrison Ministry]], instead moving to the [[backbench]].

These changes included abolition of the Australian foreign aid agency, AusAID, and extensive expenditure cuts.<ref>Jack Corbett, 2017, ''Australia's Foreign Aid Dilemma: Humanitarian Aspirations confront Democratic Legitimacy''., Abdingdon, Oxon: Routledge {{ISBN|978-1-138-69671-6}} (hbk).</ref>\n\nThe new government was sworn into office on 18 September 2013. Incoming Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced the same day that AusAID would be integrated into the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT). The news of the proposed integration had been conveyed by Bishop to senior AusAID staff some days earlier.<ref>Corbett, op.cit., p.133.</ref> The official explanation for the integration of AusAID into DFAT was that \u201cIntegration will enable DFAT to better pursue Australia\u2019s national interests by ensuring closer alignment and mutually reinforcing linkages among the Government\u2019s aid, foreign affairs and trade efforts.\u201d<ref>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 2014. ''Submission to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee Inquiry into Australia's Overseas Aid and Development Assistance Program'', 7 February. p.1.</ref>\n\nThe impact of the integration on the quality of Australia's aid program led to considerable debate.<ref>An independent review of the integration process five years after the change was issued in early 2019.  See Richard Moore, '[http://devpolicy.org/publications/reports/DFAT-AusAIDIntegrationReview-FullVersion.pdf Strategic Choice: A future-focused review of the DFAT-AusAID integration'], February 2019, Canberra: ANU, Development Policy Centre.  See also Corbett, op.cit., p. 136.</ref>  Sceptics pointed to the departure of a considerable number of experienced aid professionals from the former AusAID while the process of integration was taking place and argued that the culture and priorities of DFAT were not supportive of a quality aid program.  Those in favour of the change argued that closer alignment with foreign affairs would ensure that the aid program was more relevant and would provide better value for money.<ref>Greg Sheridan 2014.

In Opposition, the Liberal Party had publicly endorsed the aim of maintaining the Australian aid budget at the level of 0.5% of GDP.<ref>Corbett, op.cit, p. 132.</ref>  Aid spending amounted to around $5.0 billion in 2014/15.  However budget cuts introduced after the new government took office led to marked reductions. Expenditure was reduced to around $4.2 billion in 2015/16. Further reductions were introduced in following years.  Aid spending as a share of GDP fell from 0.32% in 2014/15 to an estimated 0.23% in 2018/19.<ref>Data is available at Development Policy Centre, Australian National University, ''[http://devpolicy.org/aidtracker/trends/ Aid Tracker]''.

Affairs]] from 2013 to 2018 and [[Liberal Party of Australia#List of deputy leaders|deputy leader]] of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] from 2007 to 2018. She was the [[Australian House of Representatives|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Division of Curtin|Curtin]] from 1998 to 2019. She has been the [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] of [[Australian National University]] from January 2020.\n\nBishop was born in [[Lobethal]], [[South Australia]], and studied law at the [[University of Adelaide]]. Prior to entering politics she worked as a commercial lawyer in [[Perth, Western Australia]]; she was the local managing partner of [[Clayton Utz]]. She was a delegate to the [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|1998 constitutional convention]], and also served as a director of the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) and as a member of the [[Murdoch University]] senate. Bishop was elected to parliament at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], representing the [[Division of Curtin]] in Perth's western suburbs. In the [[Howard Government]], she served as [[Minister for Ageing (Australia)|Minister for Ageing]] (2003\u20132006), [[Minister for Education (Australia)|Minister for Education and Science]] (2006\u20132007), and [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]] (2006\u20132007).\n\nAfter the [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] lost the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 election]], Bishop was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party. She was the first woman to hold the position, and was re-elected to the post at multiple [[leadership spill]]s following her initial election. During her time as deputy, there were three different Liberal leaders\u2014[[Brendan Nelson]], [[Malcolm Turnbull]], and [[Tony Abbott]]. When the Coalition returned to power at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 election]], Bishop was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs in the [[Abbott Government]]. She was Australia's first female foreign minister. Issues that arose during her tenure included changes to the [[Australian Aid|Australian foreign aid program]], the [[international military intervention against ISIL]], the shooting down of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]], and the execution of Australian citizens by Indonesia.\n\nIn August 2018, [[Peter Dutton]] challenged Turnbull for the leadership of the Liberal Party, due to dissatisfaction from the party's conservative wing. Turnbull defeated Dutton in a leadership ballot, but tensions continued to mount and the party voted in favour of holding [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spills, 2018|a second spill]]; Bishop chose to be a candidate. In the second vote, Bishop was eliminated in the first round by [[Peter Dutton]] and [[Scott Morrison]], with Morrison elected as party leader (and thus prime minister) in the second round.<ref>{{cite news|title=Scott Morrison wins Liberal party leadership spill|url=https://www.9news.com.au/2018/08/23/13/57/five-things-you-need-to-know-about-scott-morrison|work=Nine News|date=24 August 2018|accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref> She declined to retain the foreign affairs portfolio in the [[First Morrison Ministry|Morrison Ministry]], instead moving to the [[backbench]].

These changes included abolition of the Australian foreign aid agency, AusAID, and extensive expenditure cuts.<ref>Jack Corbett, 2017, ''Australia's Foreign Aid Dilemma: Humanitarian Aspirations confront Democratic Legitimacy''., Abdingdon, Oxon: Routledge {{ISBN|978-1-138-69671-6}} (hbk).</ref>\n\nThe new government was sworn into office on 18 September 2013.

The news of the proposed integration had been conveyed by Bishop to senior AusAID staff some days earlier.<ref>Corbett, op.cit., p.133.</ref> The official explanation for the integration of AusAID into DFAT was that \u201cIntegration will enable DFAT to better pursue Australia\u2019s national interests by ensuring closer alignment and mutually reinforcing linkages among the Government\u2019s aid, foreign affairs and trade efforts.\u201d<ref>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 2014.

However budget cuts introduced after the new government took office led to marked reductions. Expenditure was reduced to around $4.2 billion in 2015/16.

The first CSANF Cup was launched in 2011, a modest arrangement because of financial difficulties. The single match elimination of the loser was adopted.\n\nThe following Cup events were in 2014 called CSANF Cup - Fraternidad Internacional and the third was in 2017 called CSANF Cup - 10 A\u00f1os o celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the CSANF\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|- style=\"background: #C1D8FF;\"\n!rowspan=2 width=3%|#\n!rowspan=2 width=5%|Year\n!rowspan=2 width=10%|Title\n!rowspan=2 width=10%|Host\n!colspan=3|Final\n|- style=\"background: #C1D8FF;\"\n!width=15%|Campe\u00e3o\n!width=10%|Placar\n!width=15%|Vice\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|'''2011'''\n|'''Copa CSANF 2011'''\n|[[File:Bandera Juan Fern\u00e1ndez.jpg|22x20px|border]] [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]] <br /> [[Chile]]\n|[[File:Bandera Juan Fern\u00e1ndez.jpg|30x27px|border]] <br /> '''[[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]'''\n|'''1 \u2013 1'''<br />'''(4 \u2013 3 [[Penalty kick (association football)|Penalty <br />kicks]])'''\n|[[File:Banner of the Qulla Suyu.svg|30x27px|border]] <br /> [[Aymara people|Aimar\u00e1]] Nation\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|'''2014'''\n|'''Copa CSANF 2014 - <br />Fraternidad Internacional'''\n|[[File:Bandera_de_la_Ciudad_de_Buenos_Aires.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Buenos Aires]], [[File:Flag_of_Argentina.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Argentina]]\n|[[File:Flag of Armenia.svg|border|30x27px]] [[File:Flag of Argentina.svg|30x27px|border]] <br /> '''[[Armenian Argentine|Armenian Argentine Community]]'''\n|'''8 - 3''' <br />\n|[[File:Flag of Esperanto.svg|border|30x27px]] <br /> [[Esperanto]]\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|'''2017'''\n|'''Copa CSANF - <br />10 A\u00f1os'''\n|[[File:Bandera_de_la_Ciudad_de_Buenos_Aires.svg|22x20px|border]] Buenos Aires, [[File:Flag_of_Argentina.svg|22x20px|border]] Argentina\n|[[File:Flag of Armenia.svg|border|30x27px]] [[File:Flag of Argentina.svg|30x27px|border]] <br /> '''Armenian Argentine Community'''\n|'''10 - 0''' <br />\n|[[File:Bandeira-fernandodenoronha.gif|border|30x27px]] <br /> [[Fernando de Noronha]]\n\n|}\n\n==Affiliation with Confederation of Independent Football Associations==\nSince 2019, CSANF affiliated itself with [[Confederation of Independent Football Associations]] (ConIFA or CONIFA) such that the current champion of the CSANF Cup, has the right, if affiliated at the same time with CONIFA, to qualify automatically to the following edition of the CONIFA World Cup as representative of the South American group. It is worth mentioning that this was a new opening, as until the 2019 agreement, CONIFA did not have any South American representation. However the CSANF champion was not obliged to participate in case it didn't want to.

The single match elimination of the loser was adopted.\n\nThe following Cup events were in 2014 called CSANF Cup - Fraternidad Internacional and the third was in 2017 called CSANF Cup - 10 A\u00f1os o celebrate the 10th anniversary of the founding of the CSANF\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: 0 auto;\"\n|- style=\"background: #C1D8FF;\"\n!rowspan=2 width=3%|#\n!rowspan=2 width=5%|Year\n!rowspan=2 width=10%|Title\n!rowspan=2 width=10%|Host\n!colspan=3|Final\n|- style=\"background: #C1D8FF;\"\n!width=15%|Campe\u00e3o\n!width=10%|Placar\n!width=15%|Vice\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|'''2011'''\n|'''Copa CSANF 2011'''\n|[[File:Bandera Juan Fern\u00e1ndez.jpg|22x20px|border]] [[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]] <br> [[Chile]]\n|[[File:Bandera Juan Fern\u00e1ndez.jpg|30x27px|border]] <br /> '''[[Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands]]'''\n|'''1 \u2013 1'''<br />'''(4 \u2013 3 [[Penalty kick (association football)|Penalty <br>kicks]])'''\n|[[File:Banner of the Qulla Suyu.svg|30x27px|border]] <br /> [[Aymara people|Aimar\u00e1]] Nation\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|'''2014'''\n|'''Copa CSANF 2014 - <br>Fraternidad Internacional'''\n|[[File:Bandera_de_la_Ciudad_de_Buenos_Aires.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Buenos Aires]], [[File:Flag_of_Argentina.svg|22x20px|border]] [[Argentina]]\n|[[File:Flag of Armenia.svg|border|30x27px]] [[File:Flag of Argentina.svg|30x27px|border]] <br /> '''[[Armenian Argentine|Armenian Argentine Community]]'''\n|'''8 - 3''' <br />\n|[[File:Flag of Esperanto.svg|border|30x27px]] <br /> [[Esperanto]]\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|'''2017'''\n|'''Copa CSANF - <br>10 A\u00f1os'''\n|[[File:Bandera_de_la_Ciudad_de_Buenos_Aires.svg|22x20px|border]] Buenos Aires, [[File:Flag_of_Argentina.svg|22x20px|border]] Argentina\n|[[File:Flag of Armenia.svg|border|30x27px]] [[File:Flag of Argentina.svg|30x27px|border]] <br /> '''Armenian Argentine Community'''\n|'''10 - 0''' <br />\n|[[File:Bandeira-fernandodenoronha.gif|border|30x27px]] <br /> [[Fernando de Noronha]]\n\n|}\n\n==Affiliation with Confederation of Independent Football Associations==\nSince 2019, CSANF affiliated itself with [[Confederation of Independent Football Associations]] (ConIFA or CONIFA) such that the current champion of the CSANF Cup, has the right, if affiliated at the same time with CONIFA, to qualify automatically to the following edition of the CONIFA World Cup as representative of the South American group. It is worth mentioning that this was a new opening, as until the 2019 agreement, CONIFA did not have any South American representation. However the CSANF champion was not obliged to participate in case it didn't want to.
