Because of demand in the American market from the early 1970s to the mid-1980s (with only a brief recession in 1979), Surat's diamond industry grew tremendously. Currently most of the diamond polishing workshops are running in the [[Varachha]] area of Surat, mostly by the people of the [[Patel]] community.<ref name=diamondhistory>{{cite journal|title=Diamond and Patels|citeseerx = 10.1.1.1026.5615|year = 1999}}</ref>\n\nAround the world, 8 out of 10 diamonds on the market were cut and polished in Surat.

He was a professor of economics at Yeonhee College and an economic theorist of the Communist Party of Korea, and a representative figure of socialist economists during the Japanese colonial period along with Lee Soon-Tak. After the independence, on the premise of some asset class and solidarity, in the article 'The Path of the Chosun People's', 'Combination of New Democracy (National Unification Front)' was proposed. After liberation, Kim Doo-bong, Heo Jeong-suk, and Choi Chang-ik connected with Nam Joseon New Democratic Party and Nationalist Democratic Front, but did not come down after coming to North Korea with Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, Jang Geon-sang in April 1948. Since then, he served as the first literary statue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn in Gochang-gun, Jeonbuk Province in 1894. In 1912, at the age of 19, he entered Suwon Agriculture and Forestry School. The school was free of tuition, was able to live in a dormitory, and Nam Wun Baek was even subsidized in tuition, so he was able to concentrate on his studies. After graduating from Suwon Agricultural and Forestry School in 1915, he was appointed as a teacher at Ganghwa Normal School in accordance with the mandatory regulations.\n\nAfter working for two years at this school, he received a telegram as an engineer of the Ganghwa-gun Forestry Cooperative and worked again for one year. He wandered worrying about the future of this period and decided to study in Japan for a new intellectual desire. In 1918, he went to Japan to study, graduated from Tokyo High School of Commerce and Tokyo University of Commerce (now Hitotsubashi University).\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo University in 1925, he returned to Korea and became a professor at Yonhee College. During this period, in 1925, the Communist Party of Korea was founded in secret. Although communism had already been introduced to Korea, which had fallen into a colony, even after the founding of the Communist Party of Korea and the Korean Studies Movement in the 1920s, the Governor-General of Japan made a series of suppression of the communist movement and the Korean history of restructuring. Nevertheless, socialism was persistently spreading in connection with the anti-Japanese movement.\n\n===Late Japanese colonial period===\nHe stood in the position of Marx's antiquities and class struggle theory and lectured on the history of Joseon, criticizing and refuting the 'identity theory' of the colonial consulate, and along with the lecture activities, he wrote books, Korea Social Economic History in 1933 and Korea Feudal Society in 1937 about economic history. On the other hand, Paek Nam-un was attacked intensively by people in the autonomous movement when he published several criticisms of autonomy asserted by national reformists from a nationalist perspective. \n\nAs his reputation as an economist became known, there were many students following him, and Nam Woon Baek led a socialist student club called the Economic Research Society. However, the Japanese imprisoned him and imprisoned him for more than two years. Released in 1940, he later lived in seclusion in addition to interacting with scholars.\n\n===After liberation===\nWith Nam Wun Baek, on August 15, 1945, first founded the Korea Academy and became professor of the Faculty of Law, [[Kyungsung University]]. He then devoted progressive or socialist scholars to supporting the theory of building a new nation.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?sfrm=2&n=199511220290]</ref>\nIn December 1945, when the Moscow 3-phase conference was announced, he first declared a return in the name of the president of the Korea Academy and insisted on it through lectures, but later turned to a stand and supported the stand.\n\nFrom this point on, Paek Nam-un began to work on the political front. He was independence movement in Yan'an, China, and had a certain connection with Hangul scholar Kim Doo-bong, who returned to the north of the [[Division of Korea|38th parallel]], Choi Chang-ik of the Korean Independent Alliance, and Jung-sook Heo. Paek Nam-un organized the Gyeongseong Special Committee of the Korean Independent Alliance and became Chairman. Then, with the consent of Kim Doo-bong, a party called the Nam Josun New Democratic Party was founded and progressively reorganized to become the party leader. Connected with Kim Doo-bong, Heo Jung-sook, and Choi Chang-ik, and worked with the Namjosun New Democratic Party in the National Democracy Front in February 1946.\n\n====New Democratic Party Activities====\nHe has been to the north of the 38th parallel twice as a representative of the New Democratic Party of Namjosun. In addition, the Korean military campaigned for unification in the midst of US military campaigns. Thus, the New Korea People's Party, the People's Party of Korea, and the [[Communist Party of Korea]] were worthy to form the South Korean Workers' Party. On February 15, 1946, he was invited to the co-chair of the Nationalist National Front (Minjeon).<ref>\uac15\uc900\ub9cc, \ud55c\uad6d\ud604\ub300\uc0ac\uc0b0\ucc45 1940\ub144\ub300\ud3b8 1\uad8c 211\ucabd</ref> He left the street without joining the Namro Party, led by Park Heon-young, and through this, he had a conflict and confrontation with Park Heon-young. During this process, he felt skeptical and declared resignation in front of the barriers of reality. After that, he organized the National Culture Research Center and participates in cultural movements. However, in April 1947, six months after the retirement of the political system, the government returned to the political system. After announcing an article against the establishment of a single government, he collaborated with Yeon-hyung Yeo to join the founding of the People's Party of Korea. In May 1947, he was appointed Vice-Chairman of the People's Party of Korea. However, on July 19th, when Yeon-hyung was assassinated, he could no longer maintain his organization. In August 1947, a wave of left-wing arrest arrested Paek Nam-un in a crisis of being arrested with the party. Eventually, Nam Woon Baek faces a threat of personal affairs, and first brings the family to North Korea.\n\nBy the time he was studying in Japan, he was strongly influenced by Marxism in the intellectual class in Japan, and there were many socialist economists, especially in Tokyo. From this point on, it is estimated that Paek Nam-un naturally leaned toward Marxism.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n[[image:\ud5c8\ud5cc \ubc15\ud5cc\uc601 \ud64d\uba85\ud76c.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In August 1948, the 'People's Congress' was held in [[Haeju]], [[Hwanghae Province]].

At the crossroads, Paek Nam-un chose to participate in the inter-Korean negotiations with Kim Gu, criticizing the establishment of the 'South Korea Bay Government' and the May 10 general election. In April 1948, he attended the Pyongyang Inter-Korean Conference. At this conference, he first gave a speech following Kim Il-sung and Park Heon-young, and at the third meeting he was also the moderator. \n\nHe was the twelfth northbound and the last northbound to go north to participate in inter-Korean negotiations. After that, he sat down in Pyongyang after the inter-Korean negotiations.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> \n\n===North Korea===\nAugust-September 1948 The 1st Expeditionary Member of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He was appointed as the first Education Minister in the [[Cabinet of North Korea|North Korean Cabinet]] led by [[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] [[Kim Il-sung]] and served for eight years. He also served as President of the Academy of Sciences of North Korea. Afterwards, the distance from the coastal group was safe when Kim Doo-bong and Choi Chang-ik were purged and Hur Jeong-suk was displaced in 1961. Later he served as the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly in 1961-62, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Marx Leninist Broadcasting University.

He was a professor of economics at Yeonhee College and an economic theorist of the Communist Party of Korea, and a representative figure of socialist economists during the Japanese colonial period along with Lee Soon-Tak. After the independence, on the premise of some asset class and solidarity, in the article 'The Path of the Chosun People's', 'Combination of New Democracy (National Unification Front)' was proposed. After liberation, Kim Doo-bong, Heo Jeong-suk, and Choi Chang-ik connected with Nam Joseon New Democratic Party and Nationalist Democratic Front, but did not come down after coming to North Korea with Kim Gu, Kim Kyu-sik, Jang Geon-sang in April 1948. Since then, he served as the first literary statue of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nBorn in Gochang-gun, Jeonbuk Province in 1894. In 1912, at the age of 19, he entered Suwon Agriculture and Forestry School. The school was free of tuition, was able to live in a dormitory, and Nam Wun Baek was even subsidized in tuition, so he was able to concentrate on his studies. After graduating from Suwon Agricultural and Forestry School in 1915, he was appointed as a teacher at Ganghwa Normal School in accordance with the mandatory regulations.\n\nAfter working for two years at this school, he received a telegram as an engineer of the Ganghwa-gun Forestry Cooperative and worked again for one year. He wandered worrying about the future of this period and decided to study in Japan for a new intellectual desire. In 1918, he went to Japan to study, graduated from Tokyo High School of Commerce and Tokyo University of Commerce (now Hitotsubashi University).\n\nAfter graduating from Tokyo University in 1925, he returned to Korea and became a professor at Yonhee College. During this period, in 1925, the Communist Party of Korea was founded in secret. Although communism had already been introduced to Korea, which had fallen into a colony, even after the founding of the Communist Party of Korea and the Korean Studies Movement in the 1920s, the Governor-General of Japan made a series of suppression of the communist movement and the Korean history of restructuring. Nevertheless, socialism was persistently spreading in connection with the anti-Japanese movement.\n\n===Late Japanese colonial period===\nHe stood in the position of Marx's antiquities and class struggle theory and lectured on the history of Joseon, criticizing and refuting the 'identity theory' of the colonial consulate, and along with the lecture activities, he wrote books, Korea Social Economic History in 1933 and Korea Feudal Society in 1937 about economic history. On the other hand, Paek Nam-un was attacked intensively by people in the autonomous movement when he published several criticisms of autonomy asserted by national reformists from a nationalist perspective. \n\nAs his reputation as an economist became known, there were many students following him, and Nam Woon Baek led a socialist student club called the Economic Research Society. However, the Japanese imprisoned him and imprisoned him for more than two years. Released in 1940, he later lived in seclusion in addition to interacting with scholars.\n\n===After liberation===\nWith Nam Wun Baek, on August 15, 1945, first founded the Korea Academy and became professor of the Faculty of Law, [[Kyungsung University]]. He then devoted progressive or socialist scholars to supporting the theory of building a new nation.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?sfrm=2&n=199511220290]</ref>\nIn December 1945, when the Moscow 3-phase conference was announced, he first declared a return in the name of the president of the Korea Academy and insisted on it through lectures, but later turned to a stand and supported the stand.\n\nFrom this point on, Paek Nam-un began to work on the political front. He was independence movement in Yan'an, China, and had a certain connection with Hangul scholar Kim Doo-bong, who returned to the north of the [[Division of Korea|38th parallel]], Choi Chang-ik of the Korean Independent Alliance, and Jung-sook Heo. Paek Nam-un organized the Gyeongseong Special Committee of the Korean Independent Alliance and became Chairman. Then, with the consent of Kim Doo-bong, a party called the Nam Josun New Democratic Party was founded and progressively reorganized to become the party leader. Connected with Kim Doo-bong, Heo Jung-sook, and Choi Chang-ik, and worked with the Namjosun New Democratic Party in the National Democracy Front in February 1946.\n\n====New Democratic Party Activities====\nHe has been to the north of the 38th parallel twice as a representative of the New Democratic Party of Namjosun. In addition, the Korean military campaigned for unification in the midst of US military campaigns. Thus, the New Korea People's Party, the People's Party of Korea, and the [[Communist Party of Korea]] were worthy to form the South Korean Workers' Party. On February 15, 1946, he was invited to the co-chair of the Nationalist National Front (Minjeon).<ref>\uac15\uc900\ub9cc, \ud55c\uad6d\ud604\ub300\uc0ac\uc0b0\ucc45 1940\ub144\ub300\ud3b8 1\uad8c 211\ucabd</ref> He left the street without joining the Namro Party, led by Park Heon-young, and through this, he had a conflict and confrontation with Park Heon-young. During this process, he felt skeptical and declared resignation in front of the barriers of reality. After that, he organized the National Culture Research Center and participates in cultural movements. However, in April 1947, six months after the retirement of the political system, the government returned to the political system. After announcing an article against the establishment of a single government, he collaborated with Yeon-hyung Yeo to join the founding of the People's Party of Korea. In May 1947, he was appointed Vice-Chairman of the People's Party of Korea. However, on July 19th, when Yeon-hyung was assassinated, he could no longer maintain his organization. In August 1947, a wave of left-wing arrest arrested Paek Nam-un in a crisis of being arrested with the party. Eventually, Nam Woon Baek faces a threat of personal affairs, and first brings the family to North Korea.\n\nBy the time he was studying in Japan, he was strongly influenced by Marxism in the intellectual class in Japan, and there were many socialist economists, especially in Tokyo. From this point on, it is estimated that Paek Nam-un naturally leaned toward Marxism.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n[[image:\ud5c8\ud5cc \ubc15\ud5cc\uc601 \ud64d\uba85\ud76c.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In August 1948, the 'People's Congress' was held in [[Haeju]], [[Hwanghae Province]]. From the left, Paek Nam-un, Heo Heon, [[Pak Hon-yong]], and [[Hong Myong-hui]].]]\nOn May 10, 1948, the general election was scheduled to go north or south of South Korea. At the crossroads, Paek Nam-un chose to participate in the inter-Korean negotiations with Kim Gu, criticizing the establishment of the 'South Korea Bay Government' and the May 10 general election. In April 1948, he attended the Pyongyang Inter-Korean Conference. At this conference, he first gave a speech following Kim Il-sung and Park Heon-young, and at the third meeting he was also the moderator. \n\nHe was the twelfth northbound and the last northbound to go north to participate in inter-Korean negotiations. After that, he sat down in Pyongyang after the inter-Korean negotiations.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> \n\n===North Korea===\nAugust-September 1948 The 1st Expeditionary Member of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He was appointed as the first Education Minister in the [[Cabinet of North Korea|North Korean Cabinet]] led by [[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] [[Kim Il-sung]] and served for eight years. He also served as President of the Academy of Sciences of North Korea. Afterwards, the distance from the coastal group was safe when Kim Doo-bong and Choi Chang-ik were purged and Hur Jeong-suk was displaced in 1961. Later he served as the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly in 1961-62, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, Marx Leninist Broadcasting University. He became the President of the the Supreme People's Assembly in 1967, and the Chairman of the National Democratic Front of Korea in 1974.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nPaek Nam-un acted as an intermediary for North Korea's intellectuals.

It is an open boat propelled by one, two or four paddlers from a kneeling position, using single-bladed paddles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equipment and history|url=http://www.olympic.org/canoe-kayak-sprint-equipment-and-history?tab=equipement|publisher=IOC|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref> The difficulty of balance can depend on how wide or narrow the canoe is, although regularly the less contact a canoe has with the water the faster it goes. This makes the narrower boats much faster and popular when it comes to racing.\n\n==History==\nCanoeing was a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]].  It was the first time that the sport was part of the Olympic program. The [[French Olympic Committee]] asked the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] to demonstrate the sport in Paris. Races were arranged between the [[Canadian Canoe Association]] and the [[Washington Canoe Club]] from the [[United States]].  Events were held for C1, C2, and C4.<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Jeux de la VIII<sup>e</sup> Olympiade Paris 1924 - Rapport Officiel|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1924/1924.pdf|publisher=Comit\u00e9 Olympique Fran\u00e7ais|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref> Canoeing has been a medal sport since the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]] in [[Berlin]] where C1s and C2s raced. 1924 was the last time C4s were raced in the Olympics.\n\nThe trend is towards reducing the course distance. Early races were staged over 1,000 and 10,000 meters for men and 5,000 meters for women. Today, they are over distances of 200, 500 and 1000 meters. For the 2012 Games in London, the 500m events were replaced by 200m events. However, in the ICF World Championships, distances of 5000m are still raced today.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Competition schedule|url = http://www.milanworldcanoesprint.com/en/results-live-streaming/competition-schedule|website = www.milanworldcanoesprint.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> \n\nWomen's canoe debuted internationally at the [[2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2010 championships]] in [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Poland]] and will be in the Olympics for the first time with a C1 event at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n== Women's canoe ==\nThe exclusion of sprint canoe events in the Olympics has been a cause of controversy. Non-Olympic events such as the [[Pan American Canoe Championships|Pan American Championships]] also excluded women's canoe for 1000, 500, and 200 meter events since 2001. The Senior and U23 World Championships only include 2 official events for women's canoe.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About Sprint Canoe/Kayak|url = http://womencanintl.com/wordpress/about-womencan-intl/about-canoe-sprint/|website = WomenCAN International|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> The group WomenCAN International works to push sprint canoe organizations to include more events for women's canoe. WomenCAN is led by American canoeist Pamela Boteler, who made canoe-kayak history in the 2000 National Championships by becoming the first woman to compete in sprint canoe, against the men, winning gold and bronze medals. <ref>{{Cite web|title = Pamela Boteler|url = http://www.teamusa.org/usa-canoe-kayak/athletes/Pamela-Boteler|website = Team USA|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> In 2002, Boteler's lobbying convinced USA Canoe-Kayak to allow women to compete at the National Championships in their own events. \n\n==Equipment==\nBoats are symmetrical along the length and only paddled with single-bladed paddles. To keep course paddlers use what is called a J-stroke while they paddle. Paddlers kneel on a foam or cushioned block to stabilize their knee, and often have foot braces to secure their position. ICF Sprint boats are called C1, C2, C4, with the 'C' for canoe and the number for the number of paddlers required to (successfully) propel the vessel.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICF Canoe Sprint Rules|url=https://www.canoeicf.com/rules#sprint|publisher=ICF|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> (In several European countries the 'C' was interpreted as the 'C' for [[Canadian canoe]].)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These canoes were known as deltas, and typically have a diamond-shape, when viewed from above. An example was the Struer Delta, designed in 1956. The restriction was dropped soon after Plastex began manufacturing boats with wings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to 200m.info|url=http://www.kayak.plus.com/200m/|accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three main companies who manufacture sprint canoes: [[Nelo]], Plastex, and [[Vajda]]. Nelo are based in [[Portugal]] and was established in 1978. They are recognized as the largest canoe manufacturer in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NELO|url = http://www.nelo.eu/company|website = NELO|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> Plastex was founded in 1990 by [[Whitewater slalom|slalom canoeist]] [[Richard Seruga]]. They are Nelo's main competition in design innovation in sprint canoe. In 1999, Plastex made a design revolution, which pushed ICF Committee to change the rules concerning boats dimensions during ICF Congress 2000. Vajda, or Vajdagroup, specializes in sprint canoes and whirlpool spas. Their use of carbon and [[Nomex]] Honeycomb in their construction helps them build very light boats.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VAJDAGROUP|url = http://www.vajdagroup.com/gen_page.php?menu=3#|website = www.vajdagroup.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref>\n\n== Canada ==\nSprint Canoe-Kayak is very popular in Canada, unlike in the United States whose water sport activity is dominated by [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Many famous Canadian Olympic athletes competed in sprint canoe, such as [[Sue Holloway]], the first Canadian and first woman to ever compete in both Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 1976 for cross-country skiing and sprint kayaking.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rideau River just like home for Olympian Sue Holloway|url = https://ottawacitizen.com/health/diet-fitness/liquid-gold|website = Ottawa Citizen|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> [[Adam van Koeverden]] is another athlete who has become a prominent Canadian figure, now working as a sports analyst for the Canadian national public service broadcaster, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], covering the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi Winter Olympics]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speakers' Spotlight - Adam van Koeverden {{!}} World Champion Kayaker|url = http://www.speakers.ca/speakers/adam-van-koeverden/|website = www.speakers.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> Van Koeverden first captured the world's attention at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] where he was a double medalist, winning gold and bronze. Van Koeverden was selected as Canada's flag bearer at the closing ceremonies following his impressive performance, and as opening ceremonies flag-bearer in the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympics]]. He then won silver at both 2008 and 2012 Games. Van Koeverden was named \"Canada's Athlete of the Year\" in 2012. He is also an ambassador for [[Right To Play|Right to Play]], and involved with the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]]'s Athlete Commission, the [[David Suzuki Foundation]], Colon Cancer Canada, and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]].\n\nCanada is the only country in the world to race [[war canoe]], or C15, and is the focal point of the club system.<ref>{{Cite web|title = War Canoe {{!}} CanoeKayak Canada|url = http://canoekayak.ca/go-paddling/war-canoe/|website = canoekayak.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> War canoes are often made of wood and their design has remained mostly unchanged for decades. War canoe may also be made of [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]], or another composite. War canoe paddles are single bladed and made of wood or carbon-fibre. These paddles are shorter than a C1 or C2 paddler would use. War canoes are steered by a [[Coxswain|cox]], or steersperson, who use a much bigger and longer blade to allow for more control. War canoe races are exciting and allow for canoe clubs to showcase club pride. Races vary between distances of 200, 500, and 1000 meters. \n\nThe Canadian C4 is another boat exclusive to Canada. It is wider than the ICF C4, the International Canoe for four people. The John W. Black Trophy, which can be won at the Canadian National Canoe Championships, is famous and likened to the [[Stanley Cup]]. It was first introduced in 1928 on behalf of the Canadian Canoe Association from its donor, Mr. John W. Black.<ref>{{Cite book|title = 100 Years of Champions|last = Johnston|first = C.

It is an open boat propelled by one, two or four paddlers from a kneeling position, using single-bladed paddles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Equipment and history|url=http://www.olympic.org/canoe-kayak-sprint-equipment-and-history?tab=equipement|publisher=IOC|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref> The difficulty of balance can depend on how wide or narrow the canoe is, although regularly the less contact a canoe has with the water the faster it goes. This makes the narrower boats much faster and popular when it comes to racing.\n\n==History==\nCanoeing was a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]].  It was the first time that the sport was part of the Olympic program. The [[French Olympic Committee]] asked the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]] to demonstrate the sport in Paris. Races were arranged between the [[Canadian Canoe Association]] and the [[Washington Canoe Club]] from the [[United States]].  Events were held for C1, C2, and C4.<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Jeux de la VIII<sup>e</sup> Olympiade Paris 1924 - Rapport Officiel|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1924/1924.pdf|publisher=Comit\u00e9 Olympique Fran\u00e7ais|accessdate=8 June 2014}}</ref> Canoeing has been a medal sport since the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Games]] in [[Berlin]] where C1s and C2s raced. 1924 was the last time C4s were raced in the Olympics.\n\nThe trend is towards reducing the course distance. Early races were staged over 1,000 and 10,000 meters for men and 5,000 meters for women. Today, they are over distances of 200, 500 and 1000 meters. For the 2012 Games in London, the 500m events were replaced by 200m events. However, in the ICF World Championships, distances of 5000m are still raced today.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Competition schedule|url = http://www.milanworldcanoesprint.com/en/results-live-streaming/competition-schedule|website = www.milanworldcanoesprint.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> \n\nWomen's canoe debuted internationally at the [[2010 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships|2010 championships]] in [[Pozna\u0144]], [[Poland]] and will be in the Olympics for the first time with a C1 event at the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, Japan.\n\n== Women's canoe ==\nThe exclusion of sprint canoe events in the Olympics has been a cause of controversy. Non-Olympic events such as the [[Pan American Canoe Championships|Pan American Championships]] also excluded women's canoe for 1000, 500, and 200 meter events since 2001. The Senior and U23 World Championships only include 2 official events for women's canoe.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About Sprint Canoe/Kayak|url = http://womencanintl.com/wordpress/about-womencan-intl/about-canoe-sprint/|website = WomenCAN International|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> The group WomenCAN International works to push sprint canoe organizations to include more events for women's canoe. WomenCAN is led by American canoeist Pamela Boteler, who made canoe-kayak history in the 2000 National Championships by becoming the first woman to compete in sprint canoe, against the men, winning gold and bronze medals. <ref>{{Cite web|title = Pamela Boteler|url = http://www.teamusa.org/usa-canoe-kayak/athletes/Pamela-Boteler|website = Team USA|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> In 2002, Boteler's lobbying convinced USA Canoe-Kayak to allow women to compete at the National Championships in their own events. \n\n==Equipment==\nBoats are symmetrical along the length and only paddled with single-bladed paddles. To keep course paddlers use what is called a J-stroke while they paddle. Paddlers kneel on a foam or cushioned block to stabilize their knee, and often have foot braces to secure their position. ICF Sprint boats are called C1, C2, C4, with the 'C' for canoe and the number for the number of paddlers required to (succesfully) propel the vessel.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICF Canoe Sprint Rules|url=https://www.canoeicf.com/rules#sprint|publisher=ICF|accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref> (In several European countries the 'C' was interpreted as the 'C' for [[Canadian canoe]].)\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

These canoes were known as deltas, and typically have a diamond-shape, when viewed from above. An example was the Struer Delta, designed in 1956. The restriction was dropped soon after Plastex began manufacturing boats with wings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to 200m.info|url=http://www.kayak.plus.com/200m/|accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere are three main companies who manufacture sprint canoes: [[Nelo]], Plastex, and [[Vajda]]. Nelo are based in [[Portugal]] and was established in 1978. They are recognized as the largest canoe manufacturer in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NELO|url = http://www.nelo.eu/company|website = NELO|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> Plastex was founded in 1990 by [[Whitewater slalom|slalom canoeist]] [[Richard Seruga]]. They are Nelo's main competition in design innovation in sprint canoe. In 1999, Plastex made a design revolution, which pushed ICF Committee to change the rules concerning boats dimensions during ICF Congress 2000. Vajda, or Vajdagroup, specializes in sprint canoes and whirlpool spas. Their use of carbon and [[Nomex]] Honeycomb in their construction helps them build very light boats.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VAJDAGROUP|url = http://www.vajdagroup.com/gen_page.php?menu=3#|website = www.vajdagroup.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref>\n\n== Canada ==\nSprint Canoe-Kayak is very popular in Canada, unlike in the United States whose water sport activity is dominated by [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]]. Many famous Canadian Olympic athletes competed in sprint canoe, such as [[Sue Holloway]], the first Canadian and first woman to ever compete in both Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 1976 for cross-country skiing and sprint kayaking.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rideau River just like home for Olympian Sue Holloway|url = https://ottawacitizen.com/health/diet-fitness/liquid-gold|website = Ottawa Citizen|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> [[Adam van Koeverden]] is another athlete who has become a prominent Canadian figure, now working as a sports analyst for the Canadian national public service broadcaster, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], covering the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi Winter Olympics]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speakers' Spotlight - Adam van Koeverden {{!}} World Champion Kayaker|url = http://www.speakers.ca/speakers/adam-van-koeverden/|website = www.speakers.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> Van Koeverden first captured the world's attention at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Olympic Games]] where he was a double medalist, winning gold and bronze. Van Koeverden was selected as Canada's flag bearer at the closing ceremonies following his impressive performance, and as opening ceremonies flag-bearer in the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London Olympics]]. He then won silver at both 2008 and 2012 Games. Van Koeverden was named \"Canada's Athlete of the Year\" in 2012. He is also an ambassador for [[Right To Play|Right to Play]], and involved with the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]]'s Athlete Commission, the [[David Suzuki Foundation]], Colon Cancer Canada, and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]].\n\nCanada is the only country in the world to race [[war canoe]], or C15, and is the focal point of the club system.<ref>{{Cite web|title = War Canoe {{!}} CanoeKayak Canada|url = http://canoekayak.ca/go-paddling/war-canoe/|website = canoekayak.ca|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}</ref> War canoes are often made of wood and their design has remained mostly unchanged for decades. War canoe may also be made of [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]], or another composite. War canoe paddles are single bladed and made of wood or carbon-fibre. These paddles are shorter than a C1 or C2 paddler would use. War canoes are steered by a [[Coxswain|cox]], or steersperson, who use a much bigger and longer blade to allow for more control. War canoe races are exciting and allow for canoe clubs to showcase club pride. Races vary between distances of 200, 500, and 1000 meters. \n\nThe Canadian C4 is another boat exclusive to Canada. It is wider than the ICF C4, the International Canoe for four people. The John W. Black Trophy, which can be won at the Canadian National Canoe Championships, is famous and likened to the [[Stanley Cup]]. It was first introduced in 1928 on behalf of the Canadian Canoe Association from its donor, Mr. John W. Black.<ref>{{Cite book|title = 100 Years of Champions|last = Johnston|first = C.
