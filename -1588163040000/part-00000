He inherited vast estates and served in various offices of state in [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], and [[Kingdom of England|England]], a country he ultimately governed as [[Lord Protector]] during the madness of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]].\n\nHis conflicts with Henry's wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and other members of Henry's court, as well as [[House of York#Descent from Edward III|his competing claim to the throne]], were a leading factor in the political upheaval of mid-fifteenth-century England, and a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Richard eventually attempted to take [[Throne of England|the throne]], but was dissuaded, although it was agreed that he would become king on Henry's death. But within a few weeks of securing [[Act of Accord|this agreement]], he died in [[Battle of Wakefield|battle]]. Two of his sons, [[Edward IV]] and [[Richard III]], later ascended the throne.\n\n==Descent==\n[[File:Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (Variant).svg|thumb|Arms of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York: [[quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]], 1st and 4th: ''[[Royal arms of England]] overall a label of three points each charged with three torteaux'' (arms of his grandfather, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York]]<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]</ref><ref>Pinches, John Harvey; Pinches, Rosemary (1974), The Royal Heraldry of England, Heraldry Today, Slough, Buckinghamshire: Hollen Street Press, {{ISBN|0-900455-25-X}}</ref>), 2nd: ''[[Anscarids|Castile and Le\u00f3n]]'', 3rd, quarterly: ''[[Anne Mortimer|Mortimer]] and [[House of de Burgh|de Burgh]]'', overall an inescutcheon of ''[[Earl of Kent#Earls of Kent, sixth creation (1360)|Holland, Earl of Kent]]'']]\nRichard of York was born on 22 September 1411,{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} the son of [[Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge|Richard, Earl of Cambridge]] (1385\u20131415), and his wife [[Anne Mortimer]] (1388\u20131411). Both his parents were descended from King [[Edward III of England]] (1312\u20131377): his father was son of [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund, 1st Duke of York]] (founder of the [[House of York]]), fourth surviving son of Edward III, whereas his mother Anne Mortimer was a great-granddaughter of [[Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], Edward's second son. After the death in 1425 of Anne's childless brother [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Edmund, Earl of March]], this ancestry supplied her son Richard, of the [[House of York]], with a claim to the English throne that was arguably superior to that of the reigning [[House of Lancaster]], descended from [[John of Gaunt]], the third son of Edward III.{{sfn|Watts|2004}}\n\nRichard had an only sister, [[Isabel of York, Countess of Essex|Isabel]]. Richard's mother, Anne Mortimer, died in or shortly after his birth, and his father the Earl of Cambridge was beheaded in 1415 for his part in the [[Southampton Plot]] against the Lancastrian [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]. Within a few months of his father's death, Richard's childless uncle, [[Edward, 2nd Duke of York]], was slain at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415, and so Richard inherited Edward's title and lands, becoming 3rd [[Duke of York]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} The lesser title but greater estates of the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]], along with their claim to the throne, also descended to him on the death of his maternal uncle [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], in 1425.\n\nRichard of York already held a strong claim to the English throne, being the [[heir general]] of Edward III while also related to the same king in a direct [[Patrilineality|male line of descent]].{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=240}} Once he inherited the vast Mortimer estates, he also became the wealthiest and most powerful noble in England, second only to the king himself.{{sfn|Pugh|2001|pp=71, 74}} An account shows that York's net income from Welsh and [[Welsh marches|marcher]] lands alone was \u00a33,430 (about \u00a3350,000 today) in the year 1443\u201344.{{sfn|Jacob|1961|pp=335, 465}}\n\n==Childhood and upbringing==\nUpon the death of the Earl of Cambridge, Richard became a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the crown.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} As he was an orphan, his property was managed by royal officials. Despite his father's plot against the king, along with his provocative ancestry \u2013 one which had been used in the past as a rallying point by enemies of the [[House of Lancaster]] \u2013 Richard was allowed to inherit his family estates without any legal constraints. His considerable lands as [[duke of York]] meant that his wardship was a valuable gift of the crown, and in December 1423 this was sold to [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=666\u2013667}}\n\nLittle is recorded of Richard's early life.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} As a royal ward, in 1416 he was placed under the guardianship of the Lancastrian retainer Sir [[Robert Waterton]],{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} under whose tutelage he remained until 1423, in a low public profile.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=666}} Then, as ward of the Earl of Westmorland, York was brought up in the [[Neville family]] hearth, until his majority.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=667}} The earl had fathered an enormous family and had many daughters needing husbands, and, as was his right, he [[betrothal|betrothed]] the young Richard to his daughter [[Cecily Neville, Duchess of York|Cecily Neville]] (1415\u20131495). The marriage, which took place by October 1429,{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=2}} made Richard related to much of the English upper aristocracy, many of whose members had themselves married into the Neville family.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=667}} In October 1425, when Ralph Neville died, he bequeathed the wardship of York to his widow, [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} By now the wardship was even more valuable, as Richard had inherited the vast Mortimer estates on the death of the [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Earl of March]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}}\n\nOver the next few years York was drawn more closely into the circle around the young king.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} On 19 May 1426 he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] at [[Leicester]] by [[John, Duke of Bedford]], the younger brother of [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=80, 666}} He was present at the [[coronation]] of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] on 6 November 1429 in [[Westminster Abbey]], and on 20 January 1430 he acted as [[Lord High Constable of England|Constable of England]] for a [[duel]] in the presence of the king at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=2}} He then followed Henry to [[France]], being present at his coronation as [[List of French monarchs|king of France]] in [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] in 1431.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=2}} Finally, on 12 May 1432, he came into his inheritance and was granted full control of his estates.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} On 22 April 1433, York was admitted to the knightly [[Order of the Garter]].\n\n==The war in France==\nAs York reached majority, events were unfolding in [[France]] which would tie him to the events of the ongoing [[Hundred Years' War]]. In the spring of 1434, York attended a great council meeting at [[Westminster]] which attempted to conciliate the king's uncles, the dukes of [[John, Duke of Bedford|Bedford]] and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]] (heads of [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|the regency government]]), over disagreements regarding the conduct of the war in France.{{sfn|Laynesmith|2017|p=32}} [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry V's conquests in France]] could not be sustained forever, as [[Kingdom of England|England]] either needed to conquer more territory to ensure permanent French subordination, or to concede territory to gain a negotiated settlement. During [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]'s minority, his Council took advantage of French weakness and the alliance with [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to increase [[Dual monarchy of England and France|England's possessions]], but following the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] of 1435, Burgundy ceased to recognise the [[English claims to the French throne|English king's claim to the French throne]].\n\nIn May 1436, a few months after Bedford's death, York was appointed to succeed him as commander of the English forces in France.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=28}} York's appointment was one of a number of stop-gap measures after the death of Bedford to try to retain French possessions until the young [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] could assume personal rule.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=28}} His actual departure was delayed due to disagreements pertaining to the terms of his indentures. Rather than receiving the same powers Bedford had enjoyed as \"regent\", York was forced to settle for a lesser role as \"lieutenant-general and governor\", by which he was not allowed to appoint major financial and military officials.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=455}}\n\nYork landed in France on 7 June 1436, disembarking at [[Honfleur]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=29}} This was the duke's first military command.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=201}} The fall of [[Paris]] (his original destination) led to his army being redirected to [[Rouen]]. Working with Bedford's captains, York had some success, recovering many lost areas in [[Normandy]] while establishing good order and justice in [[Duchy of Normandy|the duchy]].{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=153}} The campaigns were mainly conducted by [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Talbot]], one of the leading English captains of the day, but York also played a part in stopping and reversing French advances, recapturing [[F\u00e9camp]] and a number of towns in the [[Pays de Caux]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=29}}{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}}\n\nHowever, he was dissatisfied with the terms under which he was appointed, as he had to find much of the money to pay his troops and other expenses from his own estates.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=111}} York was keen to leave France as soon as his original twelve-month term of office expired, but he was instructed to remain until the arrival of his successor, the [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], and he did not return to [[England]] until November 1437. In spite of York's position as one of the leading nobles of the realm, he was not included in [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]'s Council on his return.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=72}}\n\n==France again==\n[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] turned to York again in 1440 after peace negotiations failed. He was reappointed Lieutenant of France on 2 July, this time with the same powers that the late [[John, Duke of Bedford|Bedford]] had earlier been granted. As in 1437, York was able to count on the loyalty of Bedford's supporters, including Sir [[John Fastolf]], Sir [[William Oldhall]], and Sir [[William ap Thomas]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=459, 671}} He was promised an annual income of \u00a320,000 to support his position.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=459}} [[Cecily Neville|Duchess Cecily]] accompanied him to [[Normandy]], and his children [[Edward IV of England|Edward]], [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland|Edmund]] and [[Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk|Elizabeth]] were all born in [[Rouen]].\n\nYork reached France in 1441 and quickly moved down the [[Seine]] towards [[Pontoise]], which was [[Siege of Pontoise|besieged by the French]].{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}} Though York failed to bring the French to battle, he and [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Talbot]] \u2013 in what would be the highlight of York's military career{{sfn|Laynesmith|2017|p=41}} \u2013 led a brilliant campaign involving several river crossings around the Seine and [[Oise (river)|Oise]], chasing them almost up to the walls of Paris.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=154}} In the end, all of York's efforts were in vain, for the French took Pontoise by assault in September 1441.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=154}} This was to be York's only military action during his second lieutenancy.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}}\n\nIn 1442, York continued to hold the line in Normandy.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=462}} He signed a treaty with [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabel, duchess of Burgundy]], at [[Dijon]] on 23 April 1443, which created an indefinite truce between England and Burgundy.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=169}} Funding the war effort was becoming an increasing issue: though he was paid his annuity of \u00a320,000 in 1441\u20132, York not receive anything more from England until February 1444.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=154\u2013155}}\n\nHowever, in 1443 [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] put the newly created [[Duke of Somerset]], [[John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset|John Beaufort]], in charge of an army of 8,000 men, initially intended for the relief of [[Gascony]]. This denied York much-needed men and resources at a time when he was struggling to hold the borders of [[Normandy]]. Not only that, but the terms of Somerset's appointment could have caused York to feel that his own role as effective regent over the whole of Lancastrian France was reduced to that of governor of Normandy. The English establishment in Normandy expressed strong opposition to the measure,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=467}} but the delegation York sent to remonstrate against the decision was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=468}} Somerset's campaign itself also added to the insult: his conduct brought [[Kingdom of England|England]] to odds with the dukes of [[Francis I, Duke of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Jean II, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Alen\u00e7on]], disrupting York's attempts (conducted during 1442\u201343) to involve the English in an alliance of French nobles.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}} Somerset's army achieved nothing and eventually returned to Normandy, where Somerset died in 1444. This may have been the start of the hatred that York harboured for the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]], a resentment that would later turn into [[Wars of the Roses|civil war]].\n\nEnglish policy now turned back to a negotiated peace (or at least a [[truce]]) with France, so the remainder of York's time in France was spent in routine administration and domestic matters.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=46}} York met [[Margaret of Anjou]], the intended bride for Henry VI, on 18 March 1445 at [[Pontoise]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=46}}\n\n==Role in politics before 1450==\nYork appears to have kept a low profile in English politics before his final return to England, in 1445.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"York and English politics before 1450\"}} [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] seems to have been reluctant to employ York, who was not invited to the first royal council at the end of the regency in November 1437.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=153}}\n\n[[Image:Richarddukeofyork.gif|thumb]]\nYork returned to England on 20 October 1445 at the end of his five-year appointment in France. He must have had reasonable expectations of reappointment. However, he had become associated with the English in Normandy who were opposed to the policy of Henry VI's Council towards France, some of whom had followed him to England (for example Sir [[William Oldhall]] and Sir [[Andrew Ogard]]). Eventually (on 24 December 1446) the lieutenancy went to [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]], who had succeeded his brother John. During 1446 and 1447, York attended meetings of Henry VI's Council and of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], but most of his time was spent in administration of his estates on the [[England\u2013Wales border|Welsh border]].\n\nYork's attitude toward the Council's surrender of the French province of [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], in return for an extension of the [[Treaty of Tours|truce with France]] and [[Margaret of Anjou|a French bride]] for [[Henry VI of England|Henry]], must have contributed to his appointment on 30 July 1447 as [[List of chief governors of Ireland|Lieutenant of Ireland]]. In some ways it was a logical appointment, as Richard was also [[Earl of Ulster]] and had considerable estates in [[Ireland]], but it was also a convenient way of removing him from both [[England]] and [[France]]. His term of office was for ten years, ruling him out of consideration for any other high office during that period.\n\nDomestic matters kept him in England until June 1449, but when he did eventually leave for [[Ireland]], it was with Cecily (who was pregnant at the time) and an army of around 600 men. This suggests a stay of some time was envisaged.  However, claiming lack of money to defend English possessions, York decided to return to England. His financial state may indeed have been problematic, since by the mid-1440s he was owed \u00a338,666{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=75}} by the crown, (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|38,666|1450|r=4}}}} in current value){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and the income from his estates was declining.\n\n==Leader of the Opposition, 1450\u20131453==\n[[File: A Chronicle of England - Page 400 - Henry VI and the Dukes of York and Somerset.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (right) sitting while the Dukes of York (left) and [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Somerset]] (centre) have an argument.]]\nIn 1450, the defeats and failures of the English royal government of the previous ten years boiled over into serious political unrest. In January [[Adam Moleyns]], [[Lord Privy Seal]] and [[Bishop of Chichester]], was lynched. In May the chief councillor of the king, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], was murdered on his way into exile. The [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] demanded that the king take back many of the grants of land and money he had made to his favourites.\n\nIn June, [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]] rose in revolt. Led by [[Jack Cade]] (taking the name [[Mortimer]]), they took control of [[London]] and killed [[James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele]], the [[Lord High Treasurer]] of England. In August, the final towns held in [[Normandy]] fell to the French and refugees flooded back to England.\n\nOn 7 September, York landed at [[Beaumaris]], [[Anglesey]]. Evading an attempt by Henry to intercept him, and gathering followers as he went, York arrived in London on 27 September. After an inconclusive (and possibly violent) meeting with the king, York continued to recruit, both in [[East Anglia]] and the west. The violence in London was such that Somerset, back in England after the collapse of English Normandy, was put in the [[Tower of London]] for his own safety. In December Parliament elected York's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], Sir William Oldhall, as [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]].\n\nYork's public stance was that of a reformer, demanding better government and the prosecution of the \"traitors\" who had lost northern France. Judging by his later actions, there may also have been a more hidden motive \u2013 the destruction of Somerset, who was soon released from the Tower. York's men made several attacks on the properties and servants of the Duke of Somerset, who was to be the focus for attack in parliament. York and his ally, the Duke of Norfolk, arrived in London in November with large and threatening retinues. The London mob was mobilized to put pressure on parliament itself.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=73}} However, although granted another office, that of [[Justice in eyre|Justice of the Forest]] south of the [[River Trent|Trent]], York still lacked any real support outside Parliament and his own [[Retinue|retainers]]. In April 1451, Somerset was released from the Tower and appointed [[List of Captains, Lieutenants and Lords Deputies of English Calais|Captain of Calais]]. When one of York's councillors, [[Thomas Yonge|Thomas Young]], the [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Bristol]], proposed that York be recognised as heir to the throne, he was sent to the Tower and Parliament was dissolved.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Henry VI was prompted into belated reforms,{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=248, 252}} which went some way to restore public order and improve the royal finances. Frustrated by his lack of political power, York retired to Ludlow.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}}\n\nIn 1452, York made another bid for power, but not to become king himself. Protesting his loyalty, he aimed to be recognised as Henry VI's heir to the throne (Henry was childless after seven years of marriage), while also trying to destroy the Duke of Somerset, who Henry may have preferred to succeed him over York, as a Beaufort descendant.  Gathering men on the march from Ludlow, York headed for London to find the city gates barred against him on Henry's orders.  At [[Dartford]] in Kent, with his army outnumbered, and the support of only two of the nobility (the [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]] and [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]]), York was forced to come to an agreement with Henry. He was allowed to present his complaints against Somerset to the king, but was then taken to London and after two weeks of virtual [[house arrest]], was forced to swear an [[oath of allegiance]] at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]].\n\n==Protector of the Realm, 1453\u20131455==\nBy the summer of 1453, York seemed to have lost his power struggle.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=103}} Henry embarked on a series of judicial tours, punishing York's tenants who had been involved in the debacle at Dartford.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=83}} The [[Queen consort]], Margaret of Anjou, was pregnant, and even if she should [[Miscarriage|miscarry]], the marriage of the newly ennobled [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond]], to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]] provided for an alternative line of succession. By July, York had lost both of his offices, Lieutenant of Ireland and Justice of the Forest south of the Trent.\n\nThen, in August 1453, Henry VI suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown, perhaps brought on by the news of the defeat at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in [[Gascony]], which finally drove English forces from France.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=270}} He became completely unresponsive, unable to speak, and had to be led from room to room.  The Council tried to carry on as though the king's disability would be brief, but they had to admit eventually that something had to be done. In October, invitations for a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] were issued, and although Somerset tried to have him excluded, York (the premier duke of the realm) was included. Somerset's fears were to prove well grounded, for in November he was committed to the Tower.\n\nOn 22 March 1454, Cardinal [[John Kemp]], the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], died, making continued government in the King's name constitutionally impossible. Henry could not be induced to respond to any suggestion as to who might replace Kemp.<ref>{{cite book |last= Goodwin |date=16 February 2012 |first=George |title=Fatal Colours |url={{google books|A9EGec-o2joC|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix]] |place=London |pp=63\u201364 |isbn=978-0-7538-2817-5 |ref=harv }}</ref> Despite the opposition of Margaret of Anjou, York was appointed [[Lord Protector|Protector of the Realm]] and Chief Councillor on 27 March 1454. York's appointment of his brother-in-law, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], as Chancellor was significant. Henry's burst of activity in 1453 had seen him try to stem the violence caused by various disputes between noble families. These disputes gradually polarised around the long-standing [[Percy\u2013Neville feud]]. Unfortunately for Henry, Somerset (and therefore the king) became identified with the [[House of Percy|Percy]] cause. This drove the [[House of Neville|Neville]]s into the arms of York, who now for the first time had support among a section of the nobility.\n\n==Confrontation and aftermath, 1455\u20131456==\nAccording to the historian [[R. L. Storey|Robin Storey]]: \"If Henry's insanity was a tragedy, his recovery was a national disaster.\"{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=159}} When he recovered his reason in January 1455, Henry lost little time in reversing York's actions. Somerset was released and restored to favour.  York was deprived of the Captaincy of Calais (which was granted to Somerset once again) and of the office of Protector.  Salisbury resigned as Chancellor. York, Salisbury, and Salisbury's eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], were threatened when a Great Council was called to meet on 21 May in [[Leicester]] (away from Somerset's enemies in London). York and his Neville relations recruited in the north and probably along the Welsh border. By the time Somerset realised what was happening, there was no time to raise a large force to support the king.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOnce York took his army south of Leicester, thus barring the route to the Great Council, the dispute between him and the king regarding Somerset would have to be settled by force. On 22 May, the king and Somerset arrived at [[St Albans]] with a hastily assembled and poorly equipped army of around 2,000. York, Warwick, and Salisbury were already there with a larger and better-equipped army. More importantly, at least some of their soldiers would have had experience in the frequent border skirmishes with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the occasionally rebellious people of [[Wales]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe [[First Battle of St Albans]] that followed hardly deserves the term battle. Possibly as few as 50 men were killed, but among them were some of the prominent leaders of the Lancastrian party, such as Somerset himself, [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford]]. York and the Nevilles had therefore succeeded in killing their enemies, while York's capture of the king gave him the chance to resume the power he had lost in 1453. It was vital to keep Henry alive, as his death would have led, not to York becoming king himself, but to the minority rule of his two-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Westminster]]. Since York's support among the nobility was small, he would be unable to dominate a minority Council led by Margaret of Anjou.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the custody of York, the king was returned to London with York and Salisbury riding alongside, and with Warwick bearing the royal sword in front. On 25 May, Henry received the crown from York in a clearly symbolic display of power. York made himself [[Lord High Constable of England|Constable of England]] and appointed Warwick Captain of Calais. York's position was enhanced when some of the nobility agreed to join his government, including Salisbury's brother [[William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent|William Neville, Lord Fauconberg]], who had served under York in France.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFor the rest of the summer, York held the king prisoner, either in [[Hertford castle]] or in London (to be enthroned in Parliament in July). When Parliament met again in November, the throne was empty, and it was reported that the king was ill again. York resumed the office of Protector; although he surrendered it when the king recovered in February 1456, it seemed that this time Henry was willing to accept that York and his supporters would play a major part in the government of the realm.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSalisbury and Warwick continued to serve as councillors, and Warwick was confirmed as Captain of Calais. In June, York himself was sent north to defend [[Anglo-Scottish border|the border]] against a threatened invasion by [[James II of Scotland]]. However, the king once again came under the control of a dominant figure, this time one harder to replace than Suffolk or Somerset: for the rest of his reign, it would be the queen, Margaret of Anjou, who would control the king.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Uneasy peace, 1456\u20131459==\nAlthough Margaret of Anjou had now taken the place formerly held by Suffolk or Somerset, her position, at least at first, was not as dominant. York had his Lieutenancy of Ireland renewed, and he continued to attend meetings of the Council. However, in August 1456 the court moved to [[Coventry]], in the heart of the queen's lands. How York was treated now depended on how powerful the queen's views were. York was regarded with suspicion on three fronts: he threatened the succession of the young [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]]; he was apparently negotiating for the marriage of his eldest son Edward into the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian ruling family]]; and as a supporter of the Nevilles, he was contributing to the major cause of disturbance in the kingdom \u2013 the Percy\u2013Neville feud.\n\nHere, the Nevilles lost ground. Salisbury gradually ceased to attend meetings of the council. When his brother [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]], [[Bishop of Durham]], died in 1457, the new appointment was [[Laurence Booth]]. Booth was a member of the queen's inner circle. The Percys were shown greater favour both at court and in the struggle for power on the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Scottish border]].\n\nHenry's attempts at reconciliation between the factions divided by the killings at St Albans reached their climax with [[The Love Day]] on 25 March 1458. However, the lords concerned had earlier turned London into an armed camp, and the public expressions of amity seemed not to have lasted beyond the ceremony.\n\n==Civil war breaks out, 1459==\nIn June 1459 a Great Council was summoned to meet at [[Coventry]]. York, the Nevilles and some other lords refused to appear, fearing that the armed forces that had been commanded to assemble the previous month had been summoned to arrest them. Instead, York and Salisbury recruited in their strongholds and met Warwick, who had brought with him his troops from [[Calais]], at [[Worcester]]. [[Parliament of Devils|Parliament was summoned to meet at Coventry in November]], but without York and the Nevilles. This could only mean that they were to be accused of treason.\n\nYork and his supporters raised their armies, but they were initially dispersed throughout the country. Salisbury beat back a Lancastrian ambush at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] on 23 September 1459, while his son Warwick evaded another army under the command of the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], and afterwards they both joined their forces with York. On 11 October, York tried to move south, but was forced to head for Ludlow. On 12 October, at the [[Battle of Ludford Bridge]], York once again faced Henry just as he had at [[Dartford]] seven years earlier. Warwick's troops from Calais refused to fight, and the rebels fled \u2013 York to [[Ireland]], Warwick, Salisbury and York's son Edward to Calais.{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=31}} York's wife Cecily and their two younger sons ([[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard]]) were captured in [[Ludlow Castle]] and imprisoned at Coventry.\n\n==The wheel of fortune (1459\u20131460)==\nYork's flight worked to his advantage. He was still Lieutenant of Ireland and attempts to replace him failed.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=320}} The [[Parliament of Ireland]] backed him, providing offers of both military and financial support. Warwick's (possibly inadvertent) return to Calais also proved fortunate. His control of the [[English Channel]] meant that pro-Yorkist propaganda, emphasising loyalty to the king while decrying his wicked councillors, could be spread around [[southern England]]. Such was the Yorkists' naval dominance that Warwick was able to sail to Ireland in March 1460, meet York and return to Calais in May. Warwick's control of Calais was to prove to be influential with the wool-merchants in London.\n\nIn December 1459 York, Warwick and Salisbury suffered [[attainder]]. Their lives were forfeit, and their lands reverted to the king; their heirs would not inherit. This was the most extreme punishment a member of the nobility could suffer, and York was now in the same situation as Henry of Bolingbroke (the future King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]) in 1398. Only a successful invasion of England would restore his fortune. Assuming the invasion was successful, York had three options: become Protector again, disinherit the king's son so that York would succeed, or claim the throne for himself.\n\nOn 26 June, Warwick and Salisbury landed at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. The men of Kent rose to join them. London opened its gates to the Nevilles on 2 July. They marched north into [[the Midlands]], and on 10 July, they defeated the royal army at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] (through treachery among the king's troops), and captured Henry, whom they brought back to London.\n\nYork remained in Ireland. He did not set foot in England until 9 September, and when he did, he acted as a king. Marching under the arms of his maternal great-great-grandfather [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], he displayed a banner of the [[Coat of Arms of England]] as he approached London.\n\nA Parliament called to meet on 7 October repealed all the legislation of the Coventry parliament the previous year. On 10 October, York arrived in London and took residence in the royal palace. Entering Parliament with his sword borne upright before him, he made for the empty throne and placed his hand upon it, as if to occupy it. He may have expected the assembled peers to acclaim him as king, as they had acclaimed [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]] in 1399. Instead, there was silence. [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Thomas Bourchier]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], asked whether he wished to see the king. York replied, \"I know of no person in this realm the which oweth not to wait on me, rather than I of him.\" This high-handed reply did not impress the Lords.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=142}}\n\nThe next day, Richard advanced his claim to the crown by hereditary right in proper form. However, his narrow support among his peers led to failure once again. After weeks of negotiation, the best that could be achieved was the [[Act of Accord]], by which York and his heirs were recognised as Henry's successors. However, Parliament did grant York extraordinary executive powers to protect the realm, and made him [[Prince of Wales]] (and [[Earl of Chester]], [[Duke of Cornwall]]) and [[Lord Protector]] of England<ref name=\"books.google\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=X_4UAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA109 Act of Accord], from Davies, John S., ''An English Chronicle of the Reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI'', folios 208\u2013211 (from Googlebooks, retrieved 15 July 2013)</ref> on 31 October 1460.{{sfn|Cokayne|1959|p=908}} With the king effectively in custody, York and Warwick were the ''[[de facto]]'' rulers of the country.\n\n==Final campaign and death==\nWhile this was happening, the Lancastrian loyalists were rallying and arming in the [[Northern England|north of England]].{{sfn|Goodman|1981|pp=41\u201342}} Faced with the threat of attack from the Percys, and with Margaret of Anjou trying to gain the support of the new [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scotland]] [[James III of Scotland|James III]], York, Salisbury and York's second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], headed north on 2 December. They arrived at York's stronghold of [[Sandal Castle]] on 21 December to find the situation bad and getting worse. Forces loyal to Henry controlled the city of [[York]], and nearby [[Pontefract Castle]] was also in hostile hands. The Lancastrian armies were commanded by some of York's implacable enemies such as [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]], [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland]] and [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford|John Clifford]], whose fathers had been killed at the Battle of Saint Albans, and included several northern lords who were jealous of York's and Salisbury's wealth and influence in the North.\n\nOn 30 December, York and his forces [[sortie]]d from Sandal Castle.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=223}} Their reasons for doing so are not clear; they were variously claimed to be a result of deception by the Lancastrian forces, or treachery by northern lords who York mistakenly believed to be his allies, or simple rashness on York's part.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=143}} The larger Lancastrian force destroyed York's army in the resulting [[Battle of Wakefield]].

He inherited vast estates and served in various offices of state in [[Lordship of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], and [[Kingdom of England|England]], a country he ultimately governed as [[Lord Protector]] during the madness of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]].\n\nHis conflicts with Henry's wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]], and other members of Henry's court, as well as [[House of York#Descent from Edward III|his competing claim to the throne]], were a leading factor in the political upheaval of mid-fifteenth-century England, and a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Richard eventually attempted to take [[Throne of England|the throne]], but was dissuaded, although it was agreed that he would become king on Henry's death. But within a few weeks of securing [[Act of Accord|this agreement]], he died in [[Battle of Wakefield|battle]]. Two of his sons, [[Edward IV]] and [[Richard III]], later ascended the throne.\n\n==Descent==\n[[File:Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York (Variant).svg|thumb|Arms of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York: [[quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]], 1st and 4th: ''[[Royal arms of England]] overall a label of three points each charged with three torteaux'' (arms of his grandfather, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York]]<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]</ref><ref>Pinches, John Harvey; Pinches, Rosemary (1974), The Royal Heraldry of England, Heraldry Today, Slough, Buckinghamshire: Hollen Street Press, {{ISBN|0-900455-25-X}}</ref>), 2nd: ''[[Anscarids|Castile and Le\u00f3n]]'', 3rd, quarterly: ''[[Anne Mortimer|Mortimer]] and [[House of de Burgh|de Burgh]]'', overall an inescutcheon of ''[[Earl of Kent#Earls of Kent, sixth creation (1360)|Holland, Earl of Kent]]'']]\nRichard of York was born on 22 September 1411,{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} the son of [[Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge|Richard, Earl of Cambridge]] (1385\u20131415), and his wife [[Anne Mortimer]] (1388\u20131411). Both his parents were descended from King [[Edward III of England]] (1312\u20131377): his father was son of [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund, 1st Duke of York]] (founder of the [[House of York]]), fourth surviving son of Edward III, whereas his mother Anne Mortimer was a great-granddaughter of [[Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], Edward's second son. After the death in 1425 of Anne's childless brother [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Edmund, Earl of March]], this ancestry supplied her son Richard, of the [[House of York]], with a claim to the English throne that was arguably superior to that of the reigning [[House of Lancaster]], descended from [[John of Gaunt]], the third son of Edward III.{{sfn|Watts|2004}}\n\nRichard had an only sister, [[Isabel of York, Countess of Essex|Isabel]]. Richard's mother, Anne Mortimer, died in or shortly after his birth, and his father the Earl of Cambridge was beheaded in 1415 for his part in the [[Southampton Plot]] against the Lancastrian [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]. Within a few months of his father's death, Richard's childless uncle, [[Edward, 2nd Duke of York]], was slain at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] in 1415, and so Richard inherited Edward's title and lands, becoming 3rd [[Duke of York]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} The lesser title but greater estates of the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]], along with their claim to the throne, also descended to him on the death of his maternal uncle [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]], in 1425.\n\nRichard of York already held a strong claim to the English throne, being the [[heir general]] of Edward III while also related to the same king in a direct [[Patrilineality|male line of descent]].{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=240}} Once he inherited the vast Mortimer estates, he also became the wealthiest and most powerful noble in England, second only to the king himself.{{sfn|Pugh|2001|pp=71, 74}} An account shows that York's net income from Welsh and [[Welsh marches|marcher]] lands alone was \u00a33,430 (about \u00a3350,000 today) in the year 1443\u201344.{{sfn|Jacob|1961|pp=335, 465}}\n\n==Childhood and upbringing==\nUpon the death of the Earl of Cambridge, Richard became a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the crown.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} As he was an orphan, his property was managed by royal officials. Despite his father's plot against the king, along with his provocative ancestry \u2013 one which had been used in the past as a rallying point by enemies of the [[House of Lancaster]] \u2013 Richard was allowed to inherit his family estates without any legal constraints. His considerable lands as [[duke of York]] meant that his wardship was a valuable gift of the crown, and in December 1423 this was sold to [[Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=666\u2013667}}\n\nLittle is recorded of Richard's early life.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} As a royal ward, in 1416 he was placed under the guardianship of the Lancastrian retainer Sir [[Robert Waterton]],{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} under whose tutelage he remained until 1423, in a low public profile.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=666}} Then, as ward of the Earl of Westmorland, York was brought up in the [[Neville family]] hearth, until his majority.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=667}} The earl had fathered an enormous family and had many daughters needing husbands, and, as was his right, he [[betrothal|betrothed]] the young Richard to his daughter [[Cecily Neville, Duchess of York|Cecily Neville]] (1415\u20131495). The marriage, which took place by October 1429,{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=2}} made Richard related to much of the English upper aristocracy, many of whose members had themselves married into the Neville family.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=667}} In October 1425, when Ralph Neville died, he bequeathed the wardship of York to his widow, [[Joan Beaufort, Countess of Westmorland|Joan Beaufort]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}} By now the wardship was even more valuable, as Richard had inherited the vast Mortimer estates on the death of the [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Earl of March]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=1}}\n\nOver the next few years York was drawn more closely into the circle around the young king.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} On 19 May 1426 he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] at [[Leicester]] by [[John, Duke of Bedford]], the younger brother of [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=80, 666}} He was present at the [[coronation]] of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] on 6 November 1429 in [[Westminster Abbey]], and on 20 January 1430 he acted as [[Lord High Constable of England|Constable of England]] for a [[duel]] in the presence of the king at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=2}} He then followed Henry to [[France]], being present at his coronation as [[List of French monarchs|king of France]] in [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] in 1431.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=2}} Finally, on 12 May 1432, he came into his inheritance and was granted full control of his estates.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Youth and inheritance\"}} On 22 April 1433, York was admitted to the knightly [[Order of the Garter]].\n\n==The war in France==\nAs York reached majority, events were unfolding in [[France]] which would tie him to the events of the ongoing [[Hundred Years' War]]. In the spring of 1434, York attended a great council meeting at [[Westminster]] which attempted to conciliate the king's uncles, the dukes of [[John, Duke of Bedford|Bedford]] and [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]] (heads of [[Regency government, 1422\u20131437|the regency government]]), over disagreements regarding the conduct of the war in France.{{sfn|Laynesmith|2017|p=32}} [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|Henry V's conquests in France]] could not be sustained forever, as [[Kingdom of England|England]] either needed to conquer more territory to ensure permanent French subordination, or to concede territory to gain a negotiated settlement. During [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]'s minority, his Council took advantage of French weakness and the alliance with [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to increase [[Dual monarchy of England and France|England's possessions]], but following the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] of 1435, Burgundy ceased to recognise the [[English claims to the French throne|English king's claim to the French throne]].\n\nIn May 1436, a few months after Bedford's death, York was appointed to succeed him as commander of the English forces in France.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=28}} York's appointment was one of a number of stop-gap measures after the death of Bedford to try to retain French possessions until the young [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] could assume personal rule.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=28}} His actual departure was delayed due to disagreements pertaining to the terms of his indentures. Rather than receiving the same powers Bedford had enjoyed as \"regent\", York was forced to settle for a lesser role as \"lieutenant-general and governor\", by which he was not allowed to appoint major financial and military officials.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=455}}\n\nYork landed in France on 7 June 1436, disembarking at [[Honfleur]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=29}} This was the duke's first military command.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=201}} The fall of [[Paris]] (his original destination) led to his army being redirected to [[Rouen]]. Working with Bedford's captains, York had some success, recovering many lost areas in [[Normandy]] while establishing good order and justice in [[Duchy of Normandy|the duchy]].{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=153}} The campaigns were mainly conducted by [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Talbot]], one of the leading English captains of the day, but York also played a part in stopping and reversing French advances, recapturing [[F\u00e9camp]] and a number of towns in the [[Pays de Caux]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=29}}{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}}\n\nHowever, he was dissatisfied with the terms under which he was appointed, as he had to find much of the money to pay his troops and other expenses from his own estates.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=111}} York was keen to leave France as soon as his original twelve-month term of office expired, but he was instructed to remain until the arrival of his successor, the [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], and he did not return to [[England]] until November 1437. In spite of York's position as one of the leading nobles of the realm, he was not included in [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]]'s Council on his return.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=72}}\n\n==France again==\n[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] turned to York again in 1440 after peace negotiations failed. He was reappointed Lieutenant of France on 2 July, this time with the same powers that the late [[John, Duke of Bedford|Bedford]] had earlier been granted. As in 1437, York was able to count on the loyalty of Bedford's supporters, including Sir [[John Fastolf]], Sir [[William Oldhall]], and Sir [[William ap Thomas]].{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|pp=459, 671}} He was promised an annual income of \u00a320,000 to support his position.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=459}} [[Cecily Neville|Duchess Cecily]] accompanied him to [[Normandy]], and his children [[Edward IV of England|Edward]], [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland|Edmund]] and [[Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk|Elizabeth]] were all born in [[Rouen]].\n\nYork reached France in 1441 and quickly moved down the [[Seine]] towards [[Pontoise]], which was [[Siege of Pontoise|besieged by the French]].{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}} Though York failed to bring the French to battle, he and [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury|Lord Talbot]] \u2013 in what would be the highlight of York's military career{{sfn|Laynesmith|2017|p=41}} \u2013 led a brilliant campaign involving several river crossings around the Seine and [[Oise (river)|Oise]], chasing them almost up to the walls of Paris.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=154}} In the end, all of York's efforts were in vain, for the French took Pontoise by assault in September 1441.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=154}} This was to be York's only military action during his second lieutenancy.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}}\n\nIn 1442, York continued to hold the line in Normandy.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=462}} He signed a treaty with [[Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabel, duchess of Burgundy]], at [[Dijon]] on 23 April 1443, which created an indefinite truce between England and Burgundy.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=169}} Funding the war effort was becoming an increasing issue: though he was paid his annuity of \u00a320,000 in 1441\u20132, York not receive anything more from England until February 1444.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=154\u2013155}}\n\nHowever, in 1443 [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] put the newly created [[Duke of Somerset]], [[John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset|John Beaufort]], in charge of an army of 8,000 men, initially intended for the relief of [[Gascony]]. This denied York much-needed men and resources at a time when he was struggling to hold the borders of [[Normandy]]. Not only that, but the terms of Somerset's appointment could have caused York to feel that his own role as effective regent over the whole of Lancastrian France was reduced to that of governor of Normandy. The English establishment in Normandy expressed strong opposition to the measure,{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=467}} but the delegation York sent to remonstrate against the decision was unsuccessful.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=468}} Somerset's campaign itself also added to the insult: his conduct brought [[Kingdom of England|England]] to odds with the dukes of [[Francis I, Duke of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[Jean II, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Alen\u00e7on]], disrupting York's attempts (conducted during 1442\u201343) to involve the English in an alliance of French nobles.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"Service in France\"}} Somerset's army achieved nothing and eventually returned to Normandy, where Somerset died in 1444. This may have been the start of the hatred that York harboured for the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]], a resentment that would later turn into [[Wars of the Roses|civil war]].\n\nEnglish policy now turned back to a negotiated peace (or at least a [[truce]]) with France, so the remainder of York's time in France was spent in routine administration and domestic matters.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=46}} York met [[Margaret of Anjou]], the intended bride for Henry VI, on 18 March 1445 at [[Pontoise]].{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=46}}\n\n==Role in politics before 1450==\nYork appears to have kept a low profile in English politics before his final return to England, in 1445.{{sfn|Watts|2004|loc=\"York and English politics before 1450\"}} [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] seems to have been reluctant to employ York, who was not invited to the first royal council at the end of the regency in November 1437.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=153}}\n\n[[Image:Richarddukeofyork.gif|thumb]]\nYork returned to England on 20 October 1445 at the end of his five-year appointment in France. He must have had reasonable expectations of reappointment. However, he had become associated with the English in Normandy who were opposed to the policy of Henry VI's Council towards France, some of whom had followed him to England (for example Sir [[William Oldhall]] and Sir [[Andrew Ogard]]). Eventually (on 24 December 1446) the lieutenancy went to [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]], who had succeeded his brother John. During 1446 and 1447, York attended meetings of Henry VI's Council and of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], but most of his time was spent in administration of his estates on the [[England\u2013Wales border|Welsh border]].\n\nYork's attitude toward the Council's surrender of the French province of [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]], in return for an extension of the [[Treaty of Tours|truce with France]] and [[Margaret of Anjou|a French bride]] for [[Henry VI of England|Henry]], must have contributed to his appointment on 30 July 1447 as [[List of chief governors of Ireland|Lieutenant of Ireland]]. In some ways it was a logical appointment, as Richard was also [[Earl of Ulster]] and had considerable estates in [[Ireland]], but it was also a convenient way of removing him from both [[England]] and [[France]]. His term of office was for ten years, ruling him out of consideration for any other high office during that period.\n\nDomestic matters kept him in England until June 1449, but when he did eventually leave for [[Ireland]], it was with Cecily (who was pregnant at the time) and an army of around 600 men. This suggests a stay of some time was envisaged.  However, claiming lack of money to defend English possessions, York decided to return to England. His financial state may indeed have been problematic, since by the mid-1440s he was owed \u00a338,666{{sfn|Storey|1986|p=75}} by the crown, (equivalent to \u00a3{{formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|38,666|1450|r=4}}}} in current value){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} and the income from his estates was declining.\n\n==Leader of the Opposition, 1450\u20131453==\n[[File: A Chronicle of England - Page 400 - Henry VI and the Dukes of York and Somerset.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] (right) sitting while the Dukes of York (left) and [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Somerset]] (centre) have an argument.]]\nIn 1450, the defeats and failures of the English royal government of the previous ten years boiled over into serious political unrest. In January [[Adam Moleyns]], [[Lord Privy Seal]] and [[Bishop of Chichester]], was lynched. In May the chief councillor of the king, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]], was murdered on his way into exile. The [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] demanded that the king take back many of the grants of land and money he had made to his favourites.\n\nIn June, [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]] rose in revolt. Led by [[Jack Cade]] (taking the name [[Mortimer]]), they took control of [[London]] and killed [[James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele]], the [[Lord High Treasurer]] of England. In August, the final towns held in [[Normandy]] fell to the French and refugees flooded back to England.\n\nOn 7 September, York landed at [[Beaumaris]], [[Anglesey]]. Evading an attempt by Henry to intercept him, and gathering followers as he went, York arrived in London on 27 September. After an inconclusive (and possibly violent) meeting with the king, York continued to recruit, both in [[East Anglia]] and the west. The violence in London was such that Somerset, back in England after the collapse of English Normandy, was put in the [[Tower of London]] for his own safety. In December Parliament elected York's [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], Sir William Oldhall, as [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]].\n\nYork's public stance was that of a reformer, demanding better government and the prosecution of the \"traitors\" who had lost northern France. Judging by his later actions, there may also have been a more hidden motive \u2013 the destruction of Somerset, who was soon released from the Tower. York's men made several attacks on the properties and servants of the Duke of Somerset, who was to be the focus for attack in parliament. York and his ally, the Duke of Norfolk, arrived in London in November with large and threatening retinues. The London mob was mobilized to put pressure on parliament itself.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=73}} However, although granted another office, that of [[Justice in eyre|Justice of the Forest]] south of the [[River Trent|Trent]], York still lacked any real support outside Parliament and his own [[Retinue|retainers]]. In April 1451, Somerset was released from the Tower and appointed [[List of Captains, Lieutenants and Lords Deputies of English Calais|Captain of Calais]]. When one of York's councillors, [[Thomas Yonge|Thomas Young]], the [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Bristol]], proposed that York be recognised as heir to the throne, he was sent to the Tower and Parliament was dissolved.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}} Henry VI was prompted into belated reforms,{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|pp=248, 252}} which went some way to restore public order and improve the royal finances. Frustrated by his lack of political power, York retired to Ludlow.{{sfn|Griffiths|1981|p=692}}\n\nIn 1452, York made another bid for power, but not to become king himself. Protesting his loyalty, he aimed to be recognised as Henry VI's heir to the throne (Henry was childless after seven years of marriage), while also trying to destroy the Duke of Somerset, who Henry may have preferred to succeed him over York, as a Beaufort descendant.  Gathering men on the march from Ludlow, York headed for London to find the city gates barred against him on Henry's orders.  At [[Dartford]] in Kent, with his army outnumbered, and the support of only two of the nobility (the [[Thomas de Courtenay, 13th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]] and [[Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]]), York was forced to come to an agreement with Henry. He was allowed to present his complaints against Somerset to the king, but was then taken to London and after two weeks of virtual [[house arrest]], was forced to swear an [[oath of allegiance]] at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]].\n\n==Protector of the Realm, 1453\u20131455==\nBy the summer of 1453, York seemed to have lost his power struggle.{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=103}} Henry embarked on a series of judicial tours, punishing York's tenants who had been involved in the debacle at Dartford.{{sfn|Hicks|1998|p=83}} The [[Queen consort]], Margaret of Anjou, was pregnant, and even if she should [[Miscarriage|miscarry]], the marriage of the newly ennobled [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond]], to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]] provided for an alternative line of succession. By July, York had lost both of his offices, Lieutenant of Ireland and Justice of the Forest south of the Trent.\n\nThen, in August 1453, Henry VI suffered a catastrophic mental breakdown, perhaps brought on by the news of the defeat at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in [[Gascony]], which finally drove English forces from France.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=270}} He became completely unresponsive, unable to speak, and had to be led from room to room.  The Council tried to carry on as though the king's disability would be brief, but they had to admit eventually that something had to be done. In October, invitations for a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] were issued, and although Somerset tried to have him excluded, York (the premier duke of the realm) was included. Somerset's fears were to prove well grounded, for in November he was committed to the Tower.\n\nOn 22 March 1454, Cardinal [[John Kemp]], the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], died, making continued government in the King's name constitutionally impossible. Henry could not be induced to respond to any suggestion as to who might replace Kemp.<ref>{{cite book |last= Goodwin |date=16 February 2012 |first=George |title=Fatal Colours |url={{google books|A9EGec-o2joC|plainurl=yes}} |publisher=[[Phoenix Books|Phoenix]] |place=London |pp=63\u201364 |isbn=978-0-7538-2817-5 |ref=harv }}</ref> Despite the opposition of Margaret of Anjou, York was appointed [[Lord Protector|Protector of the Realm]] and Chief Councillor on 27 March 1454. York's appointment of his brother-in-law, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], as Chancellor was significant. Henry's burst of activity in 1453 had seen him try to stem the violence caused by various disputes between noble families. These disputes gradually polarised around the long-standing [[Percy\u2013Neville feud]]. Unfortunately for Henry, Somerset (and therefore the king) became identified with the [[House of Percy|Percy]] cause. This drove the [[House of Neville|Neville]]s into the arms of York, who now for the first time had support among a section of the nobility.\n\n==Confrontation and aftermath, 1455\u20131456==\nAccording to the historian [[R. L. Storey|Robin Storey]]: \"If Henry's insanity was a tragedy, his recovery was a national disaster.\"{{sfn|Storey|1999|p=159}} When he recovered his reason in January 1455, Henry lost little time in reversing York's actions. Somerset was released and restored to favour.  York was deprived of the Captaincy of Calais (which was granted to Somerset once again) and of the office of Protector.  Salisbury resigned as Chancellor. York, Salisbury, and Salisbury's eldest son, [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]], were threatened when a Great Council was called to meet on 21 May in [[Leicester]] (away from Somerset's enemies in London). York and his Neville relations recruited in the north and probably along the Welsh border. By the time Somerset realised what was happening, there was no time to raise a large force to support the king.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nOnce York took his army south of Leicester, thus barring the route to the Great Council, the dispute between him and the king regarding Somerset would have to be settled by force. On 22 May, the king and Somerset arrived at [[St Albans]] with a hastily assembled and poorly equipped army of around 2,000. York, Warwick, and Salisbury were already there with a larger and better-equipped army. More importantly, at least some of their soldiers would have had experience in the frequent border skirmishes with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] and the occasionally rebellious people of [[Wales]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nThe [[First Battle of St Albans]] that followed hardly deserves the term battle. Possibly as few as 50 men were killed, but among them were some of the prominent leaders of the Lancastrian party, such as Somerset himself, [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford]]. York and the Nevilles had therefore succeeded in killing their enemies, while York's capture of the king gave him the chance to resume the power he had lost in 1453. It was vital to keep Henry alive, as his death would have led, not to York becoming king himself, but to the minority rule of his two-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Edward of Westminster]]. Since York's support among the nobility was small, he would be unable to dominate a minority Council led by Margaret of Anjou.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the custody of York, the king was returned to London with York and Salisbury riding alongside, and with Warwick bearing the royal sword in front. On 25 May, Henry received the crown from York in a clearly symbolic display of power. York made himself [[Lord High Constable of England|Constable of England]] and appointed Warwick Captain of Calais. York's position was enhanced when some of the nobility agreed to join his government, including Salisbury's brother [[William Neville, 1st Earl of Kent|William Neville, Lord Fauconberg]], who had served under York in France.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nFor the rest of the summer, York held the king prisoner, either in [[Hertford castle]] or in London (to be enthroned in Parliament in July). When Parliament met again in November, the throne was empty, and it was reported that the king was ill again. York resumed the office of Protector; although he surrendered it when the king recovered in February 1456, it seemed that this time Henry was willing to accept that York and his supporters would play a major part in the government of the realm.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nSalisbury and Warwick continued to serve as councillors, and Warwick was confirmed as Captain of Calais. In June, York himself was sent north to defend [[Anglo-Scottish border|the border]] against a threatened invasion by [[James II of Scotland]]. However, the king once again came under the control of a dominant figure, this time one harder to replace than Suffolk or Somerset: for the rest of his reign, it would be the queen, Margaret of Anjou, who would control the king.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Uneasy peace, 1456\u20131459==\nAlthough Margaret of Anjou had now taken the place formerly held by Suffolk or Somerset, her position, at least at first, was not as dominant. York had his Lieutenancy of Ireland renewed, and he continued to attend meetings of the Council. However, in August 1456 the court moved to [[Coventry]], in the heart of the queen's lands. How York was treated now depended on how powerful the queen's views were. York was regarded with suspicion on three fronts: he threatened the succession of the young [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]]; he was apparently negotiating for the marriage of his eldest son Edward into the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian ruling family]]; and as a supporter of the Nevilles, he was contributing to the major cause of disturbance in the kingdom \u2013 the Percy\u2013Neville feud.\n\nHere, the Nevilles lost ground. Salisbury gradually ceased to attend meetings of the council. When his brother [[Robert Neville (bishop)|Robert Neville]], [[Bishop of Durham]], died in 1457, the new appointment was [[Laurence Booth]]. Booth was a member of the queen's inner circle. The Percys were shown greater favour both at court and in the struggle for power on the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Scottish border]].\n\nHenry's attempts at reconciliation between the factions divided by the killings at St Albans reached their climax with [[The Love Day]] on 25 March 1458. However, the lords concerned had earlier turned London into an armed camp, and the public expressions of amity seemed not to have lasted beyond the ceremony.\n\n==Civil war breaks out, 1459==\nIn June 1459 a Great Council was summoned to meet at [[Coventry]]. York, the Nevilles and some other lords refused to appear, fearing that the armed forces that had been commanded to assemble the previous month had been summoned to arrest them. Instead, York and Salisbury recruited in their strongholds and met Warwick, who had brought with him his troops from [[Calais]], at [[Worcester]]. [[Parliament of Devils|Parliament was summoned to meet at Coventry in November]], but without York and the Nevilles. This could only mean that they were to be accused of treason.\n\nYork and his supporters raised their armies, but they were initially dispersed throughout the country. Salisbury beat back a Lancastrian ambush at the [[Battle of Blore Heath]] on 23 September 1459, while his son Warwick evaded another army under the command of the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], and afterwards they both joined their forces with York. On 11 October, York tried to move south, but was forced to head for Ludlow. On 12 October, at the [[Battle of Ludford Bridge]], York once again faced Henry just as he had at [[Dartford]] seven years earlier. Warwick's troops from Calais refused to fight, and the rebels fled \u2013 York to [[Ireland]], Warwick, Salisbury and York's son Edward to Calais.{{sfn|Goodman|1990|p=31}} York's wife Cecily and their two younger sons ([[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George]] and [[Richard III of England|Richard]]) were captured in [[Ludlow Castle]] and imprisoned at Coventry.\n\n==The wheel of fortune (1459\u20131460)==\nYork's flight worked to his advantage. He was still Lieutenant of Ireland and attempts to replace him failed.{{sfn|Wolffe|2001|p=320}} The [[Parliament of Ireland]] backed him, providing offers of both military and financial support. Warwick's (possibly inadvertent) return to Calais also proved fortunate. His control of the [[English Channel]] meant that pro-Yorkist propaganda, emphasising loyalty to the king while decrying his wicked councillors, could be spread around [[southern England]]. Such was the Yorkists' naval dominance that Warwick was able to sail to Ireland in March 1460, meet York and return to Calais in May. Warwick's control of Calais was to prove to be influential with the wool-merchants in London.\n\nIn December 1459 York, Warwick and Salisbury suffered [[attainder]]. Their lives were forfeit, and their lands reverted to the king; their heirs would not inherit. This was the most extreme punishment a member of the nobility could suffer, and York was now in the same situation as Henry of Bolingbroke (the future King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]) in 1398. Only a successful invasion of England would restore his fortune. Assuming the invasion was successful, York had three options: become Protector again, disinherit the king's son so that York would succeed, or claim the throne for himself.\n\nOn 26 June, Warwick and Salisbury landed at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]]. The men of Kent rose to join them. London opened its gates to the Nevilles on 2 July. They marched north into [[the Midlands]], and on 10 July, they defeated the royal army at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] (through treachery among the king's troops), and captured Henry, whom they brought back to London.\n\nYork remained in Ireland. He did not set foot in England until 9 September, and when he did, he acted as a king. Marching under the arms of his maternal great-great-grandfather [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], he displayed a banner of the [[Coat of Arms of England]] as he approached London.\n\nA Parliament called to meet on 7 October repealed all the legislation of the Coventry parliament the previous year. On 10 October, York arrived in London and took residence in the royal palace. Entering Parliament with his sword borne upright before him, he made for the empty throne and placed his hand upon it, as if to occupy it. He may have expected the assembled peers to acclaim him as king, as they had acclaimed [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]] in 1399. Instead, there was silence. [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Thomas Bourchier]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], asked whether he wished to see the king. York replied, \"I know of no person in this realm the which oweth not to wait on me, rather than I of him.\" This high-handed reply did not impress the Lords.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=142}}\n\nThe next day, Richard advanced his claim to the crown by hereditary right in proper form. However, his narrow support among his peers led to failure once again. After weeks of negotiation, the best that could be achieved was the [[Act of Accord]], by which York and his heirs were recognised as Henry's successors. However, Parliament did grant York extraordinary executive powers to protect the realm, and made him [[Prince of Wales]] (and [[Earl of Chester]], [[Duke of Cornwall]]) and [[Lord Protector]] of England<ref name=\"books.google\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=X_4UAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA109 Act of Accord], from Davies, John S., ''An English Chronicle of the Reigns of Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI'', folios 208\u2013211 (from Googlebooks, retrieved 15 July 2013)</ref> on 31 October 1460.{{sfn|Cokayne|1959|p=908}} With the king effectively in custody, York and Warwick were the ''[[de facto]]'' rulers of the country.\n\n==Final campaign and death==\nWhile this was happening, the Lancastrian loyalists were rallying and arming in the [[Northern England|north of England]].{{sfn|Goodman|1981|pp=41\u201342}} Faced with the threat of attack from the Percys, and with Margaret of Anjou trying to gain the support of the new [[List of Scottish monarchs|King of Scotland]] [[James III of Scotland|James III]], York, Salisbury and York's second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], headed north on 2 December. They arrived at York's stronghold of [[Sandal Castle]] on 21 December to find the situation bad and getting worse. Forces loyal to Henry controlled the city of [[York]], and nearby [[Pontefract Castle]] was also in hostile hands. The Lancastrian armies were commanded by some of York's implacable enemies such as [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]], [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland]] and [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford|John Clifford]], whose fathers had been killed at the Battle of Saint Albans, and included several northern lords who were jealous of York's and Salisbury's wealth and influence in the North.\n\nOn 30 December, York and his forces [[sortie]]d from Sandal Castle.{{sfn|Johnson|1988|p=223}} Their reasons for doing so are not clear; they were variously claimed to be a result of deception by the Lancastrian forces, or treachery by northern lords who York mistakenly believed to be his allies, or simple rashness on York's part.{{sfn|Rowse|1998|p=143}} The larger Lancastrian force destroyed York's army in the resulting [[Battle of Wakefield]].

She then went to Paris and had her first exhibit on the Rue Seine in 1978. She has an extensive list of site specific murals that were commissioned by corporations and collectors.
