The match took place on 27 April 1940 at the [[Maccabiah Stadium]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. Officiated by [[John Blackwell (referee)|John Blackwell]] of the [[British Army]], the game was watched by 10,000 spectators and ended in a 5\u20131 victory for the home side.\n\nMandatory Palestine scored in the first minute of the game, doubling their lead 10 minutes later with a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]. Two more goals by the home side meant the first half ended 4\u20130. Mandatory Palestine's forced substitution at half-time due to injury hampered their control of the game and in the fifth minute of the second half, Lebanese forward [[Camille Cordahi]] scored to become Lebanon's first official international goalscorer. [[Werner Kaspi]] scored his second goal of the game in the 60th minute, with the match ending 5\u20131.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Mandatory Palestine national football team, 1940

On 2 December 1942, the first human-made self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] was initiated in CP-1, during an experiment led by [[Enrico Fermi]]. The secret development of the reactor was the first major technical achievement for the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] effort to create [[atomic bomb]]s during [[World War II]]. Although the project's civilian and military leaders had misgivings about the possibility of a disastrous runaway reaction, they trusted Fermi's safety calculations and decided they could carry out the experiment in a densely populated area. It was built by the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]], under the west viewing stands of the original [[Stagg Field]]. Fermi described the apparatus as \"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\".{{sfn|Fermi|1982|p=24}}\n\nThe reactor was assembled in November 1942, by a team that included Fermi, [[Leo Szilard]] (who had previously [[Leo Szilard#Developing the idea of the nuclear chain reaction|formulated an idea]] for [[Nuclear chain reaction#History|non-fission chain reaction]]), [[Leona Woods]], [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Walter Zinn]], [[Martin D. Whitaker]], and [[George Weil]].  The reactor used natural uranium. This required a very large amount of material in order to reach criticality, along with graphite used as a [[neutron moderator]]. The reactor contained 45,000 ultra-pure [[graphite]] blocks weighing {{convert|360|ST}}, and was fueled by {{convert|5.4|ST}} of [[uranium]] metal and {{convert|45|ST}} of [[uranium oxide]]. Unlike most subsequent nuclear reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system as it operated at very low power \u2013 about one-half watt.\n\nThe pursuit for a reactor had been touched off by concern that [[Nazi Germany]] had a substantial scientific lead. The success of Chicago Pile-1 provided the first vivid demonstration of the feasibility of the military use of nuclear energy by the Allies, and the reality of the danger that Nazi Germany could succeed in producing nuclear weapons. Previously, estimates of critical masses had been crude calculations, leading to order-of-magnitude uncertainties about the size of a hypothetical bomb. The successful use of graphite as a moderator paved the way for progress in the Allied effort, whereas [[German nuclear weapons program|the German program]] languished partly because of the belief that scarce and expensive [[heavy water]] would have to be used for that purpose.\n\nIn 1943, CP-1 was moved to [[Red Gate Woods]], and reconfigured to become Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2).

This became known as Site A. {{convert|1025|acres}} were leased from [[Cook County]] in August,{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=67\u201368}}<ref name=\"Site A\">{{cite web |url=http://fpdcc.com/site-a/ |title=Red Gate Woods: 'Site A' |publisher=Forest Preserves of Cook County |accessdate=26 November 2015 }}</ref> but by September it was apparent that the proposed facilities would be too extensive for the site, and it was decided to build the pilot plant elsewhere.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=71\u201372, 111\u2013114}} The subcritical piles posed little danger, but Groves felt that it would be prudent to locate a critical pile\u2014a fully functional nuclear reactor\u2014at a more remote site. A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:HD.5A.027 (10542723446).jpg|thumb|left|upright|CP-1 under construction: 4th layer]]\nThe risk of building an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area was a significant issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic [[nuclear meltdown]] blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even in the event of a [[Criticality accident|runaway reaction]]. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}} The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind [[fission product]]s that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total [[neutron flux]].{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107\u2013109}}{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=17}}\n\nFermi argued that by using the [[delayed neutron]]s, and by carefully controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the [[prompt neutron]]s from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or [[neutron poison]], is injected at any time during this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with [[electromechanical]] [[control system]]s such as [[control rod]]s. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety,{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107\u2013109}} and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137\u2013138}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107\u2013109}}\n\nCompton later explained that:{{quote|As a responsible officer of the University of Chicago, according to every rule of organizational protocol, I should have taken the matter to my superior. But this would have been unfair. [[Robert Maynard Hutchins|President Hutchins]] was in no position to make an independent judgment of the hazards involved.

A circle was drawn on the floor, and the stacking of graphite blocks began on the morning of 16 November 1942.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=433}} The first layer placed was made up entirely of graphite blocks, with no uranium.

There remained concerns about the ability of a graphite-moderated reactor being able to produce plutonium on industrial scale, and for this reason the Manhattan Project continued the [[P-9 Project|development of heavy water production facilities]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=191\u2013192}} An air-cooled reactor, the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]], was built at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] in Oak Ridge as part of a plutonium semiworks,{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=204\u2013205}} followed by larger water-cooled production reactors at the Hanford Site in [[Washington state]].{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=210\u2013212}} Enough plutonium was produced for an atomic bomb by July 1945, and for two more in August.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=222\u2013223}}\n\nA commemorative plaque was unveiled at Stagg Field on 2 December 1952, the occasion of the tenth anniversary of CP-1 going critical.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=26 July 1957 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/07/26/page/17/article/u-of-c-to-raze-stagg-fields-atomic-cradle |title=U. of C. to Raze Stagg Field's Atomic Cradle |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref> It read: {{quote|On December 2, 1942 man achieved here the first self-sustaining chain reaction and thereby initiated the controlled release of nuclear energy.<ref name=\"plaques\"/> }} The plaque was saved when the West Stands were demolished in August 1957.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=16 August 1957 |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1957/08/16/page/30/article/remove-nuclear-site-plaque |title=Remove Nuclear Site Plaque |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref> The site of CP-1 was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 18 February 1965.<ref name=nhl/> When the [[National Register of Historic Places]] was created in 1966, it was immediately added to that as well.<ref name=nris/> The site was also named a [[Chicago Landmark]] on 27 October 1971.<ref name=CL>{{cite web |title=Site of the First Self-Sustaining Controlled Nuclear Chain Reaction |url=http://webapps.cityofchicago.org/landmarksweb/web/landmarkdetails.htm?lanId=1383 |publisher=[[City of Chicago]] |accessdate=26 July 2013 }}</ref>\nToday the site of the old Stagg Field is occupied by the University's [[Regenstein Library]], which was opened in 1970, and the [[Joe and Rika Mansueto Library]], which was opened in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://125.uchicago.edu/then-and-now/stagg-field-mansueto-library/ |title=Stagg Field / Mansueto Library |publisher=University of Chicago |accessdate=28 November 2015}}</ref> A [[Henry Moore]] sculpture, ''[[Nuclear Energy (sculpture)|Nuclear Energy]]'', stands in a small quadrangle just outside the Regenstein Library.<ref name=nhl/> It was dedicated on 2 December 1967, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of CP-1 going critical.

On 2 December 1942, the first human-made self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] was initiated in CP-1, during an experiment led by [[Enrico Fermi]]. The secret development of the reactor was the first major technical achievement for the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] effort to create [[atomic bomb]]s during [[World War II]]. Although the project's civilian and military leaders had misgivings about the possibility of a disastrous runaway reaction, they trusted Fermi's safety calculations and decided they could carry out the experiment in a densely populated area. It was built by the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]], under the west viewing stands of the original [[Stagg Field]]. Fermi described the apparatus as \"a crude pile of black bricks and wooden timbers\".{{sfn|Fermi|1982|p=24}}\n\nThe reactor was assembled in November 1942, by a team that included Fermi, [[Leo Szilard]] (who had previously [[Leo Szilard#Developing the idea of the nuclear chain reaction|formulated an idea]] for [[Nuclear chain reaction#History|non-fission chain reaction]]), [[Leona Woods]], [[Herbert L. Anderson]], [[Walter Zinn]], [[Martin D. Whitaker]], and [[George Weil]].  The reactor used natural uranium. This required a very large amount of material in order to reach criticality, along with graphite used as a [[neutron moderator]]. The reactor contained 45,000 ultra-pure [[graphite]] blocks weighing {{convert|360|ST}}, and was fueled by {{convert|5.4|ST}} of [[uranium]] metal and {{convert|45|ST}} of [[uranium oxide]]. Unlike most subsequent nuclear reactors, it had no radiation shielding or cooling system as it operated at very low power \u2013 about one-half watt.\n\nThe pursuit for a reactor had been touched off by concern that [[Nazi Germany]] had a substantial scientific lead. The success of Chicago Pile-1 provided the first vivid demonstration of the feasibility of the military use of nuclear energy by the Allies, and the reality of the danger that Nazi Germany could succeed in producing nuclear weapons. Previously, estimates of critical masses had been crude calculations, leading to order-of-magnitude uncertainties about the size of a hypothetical bomb. The successful use of graphite as a moderator paved the way for progress in the Allied effort, whereas [[German nuclear weapons program|the German program]] languished partly because of the belief that scarce and expensive [[heavy water]] would have to be used for that purpose.\n\nIn 1943, CP-1 was moved to [[Red Gate Woods]], and reconfigured to become Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). There, it was operated until 1954, when it was dismantled and buried. The stands at Stagg Field were demolished in August 1957; the site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[Chicago Landmark]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe idea of [[chemical]] [[chain reaction]]s was first suggested in 1913 by the German chemist [[Max Bodenstein]] for a situation in which two molecules react to form not just the final reaction products, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the original substances to cause more to react.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1956 \u2013 Award Ceremony Speech |first=Arne |last=\u00d6lander |authorlink=Arne \u00d6lander |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=23 September 2015 }}</ref> The concept of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] was first hypothesized by the Hungarian scientist [[Leo Szilard]] on 12 September 1933.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=13, 28}} Szilard realized that if a nuclear reaction produced [[neutron]]s or [[dineutron]]s, which then caused further nuclear reactions, the process might be self-perpetuating.

In order for a [[self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction]] to occur, ''k'' must be at least 3 or 4 percent greater than 1.

The cans were {{convert|8|by|8|by|8|in|cm|adj=on}} cubes. When filled with uranium oxide, each weighed about {{convert|60|lb}}. There were 288 cans in all, and each was surrounded by graphite blocks so the whole would form a cubic lattice structure. A [[Neutron source#Radioisotopes which decay with alpha particles packed in a low-Z elemental matrix|radium-beryllium neutron source]] was positioned near the bottom. The uranium oxide was heated to remove moisture, and packed into the cans while still hot on a shaking table. The cans were then soldered shut. For a workforce, Pegram secured the services of Columbia's [[American football|football]] team. It was the custom at the time for football players to perform odd jobs around the university. They were able to manipulate the heavy cans with ease. The final result was a disappointing ''k'' of 0.87.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=396\u2013397}}{{sfn|Anderson|1975|pp=86\u201387}}\n\nCompton felt that having teams at Columbia University, [[Princeton University]], the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided on his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399\u2013400}} Chicago also had a central location, and scientists, technicians and facilities were more readily available in the [[Midwest]], where war work had not yet taken them away.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|pp=399\u2013400}} In contrast, Columbia University was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts under Harold Urey and John Dunning, and was hesitant to add a third secret project.{{sfn|Anderson|1975|p=88}}\n\nBefore leaving for Chicago, Fermi's team made one last attempt to build a working pile at Columbia. Since the cans had absorbed neutrons, they were dispensed with. Instead, the uranium oxide, heated to {{convert|480|F|C|round=10|order=flip}} to dry it out, was pressed into cylindrical holes {{convert|3|in|cm}} long and {{convert|3|in|cm}} in diameter drilled into the graphite. The entire pile was then canned by soldering sheet metal around it, and the contents heated above the boiling point of water to remove moisture.

A building at Argonne to house Fermi's experimental pile was commenced, with its completion scheduled for 20 October. Due to industrial disputes, construction fell behind schedule, and it became clear the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed. In early November, Fermi came to Compton with a proposal to build the experimental pile under the stands at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:HD.5A.027 (10542723446).jpg|thumb|left|upright|CP-1 under construction: 4th layer]]\nThe risk of building an operational reactor running at criticality in a populated area was a significant issue, as there was a danger of a catastrophic [[nuclear meltdown]] blanketing one of the United States' major urban areas in radioactive fission products. But the physics of the system suggested that the pile could be safely shut down even in the event of a [[Criticality accident|runaway reaction]]. When a fuel atom undergoes fission, it releases neutrons that strike other fuel atoms in a chain reaction.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}} The time between absorbing the neutron and undergoing fission is measured in nanoseconds. Szilard had noted that this reaction leaves behind [[fission product]]s that may also release neutrons, but do so over much longer periods, from microseconds to as long as minutes. In a slow reaction like the one in a pile where the fission products build up, these neutrons account for about three percent of the total [[neutron flux]].{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107\u2013109}}{{sfn|Weinberg|1994|p=17}}\n\nFermi argued that by using the [[delayed neutron]]s, and by carefully controlling the reaction rates as the power is ramped up, a pile can reach criticality at fission rates slightly below that of a chain reaction relying solely on the [[prompt neutron]]s from the fission reactions. Since the rate of release of these neutrons depends on fission events taking place some time earlier, there is a delay between any power spikes and the later criticality event. This time gives the operators leeway; if a spike in the prompt neutron flux is seen, they have several minutes before this causes a runaway reaction. If a neutron absorber, or [[neutron poison]], is injected at any time during this period, the reactor will shut down. Consequently, the reaction can be controlled with [[electromechanical]] [[control system]]s such as [[control rod]]s. Compton felt this delay was enough to provide a critical margin of safety,{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107\u2013109}} and allowed Fermi to build Chicago Pile-1 at Stagg Field.{{sfn|Compton|1956|pp=137\u2013138}}{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=107\u2013109}}\n\nCompton later explained that:{{quote|As a responsible officer of the University of Chicago, according to every rule of organizational protocol, I should have taken the matter to my superior.

[[code page]]. It is derived from, but does not conform to, [[ISO/IEC 646]]; more specifically, it follows [[ASCII]] except for the lowercase letters and backtick (<code>`</code>), which are replaced by the naturally ordered [[Hebrew alphabet]]. It is also known as '''DEC Hebrew (7-bit)''', because [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] standardized this character set before it became an international standard.<ref name=\"Kennelly_1991_DEC\"/> [[Kermit (protocol)|Kermit]] named it '''hebrew-7''' and '''HEBREW-7'''.<ref name=\"Kermit_Charsets\"/><ref name=\"Kermit_Hebrew\"/>\n\nThe [[Hebrew alphabet]] is mapped to positions 0x60\u20130x7A, on top of the lowercase Latin letters (and grave accent for aleph). 7-bit Hebrew is stored in visual order.\n\nThis mapping with the high bit set, i.e. with the Hebrew letters in 0xE0\u20130xFA, is also reflected in [[ISO 8859-8]].\n\n==Code page layout==\n\n{|{{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|SI 960<ref

The opposition movement turned political party, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]), questioned the fairness of the election.  Because neither the MPLA nor UNITA obtained the required absolute majority of the presidential election, a follow-up election was necessary according to the constitution.\n\n==Events==\nAs both sides heightened war rhetoric, the MPLA attacked UNITA positions in Luanda.

She lives in Sydney with her son and daughter. Her leisure activities include learning to play the cello<ref name=\"bio\"/> and performing in an amateur orchestra.\n\n==Career==\n\nKate Grenville's reputation as a short story writer was made by the publication in 1984 of her collection ''[[Bearded Ladies]]''.<ref name = \"Whitlock2\">Whitlock (1989), p. 2.</ref> On its publication, [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]] wrote \"Here is someone who can really write\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n''[[Lilian's Story]]'' was her first published novel (1985) and won [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]]. It was loosely based on the story of [[Bea Miles]], known in Sydney for her eccentric public behaviour.<ref>{{cite web | first=Kate | last=Grenville | title =The Novelist as Barbarian | publisher =[[National Library of Australia]] | url =http://www.nla.gov.au/events/history/papers/Kate_Grenville%20.html | accessdate = 2015-07-12}}</ref> It has become one of Australia's best-loved novels and in 1996 was made into a film starring [[Ruth Cracknell]] and [[Toni Collette]]; Collette won the [[Australian Film Institute]] [[AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|award for supporting actress]] for her performance as the young Lilian.\n\n''[[Dreamhouse (novel)|Dreamhouse]]'' followed in 1986, and appeared as the 1994 film ''[[Traps (1994 film)|Traps]]''. ''[[Joan Makes History]]'' \u2013 the recipient of an Australian Bicentennial Commission \u2013 was published in 1988.\n\nIn 1994 Grenville returned to the characters and setting of ''Lilian's Story'' with a companion novel \u2013 ''[[Dark Places (Grenville novel)|Dark Places]]'' \u2013 that re-tells the events of the earlier novel from the point of view of Lilian's incestuous father. ''Dark Places'' won the [[Victorian Premier's Literary Award]] in 1995. (In the US this novel is titled ''Albion's Story''.)\n\n''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' appeared in 2000 and won the Orange Prize for Fiction, at the time Britain's richest literary award.\n\nIn 2006 ''[[The Secret River]]'' was published, the first of Grenville's books that take Australia's colonial past, and relations with Australia's indigenous people, as their subject. ''The Secret River'' was inspired by the story of Grenville's own great-great-great grandfather, a [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] sent to Australia from London in 1806.  This book won the Commonwealth Prize,<ref>Richard Lea, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/08/news.awardsandprizes \"Kate Grenville to meet the Queen\"], ''The Guardian'', 8 May 2006.</ref> the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Christina Stead Prize for Fiction|Christina Stead Award]], and the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Community Relations Commission Award|NSW Premier's Community Relations Prize]], and was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n''Searching for The Secret River'' (2006) is a memoir about the research and writing of the novel, tracing the journey of the author's increasing awareness of how Australia's colonial past informs its present.\n\n''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008) is set thirty years earlier than ''The Secret River''. Based on the historical notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (British Marines officer)|William Dawes]], it tells the story of the friendship between a soldier with the [[First Fleet]] and a young [[Gadigal]] girl.  These two novels together explore something of the complexity of black-white relations in Australia's past.\n\n''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'' (2011) is the sequel to ''The Secret River'' and takes up the story of William Thornhill's youngest daughter. It can be read as a stand-alone novel, without reference to ''The Secret River''.\n\nHer latest book is ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', in which Grenville uses the fragments of memoir that her mother left to construct the story of a woman whose life - in some ways typical of her times, in other ways remarkable - spanned a century of tumult and dramatic change.\n\nGrenville has also written or co-written several books about the writing process which are widely used in creative writing workshops and in schools and universities: ''The Writing Book'', ''Writing from Start to Finish'', and ''Making Stories'' (co-written with [[Sue Woolfe]]).\n\nGrenville has been awarded fellowships from the International Association of University Women and from the Literary Arts Board of the [[Australia Council]].<ref name = \"Whitlock2\"/> Her novels have all been published in the UK and US as well as Australia and have been translated into many languages, including German, Swedish, French, Hebrew and Chinese.\n\n==Style and subject matter==\n\nGrenville's early fiction presented characters trying to free themselves from social and gender stereotypes.  ''Bearded Ladies'' is a collection of short stories about women trying to free themselves from the gender stereotypes of their society.\n\n''Lilian's Story'', set in the early 20th century, takes as its subject a woman who rejects her middle-class background and the conventional future that is expected of her, and instead chooses to live as a street person, making a living by offering recitations from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. At the end of her life she declares joyously: \"Drive on, George. I am ready for whatever comes next.\"\n\n''Joan Makes History'' is a satirical re-writing of Australia's history, foregrounding the women rather than the men. Joan is an Everywoman character who in various guises lives through all the iconic moments of Australia's past. She \"makes history\" both by simply living her life, and by (re)making history by writing it.\n\n''Dreamhouse'' is a black comedy about a marriage on the rocks. It explores themes of both men and women freeing themselves from stereotypes to accept their true selves. Both partners in the marriage are attracted to their own sex: the wife is prepared to acknowledge that and act on it while the husband refuses to.\n\n''The Idea of Perfection'' is about people haunted by the impossible ideal  of perfection. The two main characters are both middle-aged and frumpish, and consider themselves unlovably flawed.  The journey they make is to recognise that to be \"imperfect\" is simply to be human, and carries its own power. As the epigraph from [[Leonardo da Vinci]] asserts: \"An arch is two weaknesses that together make a strength\".\n\n''The Secret River'' is set in early 19th-century Australia and is based on the story of one of Grenville's convict ancestors, [[Solomon Wiseman]], a London boatman transported for theft.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Secret River|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|work=One Hundred exhibition|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=25 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207193245/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|archive-date=7 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> She takes that story as a means of exploring a wider theme: the dark legacy of [[colonialism]], especially its impact on Australia's Aboriginal peoples. The title comes from the anthropologist [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W. E. H. Stanner]], who wrote about a \"secret river of blood flowing through Australia's history\": the story of white Australia's relationship with the Aboriginal people.\n\nGrenville has written a memoir of the research and writing of ''The Secret River'', entitled ''Searching for the Secret River''.\n\n''The Lieutenant'' is the story of one of the very earliest moments of black-white relationship in Australia, at the time of first settlement in 1788. Based on a historical source \u2013 the [[Gadigal]]-language notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (Royal Marines officer)|William Dawes]] \u2013 the novel tells the story of a unique friendship. In learning the Gadigal language from a young girl, Dawes wrote down word-for-word parts of their conversations. Grenville has used these fragments as the basis for a novel exploring how it might be possible for two people to reach across the gulfs of language and culture that separate them, and arrive at a relationship of mutual warmth and respect. She has described it as a \"mirror-image\" of ''The Secret River.''\n\n''Sarah Thornhill'' is a sequel to ''The Secret River''.  It tells the story of one of the children of the main character in the earlier book. Sarah Thornhill grows up knowing nothing of the dark secret in her family's past, and when she has to confront it, the direction of her life and her thinking is changed.  It's a story about secrets and lies, and how to deal with a dark legacy from the past. Grenville has said that the book is set in the 19th century, but is as much about the ugly secrets in Australian history that her own generation inherited.\n\nThese three books form a loose trilogy \u2013 \"The Colonial Trilogy\" \u2013 about the first three generations of white settlement in Australia, and what that shared black/white history means for contemporary Australians.  The themes of the three books reach beyond Australia: all are widely read in other countries where colonialism has left a problematic legacy.\n\nGrenville frequently does extensive research for her novels, often using historical or other sources as the starting-point for the work of the imagination. She says of her books that they are \"sometimes inspired by historical events, but they are imaginative constructs, not an attempt to write history\".<ref name=\"PE\"/>\n\nSome years after her mother died, Grenville put together a book about her, based on the memoirs and recordings her mother left.  The result is ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', a book about a woman born in 1912 who rode the waves of tumultuous change that happened over the course of her life.\n\nGrenville's most recent non-fiction book is about the health problems that can be caused by the synthetic fragrances that are all around us: ''The Case Against Fragrance''.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA) in 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr Kate Grenville FAHA|url=https://www.humanities.org.au/our-fellows/fellows/?find_contact_id=3029&section_select=0&fellowType_select=0&bio_search&name_search=grenville&membership_since_search&country_search=0&state_search=0|website=Australian Academy of the Humanities|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of New South Wales]]<ref name=about/> in 2010\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Sydney<ref name=about>{{Cite web |url = http://kategrenville.com/biography |title = About Kate Grenville |accessdate = 27 November 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141225095143/http://kategrenville.com/biography |archivedate = 25 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> in 2012\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from [[Macquarie University]] in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mq.edu.au/newsroom/2013/04/19/celebrated-australian-writer-kate-grenville-receives-an-honorary-doctorate/|title = Celebrated Australian writer Kate Grenville receives an honorary doctorate|date = 19 April 2013|accessdate = 27 November 2014|website = |publisher = Macquarie University|last = |first = }}</ref>\n* The Dixson Medal awarded by the [[Library Council of New South Wales]] in 2014<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |title = 2014 Honours of the Library Council of New South Wales |accessdate = 12 July 2015 |publisher = State Library of New South Wales |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171927/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |archivedate = 1 May 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Prizes===\n* 1984 \u2013 [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]] for ''Lilian's Story''\n* 1995 \u2013 [[Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction|Victorian Premier's Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction]] for ''Dark Places''<ref>http://www.literaryawards.com.au/victorianpremiers.html</ref>\n* 2001 \u2013 [[Orange Prize for Fiction]] for ''[[The Idea of Perfection]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for ''[[The Secret River]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Christina Stead Prize for fiction for ''The Secret River''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Community Relations Commission Award for ''The Secret River''\n\n===Shortlisted===\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[The Secret River]]'' \u2013 [[Miles Franklin Award]] and the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Short story collections===\n*''Bearded Ladies:Stories'' (1984) {{ISBN|0-7022-1716-6}}\n\n===Novels===\n*''Lilian's Story'' (1985), {{ISBN|1-86448-284-2}}\n*''Dreamhouse'' (1986), {{ISBN|0-7022-1959-2}}\n*''Joan Makes History: A Novel'' (1988), {{ISBN|0-7022-2174-0}}\n*''Dark Places'' (1994), {{ISBN|0-330-33549-9}} (alternative title: ''Albion's Story'')\n*''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' (1999)\n*''[[The Secret River]]'' (2005)\n*''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'', sequel to ''The Secret River'', (2011)\n*''A Room Made of Leaves'' (2020)<ref>[https://www.goodreadingmagazine.com.au/latestnews/kate-grenville-new-2020.html \"Kate Grenville releasing new book, A Room Made of Leaves, in 2020\"], ''Good Reading''.</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''The Writing Book: A Manual for Fiction Writers'' (1990), {{ISBN|0-04-442124-9}}\n*''Making Stories: How Ten Australian Novels Were Written'' (1993), with Woolfe, Sue {{ISBN|1-86373-316-7}}\n*''Writing from Start to Finish: a Six-Step Guide'' (2001)\n*''Searching for the Secret River'' (2006), {{ISBN|1-921145-39-0}}\n*''One Life: My Mother's Story'' (2015), {{ISBN|978-1-922182-05-0}}\n*''The Case Against Fragrance'' (2017), {{ISBN|978-1-925355-95-6}}.\n\n===Translations===\nGrenville's work has appeared in: Swedish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Czech, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Norwegian, Greek,  Mandarin and Japanese.<!--unsure why this list is here in such a vague way: which books appeared in which languages?

She lives in Sydney with her son and daughter. Her leisure activities include learning to play the cello<ref name=\"bio\"/> and performing in an amateur orchestra.\n\n==Career==\n\nKate Grenville's reputation as a short story writer was made by the publication in 1984 of her collection ''[[Bearded Ladies]]''.<ref name = \"Whitlock2\">Whitlock (1989), p. 2.</ref> On its publication, [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]] wrote \"Here is someone who can really write\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n''[[Lilian's Story]]'' was her first published novel (1985) and won [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]]. It was loosely based on the story of [[Bea Miles]], known in Sydney for her eccentric public behaviour.<ref>{{cite web | first=Kate | last=Grenville | title =The Novelist as Barbarian | publisher =[[National Library of Australia]] | url =http://www.nla.gov.au/events/history/papers/Kate_Grenville%20.html | accessdate = 2015-07-12}}</ref> It has become one of Australia's best-loved novels and in 1996 was made into a film starring [[Ruth Cracknell]] and [[Toni Collette]]; Collette won the [[Australian Film Institute]] [[AACTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|award for supporting actress]] for her performance as the young Lilian.\n\n''[[Dreamhouse (novel)|Dreamhouse]]'' followed in 1986, and appeared as the 1994 film ''[[Traps (1994 film)|Traps]]''. ''[[Joan Makes History]]'' \u2013 the recipient of an Australian Bicentennial Commission \u2013 was published in 1988.\n\nIn 1994 Grenville returned to the characters and setting of ''Lilian's Story'' with a companion novel \u2013 ''[[Dark Places (Grenville novel)|Dark Places]]'' \u2013 that re-tells the events of the earlier novel from the point of view of Lilian's incestuous father. ''Dark Places'' won the [[Victorian Premier's Literary Award]] in 1995. (In the US this novel is titled ''Albion's Story''.)\n\n''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' appeared in 2000 and won the Orange Prize for Fiction, at the time Britain's richest literary award.\n\nIn 2006 ''[[The Secret River]]'' was published, the first of Grenville's books that take Australia's colonial past, and relations with Australia's indigenous people, as their subject. ''The Secret River'' was inspired by the story of Grenville's own great-great-great grandfather, a [[Convicts in Australia|convict]] sent to Australia from London in 1806.  This book won the Commonwealth Prize,<ref>Richard Lea, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/08/news.awardsandprizes \"Kate Grenville to meet the Queen\"], ''The Guardian'', 8 May 2006.</ref> the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Christina Stead Prize for Fiction|Christina Stead Award]], and the [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards#Community Relations Commission Award|NSW Premier's Community Relations Prize]], and was shortlisted for the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n''Searching for The Secret River'' (2006) is a memoir about the research and writing of the novel, tracing the journey of the author's increasing awareness of how Australia's colonial past informs its present.\n\n''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008) is set thirty years earlier than ''The Secret River''. Based on the historical notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (British Marines officer)|William Dawes]], it tells the story of the friendship between a soldier with the [[First Fleet]] and a young [[Gadigal]] girl.  These two novels together explore something of the complexity of black-white relations in Australia's past.\n\n''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'' (2011) is the sequel to ''The Secret River'' and takes up the story of William Thornhill's youngest daughter. It can be read as a stand-alone novel, without reference to ''The Secret River''.\n\nHer latest book is ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', in which Grenville uses the fragments of memoir that her mother left to construct the story of a woman whose life - in some ways typical of her times, in other ways remarkable - spanned a century of tumult and dramatic change.\n\nGrenville has also written or co-written several books about the writing process which are widely used in creative writing workshops and in schools and universities: ''The Writing Book'', ''Writing from Start to Finish'', and ''Making Stories'' (co-written with [[Sue Woolfe]]).\n\nGrenville has been awarded fellowships from the International Association of University Women and from the Literary Arts Board of the [[Australia Council]].<ref name = \"Whitlock2\"/> Her novels have all been published in the UK and US as well as Australia and have been translated into many languages, including German, Swedish, French, Hebrew and Chinese.\n\n==Style and subject matter==\n\nGrenville's early fiction presented characters trying to free themselves from social and gender stereotypes.  ''Bearded Ladies'' is a collection of short stories about women trying to free themselves from the gender stereotypes of their society.\n\n''Lilian's Story'', set in the early 20th century, takes as its subject a woman who rejects her middle-class background and the conventional future that is expected of her, and instead chooses to live as a street person, making a living by offering recitations from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. At the end of her life she declares joyously: \"Drive on, George. I am ready for whatever comes next.\"\n\n''Joan Makes History'' is a satirical re-writing of Australia's history, foregrounding the women rather than the men. Joan is an Everywoman character who in various guises lives through all the iconic moments of Australia's past. She \"makes history\" both by simply living her life, and by (re)making history by writing it.\n\n''Dreamhouse'' is a black comedy about a marriage on the rocks. It explores themes of both men and women freeing themselves from stereotypes to accept their true selves. Both partners in the marriage are attracted to their own sex: the wife is prepared to acknowledge that and act on it while the husband refuses to.\n\n''The Idea of Perfection'' is about people haunted by the impossible ideal  of perfection. The two main characters are both middle-aged and frumpish, and consider themselves unlovably flawed.  The journey they make is to recognise that to be \"imperfect\" is simply to be human, and carries its own power. As the epigraph from [[Leonardo da Vinci]] asserts: \"An arch is two weaknesses that together make a strength\".\n\n''The Secret River'' is set in early 19th-century Australia and is based on the story of one of Grenville's convict ancestors, [[Solomon Wiseman]], a London boatman transported for theft.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Secret River|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|work=One Hundred exhibition|publisher=State Library of NSW|accessdate=25 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207193245/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/events/exhibitions/2010/onehundred/100-objects/Exhibit-097.htm|archive-date=7 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> She takes that story as a means of exploring a wider theme: the dark legacy of [[colonialism]], especially its impact on Australia's Aboriginal peoples. The title comes from the anthropologist [[William Edward Hanley Stanner|W. E. H. Stanner]], who wrote about a \"secret river of blood flowing through Australia's history\": the story of white Australia's relationship with the Aboriginal people.\n\nGrenville has written a memoir of the research and writing of ''The Secret River'', entitled ''Searching for the Secret River''.\n\n''The Lieutenant'' is the story of one of the very earliest moments of black-white relationship in Australia, at the time of first settlement in 1788. Based on a historical source \u2013 the [[Gadigal]]-language notebooks of Lieutenant [[William Dawes (Royal Marines officer)|William Dawes]] \u2013 the novel tells the story of a unique friendship. In learning the Gadigal language from a young girl, Dawes wrote down word-for-word parts of their conversations. Grenville has used these fragments as the basis for a novel exploring how it might be possible for two people to reach across the gulfs of language and culture that separate them, and arrive at a relationship of mutual warmth and respect. She has described it as a \"mirror-image\" of ''The Secret River.''\n\n''Sarah Thornhill'' is a sequel to ''The Secret River''.  It tells the story of one of the children of the main character in the earlier book. Sarah Thornhill grows up knowing nothing of the dark secret in her family's past, and when she has to confront it, the direction of her life and her thinking is changed.  It's a story about secrets and lies, and how to deal with a dark legacy from the past. Grenville has said that the book is set in the 19th century, but is as much about the ugly secrets in Australian history that her own generation inherited.\n\nThese three books form a loose trilogy \u2013 \"The Colonial Trilogy\" \u2013 about the first three generations of white settlement in Australia, and what that shared black/white history means for contemporary Australians.  The themes of the three books reach beyond Australia: all are widely read in other countries where colonialism has left a problematic legacy.\n\nGrenville frequently does extensive research for her novels, often using historical or other sources as the starting-point for the work of the imagination. She says of her books that they are \"sometimes inspired by historical events, but they are imaginative constructs, not an attempt to write history\".<ref name=\"PE\"/>\n\nSome years after her mother died, Grenville put together a book about her, based on the memoirs and recordings her mother left.  The result is ''One Life: My Mother's Story'', a book about a woman born in 1912 who rode the waves of tumultuous change that happened over the course of her life.\n\nGrenville's most recent non-fiction book is about the health problems that can be caused by the synthetic fragrances that are all around us: ''The Case Against Fragrance''.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n* Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities (FAHA) in 2008<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr Kate Grenville FAHA|url=https://www.humanities.org.au/our-fellows/fellows/?find_contact_id=3029&section_select=0&fellowType_select=0&bio_search&name_search=grenville&membership_since_search&country_search=0&state_search=0|website=Australian Academy of the Humanities|accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of New South Wales]]<ref name=about/> in 2010\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from the University of Sydney<ref name=about>{{Cite web |url = http://kategrenville.com/biography |title = About Kate Grenville |accessdate = 27 November 2014 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141225095143/http://kategrenville.com/biography |archivedate = 25 December 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> in 2012\n* Honorary Doctorate of Letters from [[Macquarie University]] in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://mq.edu.au/newsroom/2013/04/19/celebrated-australian-writer-kate-grenville-receives-an-honorary-doctorate/|title = Celebrated Australian writer Kate Grenville receives an honorary doctorate|date = 19 April 2013|accessdate = 27 November 2014|website = |publisher = Macquarie University|last = |first = }}</ref>\n* The Dixson Medal awarded by the [[Library Council of New South Wales]] in 2014<ref>{{citation |url = http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |title = 2014 Honours of the Library Council of New South Wales |accessdate = 12 July 2015 |publisher = State Library of New South Wales |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150501171927/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/about/awards/library_honours/2014_library_honours_recipients.html |archivedate = 1 May 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Prizes===\n* 1984 \u2013 [[The Australian/Vogel Literary Award]] for ''Lilian's Story''\n* 1995 \u2013 [[Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction|Victorian Premier's Vance Palmer Prize for Fiction]] for ''Dark Places''<ref>http://www.literaryawards.com.au/victorianpremiers.html</ref>\n* 2001 \u2013 [[Orange Prize for Fiction]] for ''[[The Idea of Perfection]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] for ''[[The Secret River]]''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Christina Stead Prize for fiction for ''The Secret River''\n* 2006 \u2013 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]], Community Relations Commission Award for ''The Secret River''\n\n===Shortlisted===\n* 2006 \u2013 ''[[The Secret River]]'' \u2013 [[Miles Franklin Award]] and the [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Short story collections===\n*''Bearded Ladies:Stories'' (1984) {{ISBN|0-7022-1716-6}}\n\n===Novels===\n*''Lilian's Story'' (1985), {{ISBN|1-86448-284-2}}\n*''Dreamhouse'' (1986), {{ISBN|0-7022-1959-2}}\n*''Joan Makes History: A Novel'' (1988), {{ISBN|0-7022-2174-0}}\n*''Dark Places'' (1994), {{ISBN|0-330-33549-9}} (alternative title: ''Albion's Story'')\n*''[[The Idea of Perfection]]'' (1999)\n*''[[The Secret River]]'' (2005)\n*''[[The Lieutenant (novel)|The Lieutenant]]'' (2008)\n*''[[Sarah Thornhill]]'', sequel to ''The Secret River'', (2011)\n*''A Room Made of Leaves'' (2020)<ref>[https://www.goodreadingmagazine.com.au/latestnews/kate-grenville-new-2020.html \"Kate Grenville releasing new book, A Room Made of Leaves, in 2020\"], ''Good Reading''.</ref>\n\n===Non-fiction===\n*''The Writing Book: A Manual for Fiction Writers'' (1990), {{ISBN|0-04-442124-9}}\n*''Making Stories: How Ten Australian Novels Were Written'' (1993), with Woolfe, Sue {{ISBN|1-86373-316-7}}\n*''Writing from Start to Finish: a Six-Step Guide'' (2001)\n*''Searching for the Secret River'' (2006), {{ISBN|1-921145-39-0}}\n*''One Life: My Mother's Story'' (2015), {{ISBN|978-1-922182-05-0}}\n*''The Case Against Fragrance'' (2017), {{ISBN|978-1-925355-95-6}}.\n\n===Translations===\nGrenville's work has appeared in: Swedish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, Czech, Bulgarian, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Norwegian, Greek,  Mandarin and Japanese.<!--unsure why this list is here in such a vague way: which books appeared in which languages?
