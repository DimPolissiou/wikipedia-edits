This watercourse flows through [[Regional County Municipality]] from:\n* [[Charlevoix-Est]]: unorganized territory of [[Mont-\u00c9lie, Quebec|Mont-\u00c9lie]] (Lacoste township), municipalities of [[Saint-Aim\u00e9-des-Lacs, Quebec|Saint-Aim\u00e9-des-Lacs]] and [[Notre-Dame-des-Monts]];\n* [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]: unorganized territory of [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pibauka]] ([[Zec des Martres]]), municipality of [[Saint-Urbain (Quebec)|Saint-Urbain]] and town of [[Baie-Saint-Paul]].\n\nThis hydrographic slope has 185 lakes and 35 tributaries. The [[Zec des Martres]] attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year, particularly because of its mountain trails offering splendid views of the Gouffre River Valley, as well as sport fishing.\n\n== Hydrology ==\nThe Gouffre River has its source at Lac du C\u0153ur (length: {{convert|1.0|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude: {{convert|823| m}}),<ref name = \"Rivi\u00e8reGouffre\">[http://www.rivieredugouffre.qc.ca / Gouffre River Site]</ref> in the County of Charlevoix West, in the [[Zec des Martres]] which is located east of the [[Grands-Jardins National Park]] and west of [[Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivi\u00e8re-Malbaie National Park]].

From this water separation line, the Malbaie River bypasses the valley of the rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre in a clockwise direction, to flow to [[La Malbaie]] in the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The hydrographic slope of the Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre stretches inland up to {{convert|47.6|km}} northwest of the mouth of the river.\n\nThe Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre flows towards the Southwest for a total distance of {{convert|76.1|km|mi|abbr=on}} before reaching the [[St. Lawrence River|Saint-Laurent]] at [[Baie-Saint-Paul]]. Its course runs along the western boundary of the municipality of [[Notre-Dame-des-Monts]] and crosses [[Saint-Urbain (Quebec)|Saint-Urbain]].

At the confluence of the river, the strike is long {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast at low tide. In addition to the confluence of the Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre, the main rivers flowing over this strike are (from west to east): Verreault Creek, [[Rivi\u00e8re du Moulin (Baie-Saint-Paul)]], Middle Creek, Vases River, Rang Saint-Laurent Creek, Lucien Creek and Bois Blanc Creek.\n\nThe watershed of the Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre covers {{convert|1010|km|2}}. Its main tributaries are the [[Le Gros Bras (Gouffre River tributary)|Le Gros Bras]], [[rivi\u00e8re des Mares]] and the [[rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre Sud-Ouest]]. The total slope of the river is {{convert|686|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n== Toponymy ==\nThe river Gouffre was named by [[Samuel de Champlain]] in 1608.<ref>[http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/CT/toposweb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=25997 Website of the Commission of toponymy of Quebec]</ref> Its name refers to the whirlpool that forms at the foot of Cap aux Corbeaux, downstream from the confluence of the river Gouffre, and which was a source of terror for sailors.\n\nThe toponme \"Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the [[Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec]].<ref>[http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/Fiche.aspx?no_seq=25997 Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: \"Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre\"].</ref>\n\n== Recreational tourism activities ==\nThe Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre is an Atlantic salmon fishing river and a trout.<ref name=\"Rivi\u00e8reGouffre\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, sport fishermen in the Quebec region frequented these waters, which had and still have the reputation of offering large salmon. The population of this species can vary in number significantly from one year to the next. Since 1979, the Association of Conservation of the Valley of the Gouffre (ACVG) manages the salmon fishery. This non-profit organization was formed on March 20, 1979, thanks to the grouping of some forty members. In spring 1979, 100 salmon pits are inventoried in the Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre. Since then, the ACVG has built 65 of these pits. Pedestrian paths run along the river; picnic tables and shelters have been set up. Two bridges span the river allowing fishermen access to all salmon pits.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|title=Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre SaumonQuebec.com Federation managers of salmon rivers in Quebec (FGRSQ)|url=https://www.saumonquebec.com/dugouffre| website = www.saumonquebec.com| date =| accessdate =2016-07-17}}</ref>\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pibauka]], a [[unorganized territory|TNO]]\n* [[Mont-\u00c9lie, Quebec|Mont-\u00c9lie]], a TNO\n* [[Saint-Aim\u00e9-des-Lacs, Quebec|Saint-Aim\u00e9-des-Lacs]], a municipality\n* [[Notre-Dame-des-Monts]], a municipality\n* [[Saint-Urbain (Quebec)|Saint-Urbain]], a municipality\n* [[Baie-Saint-Paul]], a city\n* [[Cap-aux-Corbeaux]]\n* [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n* [[St. Lawrence River]]\n* [[Grands-Jardins National Park]]\n* [[Zec des Martres]], a harversted controlled zone\n* [[List of rivers of Quebec]]\n\n{{commons category|Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre}}\n{{GeoGroup}}\n== External links ==\n{{Portal bar|Capitale-Nationale|Rivers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gouffre, river du}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Capitale-Nationale]]\n[[Category:Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox river\n| name = Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre\n| name_native        = \n| name_native_lang   = \n| name_other         = \n| name_etymology     = \n<!---------------------- IMAGE & MAP -->\n| image              = Riviere_Gouffre.JPG\n| image_caption      = The Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre at [[Baie-Saint-Paul]].\n| map                = \n| map_size           = \n| map_caption        = \n| pushpin_map        = \n| pushpin_map_size   = \n| pushpin_map_caption= \n<!---------------------- LOCATION -->\n| subdivision_type1  = Country\n| subdivision_name1  = [[Canada]]\n| subdivision_type2  = Province\n| subdivision_name2  = [[Quebec]]\n| subdivision_type3  = Region\n| subdivision_name3  = [[Capitale-Nationale]]\n| subdivision_type4  = Regional County Municipality\n| subdivision_name4  = [[Charlevoix Regional County Municipality]]\n| subdivision_type5  = City\n| subdivision_name5  = [[Baie-Saint-Paul]]\n<!---------------------- PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS -->\n| length             = {{convert|76.1|km|mi|abbr=on}}<ref name=Toponymy>{{cite web|url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/toposweb/Fiche.aspx?no_seq=25997|title=Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre, Bank of Quebec place names|website=Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec|accessdate= June 11, 2010}}</ref>\n| width_min          = \n| width_avg          = \n| width_max          = \n| depth_min          = \n| depth_avg          = \n| depth_max          = \n| discharge1_location= [[Baie-Saint-Paul]]\n| discharge1_min     = \n| discharge1_avg     = \n| discharge1_max     = \n<!---------------------- BASIN FEATURES -->\n| source1            = Lac du C\u0153ur\n| source1_location   = [[Lac-Pikauba, Quebec|Lac-Pikauba]]\n| source1_coordinates= {{coord|47.848478|-70.567861|display=inline}}\n| source1_elevation  = {{convert|823|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n| mouth              = [[St. Lawrence River]]\n| mouth_location     = [[La Malbaie]]\n| mouth_coordinates  = {{coord|47.75528|69.95361|display=inline,title}}\n| mouth_elevation    = {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n| progression        = \n| river_system       = \n| basin_size         = {{convert|1010|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}\n| tributaries_left   = (from the mouth) Ruisseau du rang Saint-Laurent, ruisseau Gobeil, ruisseau de la Goudronnerie, ruisseau aux rats musqu\u00e9s,  ruisseau du Cap Martin, d\u00e9charge du Lac \u00e0 la Mine, [[rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 La Loutre (Gouffre River tributary)]],  [[rivi\u00e8re de Chicago]], d\u00e9charge du Lac aux Brochets,  ruisseau des Bouliane,  ruisseau des Bergeron, d\u00e9charge du Lac Nice.\n| tributaries_right  = (from the mouth) [[Bras du Nord-Ouest (Gouffre River tributary)|Bras du Nord-Ouest]], [[rivi\u00e8re \u00e0 Renaud]], [[rivi\u00e8re de la Mare]], [[rivi\u00e8re R\u00e9my]], [[Le Gros Bras (Gouffre River tributary)|Le Gros Bras]], ruisseau des Cygnes, ruisseau \u00e0 l'Emp\u00eache, [[rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre Sud-Ouest]], d\u00e9charge du Lac Boudreau,  [[rivi\u00e8re des \u00celets (Gouffre River tributary)]].\n| custom_label       = \n| custom_data        = \n| extra              = \n}}\nThe '''Rivi\u00e8re du Gouffre''' is a tributary of the left bank of the [[Saint-Laurent river]], flowing into the [[Capitale-Nationale]] administrative region, [[Quebec]] ([[Canada]]).
