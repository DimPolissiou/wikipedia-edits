Amaya becomes Owlette (an [[owl]]), Greg becomes Gekko (a [[lizard]]), and Connor becomes Catboy (a [[cat]]).\n\n==Characters==\n===PJ Masks===\n'''PJ Masks''' (known as \"PJs\" for short) is the titular superhero team that fights crime at night to keep it from ruining people's days. Their catchphrase when planning to go fight their enemies is \"PJ Masks, we're on our way. Into the night, to save the day!\" Their base is hidden in a totem-like structure in the park, called their \"HQ\", which also houses a crystal that grants them their abilities. When the villains are defeated, their victory catchphrase is \"PJ Masks, all shout hooray, 'cause in the night, we saved the day!\" Among its members and allies are:\n\n====Members====\n* Connor / Catboy (voiced by [[Jacob Ewaniuk]] in Season 1, Jacob Ursomarzo in Season 2-\"Best Friends Forever\", and Roman Lutterotti in \"Meet An Yu\"-present) \u2013 Connor is a blue-eyed boy with brown hair. When he transforms, he wears a blue [[cat]] costume with cat ears and a thin feline tail.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy and the Shrinker|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm not that little, and I can still be your leader.}}</ref> He has super-hearing using Cat Ears, can leap high and far using Super Cat Jump (or \"Super Cat Leap\"), and sprints fast using Super Cat Speed,<ref name=ep2>{{cite episode|series=PJ Masks|number=2}}</ref> or just Super Speed.<ref name=SuperMS>{{cite episode|title=Owlette and the Moonball|series=PJ Masks|minutes=21|quote=We need to play as a team. Gekko, use your Super Muscles, Catboy, use your Super Speed, and I'll use my Owl Wing Wind!}}</ref> Starting in season 2, he also has Super Cat Stripes. When on a mission, he sometimes likes to narrate his actions. His main flaws are his [[impulsiveness]] and his need to control, flaws that can be exploited by the team's opponents. He is the only member of the team that [[Aquaphobia|hates water]]. His vehicle is the Cat Car, which is located in the middle segment of the PJ Masks' tower. It can launch blue hairballs at any obstacle. His bedroom is on the second floor of a blue-roofed blue-doored house next to Amaya's house. Unlike Amaya and Greg, Connor is the only one without a pet.\n** Kitten Boy (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo in \"Terrible Two-Some\", Roman Lutterotti in \"Big Sister Motsuki\") \u2013 The baby-fied version of Catboy who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Unlike Chicklette, he acts like a [[kitten]]. Whenever he uses his super cat speed, he exclaims \u201cSuper Cat Speed, and whoosh!\u201d He and Chicklette returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Amaya / Owlette (voiced by [[Addison Holley]]) \u2013 Amaya is a brown-eyed girl who wears red glasses, as well as PJ Masks' only female member besides An Yu. She has dark brown hair with a pink, wing-shaped hair clip. When she transforms, she wears a red [[owl]] costume with a dark red [[facial disc]] and a cape made of artificial feathers (dubbed her \"Super Owl Wings\"), which helps her fly. She also loses her glasses and presumably wears contact lenses. Her eyes also become an intense, blood-red color that matches her suit. She has Owl Eyes that let her see things that are far away up close, and she also has Super Owl Wing Wind, or just Owl Wing Wind (She also occasionally has super strength). Starting in season 2, she also has Super Owl Feathers, which sometimes form a Super Feather Shield. Despite being a member of PJ Masks, as well as being as adorable and likable as her teammates, she is also rude and unlikable at times (most notably in \"Glowy Moths\", where she even teamed up with Luna to get revenge on Romeo). While she doesn't mind water as Amaya, as seen in \"Catboy's Cloudy Crisis\", she is rarely soaked as Owlette. But when she is, the feathers on her suit get really soggy.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy's Two Wheeled Wonder|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm okay. But he got all my feathers wet.}}</ref> During PJ Masks Takeover Weekend on Disney Junior, she is revealed to also be the smartest member of the team. Her vehicle is the Owl-Glider, which can also do a \"Super Owl Wing Wind\". It is located in the top segment of the PJ Masks' tower. Her bedroom is on the third floor of a red-roofed red-doored home with a walled-in yard between Connor and Greg's houses. Amaya owns a bird named Birdie. Despite the fact that she is Connor's best friend, she flirts with him for convincing him to give the extra ticket to her (much to Greg/Gekko's chagrin) in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\". Owlette is male in the books.\n** Chicklette (also voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Owlette who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Whenever she uses her super owl wing wind, she exclaims \u201cSuper Owly Wingy-Wind!\u201d She and Kitten Boy returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Greg / Gekko (voiced by [[Kyle Harrison Breitkopf]] in Season 1-Season 3 and the short films and [[Claire Corlett]] in \"HQ Tour\" and Season 4-present) \u2013 Greg is a green-eyed, blonde-haired boy. When he transforms, he wears a green [[lizard]] costume with a thick reptilian tail and fins on top of his head. His powers are: Super Gekko Camouflage to go invisible or blend into the environment around him, Super Gekko Muscles (aka Super Muscles<ref name=SuperMS/>) to lift heavy things, like the HQ, Super Lizard Grip to climb walls or anchor himself to stop vehicles, and Super Lizard Water Run to walk on water.<ref name=ep2/> He has exhibited enough strength to lift a mobile laboratory (namely Romeo's) off the ground. Starting in season 2, he also has Super Lizard Shields, which can create shields. He is the only semi-aquatic member of the PJ Masks. His vehicle is the Gekko-Mobile, which is also a submersible vehicle that can travel underwater and can also ride up & over buildings via land on tank treads; it is slower than the Cat-Car. His vehicle is located in the bottom segment of the PJ Masks' tower. The vehicle has abilities similar to him, with a \"Gekko-Mobile Camouflage\" letting it blend in with surroundings. His bedroom is on the second floor of a green-roofed green-doored house next to Amaya's. Greg has a gecko named Lionel. In seasons 1\u20132, an ongoing joke about how he \"can't think of a rhyme\" was finished in \"Pirates Ahoy!\" when he sang with Owlette/Amaya, where they were singing about each other and he thought of a rhyme for the relationship of them both in that segment. It is hinted that he has a slim crush on Amaya/Owlette, but some fans believe that he has a crush on Luna Girl. He is also Connor's best friend and is treated like a little brother.\n** Baby Gekko (voiced by Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Gekko who appeared in \"Big Sister Motsuki\". Unlike the other baby PJs, he is the only one who never speaks by himself and usually only speaks in unison with the other babies. However, at one point, he did say \"Muscle Wuscles!\" when he used his Super Gekko Muscles.\n* PJ Robot (voiced by Juan Luis Bonilla) \u2013 A robot that Romeo created to infiltrate the PJ Masks HQ. However, PJ Robot decided to be a PJ Mask rather than a villain's sidekick. He joined the PJ Masks Team in Season 2. He spends most of his time inside HQ as mission control for the PJ Masks. He doesn't speak much, but when he does, it usually comes out as robotic gibberish that only the PJ Masks and Romeo can understand. He is the creator of the PJ Seeker.\n\n====Allies====\n* Teeny Weeny Ninjalino (actor unknown) \u2013 A tiny and cute ninja from \"Catboy and the Teeny Weeny Ninjalino\", who was supposed to spy on the PJ Masks but won Owlette and Gekko's affection. Catboy (who was too quick to judge him, but later became his friend after being unstuck from the Owl Glider by him) kept wanting to get rid of him, and convinced his teammates to do so as well. He returned in \"Race Up Mystery Mountain\", where he mostly interacted with Gekko. In \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\", Teeny turned on his master. But in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\" he returned to his master's side.\n** The Splat Monster (actor unknown) \u2013 The alternate form Teeny took in the episode of the same name, where he turned into a Splat Monster when he touched the transforming splat in the Mystery Mountain cave. The Teeny Weeny Ninjalino was restored to normal by An Yu. This form returned in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\" and again in \"The Disappearing Ninjas.\"\n* Armadylan (voiced by Max Calinescu in Season 2-\"Armadylan Zen\", Christian Perri in \"Arma-Leader\"-present) \u2013 An [[armadillo]]-like boy who wants to be a hero, but his being inexperienced causes him to mess up. He first meets the PJ Masks in \"Meet Armadylan\" and became an official member of the PJ Masks team in the episode \"PJ Dylan\". Armadylan's powers are his Thunder Thump to shake the ground, super strength to lift any heavy objects, like Gekko, the Rolling Thunder to roll himself up into a ball to attack his opponents and he can also dig to go underneath the ground. He is mostly mistaken by Romeo and Night Ninja for an anteater and/or an aardvark instead of an armadillo. He has a crush on either Rip or Octobella.\n* Captain Smartypants (voiced by Carter Thorne) \u2013 A young scientist who is the good version of Romeo. He helps Gekko change his teammates back to normal before Robot changes him back to his usual, evil self in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\".\n* An Yu (voiced by Kari Wong) \u2013 A samurai girl who uses her bo staff as a weapon or to fly; it also turns into a magic flute. She also turned out to be the human form of the Dragon from the Dragon Gong, as hinted by the gold dragon head on her headdress. She first appears in her human form in the season 3 episode \"Meet An Yu\". An Yu was a loner{{snd}}she attempted to face Night Ninja (from the episode \"Meet An Yu\") alone without the PJ Masks{{snd}}but they helped her out anyway, and she has occasionally helped them out in return. An Yu's powers mostly work on Mystery Mountain, and she can't use her magic flute in the town either, as seen in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\".\n*Lionel (actor unknown) \u2013 a small gekko who is the pet of Gekko, he normally appeared when the PJ Masks are transforming. He then had a major role in \"Lionel-saurs.\" when Romeo made him huge.\n*[[Santa Claus|Santa ]](voiced by [[Ron Pardo]]) - Santa is the jolly man who appeared in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" where he teamed up with the PJ Masks to stop Romeo from running [[Christmas]]. He appears with a long beard and was not as fat as the other adaptations of him.\n* Newton (actor unknown at the moment) \u2013 An upcoming character who is set to appear in season 4, and was first seen in a storyboard video for the season's 14th episode. He has star powers. He is likely to be the first hero to appear in both daytime and nighttime.\n\n===Villains===\n* Romeo (voiced by Alex Thorne in Season 1, Carter Thorne in the short films and Season 2-\"Owlette Slips Up\", Simon Pirso in \"Motsuki the Best\"-present) \u2013 The main villain in the series. He is a childish scientist who comes up with a variety of inventions and dislikes the PJ Masks, who always foil his plans. He also dislikes the other villains such as Luna Girl and Night Ninja, who he trapped in \"Romeo's Disguise\", although they did team up in \"PJ Masks vs. Bad Guys United.\" He also dislikes it when his servants disobey him. His favorite inventions (as said in \"Owlette's New Move\") are Robot, his Laboggan (which is his mobile lab, with skis in place of [[Continuous track|Caterpillar]] tracks), Super Train, and Radical Romeo Remote. From \"Blame it on the Train, Owlette\" to \"The Prank Wheelz\", he originally controlled a mobile Lab on land, but now controls his flying Sky Factory starting in \"Villain of the Sky\". He always tries to take over the world and defeat the PJs but regularly fails. Once, though, he took over the city, turning it into Romeo-aplolis in \"Gekko and the Mayhem at the Museum\". He did once help the PJ Masks in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" when he realised how much Robot cares for him despite the rotten things he has done. Even though he may be evil, Robot mentions that there is good in Romeo deep down.\n** Robots - Romeo's mechanical henchmen.\n*** Robot (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A large [[robot]], Romeo's personal servant and his buddy as Romeo mentions it in \" Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage.\". He has acted on his own,  when Romeo invented Robette and when he captured Armadylan, Despite Romeo replacing him, Robot shows that he still cares for his master and is always willing to help him. Robot's main weakness is water, as it causes him to short-circuit and be paralyzed. Whenever this happens he often says \"Robots hate water.\"\n*** Robette (actor unknown) \u2013 One of Romeo's inventions. She began to try to take over the world herself in \"Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage\". This was due to a loose screw caused by Owlette and was later resolved. During the episode, Romeo's original Robot became jealous of Robette, and ran away. This was also later resolved, and Romeo became friends with Robot again. Robette returned in the Season 2 episode \"PJ Robot\". In \"Armadylan and Robette Rule\", she ends up as Armadylan's sidekick but then went back to Romeo.\n*** Toolbox \u2013 A walking toolbox who works with Romeo, and in case of making inventions Toolbox carries Romeo's tools.\n*** Spy-Bot \u2013 A cubical bot that works for Romeo, who often used Spy-Bot to spy on the PJ Masks.\n*** Fly Bots \u2013 Small, flying robots which resemble PJ Robot before he reformed and regularly guard Romeo's Sky Factory.\n*** Naughty Bots - Naughty Bots are robots disguised as [[Gift| presents]], but they destroy everything related to [[Christmas|Christmas]] \u2013 like presents and Christmas decorations\n*** Robo-PJ Masks - As the robotic versions of the PJ Masks, they all have the same powers but with the addition of Laser Eyes which stops the enemies from moving.\n* Luna Girl (a.k.a. Luna) (voiced by Brianna Daguanno) \u2013 The second villain in the series who is also the first villainess. She is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] girl who lives on the [[Moon]] in her Lunar Fortress with her little sister Motsuki and their moths, but in \"Best Friends Forever\", it is revealed that her Luna Magnet powers give her the power to breathe in space. Her main weapons are her Luna Magnet and Luna Board that she uses as a mode of transportation. However, she also had a lot of other weapons; this once included a giant Moon-Ball, which could steal objects and swallow her enemies and the small Moon Ball, which turns the person who touches it to servants. She teamed with PJ Masks while defeating Romeo in some episodes when it came to him threatening the Moon or using her stolen lunar crystal. Starting in Season 3, she is persistently nicknamed Luna, rather than being called by her full name. In \"Gekko Saves Christmas\", she is shown to develop a crush on Gekko and at the end, they team up to put Christmas right. In \u201cBest Friends Forever\u201d at the end of the episode (like Gekko Saves Christmas), and she also joins the PJ Masks victory! She also helps the PJ Masks in \u201cPJ Party Crasher\u201d when Motsuki try to ruin Owlette\u2019s pajama party and was even invited to her slumber party. Also, she and Romeo team up in \u201cPJ Masks VS Bad Guy United\u201d when Romeo allied with Night Ninja and Luna Girl to defeat the PJs forever and in \u201cPJ Comet\u201d when Romeo and Luna Girl work together to Trap the PJ Masks in a fake comet and try to build a Villain HQ! But although being a villain towards the PJ Masks, Luna Girl is shown to have a good side sometimes that some fans believe that she will turn good and ally with them more often.\n** Moths \u2013 A swarm of [[Moth|moths]] who work for Luna.  They also have the ability to fly on the moon.\n*** Motsuki (voiced by Hattie Kragten) \u2013 The first moth to go to the moon with Luna Girl and receive her own powers from her mistress in \"Moon Madness\". Previously nicknamed \"Moth\" and \"Hench-Moth\" by Catboy, Luna was originally going to call her either \"Mothena\" or \"Motherella\", but eventually stuck with \"Motsuki\". Motsuki has the power to sense someone in the Lunar Fortress and can also shoot moon beams from her antennas to trap her victims in a purple bubble. Thanks to the PJ Masks' bad vibes, she later turns into a more anthropomorphic and more powerful, moth-like insectoid girl after hatching from a strange crystal on the moon in \"Moth on the Moon\", as intended by Luna. Following her transformation, she is given the power of speech and has a smaller crystal on her chest that has the same purpose as Luna's Luna Magnet. Despite this, she also becomes much less loyal to Luna, who now sees her as a younger sister, and enjoys annoying her, but she still loves her either way. She also has the tendency to occasionally make high-pitched squeaking noises really often. In \"Minding Motsuki\", she appears to be more loyal towards Gekko than towards Luna, as she treats her like a baby while he treats her like she's a guest.\n* Night Ninja (voiced by Trek Buccino in Season 1, Devan Cohen in the short films and Season 2-\"Do the Gekko\" and Jacob Soley in \"Armadylan, Action Hero\"-present) \u2013 Night Ninja, as his name suggests, is a [[ninja]] who rarely gets into battle as he makes his Ninjalinos do all his work and is the third villain of the series. He and Romeo have occasionally teamed up: in \"Catboy and the Shrinker\", when Romeo needed someone to help operate his shrink ray; and in \"Wacky Floats\" where they stole the parade floats and plotted to transform them into Robot Floats. In both episodes, they always argued and disagreed with each other. He did help the PJs twice in \"Wolfy Mountain\" and in \u201cWerejalinos\u201d to stop the Wolfies, from taking control of the Mystery Mountain and in \"The  Disappearing Ninjas\" when Romeo stole his Ninjalinos and invade Mystery Mountain. His main weapon is Sticky Splat which he normally uses to trap his opponents, he also uses [[Smoke bomb|smoke bombs]] to teleport to place to another.\n* Ninjalinos (actors unknown) \u2013 The minions of Night Ninja. They are small purple ninjas that talk in their own, unintelligible language (though Night Ninja does seem to understand them). Their numbers increased from episode to episode, from as few as three to well over a dozen. They sometimes get along well with the PJ Masks, much to their boss' chagrin.\n** Marvin (actor unknown) \u2013 A Ninjalino who was named. He appeared in \"Wolfy Mountain\" and \"Werejalinos\"\n** Daisy (actor unknown) \u2013 A female Ninjalino who was named. She appeared in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\".\n* The Wolfy Kids (usually referred to as \"the Wolfies\") \u2013 A trio of [[werewolf]] siblings who like to cause mischief. They ride in their car they call the \"Wolf Wheelz\". They may have been inspired by Les Mascrapules (lit. the Masked Scoundrels), a trio of villain kids from the books who also like to mess around and do as they please! They and The PJ Masks team up to defeat Luna Girl in two episode. They are show in \"Arma-Leader\" to be good after all since they help the PJs to rescue Armadylan and also another teaming with the PJs in \u201cWolfy Powers\u201d when Romeo stole the PJ Masks's powers and the Wolfies help them to retrieve their PJ powers.\n** Rip (voiced by Shechinah Mpumlwana) \u2013 The female member and leader of the Wolfy Kids who is the second villainess in the series. She has dark magenta hair with light tips and bone-shaped hair clips.\n** Howler (voiced by Kaden Stephen) \u2013 A male member of the Wolfy Kids, with white streak in his black hair.\n** Kevin (voiced by Ethan Pugiotto) \u2013 A male and younger member of the Wolfy Kids, always nicer than his brother and sister. He is a friend of Gekko.\n***Wolf Wheelz \u2013 The car of the Wolfy Kids. Originally three scooters used by the humanoid wolves, it transformed into a car in \"The Moon Prix\" as a result of being exposed to moon energy. In \"Where's the Wolf Wheelz?\", it is revealed that the car has a mind of its own.\n* Night [[Panthera|Panther]] (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo) \u2013 The evil version of Catboy who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". He also has the same powers like Catboy, like his Super Cat Stripes, only he calls it Night Panther Stripes.\n* Dark [[Owl]] (voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The evil version of Owlette who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". Like Night Panther, she has the same powers as her couterpart, like Dark Owl Feathers which are like Owlette's Owl Feathers.\n* Octobella (voiced by Simon Pirso) \u2013 Another upcoming character for season 4 who, as her name suggests, will be an [[octopus]]-themed villain, as well as the series' third villainess (yet despite being set to debut in season 4, one of her tentacles can be seen in the end of \"Gekko Everywhere\"). She was leaked in a now-removed storyboard video for an upcoming episode for season 4, titled \"Octobella's Garden\". Since the storyboard video for said episode is no longer available for viewing online, it was unknown on what Octobella will look like until \"Gekko Everywhere\", when one of her tentacles was seen grabbing the Teleporting Crystal; it was light green with a hint of orange at the base. Besides that, her other half is currently unseen, so your best bet is to wait until \"Octobella's Garden\" (or whatever episode she'll first fully appear in) comes out. One other thing about her that we do know, however, is that she has a beautiful singing voice which is enough to attract Armadylan and make him fall in love with her.\n** Percival \u2013 Octobella's [[hermit crab]] sidekick.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Cameron (voiced by Tristan Samuel in Season 1, Jonah Wineberg in Season 2, Tyler Nathan in Season 3-present) \u2013 A boy in the same class as PJ Masks when they attend school during the day as civilians. He once scared Amaya with a T-Rex cutout the same way Connor did earlier in \"Owlette's Terrible Pterodactyl Trouble\", but Connor learned his lesson and tells Cameron not to do it. In \"Catboy's Cuddly\", he was revealed to have a sister (named Marie as of \"PJ Party Crasher\"), who attends the same school.\n* Teacher (voiced by [[Robert Tinkler|Rob Tinkler]]) \u2013 An unnamed adult male who teaches Connor, Greg, and Amaya's class. When things disappear, he thinks it's strange.\n* Jayden Houston \u2013 A popular singer, known for his golden microphone. It was stolen by Luna Girl in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\", but was later recovered by the PJ Masks.\n* Master Fang (actor unknown) \u2013 The protagonist of his own comic book and TV series. Greg and Connor generally looked up to him, but Amaya doesn't seem to care about him much. He is known for his signature sword that was stolen by Night Ninja in \"Catboy and Master Fang's Sword\".\n** Kick McGee \u2013 Master Fang's unseen sidekick. His persona is often used during missions.\n* Flossy Flash \u2013 A female comic book superhero, looked up to by Owlette and Armadylan. Owlette prefers her over Master Fang and Kick McGee, who are favored by Catboy and Gekko.\n* The Announcer (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A male voice that is heard in every episode as the day becomes night.

Amaya becomes Owlette (an [[owl]]), Greg becomes Gekko (a [[lizard]]), and Connor becomes Catboy (a [[cat]]).\n\n==Characters==\n===PJ Masks===\n'''PJ Masks''' (known as \"PJs\" for short) is the titular superhero team that fights crime at night to keep it from ruining people's days. Their catchphrase when planning to go fight their enemies is \"PJ Masks, we're on our way. Into the night, to save the day!\" Their base is hidden in a totem-like structure in the park, called their \"HQ\", which also houses a crystal that grants them their abilities. When the villains are defeated, their victory catchphrase is \"PJ Masks, all shout hooray, 'cause in the night, we saved the day!\" Among its members and allies are:\n\n====Members====\n* Connor / Catboy (voiced by [[Jacob Ewaniuk]] in Season 1, Jacob Ursomarzo in Season 2-\"Best Friends Forever\", and Roman Lutterotti in \"Meet An Yu\"-present) \u2013 Connor is a blue-eyed boy with brown hair. When he transforms, he wears a blue [[cat]] costume with cat ears and a thin feline tail.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy and the Shrinker|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm not that little, and I can still be your leader.}}</ref> He has super-hearing using Cat Ears, can leap high and far using Super Cat Jump (or \"Super Cat Leap\"), and sprints fast using Super Cat Speed,<ref name=ep2>{{cite episode|series=PJ Masks|number=2}}</ref> or just Super Speed.<ref name=SuperMS>{{cite episode|title=Owlette and the Moonball|series=PJ Masks|minutes=21|quote=We need to play as a team. Gekko, use your Super Muscles, Catboy, use your Super Speed, and I'll use my Owl Wing Wind!}}</ref> Starting in season 2, he also has Super Cat Stripes. When on a mission, he sometimes likes to narrate his actions. His main flaws are his [[impulsiveness]] and his need to control, flaws that can be exploited by the team's opponents. He is the only member of the team that [[Aquaphobia|hates water]]. His vehicle is the Cat Car, which is located in the middle segment of the PJ Masks' tower. It can launch blue hairballs at any obstacle. His bedroom is on the second floor of a blue-roofed blue-doored house next to Amaya's house. Unlike Amaya and Greg, Connor is the only one without a pet.\n** Kitten Boy (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo in \"Terrible Two-Some\", Roman Lutterotti in \"Big Sister Motsuki\") \u2013 The baby-fied version of Catboy who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Unlike Chicklette, he acts like a [[kitten]]. Whenever he uses his super cat speed, he exclaims \u201cSuper Cat Speed, and whoosh!\u201d He and Chicklette returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Amaya / Owlette (voiced by [[Addison Holley]]) \u2013 Amaya is a brown-eyed girl who wears red glasses, as well as PJ Masks' only female member besides An Yu. She has dark brown hair with a pink, wing-shaped hair clip. When she transforms, she wears a red [[owl]] costume with a dark red [[facial disc]] and a cape made of artificial feathers (dubbed her \"Super Owl Wings\"), which helps her fly. She also loses her glasses and presumably wears contact lenses. Her eyes also become an intense, blood-red color that matches her suit. She has Owl Eyes that let her see things that are far away up close, and she also has Super Owl Wing Wind, or just Owl Wing Wind (She also occasionally has super strength). Starting in season 2, she also has Super Owl Feathers, which sometimes form a Super Feather Shield. Despite being a member of PJ Masks, as well as being as adorable and likable as her teammates, she is also rude and unlikable at times (most notably in \"Glowy Moths\", where she even teamed up with Luna to get revenge on Romeo). While she doesn't mind water as Amaya, as seen in \"Catboy's Cloudy Crisis\", she is rarely soaked as Owlette. But when she is, the feathers on her suit get really soggy.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Catboy's Two Wheeled Wonder|series=PJ Masks|quote=I'm okay. But he got all my feathers wet.}}</ref> During PJ Masks Takeover Weekend on Disney Junior, she is revealed to also be the smartest member of the team. Her vehicle is the Owl-Glider, which can also do a \"Super Owl Wing Wind\". It is located in the top segment of the PJ Masks' tower. Her bedroom is on the third floor of a red-roofed red-doored home with a walled-in yard between Connor and Greg's houses. Amaya owns a bird named Birdie. Despite the fact that she is Connor's best friend, she flirts with him for convincing him to give the extra ticket to her (much to Greg/Gekko's chagrin) in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\". Owlette is male in the books.\n** Chicklette (also voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Owlette who appeared in \"Terrible Two-Some\". Whenever she uses her super owl wing wind, she exclaims \u201cSuper Owly Wingy-Wind!\u201d She and Kitten Boy returned in \"Big Sister Motsuki\".\n* Greg / Gekko (voiced by [[Kyle Harrison Breitkopf]] in Season 1-Season 3 and the short films and [[Claire Corlett]] in \"HQ Tour\" and Season 4-present) \u2013 Greg is a green-eyed, blonde-haired boy. When he transforms, he wears a green [[lizard]] costume with a thick reptilian tail and fins on top of his head. His powers are: Super Gekko Camouflage to go invisible or blend into the environment around him, Super Gekko Muscles (aka Super Muscles<ref name=SuperMS/>) to lift heavy things, like the HQ, Super Lizard Grip to climb walls or anchor himself to stop vehicles, and Super Lizard Water Run to walk on water.<ref name=ep2/> He has exhibited enough strength to lift a mobile laboratory (namely Romeo's) off the ground. Starting in season 2, he also has Super Lizard Shields,which can create sheids . He is the only semi-aquatic member of the PJ Masks. His vehicle is the Gekko-Mobile, which is also a submersible vehicle that can travel underwater and can also ride up & over buildings via land on tank treads; it is slower than the Cat-Car. His vehicle is located in the bottom segment of the PJ Masks' tower. The vehicle has abilities similar to him, with a \"Gekko-Mobile Camouflage\" letting it blend in with surroundings. His bedroom is on the second floor of a green-roofed green-doored house next to Amaya's. Greg has a gecko named Lionel. In seasons 1\u20132, an ongoing joke about how he \"can't think of a rhyme\" was finished in \"Pirates Ahoy!\" when he sang with Owlette/Amaya, where they were singing about each other and he thought of a rhyme for the relationship of them both in that segment. It is hinted that he has a slim crush on Amaya/Owlette, but some fans believe that he has a crush on Luna Girl. He is also Connor's best friend and is treated like a little brother.\n** Baby Gekko (voiced by Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) \u2013 The baby-fied version of Gekko who appeared in \"Big Sister Motsuki\". Unlike the other baby PJs, he is the only one who never speaks by himself and usually only speaks in unison with the other babies. However, at one point, he did say \"Muscle Wuscles!\" when he used his Super Gekko Muscles.\n* PJ Robot (voiced by Juan Luis Bonilla) \u2013 A robot that Romeo created to infiltrate the PJ Masks HQ. However, PJ Robot decided to be a PJ Mask rather than a villain's sidekick. He joined the PJ Masks Team in Season 2. He spends most of his time inside HQ as mission control for the PJ Masks. He doesn't speak much, but when he does, it usually comes out as robotic gibberish that only the PJ Masks and Romeo can understand. He is the creator of the PJ Seeker.\n\n====Allies====\n* Teeny Weeny Ninjalino (actor unknown) \u2013 A tiny and cute ninja from \"Catboy and the Teeny Weeny Ninjalino\", who was supposed to spy on the PJ Masks but won Owlette and Gekko's affection. Catboy (who was too quick to judge him, but later became his friend after being unstuck from the Owl Glider by him) kept wanting to get rid of him, and convinced his teammates to do so as well. He returned in \"Race Up Mystery Mountain\", where he mostly interacted with Gekko. In \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\", Teeny turned on his master. But in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\" he returned to his master's side.\n** The Splat Monster (actor unknown) \u2013 The alternate form Teeny took in the episode of the same name, where he turned into a Splat Monster when he touched the transforming splat in the Mystery Mountain cave. The Teeny Weeny Ninjalino was restored to normal by An Yu. This form returned in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\" and again in \"The Disappearing Ninjas.\"\n* Armadylan (voiced by Max Calinescu in Season 2-\"Armadylan Zen\", Christian Perri in \"Arma-Leader\"-present) \u2013 An [[armadillo]]-like boy who wants to be a hero, but his being inexperienced causes him to mess up. He first meets the PJ Masks in \"Meet Armadylan\" and became an official member of the PJ Masks team in the episode \"PJ Dylan\". Armadylan's powers are his Thunder Thump to shake the ground, super strength to lift any heavy objects, like Gekko, the Rolling Thunder to roll himself up into a ball to attack his opponents and he can also dig to go underneath the ground. He is mostly mistaken by Romeo and Night Ninja for an anteater and/or an aardvark instead of an armadillo. He has a crush on either Rip or Octobella.\n* Captain Smartypants (voiced by Carter Thorne) \u2013 A young scientist who is the good version of Romeo. He helps Gekko change his teammates back to normal before Robot changes him back to his usual, evil self in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\".\n* An Yu (voiced by Kari Wong) \u2013 A samurai girl who uses her bo staff as a weapon or to fly; it also turns into a magic flute. She also turned out to be the human form of the Dragon from the Dragon Gong, as hinted by the gold dragon head on her headdress. She first appears in her human form in the season 3 episode \"Meet An Yu\". An Yu was a loner{{snd}}she attempted to face Night Ninja (from the episode \"Meet An Yu\") alone without the PJ Masks{{snd}}but they helped her out anyway, and she has occasionally helped them out in return. An Yu's powers mostly work on Mystery Mountain, and she can't use her magic flute in the town either, as seen in \"A Teeny Weeny Problem\".\n*Lionel (actor unknown) \u2013 a small gekko who is the pet of Gekko, he normally  appeared when the PJ Masks are transforming. He then had a major role in \"Lionel-saurs.\" when Romeo made him huge.\n*[[Santa Claus|Santa ]](voiced by [[Ron Pardo]]) - Santa is the jolly man who appeared in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" where he teamed up with the PJ Masks to stop Romeo from running [[Christmas]]. He appears with a long beard and was not as fat as the other adaptations of him.\n* Newton (actor unknown at the moment) \u2013 An upcoming character who is set to appear in season 4, and was first seen in a storyboard video for the season's 14th episode. He has star powers. He is likely to be the first hero to appear in both daytime and nighttime.\n\n===Villains===\n* Romeo (voiced by Alex Thorne in Season 1, Carter Thorne in the short films and Season 2-\"Owlette Slips Up\", Simon Pirso in \"Motsuki the Best\"-present) \u2013 The main villain in the series. He is a childish scientist who comes up with a variety of inventions and dislikes the PJ Masks, who always foil his plans. He also dislikes the other villains such as Luna Girl and Night Ninja, who he trapped in \"Romeo's Disguise\", although they did team up in \"PJ Masks vs. Bad Guys United.\" He also dislikes it when his servants disobey him. His favorite inventions (as said in \"Owlette's New Move\") are Robot, his Laboggan (which is his mobile lab, with skis in place of [[Continuous track|Caterpillar]] tracks), Super Train, and Radical Romeo Remote. From \"Blame it on the Train, Owlette\" to \"The Prank Wheelz\", he originally controlled a mobile Lab on land, but now controls his flying Sky Factory starting in \"Villain of the Sky\". He always tries to take over the world and defeat the PJs but regularly fails. Once, though, he took over the city, turning it into Romeo-aplolis in \"Gekko and the Mayhem at the Museum\". He did once help the PJ Masks in \"The PJ Masks Save Christmas.\" when he realised how much Robot cares for him despite the rotten things he has done. Even though he may be evil, Robot mentions that there is good in Romeo deep down.\n** Robots - Romeo's mechanical henchmen.\n*** Robot (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A large [[robot]], Romeo's personal servant and his buddy as Romeo mentions it in \" Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage.\". He has acted on his own,  when Romeo invented Robette and when he captured Armadylan, Despite Romeo replacing him, Robot shows that he still cares for his master and is always willing to help him. Robot's main weakness is water, as it causes him to short-circuit and be paralyzed. Whenever this happens he often says \"Robots hate water.\"\n*** Robette (actor unknown) \u2013 One of Romeo's inventions. She began to try to take over the world herself in \"Catboy and Gekko's Robot Rampage\". This was due to a loose screw caused by Owlette and was later resolved. During the episode, Romeo's original Robot became jealous of Robette, and ran away. This was also later resolved, and Romeo became friends with Robot again. Robette returned in the Season 2 episode \"PJ Robot\". In \"Armadylan and Robette Rule\", she ends up as Armadylan's sidekick but then went back to Romeo.\n*** Toolbox \u2013 A walking toolbox who works with Romeo, and in case of making inventions Toolbox carries Romeo's tools.\n*** Spy-Bot \u2013 A cubical bot that works for Romeo, who often used Spy-Bot to spy on the PJ Masks.\n*** Fly Bots \u2013 Small, flying robots which resemble PJ Robot before he reformed and regularly guard Romeo's Sky Factory.\n*** Naughty Bots - Naughty Bots are robots disguise as [[Gift| presents]], but they destroy everything releted to [[Christmas|Christmas]] like presents and Christmas decorations\n*** Robo-PJ Masks - As the robotic versions of the PJ Masks, they all have the same powers but with the addition of Laser Eyes which stops the enemies from moving.\n* Luna Girl (a.k.a. Luna) (voiced by Brianna Daguanno) \u2013 The second villain in the series who is also the first villainess. She is an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] girl who lives on the [[Moon]] in her Lunar Fortress with her little sister Motsuki and their moths, but in \"Best Friends Forever\", it is revealed that her Luna Magnet powers give her the power to breathe in space. Her main weapons are her Luna Magnet and Luna Board that she uses as a mode of transportation. However, she also had a lot of other weapons; this once included a giant Moon-Ball, which could steal objects and swallow her enemies and the small Moon Ball, which turns the person who touches it to servants. She teamed with PJ Masks while defeating Romeo in some episodes when it came to him threatening the Moon or using her stolen lunar crystal. Starting in Season 3, she is persistently nicknamed Luna, rather than being called by her full name. In \"Gekko Saves Christmas\", she is shown to develop a crush on Gekko and at the end, they team up to put Christmas right. In \u201cBest Friends Forever\u201d at the end of the episode (like Gekko Saves Christmas), and she also Join the PJ Masks victory! She also help the PJ Masks in \u201cPJ Party Crasher\u201d when Motsuki try to ruin Owlette\u2019s pyjama party and was even invited to her slumber party. Also, she and Romeo team up in \u201cPJ Masks VS Bad Guy United\u201d when Romeo allied with Night Ninja and Luna Girl to defeat the PJs forever and in \u201cPJ Comet\u201d when Romeo and Luna Girl work together to Trap the PJ Masks in a fake comet and try to build a Villain HQ! But although being a villain towards the PJ Masks, Luna Girl is shown to have a good side sometimes that some fans believe that she will turn good and ally with them more often.\n** Moths \u2013 A swarm of [[Moth|moths]] who work for Luna.  They also have the ability to fly on the moon.\n*** Motsuki (voiced by Hattie Kragten) \u2013 The first moth to go to the moon with Luna Girl and receive her own powers from her mistress in \"Moon Madness\". Previously nicknamed \"Moth\" and \"Hench-Moth\" by Catboy, Luna was originally going to call her either \"Mothena\" or \"Motherella\", but eventually stuck with \"Motsuki\". Motsuki has the power to sense someone in the Lunar Fortress and can also shoot moon beams from her antennas to trap her victims in a purple bubble. Thanks to the PJ Masks' bad vibes, she later turns into a more anthropomorphic and more powerful, moth-like insectoid girl after hatching from a strange crystal on the moon in \"Moth on the Moon\", as intended by Luna. Following her transformation, she is given the power of speech and has a smaller crystal on her chest that has the same purpose as Luna's Luna Magnet. Despite this, she also becomes much less loyal to Luna, who now sees her as a younger sister, and enjoys annoying her, but she still loves her either way. She also has the tendency to occasionally make high-pitched squeaking noises really often. In \"Minding Motsuki\", she appears to be more loyal towards Gekko than towards Luna, as she treats her like a baby while he treats her like she's a guest.\n* Night Ninja (voiced by Trek Buccino in Season 1, Devan Cohen in the short films and Season 2-\"Do the Gekko\" and Jacob Soley in \"Armadylan, Action Hero\"-present) \u2013 Night Ninja, as his name suggests, is a [[ninja]] who rarely gets into battle as he makes his Ninjalinos do all his work and is the third villain of the series. He and Romeo have occasionally teamed up: in \"Catboy and the Shrinker\", when Romeo needed someone to help operate his shrink ray; and in \"Wacky Floats\" where they stole the parade floats and plotted to transform them into Robot Floats. In both episodes they always argued and disagreed with each other. He did help the PJs twice in \"Wolfy Mountain\" and in \u201cWerejalinos\u201d to stop the Wolfies, from taking control of the Mystery Mountain and in \"The  Disappearing Ninjas\" when Romeo stole his Ninjalinos and invade Mystery Mountain. His main weapon is Sticky Splat which he normally uses to trap his opponents, he also uses [[Smoke bomb|smoke bombs]] to teleport to place to another.\n* Ninjalinos (actors unknown) \u2013 The minions of Night Ninja. They are small purple ninjas that talk in their own, unintelligible language (though Night Ninja does seem to understand them). Their numbers increased from episode to episode, from as few as three to well over a dozen. They sometimes get along well with the PJ Masks, much to their boss' chagrin.\n** Marvin (actor unknown) \u2013 A Ninjalino who was named. He appeared in \"Wolfy Moutain\" and \"Werejalinos\"\n** Daisy (actor unknown) \u2013 A female Ninjalino who was named. She appeared in \"The Disappearing Ninjas\".\n* The Wolfy Kids (usually referred to as \"the Wolfies\") \u2013 A trio of [[werewolf]] siblings who like to cause mischief. They ride in their car they call the \"Wolf Wheelz\". They may have been inspired by Les Mascrapules (lit. the Masked Scoundrels), a trio of villain kids from the books who also like to mess around and do as they please! They and The PJ Masks team up to defeat Luna Girl in two episode. They are show in \"Arma-Leader\" to be good after all since they help the PJs to rescue Armadylan and also another teaming with the PJs in \u201cWolfy Powers\u201d when Romeo stole the PJ Masks's powers and the Wolfies help them to retrieve their PJ powers.\n** Rip (voiced by Shechinah Mpumlwana) \u2013 The female member and leader of the Wolfy Kids who is the second villainess in the series. She has dark magenta hair with light tips and bone-shaped hair clips.\n** Howler (voiced by Kaden Stephen) \u2013 A male member of the Wolfy Kids, with white streak in his black hair.\n** Kevin (voiced by Ethan Pugiotto) \u2013 A male and younger member of the Wolfy Kids, always nicer than his brother and sister. He is a friend of Gekko.\n***Wolf Wheelz \u2013 The car of the Wolfy Kids. Originally three scooters used by the humanoid wolves, it transformed into a car in \"The Moon Prix\" as a result of being exposed to moon energy. In \"Where's the Wolf Wheelz?\", it is revealed that the car has a mind of its own.\n* Night [[Panthera|Panther]] (voiced by Jacob Ursomarzo) \u2013 The evil version of Catboy who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". He also has the same powers like Catboy, like his Super Cat Stripes, only he calls it Night Panther Stripes.\n* Dark [[Owl]] (voiced by Addison Holley) \u2013 The evil version of Owlette who appeared in \"Gekko and the Opposite Ray\". Like Night Panther, she has the same powers as her couterpart, like Dark Owl Feathers which are like Owlette's Owl Feathers.\n* Octobella (voiced by Simon Pirso) \u2013 Another upcoming character for season 4 who, as her name suggests, will be an [[octopus]]-themed villain, as well as the series' third villainess (yet despite being set to debut in season 4, one of her tentacles can be seen in the end of \"Gekko Everywhere\"). She was leaked in a now-removed storyboard video for an upcoming episode for season 4, titled \"Octobella's Garden\". Since the storyboard video for said episode is no longer available for viewing online, it was unknown on what Octobella will look like until \"Gekko Everywhere\", when one of her tentacles was seen grabbing the Teleporting Crystal; it was light green with a hint of orange at the base. Besides that, her other half is currently unseen, so your best bet is to wait until \"Octobella's Garden\" (or whatever episode she'll first fully appear in) comes out. One other thing about her that we do know, however, is that she has a beautiful singing voice which is enough to attract Armadylan and make him fall in love with her.\n** Percival \u2013 Octobella's [[hermit crab]] sidekick.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Cameron (voiced by Tristan Samuel in Season 1, Jonah Wineberg in Season 2, Tyler Nathan in Season 3-present) \u2013 A boy in the same class as PJ Masks when they attend school during the day as civilians. He once scared Amaya with a T-Rex cutout the same way Connor did earlier in \"Owlette's Terrible Pterodactyl Trouble\", but Connor learned his lesson and tells Cameron not to do it. In \"Catboy's Cuddly\", he was revealed to have a sister (named Marie as of \"PJ Party Crasher\"), who attends the same school.\n* Teacher (voiced by [[Robert Tinkler|Rob Tinkler]]) \u2013 An unnamed adult male who teaches Connor, Greg, and Amaya's class. When things disappear, he thinks it's strange.\n* Jayden Houston \u2013 A popular singer, known for his golden microphone. It was stolen by Luna Girl in \"Catboy's Tricky Ticket\", but was later recovered by the PJ Masks.\n* Master Fang (actor unknown) \u2013 The protagonist of his own comic book and TV series. Greg and Connor generally looked up to him, but Amaya doesn't seem to care about him much. He is known for his signature sword that was stolen by Night Ninja in \"Catboy and Master Fang's Sword\".\n** Kick McGee \u2013 Master Fang's unseen sidekick. His persona is often used during missions.\n* Flossy Flash \u2013 A female comic book superhero, looked up to by Owlette and Armadylan. Owlette prefers her over Master Fang and Kick McGee, who are favored by Catboy and Gekko.\n* The Announcer (voiced by Ron Pardo) \u2013 A male voice that is heard in every episode as the day becomes night. He is never seen, but is known for saying his signature introduction sequence \"Night in the city, and a brave band of heroes is ready to face fiendish villains to stop them messing with your day.\" As the kids turn into their superhero forms, the announcer states who turns into who.\n*Marie (voice actor unknown) - Marie is Cameron's sister.  Like Cameron, Marie has green eyes and brown hair. She is one of Amaya's friends. Her name was revealed in, \u201cPJ Party Crasher\u201d.\n*Jenny (voice actor unknown) - Jenny is one of Amaya's friends.\n*Unknown Monkey - An upcoming character in Season 4.  First seen at the New York Toy Fair 2020 as an action figure. They don't have a name or gender yet, but it might be the confirmed third new character for the season.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of PJ Masks episodes}}\n{{:List of PJ Masks episodes}}\n\n==Production==\n''PJ Masks'' is a British/French coproduction by [[Entertainment One]], Frog Box, and [[TeamTO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/festivals/annecy-teamto-re-ups-pj-masks-skylanders-1201798571/|title=Annecy: TeamTO Re-Ups on 'PJ Masks,' 'Skylanders' (EXCLUSIVE)|work=Variety|author1=John Hopewell|author2=Emilio Mayorga|date=June 18, 2016|access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref> The series was renewed for a second season consisting of 52 11-minute segments in June 2016;<ref name=\"THR\">{{cite web |author=Georg Szalai |date=June 15, 2016 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/disney-juniors-pj-masks-get-903016 |title=Disney Junior's 'PJ Masks' to Get Second Season |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref> it premiered on 15 January 2018.

The final installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. A [[Wii U]] version of the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3: Special Edition'', was later released in November 2012. ''Mass Effect 3'' is set within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] in 2186, where civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of [[Synthetic intelligence|synthetic]]-[[Carbon-based life|organic]] starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations.

\"generally favorable reviews\" from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game finished with scores of 93 out of 100, making ''Mass Effect 3'' the [[2012 in video gaming|highest-rated game of 2012]] on both systems.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" /><ref name=\"MCPS3\" /><ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCWii\" />\n\nCritics felt that ''Mass Effect 3'' was a satisfying conclusion to the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. In a perfect review for ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Dan Whitehead praised the game for providing a definitive close to the saga instead of something more ambiguous or open-ended.<ref name=\"eurog-review\" /> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner proclaimed that BioWare had created one of the most \"intricately crafted\" stories in the history of video gaming.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> Tom Francis of [[PC Gamer#PC Gamer US|''PC Gamer'' (US)]] remarked that the finale was a \"mixed bag\", but ultimately praised its scale and emotional impact, which he felt was more satisfying than its main plot.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|title=Mass Effect 3 review|last=Francis|first=Tom|date=March 6, 2012|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121208143402/http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|archivedate=December 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nReviewers highlighted the experience of playing ''Mass Effect 3'' with an imported saved game. In a piece for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Arthur Gies opined that, while the game would be engaging without any previous context, it would be more meaningful for players who also played through ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gies |first1=Arthur |title=Mass Effect 3 Review: The Sharp Edge of Hope |url=https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |date=March 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150201115511/http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |archivedate=February 1, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gus Mastrapa of [[The A.V.

Discussing combat for [[IGN]], Colin Moriarty observed that while changes from prior installments were minor, they were still evident, and anticipated that multiplayer would give the game added replay value.<ref name=\"ign-review\" /> While ''Game Informer'' noted that combat was not perfect, they were still positive and concluded that enemy encounters were more intense and interesting than in ''Mass Effect 2'', due in part to a greater variety in environment and enemy types.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> In an otherwise enthusiastic write-up for [[GameSpot]], Kevin VanOrd recounted numerous glitches during combat, such as party members putting themselves in the line of fire by climbing onto crates and enemies getting stuck on walls.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]] also noted numerous bugs, but relented that ''Mass Effect 3'' was still a memorable experience, citing the game's strong characters as compensation for its flaws.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" />\n\nOther aspects of ''Mass Effect 3'' to receive praise included its art design, music, and [[voice acting]]. GameSpot described the art design as \"fantastic\" and gave particular attention to its use of color and composition.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> In that same review, the website complimented the game's voice acting for bringing its major characters to life.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> ''PC Gamer'' (US) made special mention of the game's music, calling it \"gorgeous\" and observing that it significantly added to the emotional impact of the game.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\" /> ''[[The Verge]]'' went a step further and described the score as one of the most \"powerful and memorable\" ever created for a video game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Hulick - Biography |url=https://samhulick.com/#bio |publisher=Sam Hulick Official Website |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200101160444/https://samhulick.com/%23bio#bio |archivedate=January 1, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kirk Hamilton of ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the score represented some of the best video game music of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |title=The Best Video Game Music of 2012 |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |date=December 13, 2012 |website=[[Kotaku]] |url=http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130521094426/http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archivedate=May 21, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\n{{quote box\n | align = right\n | width = 30%\n | quote = \"I remember about a week or so after we had launched [the game], we'd seen all these excellent critical reviews ... then all of a sudden people were saying, 'I felt the ending was weak.'

Critics felt the ending rendered character choices inconsequential; a general lack of closure; lore contradictions and plot holes; character and narrative inconsistencies; the absence of a final boss

The final installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' trilogy, it was first released in March 2012 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], and [[PlayStation 3]]. A [[Wii U]] version of the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3: Special Edition'', was later released in November 2012. ''Mass Effect 3'' is set within the [[Milky Way Galaxy]] in 2186, where civilization is invaded by a highly advanced machine race of [[Synthetic intelligence|synthetic]]-[[Carbon-based life|organic]] starships known as Reapers. It concludes the story of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who is tasked with forging alliances between species for the war.\n\nSimilar to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the player can import a completed [[saved game]] into ''Mass Effect 3'' that influences the plot by taking previous decisions into account. In general, ''Mass Effect 3'' revolves around increasing military strength by completing [[Quest (video gaming)|missions]] and gathering resources. As BioWare designed the game to be accessible to both old and new players, many of the series' traditional gameplay elements remain, such as [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[Third-person shooter|third-person shooting]], but new aspects are introduced as well, such as a [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] component. The game's [[Video game score|score]] was written by a variety of composers, who aimed for a balance between the [[orchestra]]l sound of ''Mass Effect 2'' and the [[synthesizer]]-driven sound of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' received critical acclaim for its art direction, characters, emotional story, improved combat, soundtrack, and voice acting. However, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations. In response to the controversy, BioWare released the ''Extended Cut'' [[downloadable content]] pack, which expands upon the original ending. The game received several year-end awards, including Best RPG at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]] and Game of the Year from ''[[Game Informer]]''. In March 2017, it was followed by a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] [[sequel]], ''[[Mass Effect: Andromeda]]''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 3'' is an [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes control of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]].<ref name=\"Prima Character\">{{cite book|last1=Musa|first1=Alexander|last2=Bueno|first2=Fernando|last3=Lierop|first3=Raphael Van|title=Mass Effect 3: Prima Official Game Guide|date=2012|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|location=Roseville, CA|isbn=978-0-307-89148-8|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> If the player has a completed [[saved game]] from ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'', the character from that game can be imported.<ref name=\"Import\">{{cite web|last1=Moriarty|first1=Colin|title=Mass Effect 3 Review: Page 2 of 3|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/06/mass-effect-3-review?page=2|website=[[IGN]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> By importing an old character, decisions from prior ''Mass Effect'' titles are carried over, which impacts the plot of ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Import\" /> Similar to previous installments in the series, the player is able to choose from six different [[character class]]es that each have their own unique set of skills.<ref name=\"Tips\">{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Kate|title=Before You Start\u2026 Tips for Playing Mass Effect 3 The Best Way|url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|website=[[Kotaku]]|date=March 6, 2012|accessdate=December 28, 2017|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HQfbTNo?url=https://kotaku.com/5890848/before-you-start-tips-for-playing-mass-effect-3-the-best-way|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For example, the Adept class is proficient in [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers whereas the Soldier class is proficient in weapons.<ref name=\"Tips\"/> By completing assignments and [[Quest (video gaming)|quests]], the player is rewarded with [[experience point]]s.<ref name=\"Prima Character\" /> Once enough points are earned, Shepard levels up, which allows for the unlocking or upgrading of skills along a [[Glossary of video game terms#Skilltree|tree]].<ref name=GSCC>{{cite web|url=http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |title=Comic-Con 2011: Mass Effect 3 Hands-On Preview - Biotics and Branching Upgrades |date=July 22, 2011 |accessdate=July 24, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726053512/http://comic-con.gamespot.com/story/6324863/comic-con-2011-mass-effect-3-hands-on-preview-biotics-and-branching-upgrades |archivedate=July 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |website=[[GameSpot]]|last1=McInnis|first1=Shaun}}</ref>\n\n''Mass Effect 3'' has three pre-set [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] modes: Action, Story, and RPG.<ref name=\"Three Modes\">{{cite magazine |last1=Francis |first1=Tom |title=Mass Effect 3 Narrative Mode and Action Mode explained |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/ |magazine=[[PC Gamer]] |accessdate=June 3, 2018 |date=March 7, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HSz91FS?url=https://www.pcgamer.com/mass-effect-3-narrative-mode-and-action-mode-explained/|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In Action Mode, conversations have automatic replies and normal combat difficulty; in Story Mode, conversations have manual replies and minimal combat difficulty; and in RPG Mode, conversations have manual replies and normal combat difficulty.<ref name=\"Three Modes\" /> The game contains various [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] elements,<ref name=Best>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|title=BioWare: Mass Effect 3 Is the Best Game We've Ever Made|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011|last=Westbrook|first=Logan|magazine=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/71HT6O6rv?url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/111814-BioWare-Mass-Effect-3-Is-the-Best-Game-Weve-Ever-Made|archivedate=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> such as the ability to augment guns with different ammo types, barrels, modifications, and scopes to improve their effectiveness in combat.

\"generally favorable reviews\" from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]]. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game finished with scores of 93 out of 100, making ''Mass Effect 3'' the [[2012 in video gaming|highest-rated game of 2012]] on both systems.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" /><ref name=\"MCPS3\" /><ref name=\"MCPC\" /><ref name=\"MCWii\" />\n\nCritics felt that ''Mass Effect 3'' was a satisfying conclusion to the ''Mass Effect'' trilogy. In a perfect review for ''[[Eurogamer]]'', Dan Whitehead praised the game for providing a definitive close to the saga instead of something more ambiguous or open-ended.<ref name=\"eurog-review\" /> Writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', Andrew Reiner proclaimed that BioWare had created one of the most \"intricately crafted\" stories in the history of video gaming.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> Tom Francis of [[PC Gamer#PC Gamer US|''PC Gamer'' (US)]] remarked that the finale was a \"mixed bag\", but ultimately praised its scale and emotional impact, which he felt was more satisfying than its main plot.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|title=Mass Effect 3 review|last=Francis|first=Tom|date=March 6, 2012|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|accessdate=March 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20121208143402/http://www.pcgamer.com/review/mass-effect-3-review/|archivedate=December 8, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nReviewers highlighted the experience of playing ''Mass Effect 3'' with an imported saved game. In a piece for ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', Arthur Gies opined that, while the game would be engaging without any previous context, it would be more meaningful for players who also played through ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gies |first1=Arthur |title=Mass Effect 3 Review: The Sharp Edge of Hope |url=https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |date=March 6, 2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150201115511/http://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3443570/mass-effect-3-review-the-sharp-edge-of-hope |archivedate=February 1, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Gus Mastrapa of [[The A.V.

Discussing combat for [[IGN]], Colin Moriarty observed that while changes from prior installments were minor, they were still evident, and anticipated that multiplayer would give the game added replay value.<ref name=\"ign-review\" /> While ''Game Informer'' noted that combat was not perfect, they were still positive and concluded that enemy encounters were more intense and interesting than in ''Mass Effect 2'', due in part to a greater variety in environment and enemy types.<ref name=\"gi-review\" /> In an otherwise enthusiastic write-up for [[GameSpot]], Kevin VanOrd recounted numerous glitches during combat, such as party members putting themselves in the line of fire by climbing onto crates and enemies getting stuck on walls.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> [[Machinima, Inc.|Machinima]] also noted numerous bugs, but relented that ''Mass Effect 3'' was still a memorable experience, citing the game's strong characters as compensation for its flaws.<ref name=\"MCXbox\" />\n\nOther aspects of ''Mass Effect 3'' to receive praise included its art design, music, and [[voice acting]]. GameSpot described the art design as \"fantastic\" and gave particular attention to its use of color and composition.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> In that same review, the website complimented the game's voice acting for bringing its major characters to life.<ref name=\"gspot-review\" /> ''PC Gamer'' (US) made special mention of the game's music, calling it \"gorgeous\" and observing that it significantly added to the emotional impact of the game.<ref name=\"pcgus-review\" /> ''[[The Verge]]'' went a step further and described the score as one of the most \"powerful and memorable\" ever created for a video game.<ref>{{cite web |title=Sam Hulick - Biography |url=https://samhulick.com/#bio |publisher=Sam Hulick Official Website |accessdate=July 28, 2018 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20200101160444/https://samhulick.com/%23bio#bio |archivedate=January 1, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kirk Hamilton of ''[[Kotaku]]'' felt that the score represented some of the best video game music of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=May 21, 2013 |title=The Best Video Game Music of 2012 |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |date=December 13, 2012 |website=[[Kotaku]] |url=http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130521094426/http://kotaku.com/5968289/the-best-video-game-music-of-2012 |archivedate=May 21, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Controversy===\n{{quote box\n | align = right\n | width = 30%\n | quote = \"I remember about a week or so after we had launched [the game], we'd seen all these excellent critical reviews ... then all of a sudden people were saying, 'I felt the ending was weak.'

Pressure may also be expressed in terms of [[standard atmospheric pressure]]; the [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]] (atm) is equal to this pressure, and the [[torr]] is defined as {{frac|760}} of this. Manometric units such as the [[centimetre of water]], [[millimetre of mercury]], and [[inch of mercury]] are used to express pressures in terms of the height of [[Pressure measurement#Liquid column|column of a particular fluid]] in a manometer.\n\n==Definition==\n'''Pressure''' is the amount of force applied at [[right angle]]s to the surface of an object per unit area.

The usage of ''P'' vs ''p'' depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby presence of other symbols for quantities such as [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[momentum]], and on writing style.\n\n===Formula===\n{{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n[[File:Pressure force area.svg|200px|right]]\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F}{A},</math><ref name=\"Georgia State University, Physics & Astronomy\">{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/press.html |title=Pressure |accessdate=2018-06-14 }}</ref>\nwhere:\n:<math>p</math> is the pressure,\n:<math>F</math> is the magnitude of the [[normal force]],\n:<math>A</math> is the area of the surface on contact.\n\nPressure is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity. It relates the [[vector area]] element (a vector normal to the surface) with the [[normal force]] acting on it. The pressure is the scalar [[proportionality constant]] that relates the two normal vectors:\n:<math>d\\mathbf{F}_n = -p\\,d\\mathbf{A} = -p\\,\\mathbf{n}\\,dA.</math>\n\nThe minus sign comes from the fact that the force is considered towards the surface element, while the normal vector points outward. The equation has meaning in that, for any surface ''S'' in contact with the fluid, the total force exerted by the fluid on that surface is the [[surface integral]] over ''S'' of the right-hand side of the above equation.\n\nIt is incorrect (although rather usual) to say \"the pressure is directed in such or such direction\". The pressure, as a scalar, has no direction. The force given by the previous relationship to the quantity has a direction, but the pressure does not. If we change the orientation of the surface element, the direction of the normal force changes accordingly, but the pressure remains the same.\n\nPressure is distributed to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. It is a fundamental parameter in [[thermodynamics]], and it is [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].\n\n===Units===\n[[File:Barometer mercury column hg.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury column]]\nThe [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N/m<sup>2</sup>, or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>). This name for the unit was added in 1971;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |title=14th Conference of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures |publisher=Bipm.fr |accessdate=2012-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630020548/http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 }}</ref> before that, pressure in SI was expressed simply in newtons per square metre.\n\nOther units of pressure, such as [[pound-force per square inch|pounds per square inch]] (Ibf/in<sup>2</sup>) and [[bar (unit)|bar]], are also in common use. The [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS]] unit of pressure is the [[barye]] (Ba), equal to 1&nbsp;dyn\u00b7cm<sup>\u22122</sup>, or 0.1&nbsp;Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or kilograms-force per square centimetre (g/cm<sup>2</sup> or kg/cm<sup>2</sup><!--don't add an f to kg, this is making the point about usage without it-->) and the like without properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is expressly forbidden in SI. The [[technical atmosphere]] (symbol: at) is 1&nbsp;kgf/cm<sup>2</sup> (98.0665&nbsp;kPa, or 14.223&nbsp;psi).\n\nSince a system under pressure has the potential to perform work on its surroundings, pressure is a measure of potential energy stored per unit volume. It is therefore related to energy density and may be expressed in units such as [[joule]]s per cubic metre (J/m<sup>3</sup>, which is equal to Pa).\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F \\times \\text{distance}}{A \\times \\text{distance}} = \\frac{\\text{work}}{\\text{volume}} = \\frac{\\text{energy (J)}}{\\text{volume }(\\text{m}^3)}.</math>\n\nSome [[meteorologist]]s prefer the hectopascal (hPa) for atmospheric air pressure, which is equivalent to the older unit [[millibar]] (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the hecto- prefix is rarely used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in [[decibar]]s (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth.\n \nThe [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth [[mean sea level]] and is defined as {{val|101325|u=Pa}}.\n\nBecause pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a [[manometer]], pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., [[centimetres of water]], [[millimetres of mercury]] or [[inches of mercury]]). The most common choices are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to be used to measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height ''h'' and density ''\u03c1'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''\u03c1gh''}}, where ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal to one [[torr]]. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These ''manometric units'' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.\n\n[[Underwater diving|Underwater divers]] use the [[metre sea water]] (msw or MSW) and [[foot sea water]] (fsw or FSW) units of pressure, and these are the standard units for pressure gauges used to measure pressure exposure in [[diving chamber]]s and [[Dive computer|personal decompression computers]]. A msw is defined as 0.1&nbsp;bar (= 100000&nbsp;Pa = 10000&nbsp;Pa), is not the same as a linear metre of depth. 33.066&nbsp;fsw = 1&nbsp;atm<ref name=\"usn T2.10\">{{cite book |title=US Navy Diving Manual, 6th revision |pages=2\u201332 |year=2006 |publisher=US Naval Sea Systems Command |location=United States |url=http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&pageID=3.9 |accessdate=2008-06-15 |author=US Navy |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502023541/http://www.supsalv.org/00c3_publications.asp?destPage=00c3&pageId=3.9 |archivedate=2008-05-02 }}</ref> (1&nbsp;atm = 101325&nbsp;Pa / 33.066 = 3064.326 Pa).

Unlike [[stress (physics)|stress]], pressure is defined as a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. The negative [[gradient]] of pressure is called the [[force density]].\n\nAnother example is a knife. If we try to cut with the flat edge, force is distributed over a larger surface area resulting in less pressure, and it will not cut. Whereas using the sharp edge, which has less surface area, results in greater pressure, and so the knife cuts smoothly. This is one example of a practical application of pressure.\n\nFor gases, pressure is sometimes measured not as an ''absolute pressure'', but relative to [[atmospheric pressure]]; such measurements are called ''gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--> pressure''. An example of this is the air pressure in an [[automobile]] [[tire]], which might be said to be \"{{convert|220|kPa|psi|abbr=on|lk=in}}\", but is actually 220&nbsp;kPa (32&nbsp;psi) above atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 100&nbsp;kPa (14.7&nbsp;psi), the absolute pressure in the tire is therefore about {{convert|320|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}. In technical work, this is written \"a gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues.

Much debate has transpired on this issue.--> pressure is the relevant measure of pressure wherever one is interested in the stress on [[Pressure vessel|storage vessels]] and the plumbing components of fluidics systems. However, whenever equation-of-state properties, such as densities or changes in densities, must be calculated, pressures must be expressed in terms of their absolute values. For instance, if the atmospheric pressure is {{convert|100|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}, a gas (such as helium) at {{convert|200|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} (gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.-->) ({{convert|300|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or}} [absolute]) is 50% denser than the same gas at {{convert|100|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} (gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.-->) ({{convert|200|kPa|psi|abbr=on|disp=or}} [absolute]). Focusing on gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--> values, one might erroneously conclude the first sample had twice the density of the second one.\n\n===Scalar nature===\nIn a static [[gas]], the gas as a whole does not appear to move. The individual molecules of the gas, however, are in constant [[Brownian motion|random motion]]. Because we are dealing with an extremely large number of molecules and because the motion of the individual molecules is random in every direction, we do not detect any motion. If we enclose the gas within a container, we detect a pressure in the gas from the molecules colliding with the walls of our container. We can put the walls of our container anywhere inside the gas, and the force per unit area (the pressure) is the same. We can shrink the size of our \"container\" down to a very small point (becoming less true as we approach the atomic scale), and the pressure will still have a single value at that point. Therefore, pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense associated with it. Pressure force acts in all directions at a point inside a gas. At the surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular (at right angle) to the surface.\n\nA closely related quantity is the [[stress (physics)|stress]] tensor ''\u03c3'', which relates the vector force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> to the \n[[vector area]] <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> via the linear relation <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\sigma\\mathbf{A}</math>.\n\nThis [[tensor]] may be expressed as the sum of the [[viscous stress tensor]] minus the hydrostatic pressure. The negative of the stress tensor is sometimes called the pressure tensor, but in the following, the term \"pressure\" will refer only to the scalar pressure.\n\nAccording to the theory of [[general relativity]], pressure increases the strength of a gravitational field (see [[stress\u2013energy tensor]]) and so adds to the mass-energy cause of [[gravity]]. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but is significant in [[neutron star]]s, although it has not been experimentally tested.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10509-009-0016-8 |title=Einstein's gravity under pressure |accessdate=2012-03-27 |doi=10.1007/s10509-009-0016-8 |volume=321 |issue=2 |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |pages=151\u2013156|arxiv=0705.0825 |bibcode=2009Ap&SS.321..151V |year=2009 |last1=Vishwakarma |first1=Ram Gopal }}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Fluid pressure===\n\n'''Fluid pressure''' is most often the compressive stress at some point within a [[fluid]].

Such conditions conform with principles of [[fluid statics]]. The pressure at any given point of a non-moving (static) fluid is called the '''hydrostatic pressure'''. <!--For bolding note that this page is the target of redirection from \"hydrostatic pressure\"-->\n\nClosed bodies of fluid are either \"static\", when the fluid is not moving, or \"dynamic\", when the fluid can move as in either a pipe or by compressing an air gap in a closed container. The pressure in closed conditions conforms with the principles of [[fluid dynamics]].\n\nThe concepts of fluid pressure are predominantly attributed to the discoveries of [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]].

Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower [[static pressure]], it may have a higher stagnation pressure when forced to a standstill. Static pressure and stagnation pressure are related by:\n:<math>p_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + p</math>\n\nwhere \n:<math>p_0</math> is the [[stagnation pressure]]\n:<math>v</math> is the flow velocity\n:<math>p</math> is the static pressure.\n\nThe pressure of a moving fluid can be measured using a [[Pitot tube]], or one of its variations such as a [[Kiel probe]] or [[Cobra probe]], connected to a [[manometer]]. Depending on where the inlet holes are located on the probe, it can measure static pressures or stagnation pressures.\n\n===Surface pressure and surface tension===\nThere is a two-dimensional analog of pressure \u2013 the lateral force per unit length applied on a line perpendicular to the force.\n\nSurface pressure is denoted by \u03c0:\n:<math>\\pi = \\frac{F}{l}</math>\nand shares many similar properties with three-dimensional pressure. Properties of surface chemicals can be investigated by measuring pressure/area isotherms, as the two-dimensional analog of [[Boyle's law]], {{nowrap|''\u03c0A'' {{=}} ''k''}}, at constant temperature.\n\n[[Surface tension]] is another example of surface pressure, but with a reversed sign, because \"tension\" is the opposite to \"pressure\".\n\n=== Pressure of an ideal gas ===\n{{main|Ideal gas law}}\nIn an [[ideal gas]], molecules have no volume and do not interact. According to the [[ideal gas law]], pressure varies linearly with temperature and quantity, and inversely with volume:\n:<math>p = \\frac{nRT}{V},</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''p'' is the absolute pressure of the gas,\n:''n'' is the [[amount of substance]],\n:''T'' is the absolute temperature,\n:''V'' is the volume,\n:''R'' is the [[ideal gas constant]].\n\n[[Real gas]]es exhibit a more complex dependence on the variables of state.<ref>P. Atkins, J. de Paula ''Elements of Physical Chemistry'', 4th Ed, W. H. Freeman, 2006. {{ISBN|0-7167-7329-5}}.</ref>\n\n===Vapour pressure===\n{{main|Vapour pressure}}\nVapour pressure is the pressure of a [[vapour]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its condensed [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s in a closed system. All liquids and [[solid]]s have a tendency to [[evaporate]] into a gaseous form, and all [[gas]]es have a tendency to [[condense]] back to their liquid or solid form.\n\nThe [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form vapour bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.\n\nThe vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure|partial vapor pressure]].\n\n===Liquid pressure===\n{{See also|Fluid statics#Pressure in fluids at rest}}\n{{Continuum mechanics}}\nWhen a person swims under the water, water pressure is felt acting on the person's eardrums. The deeper that person swims, the greater the pressure. The pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the person. As someone swims deeper, there is more water above the person and therefore greater pressure. The pressure a liquid exerts depends on its depth.\n\nLiquid pressure also depends on the density of the liquid. If someone was submerged in a liquid more dense than water, the pressure would be correspondingly greater. Thus, we can say that the depth, density and liquid pressure are directly proportionate. The pressure due to a liquid in liquid columns of constant density or at a depth within a substance is represented by the following formula:\n:<math>p = \\rho gh,</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''p'' is liquid pressure,\n:''g'' is gravity at the surface of overlaying material,\n:''\u03c1'' is [[density]] of liquid,\n:''h'' is height of liquid column or depth within a substance.\n\nAnother way of saying the same formula is the following:\n\n:<math>p = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Derivation of this equation\n|-\n|This is derived from the definitions of pressure and weight density. Consider an area at the bottom of a vessel of liquid. The weight of the column of liquid directly above this area produces pressure. From the definition\n\n:<math>\\text{weight density} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{volume}}</math>\n\nwe can express this weight of liquid as\n\n:<math>\\text{weight} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume},</math>\n\nwhere the volume of the column is simply the area multiplied by the depth. Then we have\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{force}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume}}{\\text{area}},</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{(area} \\times \\text{depth)}}{\\text{area}}.</math>\n\nWith the \"area\" in the numerator and the \"area\" in the denominator canceling each other out, we are left with\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\nWritten with symbols, this is our original equation:\n:<math>p= \\rho gh.</math>\n|}\n\nThe pressure a liquid exerts against the sides and bottom of a container depends on the density and the depth of the liquid. If atmospheric pressure is neglected, liquid pressure against the bottom is twice as great at twice the depth; at three times the depth, the liquid pressure is threefold; etc. Or, if the liquid is two or three times as dense, the liquid pressure is correspondingly two or three times as great for any given depth. Liquids are practically incompressible \u2013 that is, their volume can hardly be changed by pressure (water volume decreases by only 50 millionths of its original volume for each atmospheric increase in pressure). Thus, except for small changes produced by temperature, the density of a particular liquid is practically the same at all depths.\n\nAtmospheric pressure pressing on the surface of a liquid must be taken into account when trying to discover the ''total'' pressure acting on a liquid. The total pressure of a liquid, then, is ''\u03c1gh'' plus the pressure of the atmosphere. When this distinction is important, the term ''total pressure'' is used. Otherwise, discussions of liquid pressure refer to pressure without regard to the normally ever-present atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe pressure does not depend on the ''amount'' of liquid present. Volume is not the important factor \u2013 depth is. The average water pressure acting against a dam depends on the average depth of the water and not on the volume of water held back. For example, a wide but shallow lake with a depth of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} exerts only half the average pressure that a small {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} deep pond does. (The ''total force'' applied to the longer dam will be greater, due to the greater total surface area for the pressure to act upon. But for a given {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide section of each dam, the {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water will apply one quarter the force of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water). A person will feel the same pressure whether his/her head is dunked a metre beneath the surface of the water in a small pool or to the same depth in the middle of a large lake. If four vases contain different amounts of water but are all filled to equal depths, then a fish with its head dunked a few centimetres under the surface will be acted on by water pressure that is the same in any of the vases. If the fish swims a few centimetres deeper, the pressure on the fish will increase with depth and be the same no matter which vase the fish is in. If the fish swims to the bottom, the pressure will be greater, but it makes no difference what vase it is in. All vases are filled to equal depths, so the water pressure is the same at the bottom of each vase, regardless of its shape or volume. If water pressure at the bottom of a vase were greater than water pressure at the bottom of a neighboring vase, the greater pressure would force water sideways and then up the narrower vase to a higher level until the pressures at the bottom were equalized. Pressure is depth dependent, not volume dependent, so there is a reason that water seeks its own level.\n\nRestating this as energy equation, the energy per unit volume in an ideal, incompressible liquid is constant throughout its vessel. At the surface, gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the two energy components change linearly with the depth.<ref>Streeter, V. L., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Example&nbsp;3.5, McGraw&ndash;Hill Inc. (1966), New York.</ref>  Mathematically, it is described by [[Bernoulli's equation]], where velocity head is zero and comparisons per unit volume in the vessel are\n:<math>\\frac{p}{\\gamma} + z = \\mathrm{const}.</math>\n\nTerms have the same meaning as in [[#Fluid pressure|section Fluid pressure]].\n\n===Direction of liquid pressure===\nAn experimentally determined fact about liquid pressure is that it is exerted equally in all directions.<ref name=\"Hewitt\">Hewitt 251 (2006)</ref> If someone is submerged in water, no matter which way that person tilts his/her head, the person will feel the same amount of water pressure on his/her ears. Because a liquid can flow, this pressure isn't only downward. Pressure is seen acting sideways when water spurts sideways from a leak in the side of an upright can. Pressure also acts upward, as demonstrated when someone tries to push a beach ball beneath the surface of the water. The bottom of a boat is pushed upward by water pressure ([[buoyancy]]).\n\nWhen a liquid presses against a surface, there is a net force that is perpendicular to the surface. Although pressure doesn't have a specific direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net perpendicular point.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is why water spurting from a hole in a bucket initially exits the bucket in a direction at right angles to the surface of the bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force vectors perpendicular to the inner container surface will increase with increasing depth \u2013 that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of liquid out of the hole is <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2gh}</math>, where ''h'' is the depth below the free surface.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if freely falling the same vertical distance ''h''.\n\n===Kinematic pressure===\n:<math>P=p/\\rho_0</math>\nis the kinematic pressure, where <math>p</math> is the pressure and <math>\\rho_0</math> constant mass density.

The usage of ''P'' vs ''p'' depends upon the field in which one is working, on the nearby presence of other symbols for quantities such as [[Power (physics)|power]] and [[momentum]], and on writing style.\n\n===Formula===\n{{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n[[File:Pressure force area.svg|200px|right]]\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F}{A},</math><ref name=\"Georgia State University, Physics & Astronomy\">{{cite web |url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/press.html |title=Pressure |accessdate=2018-06-14 }}</ref>\nwhere:\n:<math>p</math> is the pressure,\n:<math>F</math> is the magnitude of the [[normal force]],\n:<math>A</math> is the area of the surface on contact.\n\nPressure is a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity. It relates the [[vector area]] element (a vector normal to the surface) with the [[normal force]] acting on it. The pressure is the scalar [[proportionality constant]] that relates the two normal vectors:\n:<math>d\\mathbf{F}_n = -p\\,d\\mathbf{A} = -p\\,\\mathbf{n}\\,dA.</math>\n\nThe minus sign comes from the fact that the force is considered towards the surface element, while the normal vector points outward. The equation has meaning in that, for any surface ''S'' in contact with the fluid, the total force exerted by the fluid on that surface is the [[surface integral]] over ''S'' of the right-hand side of the above equation.\n\nIt is incorrect (although rather usual) to say \"the pressure is directed in such or such direction\". The pressure, as a scalar, has no direction. The force given by the previous relationship to the quantity has a direction, but the pressure does not. If we change the orientation of the surface element, the direction of the normal force changes accordingly, but the pressure remains the same.\n\nPressure is distributed to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. It is a fundamental parameter in [[thermodynamics]], and it is [[conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate]] to [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]].\n\n===Units===\n[[File:Barometer mercury column hg.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury column]]\nThe [[SI]] unit for pressure is the [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]] (Pa), equal to one [[newton (unit)|newton]] per [[square metre]] (N/m<sup>2</sup>, or kg\u00b7m<sup>\u22121</sup>\u00b7s<sup>\u22122</sup>). This name for the unit was added in 1971;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |title=14th Conference of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures |publisher=Bipm.fr |accessdate=2012-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630020548/http://www.bipm.fr/en/convention/cgpm/14/pascal-siemens.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 }}</ref> before that, pressure in SI was expressed simply in newtons per square metre.\n\nOther units of pressure, such as [[pound-force per square inch|pounds per square inch]] (Ibf/in<sup>2</sup>)and [[bar (unit)|bar]], are also in common use. The [[Centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second system of units|CGS]] unit of pressure is the [[barye]] (Ba), equal to 1&nbsp;dyn\u00b7cm<sup>\u22122</sup>, or 0.1&nbsp;Pa. Pressure is sometimes expressed in grams-force or kilograms-force per square centimetre (g/cm<sup>2</sup> or kg/cm<sup>2</sup><!--don't add an f to kg, this is making the point about usage without it-->) and the like without properly identifying the force units. But using the names kilogram, gram, kilogram-force, or gram-force (or their symbols) as units of force is expressly forbidden in SI. The [[technical atmosphere]] (symbol: at) is 1&nbsp;kgf/cm<sup>2</sup> (98.0665&nbsp;kPa, or 14.223&nbsp;psi).\n\nSince a system under pressure has the potential to perform work on its surroundings, pressure is a measure of potential energy stored per unit volume. It is therefore related to energy density and may be expressed in units such as [[joule]]s per cubic metre (J/m<sup>3</sup>, which is equal to Pa).\nMathematically:\n:<math>p = \\frac{F \\times \\text{distance}}{A \\times \\text{distance}} = \\frac{\\text{work}}{\\text{volume}} = \\frac{\\text{energy (J)}}{\\text{volume }(\\text{m}^3)}.</math>\n\nSome [[meteorologist]]s prefer the hectopascal (hPa) for atmospheric air pressure, which is equivalent to the older unit [[millibar]] (mbar). Similar pressures are given in kilopascals (kPa) in most other fields, where the hecto- prefix is rarely used. The inch of mercury is still used in the United States. Oceanographers usually measure underwater pressure in [[decibar]]s (dbar) because pressure in the ocean increases by approximately one decibar per metre depth.\n \nThe [[Atmosphere (unit)|standard atmosphere]] (atm) is an established constant. It is approximately equal to typical air pressure at Earth [[mean sea level]] and is defined as {{val|101325|u=Pa}}.\n\nBecause pressure is commonly measured by its ability to displace a column of liquid in a [[manometer]], pressures are often expressed as a depth of a particular fluid (e.g., [[centimetres of water]], [[millimetres of mercury]] or [[inches of mercury]]). The most common choices are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) and water; water is nontoxic and readily available, while mercury's high density allows a shorter column (and so a smaller manometer) to be used to measure a given pressure. The pressure exerted by a column of liquid of height ''h'' and density ''\u03c1'' is given by the hydrostatic pressure equation {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''\u03c1gh''}}, where ''g'' is the [[gravitational acceleration]]. Fluid density and local gravity can vary from one reading to another depending on local factors, so the height of a fluid column does not define pressure precisely. When millimetres of mercury or inches of mercury are quoted today, these units are not based on a physical column of mercury; rather, they have been given precise definitions that can be expressed in terms of SI units.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} One millimetre of mercury is approximately equal to one [[torr]]. The water-based units still depend on the density of water, a measured, rather than defined, quantity. These ''manometric units'' are still encountered in many fields. [[Blood pressure]] is measured in millimetres of mercury in most of the world, and lung pressures in centimetres of water are still common.\n\n[[Underwater diving|Underwater divers]] use the [[metre sea water]] (msw or MSW) and [[foot sea water]] (fsw or FSW) units of pressure, and these are the standard units for pressure gauges used to measure pressure exposure in [[diving chamber]]s and [[Dive computer|personal decompression computers]].

Although the force applied to the surface is the same, the thumbtack applies more pressure because the point concentrates that force into a smaller area. Pressure is transmitted to solid boundaries or across arbitrary sections of fluid ''normal to'' these boundaries or sections at every point. Unlike [[stress (physics)|stress]], pressure is defined as a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar quantity]]. The negative [[gradient]] of pressure is called the [[force density]].\n\nAnother example is a knife. If we try to cut with the flat edge, force is distributed over a larger surface area resulting in less pressure, and it will not cut. Whereas using the sharp edge, which has less surface area, results in greater pressure, and so the knife cuts smoothly. This is one example of a practical application of pressure.\n\nFor gases, pressure is sometimes measured not as an ''absolute pressure'', but relative to [[atmospheric pressure]]; such measurements are called ''gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues.

However, whenever equation-of-state properties, such as densities or changes in densities, must be calculated, pressures must be expressed in terms of their absolute values. For instance, if the atmospheric pressure is {{convert|100|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}, a gas (such as helium) at {{convert|200|kPa|psi|abbr=on}} (gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues.

Focusing on gauge<!--Editors are asked to PLEASE check the discussion page for this article before making changes regarding \"gauge\" vs. \"gage\" spelling issues. Much debate has transpired on this issue.--> values, one might erroneously conclude the first sample had twice the density of the second one.\n\n===Scalar nature===\nIn a static [[gas]], the gas as a whole does not appear to move. The individual molecules of the gas, however, are in constant [[Brownian motion|random motion]]. Because we are dealing with an extremely large number of molecules and because the motion of the individual molecules is random in every direction, we do not detect any motion. If we enclose the gas within a container, we detect a pressure in the gas from the molecules colliding with the walls of our container. We can put the walls of our container anywhere inside the gas, and the force per unit area (the pressure) is the same. We can shrink the size of our \"container\" down to a very small point (becoming less true as we approach the atomic scale), and the pressure will still have a single value at that point. Therefore, pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense associated with it. Pressure force acts in all directions at a point inside a gas. At the surface of a gas, the pressure force acts perpendicular (at right angle) to the surface.\n\nA closely related quantity is the [[stress (physics)|stress]] tensor ''\u03c3'', which relates the vector force <math>\\mathbf{F}</math> to the \n[[vector area]] <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> via the linear relation <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\sigma\\mathbf{A}</math>.\n\nThis [[tensor]] may be expressed as the sum of the [[viscous stress tensor]] minus the hydrostatic pressure. The negative of the stress tensor is sometimes called the pressure tensor, but in the following, the term \"pressure\" will refer only to the scalar pressure.\n\nAccording to the theory of [[general relativity]], pressure increases the strength of a gravitational field (see [[stress\u2013energy tensor]]) and so adds to the mass-energy cause of [[gravity]]. This effect is unnoticeable at everyday pressures but is significant in [[neutron star]]s, although it has not been experimentally tested.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10509-009-0016-8 |title=Einstein's gravity under pressure |accessdate=2012-03-27 |doi=10.1007/s10509-009-0016-8 |volume=321 |issue=2 |journal=Astrophysics and Space Science |pages=151\u2013156|arxiv=0705.0825 |bibcode=2009Ap&SS.321..151V |year=2009 |last1=Vishwakarma |first1=Ram Gopal }}</ref>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Fluid pressure===\n\n'''Fluid pressure''' is most often the compressive stress at some point within a [[fluid]].

Such conditions conform with principles of [[fluid statics]]. The pressure at any given point of a non-moving (static) fluid is called the '''hydrostatic pressure'''. <!--For bolding note that this page is the target of redirection from \"hydrostatic pressure\"-->\n\nClosed bodies of fluid are either \"static\", when the fluid is not moving, or \"dynamic\", when the fluid can move as in either a pipe or by compressing an air gap in a closed container.

Consequently, although a fluid moving at higher speed will have a lower [[static pressure]], it may have a higher stagnation pressure when forced to a standstill. Static pressure and stagnation pressure are related by:\n:<math>p_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 + p</math>\n\nwhere \n:<math>p_0</math> is the [[stagnation pressure]]\n:<math>v</math> is the flow velocity\n:<math>p</math> is the static pressure.\n\nThe pressure of a moving fluid can be measured using a [[Pitot tube]], or one of its variations such as a [[Kiel probe]] or [[Cobra probe]], connected to a [[manometer]].

All liquids and [[solid]]s have a tendency to [[evaporate]] into a gaseous form, and all [[gas]]es have a tendency to [[condense]] back to their liquid or solid form.\n\nThe [[atmospheric pressure]] [[boiling point]] of a liquid (also known as the [[normal boiling point]]) is the temperature at which the vapor pressure equals the ambient atmospheric pressure. With any incremental increase in that temperature, the vapor pressure becomes sufficient to overcome atmospheric pressure and lift the liquid to form vapour bubbles inside the bulk of the substance. [[liquid bubble|Bubble]] formation deeper in the liquid requires a higher pressure, and therefore higher temperature, because the fluid pressure increases above the atmospheric pressure as the depth increases.\n\nThe vapor pressure that a single component in a mixture contributes to the total pressure in the system is called [[partial pressure|partial vapor pressure]].\n\n===Liquid pressure===\n{{See also|Fluid statics#Pressure in fluids at rest}}\n{{Continuum mechanics}}\nWhen a person swims under the water, water pressure is felt acting on the person's eardrums. The deeper that person swims, the greater the pressure. The pressure felt is due to the weight of the water above the person. As someone swims deeper, there is more water above the person and therefore greater pressure. The pressure a liquid exerts depends on its depth.\n\nLiquid pressure also depends on the density of the liquid. If someone was submerged in a liquid more dense than water, the pressure would be correspondingly greater. Thus, we can say that the depth, density and liquid pressure are directly proportionate. The pressure due to a liquid in liquid columns of constant density or at a depth within a substance is represented by the following formula:\n:<math>p = \\rho gh,</math>\n\nwhere:\n:''p'' is liquid pressure,\n:''g'' is gravity at the surface of overlaying material,\n:''\u03c1'' is [[density]] of liquid,\n:''h'' is height of liquid column or depth within a substance.\n\nAnother way of saying the same formula is the following:\n\n:<math>p = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"60%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n!Derivation of this equation\n|-\n|This is derived from the definitions of pressure and weight density. Consider an area at the bottom of a vessel of liquid. The weight of the column of liquid directly above this area produces pressure. From the definition\n\n:<math>\\text{weight density} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{volume}}</math>\n\nwe can express this weight of liquid as\n\n:<math>\\text{weight} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume},</math>\n\nwhere the volume of the column is simply the area multiplied by the depth. Then we have\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{force}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight}}{\\text{area}} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{volume}}{\\text{area}},</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\frac{\\text{weight density} \\times \\text{(area} \\times \\text{depth)}}{\\text{area}}.</math>\n\nWith the \"area\" in the numerator and the \"area\" in the denominator canceling each other out, we are left with\n\n:<math>\\text{pressure} = \\text{weight density} \\times \\text{depth}.</math>\n\nWritten with symbols, this is our original equation:\n:<math>p= \\rho gh.</math>\n|}\n\nThe pressure a liquid exerts against the sides and bottom of a container depends on the density and the depth of the liquid. If atmospheric pressure is neglected, liquid pressure against the bottom is twice as great at twice the depth; at three times the depth, the liquid pressure is threefold; etc. Or, if the liquid is two or three times as dense, the liquid pressure is correspondingly two or three times as great for any given depth. Liquids are practically incompressible \u2013 that is, their volume can hardly be changed by pressure (water volume decreases by only 50 millionths of its original volume for each atmospheric increase in pressure). Thus, except for small changes produced by temperature, the density of a particular liquid is practically the same at all depths.\n\nAtmospheric pressure pressing on the surface of a liquid must be taken into account when trying to discover the ''total'' pressure acting on a liquid. The total pressure of a liquid, then, is ''\u03c1gh'' plus the pressure of the atmosphere. When this distinction is important, the term ''total pressure'' is used. Otherwise, discussions of liquid pressure refer to pressure without regard to the normally ever-present atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe pressure does not depend on the ''amount'' of liquid present. Volume is not the important factor \u2013 depth is. The average water pressure acting against a dam depends on the average depth of the water and not on the volume of water held back. For example, a wide but shallow lake with a depth of {{convert|3|m|0|abbr=on}} exerts only half the average pressure that a small {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} deep pond does. (The ''total force'' applied to the longer dam will be greater, due to the greater total surface area for the pressure to act upon. But for a given {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide section of each dam, the {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water will apply one quarter the force of {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep water). A person will feel the same pressure whether his/her head is dunked a metre beneath the surface of the water in a small pool or to the same depth in the middle of a large lake. If four vases contain different amounts of water but are all filled to equal depths, then a fish with its head dunked a few centimetres under the surface will be acted on by water pressure that is the same in any of the vases. If the fish swims a few centimetres deeper, the pressure on the fish will increase with depth and be the same no matter which vase the fish is in. If the fish swims to the bottom, the pressure will be greater, but it makes no difference what vase it is in. All vases are filled to equal depths, so the water pressure is the same at the bottom of each vase, regardless of its shape or volume. If water pressure at the bottom of a vase were greater than water pressure at the bottom of a neighboring vase, the greater pressure would force water sideways and then up the narrower vase to a higher level until the pressures at the bottom were equalized. Pressure is depth dependent, not volume dependent, so there is a reason that water seeks its own level.\n\nRestating this as energy equation, the energy per unit volume in an ideal, incompressible liquid is constant throughout its vessel. At the surface, gravitational potential energy is large but liquid pressure energy is low. At the bottom of the vessel, all the gravitational potential energy is converted to pressure energy. The sum of pressure energy and gravitational potential energy per unit volume is constant throughout the volume of the fluid and the two energy components change linearly with the depth.<ref>Streeter, V. L., ''Fluid Mechanics'', Example&nbsp;3.5, McGraw&ndash;Hill Inc. (1966), New York.</ref>  Mathematically, it is described by [[Bernoulli's equation]], where velocity head is zero and comparisons per unit volume in the vessel are\n:<math>\\frac{p}{\\gamma} + z = \\mathrm{const}.</math>\n\nTerms have the same meaning as in [[#Fluid pressure|section Fluid pressure]].\n\n===Direction of liquid pressure===\nAn experimentally determined fact about liquid pressure is that it is exerted equally in all directions.<ref name=\"Hewitt\">Hewitt 251 (2006)</ref> If someone is submerged in water, no matter which way that person tilts his/her head, the person will feel the same amount of water pressure on his/her ears. Because a liquid can flow, this pressure isn't only downward. Pressure is seen acting sideways when water spurts sideways from a leak in the side of an upright can. Pressure also acts upward, as demonstrated when someone tries to push a beach ball beneath the surface of the water. The bottom of a boat is pushed upward by water pressure ([[buoyancy]]).\n\nWhen a liquid presses against a surface, there is a net force that is perpendicular to the surface. Although pressure doesn't have a specific direction, force does. A submerged triangular block has water forced against each point from many directions, but components of the force that are not perpendicular to the surface cancel each other out, leaving only a net perpendicular point.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is why water spurting from a hole in a bucket initially exits the bucket in a direction at right angles to the surface of the bucket in which the hole is located. Then it curves downward due to gravity. If there are three holes in a bucket (top, bottom, and middle), then the force vectors perpendicular to the inner container surface will increase with increasing depth \u2013 that is, a greater pressure at the bottom makes it so that the bottom hole will shoot water out the farthest. The force exerted by a fluid on a smooth surface is always at right angles to the surface. The speed of liquid out of the hole is <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2gh}</math>, where ''h'' is the depth below the free surface.<ref name=\"Hewitt\" /> This is the same speed the water (or anything else) would have if freely falling the same vertical distance ''h''.\n\n===Kinematic pressure===\n:<math>P=p/\\rho_0</math>\nis the kinematic pressure, where <math>p</math> is the pressure and <math>\\rho_0</math> constant mass density. The SI unit of ''P'' is m<sup>2</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>. Kinematic pressure is used in the same manner as [[kinematic viscosity]] <math>\\nu</math> in order to compute the [[Navier\u2013Stokes equation]] without explicitly showing the density <math>\\rho_0</math>.\n\n;Navier\u2013Stokes equation with kinematic quantities\n:<math> \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + (u \\nabla) u = - \\nabla P + \\nu \\nabla^2 u. </math>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{cmn|\n*{{annotated link|Atmospheric pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Blood pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Boyle's law}}\n*{{annotated link|Combined gas law}}\n*{{annotated link|Conversion of units}}\n*{{annotated link|Critical point (thermodynamics)}}\n*{{annotated link|Dimensional analysis}}\n*{{annotated link|Dynamic pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Electric potential}}\n*{{annotated link|Electron degeneracy pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Hydraulics}}\n*{{annotated link|Internal pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Kinetic theory of gases#Pressure and kinetic energy|Kinetic theory}}\n*{{annotated link|Microphone}}\n*{{annotated link|Orders of magnitude (pressure)}}\n*{{annotated link|Partial pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Pressure measurement}}\n*{{annotated link|Pressure sensor}}\n*{{annotated link|Sound pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Static pressure}}\n*{{annotated link|Timeline of temperature and pressure measurement technology}}\n*{{annotated link|Torricelli's law}}\n*{{annotated link|Vacuum}}\n*{{annotated link|Vacuum pump}}\n*{{annotated link|Vertical pressure variation}}\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.physnet.org/modules/pdf_modules/m48.pdf ''Introduction to Fluid Statics and Dynamics''] on [http://www.physnet.org/ Project PHYSNET]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100106203418/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/pressure.html Pressure being a scalar quantity]\n*[http://www.wikiunits.org wikiUnits.org - Convert units of pressure]\n\n{{Underwater diving}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Atmospheric thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Underwater diving physics]]\n[[Category:Concepts in physics]]\n[[Category:Fluid dynamics]]\n[[Category:Fluid mechanics]]\n[[Category:Hydraulics]]\n[[Category:Pressure| ]]\n[[Category:Thermodynamic properties]]\n[[Category:State functions]]\n", "name_user": "Martinkat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eUnits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure"}

Nepal Idol was hosted by television actor and model Sushil Nepal and actress, model, VJ and television journalist [[Reema Bishwokarma]]. After announcement of season 2 Sushil Nepal, who left to host another singing reality show [[The Voice of Nepal]],  was replaced by Aasif Shah, Television Producer, music video and tvc director, singer and actor from famous Nepali movie, [[Dui Rupaiya|'Dui Rupiyan]]'. For season 3, new host Mampi Ghosh was there to replace Reema Bishwokarma, who moved to Comedy Chamipons. In 2019, Asif Shah and Mampi Ghosh, previously known as Pawankali will host the third season.\n\n===Judges===\nA preselected panel of music industry representatives are given to judge the contestants in prejudge round which is not televised. Actual panel of judges of three or five judge the contestants from Televised Audition to Grand Finale. In Nepal Idol, in season one and two the judges were [[Nhyoo Bajracharya]], [[Indira Joshi]] and [[Kali Prasad Baskota]]. Bajracharya is a music composer and singer.

Each stage of the theatre round, a number of contestants are eliminated and sent home by the judges, very few contestants brought back during the Wildcards show.\n\n*Paino Round: After theatre, top 18 or top 20 contestants are selected. They are divided into 8 or 10 within themselves and 3 or 4 are eliminated from the round. Eliminated contestants are brought back during wildcard shows. \n\n*Gala Round: The gala occurs usually pre-recorded where contestants sing in a television studio fully televised; again judges give critiques but beginning at this stage, home viewers vote via telephone and SMS (and in some countries other voting mechanisms including via Internet or who they want to stay in the competition. The contestants are judged by 50% audience vote and 50% judges marking. Gala usually consists of 12 contestants where they perform individually or in a group (usually in elimination day) semi-final contestants sing every week until all finalists have been chosen. Wildcards episode is also featured. Judges can use veto power of no elimination for only one time.\n\n*Grand Finale:  The Grand Finale occurs when there are three contestants left in the competition. This is the pinnacle of the entire series and often highest-rated show; also for some countries, it is venued in a prestigious location. There are usually group performances and/or special musical guests. Also, it has the best moments of the series which leads up to the announcement of the winner, which is determined by the highest number of votes. When that happens, he or she will perform an encore of the coronation single which sometimes includes pyrotechnics/fireworks. In every round, the set is often changed.\n\n==Season 1 (2017)==\nNepal Idol Season 1 was directed by Laxman Paudyal. Assistant Directors were Mohan raj Adhikari, Babu Surace D.C. and Manoj K.C.(Samaya). This is the first-ever international franchise show held in the country.

Eliminated contestants are brought back during wildcard shows. \n\n*Gala Round: The gala occurs usually pre-recorded where contestants sing in a television studio fully televised; again judges give critiques but beginning at this stage, home viewers vote via telephone and SMS (and in some countries other voting mechanisms including via Internet or who they want to stay in the competition. The contestants are judged by 50% audience vote and 50% judges marking. Gala usually consists of 12 contestants where they perform individually or in a group (usually in elimination day) semi-final contestants sing every week until all finalists have been chosen. Wildcards episode is also featured. Judges can use veto power of no elimination for only one time.\n\n*Grand Finale:  The Grand Finale occurs when there are three contestants left in the competition. This is the pinnacle of the entire series and often highest rated show; also for some countries, it is venued in a prestigious location. There are usually group performances and/or special musical guests. Also, it has the best moments of the series which leads up to the announcement of the winner, which is determined by the highest number of votes. When that happens, he or she will perform an encore of the coronation single which sometimes includes pyrotechnics/fireworks. In every round, the set is often changed.\n\n==Season 1 (2017)==\nNepal Idol Season 1 was directed by Laxman Paudyal.

Poetry, drama, historical plays and paintings received great impetus.  The number of newspapers, magazines and radio increased, with greater acceptance of [[vernacular]] and regional media.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nBorn at Rajnandgaon in [[Chhattisgarh]] on 15 October 1929, Surendra had his early education at [[Sikandarpur]] (District Farukhabad), Gwalior and [[Holipura]] in District Agra.
