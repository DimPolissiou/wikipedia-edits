In the first half of the 16th century (approximately 1530) residents of this area, under the leadership of a Vojnovi\u0107 from [[Glamo\u010d]], migrated to the surroundings of Zagreb (Metlika Zumberak and four surrounding villages). The greater area was populated in Roman Times as evidenced by the remains of Roman roads and signposts.\n\n===Austro-Hungarian Rule===\nIn 1878 Drvar, along with the rest of Bosnia, was [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|subjugated to Austro-Hungarian rule]]. Around 1893 German industrialist {{ill|Otto von Steinbeis|de}} leased the right to exploit fir and spruce forests in the mountains of Klekova\u010da, Lunjeva\u010de, Srnetica and Osje\u010denica. Steinbeis operated in the area until 1918 when, after the [[First World War]], the company was taken over by the new Yugoslav state. During the 25 years that Steinbeis operated in the area, he created a complete infrastructure for processing forest products including the construction of modern lumber mills in Drvar and Dobrljin, and the construction of a network of roads and 400&nbsp;km of narrow-gauge railway, and telephone and telegraph lines.<ref>[http://othes.univie.ac.at/417/1/02-12-2008_8606753.pdf], Helga Berdan: Die Machtpolitik \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns und der Eisenbahnbau in Bosnien-Herzegowina 1872\u20131914, Magisterarbeit, Wien 2008</ref> During this time Drvar grew into an industrial town employing approximately 2800 persons in which homes, hospitals, restaurants, cafe and retails shops were built. Additional factories appeared in Drvar, including a cellulose factory opened by Alphons Simunius Blumer.\n\nEventually, poor labor conditions led to the first organized strikes in Drvar in 1906.  These strikes continued until 1911 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire banned all such activities.\n\n===20th century===\n1918 saw the fall of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the rise of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], but this did not help the plight of the workers in Drvar, who became better organized and rose up to strike again in 1921.\n\n===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Drvar was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. In 1932, an economic crisis resulted in the layoff of 2,000 workers.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Marshal Tito during the Second World War in Yugoslavia, May 1944.jpg|thumb|279x279px|right|Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] (right) with his cabinet in Drvar, 1944]]\n[[File:Titova pe\u0107ina - Drvar.jpg|thumb|277x277px|Tito's cave headquarters]]\nIn more recent history, Drvar is perhaps most famous as the location of a daring [[airdrop]] [[Raid on Drvar|raid on Drvar]], codenamed \"Operation R\u00f6sselsprung\", on May 25, 1944, by Nazi German invaders, in an attempt to assassinate [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]. Tito, the main [[Yugoslav Partisan|Partisan]] commander, was sheltered in the Partisan General Staff headquarters in what is now called \"Tito's Cave\" in the hills near Drvar at the time.\n\nDuring the 4 years and 1 months of the war, Drvar was under occupation for just 390 days. 767 Drvar civilians were killed and only 13 pre-war houses still stood. Approximately 93% of the infrastructure of the town was destroyed, and the livestock population had been reduced by more than 80%.\n\nDrvar was first occupied by the German army in April 1941, followed shortly thereafter by the Italians. Drvar continued to experience fierce fighting through mid-1942 when the last of the German and Italian forces were expelled.  The Germans re-entered Drvar in 1943 and left it a burned ruin when they departed.\n\nDuring the summer 1941, [[Chetniks]] expelled and killed members of the Croatian nation and Catholics in Drvar area. The most significant event was the [[Trubar massacre]], a civilian massacre committed by Chetniks on 27 July 1941.<ref>{{cite web|last1=\u010cutura|first1=Vlado|title=Ra\u0111a se novi \u017eivot na mu\u010deni\u010dkoj krvi|url=http://www.glas-koncila.hr/index.php?option=com_php&Itemid=41&news_ID=22942|website=Glas Koncila|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Vuk\u0161i\u0107|first1=Tomo|title=\"Dan ustanka\" - ubojstvo \u017eupnika iz Drvara i Bosanskog Grahova|url=http://www.katolicki-tjednik.com/vijest.asp?n_UID=1598|website=Katoli\u010dki tjednik|accessdate=30 December 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310123301/http://www.katolicki-tjednik.com/vijest.asp?n_UID=1598|archivedate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 10, [[Usta\u0161e]], aligned with [[Nazi]] Germany, declared the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) and claimed as part of its territory the entire area known as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  In Drvar, this resulted in the beginning of the presence of the Usta\u0161e government, the movement chiefly responsible for the World War II Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia in which Serbs, Jews, Roma, Croat and Bosniak resistance members and political opponents were sent to concentration camps and killed. In the beginning the Usta\u0161e contingent in Drvar consisted of the Croatian population residing in Drvar, but they were soon reinforced by others who came from outside Drvar.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In June 1941 Usta\u0161e arrested a large group of prominent Drvar citizens, and took them to Risovac near Bosanski Petrovac, where they were tortured, killed and thrown into a pit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Drvar citizens fought the Usta\u0161e, forming highly organized guerrilla detachments with Kameni\u010dki, Javorje, Crljivi\u010dko-zaglavi\u010dki, Boboljusko-cvjetni\u010dki, Trubarski, Mokronog and Ti\u010devski, and Grahovo area Grahovsko-resanovski.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===SFR Yugoslavia===\nIn the years following the war, Drvar was rebuilt, its timber industry restored, and new metal, fabrication, and carpet industries developed. Eventually, electricity was brought to outlying villages.  Over time, it became a tourist destination attracting approximately 200,000 visitors a year, primarily to Tito's Cave, and on November 24, 1981, Drvar changed its name to Titov Drvar.\n\n===Bosnian War===\nIn 1995, Drvar (as well as some other municipalities) was taken over by Croatian forces, and the Serb population fled. Many of them moved to [[Banja Luka]]. During this period, Drvar was nearly deserted. Leading up to 1995, Drvar was populated almost entirely by Bosnian Serbs. During the [[Bosnian War]] between 1992 and 1995, Drvar was controlled by what is now called the [[Republika Srpska]].\n\nOn 3 August 1995, the Croatian Armed Forces with the help of Bosnian Croats began shelling Drvar, from the mountain of \u0160ator. Two Drvar citizens were killed and older men and women began to evacuate to Petrovac. One day later, the Croatian Government armed forces began \"Operation Storm\", called by European Union Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia Carl Bildt, \"the most efficient ethnic cleansing we've seen in the Balkans\",<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BInS_EkHIUsC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false/ Pearl, Daniel (2002), At Home in the World: Collected Writings from The Wall Street Journal, Simon and Schuster, p. 224] {{ISBN|0-7432-4415-X}}</ref> in the \"Dalmatinska zagora\" region of Croatia, and columns of hundreds of thousands of refugees in cars, on tractors, wagons and on foot began to pass through Drvar as they fled their homes in Croatia. The shelling on the outlying areas of Drvar by Croatian Government forces was renewed and continued for days.\n\n====Aftermath====\nIn late 1995, after the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Accord]] was signed, Drvar became part of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], after which Croat politicians enticed up to 6,000 Bosnian Croats, mainly displaced persons from central Bosnia, to move to Drvar, by promising such things as jobs and keys to vacant homes. A further 2,500 Croat [[Croatian Defence Council|HVO]] troops and their families were stationed there, also occupying the homes of displaced Bosnian Serb citizens.<ref name=\"impunity\">[[International Crisis Group]], [http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/files/europe/balkans/bosnia-herzegovina/bosnia%2019.ashx Impunity in Drvar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212025944/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/files/europe/balkans/bosnia-herzegovina/bosnia%2019.ashx |date=February 12, 2011 }}, 20 August 1998</ref>  This drastically changed the population and from 1995-1999 the population was primarily Croatian.\n\nIn 1996, small numbers of Serbs began to try to return to their homes but faced harassment and discrimination by the Croats.

The Drvar area is still one of the largest logging and wood-processing environments in BiH. One of the major problems in this area is the widespread corruption connected to this wood-processing industry. It is estimated that during 2004 about 110,000m <sup>3</sup> of wood 'disappeared'. Average price of 1m <sup>3</sup> of timber (second class) is about 100&nbsp;km (100 Konvertible Mark = 50 Euros).\n\n==Features==\nA \"Desant na Drvar\" is a movie made about the German attack on Drvar. There are still some locations in area, which were heavily fought over in that period, that still seem to be untouched by time.\n\nFamous landmarks include \"Tito's Cave\" and the so-called \"Citadel\". At the latter mentioned location one can find an Austrian-Hungarian cemetery (in a very poor state) which may contain some (unknown) number of German soldiers buried after the attack of 1944. On this spot there is also a Roman road sign (+/- 100 AD). Another one can be found on the way to [[Bosanski Petrovac]] near [[Zaglavica]].\n\nDrvar is also renowned for its local [[rakia|rakija]], a type of plum or cranberry brandy, originating in [[Serbia]] but popular all over the [[Balkans]].\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Petar Pe\u0107anac]], first man who climbed Mount Everest from BIH and Republika Srpska in 2007\n* [[Sa\u0161a Adamovi\u0107]], doctor of cryptology\n* [[Andrea Arsovi\u0107]], sports shooting\n* [[Radomir Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Olympic medalist in judo\n* [[Milan Rodi\u0107]], professional football player\n* [[Marija Bursa\u0107]], National Hero of Yugoslavia\n* [[Milka Bosni\u0107]], national hero\n* [[Nikola \u0160piri\u0107]], Former Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Dejan Mati\u0107]], singer\n* [[Sa\u0161a Mati\u0107]], singer\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canton 10]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Drvar}}\n* {{official website|http://www.opstinadrvar.net}}\n\n{{Settlements of Drvar}}\n{{Canton-10}}\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{Hero Cities of SFRJ}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Drvar| ]]\n[[Category:Serb communities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement <!--more fields are available for this Infobox--See Template:Infobox Settlement-->\n| official_name          = Drvar\n| native_name            = \u0414\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440\n| settlement_type        = [[List of cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Town]] and [[Municipalities of Bosnia and Herzegovina|municipality]]\n| image_skyline          = Drvar Total View.jpg\n| image_caption          = Panorama of Drvar\n| subdivision_type1      = [[Countries of the world|Country]]\n| subdivision_name1      = [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n| subdivision_type2      = [[Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Entity]]\n| subdivision_name2      = [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n| subdivision_type3      = [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Canton]]\n| subdivision_name3      = [[Canton 10]]\n| timezone               = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset             = +1\n| timezone_DST           = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST         = +2\n| leader_title           = Municipality&nbsp;president\n| leader_name            = Du\u0161ica Runi\u0107\n| leader_party           = [[Alliance of Independent Social Democrats|SNSD]]\n| image_shield           = \n| area_total_km2         = 589.3\n| elevation_m            = 480\n| population_total       = 7506\n| population_footnotes   = \n| population_as_of       = 2013 census\n| population_density_km2 = auto\n| pushpin_map            = Bosnia and Herzegovina\n| pushpin_label_position = <!-- the position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n| pushpin_map_caption    = Location in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n| pushpin_mapsize        = \n| website                = {{url|http://www.opstinadrvar.net}}\n| coordinates            = {{coord|44|22|N|16|23|E|region:BA|display=inline,title}}\n| area_code              = +387 34\n| parts                  = \n}}\n\n'''Drvar''' ([[Cyrillic]]: \u0414\u0440\u0432\u0430\u0440, {{IPA-sh|d\u0159\u0329\u028ba\u02d0r|pron}}) is a town and municipality located in [[Canton 10]] of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], an entity of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

During the 25 years that Steinbeis operated in the area, he created a complete infrastructure for processing forest products including the construction of modern lumber mills in Drvar and Dobrljin, and the construction of a network of roads and 400&nbsp;km of narrow-gauge railway, and telephone and telegraph lines.<ref>[http://othes.univie.ac.at/417/1/02-12-2008_8606753.pdf], Helga Berdan: Die Machtpolitik \u00d6sterreich-Ungarns und der Eisenbahnbau in Bosnien-Herzegowina 1872\u20131914, Magisterarbeit, Wien 2008</ref> During this time Drvar grew into an industrial town employing approximately 2800 persons in which homes, hospitals, restaurants, cafe and retails shops were built. Additional factories appeared in Drvar, including a cellulose factory opened by Alphons Simunius Blumer.\n\nEventually, poor labor conditions led to the first organized strikes in Drvar in 1906.  These strikes continued until 1911 when the Austro-Hungarian Empire banned all such activities.\n\n===20th century===\n1918 saw the fall of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the rise of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], but this did not help the plight of the workers in Drvar, who became better organized and rose up to strike again in 1921.\n\n===Kingdom of Yugoslavia===\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Drvar was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. In 1932, an economic crisis resulted in the layoff of 2,000 workers.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Marshal Tito during the Second World War in Yugoslavia, May 1944.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]] (right) with his cabinet in Drvar, 1944]]\n[[File:Titova pe\u0107ina - Drvar.jpg|thumb|220px|Tito's cave headquarters]]\nIn more recent history, Drvar is perhaps most famous as the location of a daring [[airdrop]] [[Raid on Drvar|raid on Drvar]], codenamed \"Operation R\u00f6sselsprung\", on May 25, 1944, by Nazi German invaders, in an attempt to assassinate [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]. Tito, the main [[Yugoslav Partisan|Partisan]] commander, was sheltered in the Partisan General Staff headquarters in what is now called \"Tito's Cave\" in the hills near Drvar at the time.\n\nDuring the 4 years and 1 months of the war, Drvar was under occupation for just 390 days. 767 Drvar civilians were killed and only 13 pre-war houses still stood. Approximately 93% of the infrastructure of the town was destroyed, and the livestock population had been reduced by more than 80%.\n\nDrvar was first occupied by the German army in April 1941, followed shortly thereafter by the Italians. Drvar continued to experience fierce fighting through mid-1942 when the last of the German and Italian forces were expelled.  The Germans re-entered Drvar in 1943 and left it a burned ruin when they departed.\n\nDuring the summer 1941, [[Chetniks]] expelled and killed members of the Croatian nation and Catholics in Drvar area. The most significant event was the [[Trubar massacre]], a civilian massacre committed by Chetniks on 27 July 1941.<ref>{{cite web|last1=\u010cutura|first1=Vlado|title=Ra\u0111a se novi \u017eivot na mu\u010deni\u010dkoj krvi|url=http://www.glas-koncila.hr/index.php?option=com_php&Itemid=41&news_ID=22942|website=Glas Koncila|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Vuk\u0161i\u0107|first1=Tomo|title=\"Dan ustanka\" - ubojstvo \u017eupnika iz Drvara i Bosanskog Grahova|url=http://www.katolicki-tjednik.com/vijest.asp?n_UID=1598|website=Katoli\u010dki tjednik|accessdate=30 December 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310123301/http://www.katolicki-tjednik.com/vijest.asp?n_UID=1598|archivedate=10 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn April 10, [[Usta\u0161e]], aligned with [[Nazi]] Germany, declared the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) and claimed as part of its territory the entire area known as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].  In Drvar, this resulted in the beginning of the presence of the Usta\u0161e government, the movement chiefly responsible for the World War II Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia in which Serbs, Jews, Roma, Croat and Bosniak resistance members and political opponents were sent to concentration camps and killed. In the beginning the Usta\u0161e contingent in Drvar consisted of the Croatian population residing in Drvar, but they were soon reinforced by others who came from outside Drvar.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In June 1941 Usta\u0161e arrested a large group of prominent Drvar citizens, and took them to Risovac near Bosanski Petrovac, where they were tortured, killed and thrown into a pit.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Drvar citizens fought the Usta\u0161e, forming highly organized guerrilla detachments with Kameni\u010dki, Javorje, Crljivi\u010dko-zaglavi\u010dki, Boboljusko-cvjetni\u010dki, Trubarski, Mokronog and Ti\u010devski, and Grahovo area Grahovsko-resanovski.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===SFR Yugoslavia===\nIn the years following the war, Drvar was rebuilt, its timber industry restored, and new metal, fabrication, and carpet industries developed. Eventually, electricity was brought to outlying villages.  Over time, it became a tourist destination attracting approximately 200,000 visitors a year, primarily to Tito's Cave, and on November 24, 1981, Drvar changed its name to Titov Drvar.\n\n===Bosnian War===\nIn 1995, Drvar (as well as some other municipalities) was taken over by Croatian forces, and the Serb population fled. Many of them moved to [[Banja Luka]]. During this period, Drvar was nearly deserted. Leading up to 1995, Drvar was populated almost entirely by Bosnian Serbs. During the [[Bosnian War]] between 1992 and 1995, Drvar was controlled by what is now called the [[Republika Srpska]].\n\nOn 3 August 1995, the Croatian Armed Forces with the help of Bosnian Croats began shelling Drvar, from the mountain of \u0160ator. Two Drvar citizens were killed and older men and women began to evacuate to Petrovac. One day later, the Croatian Government armed forces began \"Operation Storm\", called by European Union Special Envoy to the Former Yugoslavia Carl Bildt, \"the most efficient ethnic cleansing we've seen in the Balkans\",<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=BInS_EkHIUsC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false/ Pearl, Daniel (2002), At Home in the World: Collected Writings from The Wall Street Journal, Simon and Schuster, p. 224] {{ISBN|0-7432-4415-X}}</ref> in the \"Dalmatinska zagora\" region of Croatia, and columns of hundreds of thousands of refugees in cars, on tractors, wagons and on foot began to pass through Drvar as they fled their homes in Croatia. The shelling on the outlying areas of Drvar by Croatian Government forces was renewed and continued for days.\n\n====Aftermath====\nIn late 1995, after the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Peace Accord]] was signed, Drvar became part of the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], after which Croat politicians enticed up to 6,000 Bosnian Croats, mainly displaced persons from central Bosnia, to move to Drvar, by promising such things as jobs and keys to vacant homes. A further 2,500 Croat [[Croatian Defence Council|HVO]] troops and their families were stationed there, also occupying the homes of displaced Bosnian Serb citizens.<ref name=\"impunity\">[[International Crisis Group]], [http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/files/europe/balkans/bosnia-herzegovina/bosnia%2019.ashx Impunity in Drvar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212025944/http://www.crisisgroup.org/~/media/files/europe/balkans/bosnia-herzegovina/bosnia%2019.ashx |date=February 12, 2011 }}, 20 August 1998</ref>  This drastically changed the population and from 1995-1999 the population was primarily Croatian.\n\nIn 1996, small numbers of Serbs began to try to return to their homes but faced harassment and discrimination by the Croats.

The local government and companies, the few that exist, are dominated by the Croats, and Serbs have difficulty finding employment.\n\n===Modern===\nSince the end of the Bosnian War, about 5,000 Bosnian Serb residents have returned to Drvar.{{citation_needed|date=August 2019}} However, unemployment in the town stands at 80% and many residents blame the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the poor economic situation.<ref>{{cite web| publisher= BBC| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-21664488| author= | title= Bosnia town holds 'funeral' to protest at unemployment| date= 4 March 2013| accessdate= 6 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher=RTS| url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/11/Region/1371710/Dejtonska+sudbina+Drvara+.html| title=Dejtonska sudbina Drvara| date=3 August 2013| accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, the [[President of Serbia]] [[Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107]] made an official visit to Drvar, along with the [[List of members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serb Member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] [[Milorad Dodik]].<ref name=\"vucic2019\">{{cite news |title=Vu\u010di\u0107: Jedinstveni za opstanak; Ne me\u0161am se u unutra\u0161nje stvari BiH |url=https://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2019&mm=09&dd=13&nav_category=11&nav_id=1590968 |accessdate=13 September 2019 |work=b92.net |agency=Tanjug |date=13 September 2019 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\nDrvar is a member of the [[Alliance of Serb Municipalities]]. \n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Drvar, the following settlements comprise the municipality:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Ata\u0161evac]]\n* [[Bastasi (Drvar)|Bastasi]]\n* [[Boboljusci]]\n* [[Bosanski Osredci]]\n* [[Brda (Drvar)|Brda]]\n* [[Bun\u010devac]]\n* Drvar Selo\n* [[Gornji Ti\u0161kovac]]\n* [[Gruborski Naslon]]\n* [[Kamenica (Drvar)|Kamenica]]\n* [[Ljeskovica (Drvar)|Ljeskovica]]\n* [[Mali Cvjetni\u0107]]\n* [[Malo O\u010dijevo]]\n\n* [[Mokronoge (Drvar)|Mokronoge]]\n* [[Motike (Drvar)|Motike]]\n* [[Mr\u0111e]]\n* [[O\u010digrije]]\n* [[Palu\u010dci]]\n* [[Podi\u0107]]\n* [[Podovi (Drvar)|Podovi]]\n* [[Poljice, Drvar|Poljice]]\n* [[Potoci (Drvar)|Potoci]]\n* [[Prekaja]]\n* [[Srnetica]]\n* [[\u0160ajinovac]]\n* [[\u0160ipovljani]]\n* [[Trnini\u0107 Brijeg]]\n* [[Trubar (Drvar)|Trubar]]\n* [[Uvala]]\n* [[Veliki Cvjetni\u0107]]\n* [[Veliko O\u010dijevo]]\n* [[Vidovo Selo]]\n* [[Vrto\u010de (Drvar)|Vrto\u010de]]\n* [[Zaglavic]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Drvar Church.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Serbian Orthodox Church]]\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality has a population of 7,036 inhabitants.\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n{| class=wikitable\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

The Drvar area is still one of the largest logging and wood-processing environments in BiH. One of the major problems in this area is the widespread corruption connected to this wood-processing industry. It is estimated that during 2004 about 110,000m <sup>3</sup> of wood 'disappeared'. Average price of 1m <sup>3</sup> of timber (second class) is about 100&nbsp;km (100 Konvertible Mark = 50 Euros).\n\n==Features==\nA \"Desant na Drvar\" is a movie made about the German attack on Drvar. There are still some locations in area, which were heavily fought over in that period, that still seem to be untouched by time.\n\nFamous landmarks include \"Tito's Cave\" and the so-called \"Citadel\". At the latter mentioned location one can find an Austrian-Hungarian cemetery (in a very poor state) which may contain some (unknown) number of German soldiers buried after the attack of 1944. On this spot there is also a Roman road sign (+/- 100 AD). Another one can be found on the way to [[Bosanski Petrovac]] near [[Zaglavica]].\n\nDrvar is also renowned for its local [[rakia|rakija]], a type of plum or cranberry brandy, originating in [[Serbia]] but popular all over the [[Balkans]].\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Petar Pe\u0107anac]], first man who climbed Mount Everest from BIH and Republika Srpska in 2007\n* [[Sa\u0161a Adamovi\u0107]], doctor of cryptology\n* [[Andrea Arsovi\u0107]], sports shooting\n* [[Radomir Kova\u010devi\u0107]], Olympic medalist in judo\n* [[Milan Rodi\u0107]], professional football player\n* [[Marija Bursa\u0107]], National Hero of Yugoslavia\n* [[Milka Bosni\u0107]], national hero\n* [[Nikola \u0160piri\u0107]], Former Prime Minister of Bosnia and Herzegovina\n* [[Dejan Mati\u0107]], singer\n* [[Sa\u0161a Mati\u0107]], singer\n\n==See also==\n* [[Canton 10]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Drvar}}\n* {{official website|http://www.opstinadrvar.net}}\n\n{{Settlements of Drvar}}\n{{Canton-10}}\n{{Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{Hero Cities of SFRJ}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Drvar| ]]\n[[Category:Serb communities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n", "name_user": "EcLiPsE285", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drvar"}
