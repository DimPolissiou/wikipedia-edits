It is widely considered to have one of the world's finest collections of [[Art of Europe|European art]], dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and the single best collection of [[Spanish art]]. Founded as a museum of [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]] in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. The Prado Museum is one of the most visited sites in the world, and it is considered one of the [[list of largest art museums|greatest art museums]] in the world. The numerous works by [[Francisco Goya]], the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[El Greco]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Titian]], and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], are some of the highlights of the collection.\n\nThe collection currently comprises around 8,200 drawings, 7,600 paintings, 4,800 prints, and 1,000 sculptures, in addition to many other works of art and historic documents. As of 2012, the museum displayed about 1,300 works in the main buildings, while around 3,100 works were on temporary loan to various museums and official institutions. The remainder were in storage.<ref name=\"collection\">{{cite web| title=The Collection: origins| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/origins/| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012}}See also ''Museo del Prado, Cat\u00e1logo de las pinturas'', 1996,  Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Cultura, Madrid, No ISBN, which lists about 7,800 paintings.

Retrieved 28 June 2013.</ref> It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] museums in Spain.\n\nThe best-known work on display at the museum is ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by Vel\u00e1zquez. Vel\u00e1zquez and his keen eye and sensibility were also responsible for bringing much of the museum's fine collection of Italian masters to Spain, now the largest outside Italy.\n\n==History==\nThe building that is now the home of the Museo Nacional del Prado was designed in 1785 by architect of the [[Enlightenment in Spain]]  [[Juan de Villanueva]] on the orders of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] to house the Natural History Cabinet. Nonetheless, the building's final function was not decided until the monarch's grandson, [[Ferdinand VII]], encouraged by his wife, Queen [[Maria Isabel of Portugal|Mar\u00eda Isabel de Braganza]], decided to use it as a new Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures. The Royal Museum, which would soon become known as the National Museum of Painting and Sculpture, and subsequently the Museo Nacional del Prado, opened to the public for the first time in November 1819. It was created with the double aim of showing the works of art belonging to the Spanish Crown and to demonstrate to the rest of Europe that Spanish art was of equal merit to any other national school.\n\n[[File:Grand hall d'exposition au Mus\u00e9e du Prado.JPG|thumb|left|320px|In the main exhibition hall, first floor]]\nThe first catalogue of the Museum, published in 1819 and solely devoted to Spanish painting, included 311 paintings, although at that time the Museum housed 1,510 from the various royal residences, the Reales Sitios, including works from other schools. The exceptionally important royal collection, which forms the nucleus of the present-day Museo del Prado, started to increase significantly in the 16th century during the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and continued under the succeeding Habsburg and Bourbon monarchs. Their efforts and determination led to the Royal Collection being enriched by some of the masterpieces now to be seen in the Prado. These include ''The Descent from the Cross'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' by Hieronymous Bosch, ''Knight with his Hand on his Breast'' by [[El Greco]], ''The Death of the Virgin'' by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], ''The Holy Family'', known as \"La Perla\", by [[Raphael]], ''Charles V at M\u00fclhberg'' by [[Titian]], ''Christ Washing the Disciples\u2019 Feet'' by [[Tintoretto]], [[D\u00fcrer]]'s ''Self-portrait'', ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by Vel\u00e1zquez, ''[[The Three Graces (Rubens)|The Three Graces]]'' by Rubens, and ''[[The Family of Charles IV]]'' by Goya.\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 220\n   | header    = [[Francisco Goya]]\n   | image1    =Goya Maja naga2.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Francisco Goya, ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', oil on canvas, (circa 1797\u20131800)\n   | image2    = Goya Maja ubrana2.jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = Francisco Goya, ''[[La maja vestida]]'', oil on canvas, (circa 1797\u20131800)\n  }}\n\nIn addition to works from the Spanish royal collection, other holdings increased and enriched the Museum with further masterpieces, such as the two Majas by Goya. Among the now closed museums whose collections have been added to that of the Prado were the Museo de la Trinidad in 1872, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1971. In addition, numerous legacies, donations and purchases have been of crucial importance for the growth of the collection. Various works entered the Prado from the Museo de la Trinidad, including ''The Fountain of Grace'' by the School of Van Eyck, the Santo Domingo and San Pedro Mart\u00edr altarpieces painted for the monastery of Santo Tom\u00e1s in \u00c1vila by [[Pedro Berruguete]], and the five canvases by El Greco executed for the Colegio de do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n. Most of the Museum's 19th-century paintings come from the former Museo de Arte Moderno, including works by the Madrazos, [[Jos\u00e9 de Madrazo y Agudo]] and [[Federico de Madrazo]], [[Vicente L\u00f3pez Porta\u00f1a|Vicente L\u00f3pez]], [[Carlos de Haes]], [[Eduardo Rosales]] and [[Sorolla]].\n\nUpon the deposition of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] in 1868, the museum was nationalized and acquired the new name of \"Museo del Prado\". The building housed the royal collection of arts, and it rapidly proved too small. The first enlargement to the museum took place in 1918. Since the creation of the Museo del Prado more than 2,300 paintings have been incorporated into its collection, as well as numerous sculptures, prints, drawings and works of art through bequests, donations and purchases, which account for most of the New Acquisitions. Numerous bequests have enriched the Museum's holdings, such as the outstanding collection of medals left to the Museum by Pablo Bosch; the drawings and items of decorative art left by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n as well as [[Van der Weyden]]'s masterpiece, ''The Virgin and Child''; and the Ram\u00f3n de Errazu bequest of 19th-century paintings. Particularly important donations include Bar\u00f3n Emile d'Erlanger's gift of Goya's Black Paintings in 1881. Among the numerous works that have entered the collection through purchase are some outstanding ones acquired in recent years including two works by El Greco, ''The Fable'' and ''The Flight into Egypt'' acquired in 1993 and 2001, Goya's ''[[The Countess of Chinchon]]'' bought in 2000, Vel\u00e1zquez's portrait of ''The Pope's Barber'', acquired in 2003 and Fra Angelico's ''Madonna of the Pomegranate'' purchased in 2016.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1900, the Prado helped decorate city halls, new universities, and churches. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] from 1931 to 1936, the focus was on developing provincial museums. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], upon the recommendation of the [[League of Nations]], the museum staff removed 353 paintings, 168 drawings and the Dauphin's Treasure and sent the art to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], then later to [[Girona]], and finally to [[Geneva]]. The art had to be returned across French territory in night trains to the museum upon the commencement of World War II. During the early years of the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], many paintings were sent to embassies.<ref name=\"riding\">{{cite news| author=Alan Riding| date=1 August 1990| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/arts/the-prado-finds-out-what-it-has-and-where.html| title=The Prado Finds Out What It Has and Where| work=[[The New York Times]]| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez en El Prado.JPG|left|thumb|150px|A main promenade entrance is dominated by this 1899 bronze statue of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], by Aniceto Marinas]]\nThe main building was enlarged with short pavilions in the rear between 1900 and 1960.

The building that lodges the Museum of the Prado was initially conceived by [[Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino y Redondo, count of Floridablanca]] and was commissioned in 1785 by Charles III for the ''reurbanizaci\u00f3n'' of the Paseo del Prado. To this end, Charles III called on one of his favorite architects, [[Juan de Villanueva]], author also of the nearby Botanical Garden and the City Hall of Madrid.<ref name=\"chronology\">{{cite web| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/index.php?id=904| title=Chronology of Museo del Prado, 1785| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012|language=es}}</ref>\n\nThe ''prado'' (\"meadow\") that was where the museum now stands gave its name to the area, the Sal\u00f3n del Prado (later [[Paseo del Prado]]), and to the museum itself upon [[nationalisation]]. Work on the building stopped at the conclusion of Charles III's reign and throughout the [[Peninsular War]] and was only initiated again during the reign of Charles III's grandson, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]].

In exchange, the museum gained control of the budget \u2014 now roughly \u20ac35&nbsp;million \u2014 and the power to raise money from corporate donations and merchandising.

It is widely considered to have one of the world's finest collections of [[Art of Europe|European art]], dating from the 12th century to the early 20th century, based on the former Spanish Royal Collection, and the single best collection of [[Spanish art]]. Founded as a museum of [[painting]]s and [[sculpture]] in 1819, it also contains important collections of other types of works. The Prado Museum is one of the most visited sites in the world, and it is considered one of the [[list of largest art museums|greatest art museums]] in the world. The numerous works by [[Francisco Goya]], the single most extensively represented artist, as well as by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[El Greco]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Titian]], and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], are some of the highlights of the collection.\n\nThe collection currently comprises around 8,200 drawings, 7,600 paintings, 4,800 prints, and 1,000 sculptures, in addition to many other works of art and historic documents. As of 2012, the museum displayed about 1,300 works in the main buildings, while around 3,100 works were on temporary loan to various museums and official institutions. The remainder were in storage.<ref name=\"collection\">{{cite web| title=The Collection: origins| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/the-collection/origins/| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012}}See also ''Museo del Prado, Cat\u00e1logo de las pinturas'', 1996,  Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n y Cultura, Madrid, No ISBN, which lists about 7,800 paintings.

Retrieved 28 June 2013.</ref> It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] museums in Spain.\n\nThe best-known work on display at the museum is ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by Vel\u00e1zquez. Vel\u00e1zquez and his keen eye and sensibility were also responsible for bringing much of the museum's fine collection of Italian masters to Spain, now the largest outside Italy.\n\n==History==\nThe building that is now the home of the Museo Nacional del Prado was designed in 1785 by architect of the [[Enlightenment in Spain]]  [[Juan de Villanueva]] on the orders of [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] to house the Natural History Cabinet. Nonetheless, the building's final function was not decided until the monarch's grandson, [[Ferdinand VII]], encouraged by his wife, Queen [[Maria Isabel of Portugal|Mar\u00eda Isabel de Braganza]], decided to use it as a new Royal Museum of Paintings and Sculptures. The Royal Museum, which would soon become known as the National Museum of Painting and Sculpture, and subsequently the Museo Nacional del Prado, opened to the public for the first time in November 1819. It was created with the double aim of showing the works of art belonging to the Spanish Crown and to demonstrate to the rest of Europe that Spanish art was of equal merit to any other national school.\n\n[[File:Grand hall d'exposition au Mus\u00e9e du Prado.JPG|thumb|left|320px|In the main exhibition hall, first floor]]\nThe first catalogue of the Museum, published in 1819 and solely devoted to Spanish painting, included 311 paintings, although at that time the Museum housed 1,510 from the various royal residences, the Reales Sitios, including works from other schools. The exceptionally important royal collection, which forms the nucleus of the present-day Museo del Prado, started to increase significantly in the 16th century during the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and continued under the succeeding Habsburg and Bourbon monarchs. Their efforts and determination led to the Royal Collection being enriched by some of the masterpieces now to be seen in the Prado. These include ''The Descent from the Cross'' by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' by Hieronymous Bosch, ''Knight with his Hand on his Breast'' by [[El Greco]], ''The Death of the Virgin'' by [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], ''The Holy Family'', known as \"La Perla\", by [[Raphael]], ''Charles V at M\u00fclhberg'' by [[Titian]], ''Christ Washing the Disciples\u2019 Feet'' by [[Tintoretto]], [[D\u00fcrer]]'s ''Self-portrait'', ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by Vel\u00e1zquez, ''[[The Three Graces (Rubens)|The Three Graces]]'' by Rubens, and ''[[The Family of Charles IV]]'' by Goya.\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 220\n   | header    = [[Francisco Goya]]\n   | image1    =Goya Maja naga2.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Francisco Goya, ''[[La maja desnuda]]'', oil on canvas, (circa 1797\u20131800)\n   | image2    = Goya Maja ubrana2.jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = Francisco Goya, ''[[La maja vestida]]'', oil on canvas, (circa 1797\u20131800)\n  }}\n\nIn addition to works from the Spanish royal collection, other holdings increased and enriched the Museum with further masterpieces, such as the two Majas by Goya. Among the now closed museums whose collections have been added to that of the Prado were the Museo de la Trinidad in 1872, and the Museo de Arte Moderno in 1971. In addition, numerous legacies, donations and purchases have been of crucial importance for the growth of the collection. Various works entered the Prado from the Museo de la Trinidad, including ''The Fountain of Grace'' by the School of Van Eyck, the Santo Domingo and San Pedro Mart\u00edr altarpieces painted for the monastery of Santo Tom\u00e1s in \u00c1vila by [[Pedro Berruguete]], and the five canvases by El Greco executed for the Colegio de do\u00f1a Mar\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n. Most of the Museum's 19th-century paintings come from the former Museo de Arte Moderno, including works by the Madrazos, [[Jos\u00e9 de Madrazo y Agudo]] and [[Federico de Madrazo]], [[Vicente L\u00f3pez Porta\u00f1a|Vicente L\u00f3pez]], [[Carlos de Haes]], [[Eduardo Rosales]] and [[Sorolla]].\n\nUpon the deposition of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]] in 1868, the museum was nationalized and acquired the new name of \"Museo del Prado\". The building housed the royal collection of arts, and it rapidly proved too small. The first enlargement to the museum took place in 1918. Since the creation of the Museo del Prado more than 2,300 paintings have been incorporated into its collection, as well as numerous sculptures, prints, drawings and works of art through bequests, donations and purchases, which account for most of the New Acquisitions. Numerous bequests have enriched the Museum's holdings, such as the outstanding collection of medals left to the Museum by Pablo Bosch; the drawings and items of decorative art left by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez Dur\u00e1n as well as [[Van der Weyden]]'s masterpiece, ''The Virgin and Child''; and the Ram\u00f3n de Errazu bequest of 19th-century paintings. Particularly important donations include Bar\u00f3n Emile d'Erlanger's gift of Goya's Black Paintings in 1881. Among the numerous works that have entered the collection through purchase are some outstanding ones acquired in recent years including two works by El Greco, ''The Fable'' and ''The Flight into Egypt'' acquired in 1993 and 2001, Goya's ''[[The Countess of Chinchon]]'' bought in 2000, Vel\u00e1zquez's portrait of ''The Pope's Barber'', acquired in 2003 and Fra Angelico's ''Madonna of the Pomegranate'' purchased in 2016.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1900, the Prado helped decorate city halls, new universities, and churches. During the [[Second Spanish Republic]] from 1931 to 1936, the focus was on developing provincial museums. During the [[Spanish Civil War]], upon the recommendation of the [[League of Nations]], the museum staff removed 353 paintings, 168 drawings and the Dauphin's Treasure and sent the art to [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], then later to [[Girona]], and finally to [[Geneva]]. The art had to be returned across French territory in night trains to the museum upon the commencement of World War II. During the early years of the dictatorship of [[Francisco Franco]], many paintings were sent to embassies.<ref name=\"riding\">{{cite news| author=Alan Riding| date=1 August 1990| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/arts/the-prado-finds-out-what-it-has-and-where.html| title=The Prado Finds Out What It Has and Where| work=[[The New York Times]]| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez en El Prado.JPG|left|thumb|150px|A main promenade entrance is dominated by this 1899 bronze statue of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], by Aniceto Marinas]]\nThe main building was enlarged with short pavilions in the rear between 1900 and 1960.

The building that lodges the Museum of the Prado was initially conceived by [[Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino y Redondo, count of Floridablanca]] and was commissioned in 1785 by Charles III for the ''reurbanizaci\u00f3n'' of the Paseo del Prado. To this end, Charles III called on one of his favorite architects, [[Juan de Villanueva]], author also of the nearby Botanical Garden and the City Hall of Madrid.<ref name=\"chronology\">{{cite web| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/index.php?id=904| title=Chronology of Museo del Prado, 1785| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012|language=es}}</ref>\n\nThe ''prado'' (\"meadow\") that was where the museum now stands gave its name to the area, the Sal\u00f3n del Prado (later [[Paseo del Prado]]), and to the museum itself upon [[nationalisation]]. Work on the building stopped at the conclusion of Charles III's reign and throughout the [[Peninsular War]] and was only initiated again during the reign of Charles III's grandson, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]]. The premises had been used as headquarters for the [[cavalry]] and a [[gunpowder]]-store for the [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic troops based in Madrid during the war.\n\n==Special exhibitions==\nBetween 8 November 2011 and 25 March 2012, a group of 179 works of art were brought to the Museo del Prado from the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]].<ref name=\"hermitage\">{{cite web| url=http://www.museodelprado.es/en/exhibitions/exhibitions/at-the-museum/tesoros-del-hermitage/| title=The Hermitage in the Prado| publisher=Museo Nacional del Prado| accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref> Notable works included:\n* ''[[:File:Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn - A Scholar.JPG|A Scholar]]'' (1631), by [[Rembrandt]]\n* ''[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]'' (c. 1596), by [[Caravaggio]]\n* ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' (1647), by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]]\n* ''[[Game of Bowls]]'' (1908), by [[Henri Matisse]]\n* ''Bouquet of Cornflowers with Stems of Oats in a Vase'' (c. 1900), by [[House of Faberg\u00e9]]\n* ''[[List of works by Claude Monet|Pond at Montgeron]]'' (1876), by [[Claude Monet]]\n* ''Belt buckle with a monster attacking a horse'', (4th\u20133rd century BC), (gold ornament from Peter I\u2019s [[Siberia]]n Collection)\n* ''Moonrise, Two Men on the Shore'' (c. 1900), by [[Caspar David Friedrich]]\n* [[:File:Kandinsky - Composition VI (1913).jpg|Composition VI]] (1913), by [[Wassily Kandinsky]]\n* ''Metaphysical Still life'' (1918), by [[Giorgio Morandi]]\n\nConversely, for the first time in its 200-year history, the Museo del Prado has toured an exhibition of its renowned collection of Italian masterpieces at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, from 16 May 2014 until 31 August 2014.

Under its new bylaws, which the [[Cortes Generales]] approved in 2003, the Prado must gradually reduce its level of state support to 50 percent from 80 percent. In exchange, the museum gained control of the budget \u2014 now roughly \u20ac35 million \u2014 and the power to raise money from corporate donations and merchandising. However, its recent \u20ac150 million expansion was paid for by the Spanish state.<ref name=\"fuchs\">{{cite news| author=Dale Fuchs| date=24 December 2004| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/business/worldbusiness/24iht-wbspot24_ed3_.html| title=The art of financing the Prado| work=New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=15 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, [[Manuel Villaescusa]] bequeathed his fortune of nearly $40 million in Madrid real estate to the Prado, to be used solely for the acquisition of paintings.

His nohas are recited the world over, from India, Pakistan, Bahrain to Canada and Norway.<ref name=youtube/>\n\n==Early life==\nSachay Bhai was born as Syed Ali Muhammad Rizvi in [[Azamgarh]] village Bahauddinpur Division of the province [[Uttar Pradesh]]. He was born to a family of descendants of 8th Imam of [[Shia Muslims]], Imam [[Ali ar-Ridha]] in 1940. He was the second sibling of four brothers and five sisters. At the age of ten, his parents migrated to [[Pakistan]] and settled down in Liaquatabad C' Area (Lalookhait) Karachi. He passed his [[Matriculation]] from Jacob Lines School, [[Karachi]] in 1957. He continued his studies and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree from the [[University of Karachi]].\n\n==Family==\nSachay was married to Syeda Jamal Akhter Zaidi. They have seven daughters and one son, Syed Ali Raza Rizvi. Ali is also a well-established [[poet]] and Nauha Khwwan and has several Nauhas to his credit.\nSachay\u2019s father Syed Yarwar Hussain was also a renowned religious poet and a number of [[elegy]] (Marsia) and [[Nauha]] are to his credit.\nHis published poetic work consists of Marasiy - e- Yawar, vol 1 and 2.\n\n==Sachay Bashay duo==\nSyed Ali Abbas Rizvi (Marhoom), popularly known as Bashay, was younger brother to Sachay and served as his co-reciter (Bazoo) till his death in early 90s. He also served as the main reciter of Anjuman-e-Zulfiqar-e-Hyderi when Sachay left for Canada in 1988. On many occasions Sachay himself praised Bashay and publicly declared that Bashay's voice is far better than his own.  The magic held in both brothers voices created a frenzy not only in Pakistan but around the world.\n\n==Early Work: 1951\u20131962==\nSachay recited Nauhas and Manqabats at many occasions but was not taken seriously due to his young age.
