In 1908, Fushun became the seat of Xingren County ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u5174\u4ec1\u53bf}}, later renamed to [[Fushun County, Liaoning|Fushun County]]). Fushun was occupied by Russia until 1905 and by Japan until 1945. With the Japanese victory over [[Imperial Russia]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], the [[South Manchurian Railway|South Manchuria branch]] (from [[Changchun]] to [[L\u00fcshun]]) of the [[China Far East Railway]] was transferred to Japanese control. [[South Manchuria Railway Company]] quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions. Coal mines were developed at Fushun.

Houshi National Forest Park, about {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}} from Fushun city centre, is rated by the central government as an [[Tourist Attraction Rating Categories of China|AAAA tourist attraction]]. Saer Hu Scenic Area covers some {{convert|268|km2|abbr=on}}. It includes the {{convert|110|km2|abbr=on}} Dahuofang Reservoir, the largest man-made lake in northeast China.\n\nThere are a number of historic and cultural sites. Fushun's success in applying for two UNESCO [[World Heritage]] sites is expected to attract more tourists. They include a site known as Xingjing City, the origin of the Qing Dynasty, which is within today's Fushun. It was the first capital of the Late Jin dynasty, dating to 1616. The second site contains the Yongling tombs, where several members of the royal household are buried.\n\nIn more recent times, Fushun was where [[Lei Feng]] was stationed as a soldier and died, and a memorial museum telling his life story is a popular attraction. It is located at Wang Hua District in Fushun. It was also in Fushun that the last emperor, [[Puyi]], was imprisoned after the end of World War II. The [[Fushun War Criminals Management Centre]] is converted into a museum in 1986. Another war memorial, the Pingdingshan Tragedy Memorial Hall Ruins, tells the story of a massacre of Chinese people by the Japanese in 1931. It was rebuilt and expanded in 2007. It includes a pit filled with about 800 bodies\u2014largely infants, adults, and the elderly who were killed by the Japanese.\n\nThe [[Ring of Life]] monument opened in 2013 and features an observation deck overseeing the city. This circular tower, 515-foot (approximately 157 meters) tall, cost over $15 million to build.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellenews.com/2012/11/17/world/asia-news/the-ring-of-life-500-foot-steel-ring-built-in-chinese-city-of-fushun/ |title=The Ring of Life: 500-foot steel ring built in Chinese city of Fushun &#124; BelleNews.com, Latest News |publisher=Bellenews.com |date=2012-11-17 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref> It is covered with 12,000 LED lights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/6909/2012/11/13/2743s732348.htm |title='Ring of Life' Lights Up Fushun |publisher=English.cri.cn |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2012-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Red River Valley in Fushun has opened a number of summer resorts.

In 1783, the new walled city was completed southwest of the old city. In 1908, Fushun became the seat of Xingren County (\u5174\u4ec1\u53bf, later renamed to [[Fushun County, Liaoning|Fushun County]]). Fushun was occupied by Russia until 1905 and by Japan until 1945. With the Japanese victory over [[Imperial Russia]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], the [[South Manchurian Railway|South Manchuria branch]] (from [[Changchun]] to [[L\u00fcshun]]) of the [[China Far East Railway]] was transferred to Japanese control. [[South Manchuria Railway Company]] quickly expanded the system inherited from Russia to staggering proportions. Coal mines were developed at Fushun. Under the control of the Japanese and with 30 years of development, Fushun area became highly industrialized. Fushun gained city status in 1937.\n\n==Population==\nFushun has 2.14&nbsp;million inhabitants, including 1.34&nbsp;million in the urban area.

Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of [[sound]] energy, sounding similar to an [[explosion]] or a [[thunder]]clap to the human ear. The crack of a supersonic [[bullet]] passing overhead or the crack of a [[bullwhip]] are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\">{{cite journal |last1=May |first1=Mike |title=Crackin' Good Mathematics |journal=American Scientist |date=September 2002 |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=415\u2013416 |jstor=27857718}}</ref>\n\nSonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures. They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.\n\n==Causes==\nWhen an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.\n\n{{anchor|Mach cone}}In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the \"smooth flight\" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave <math> \\alpha </math> is given by:\n\n:<math>\\sin( \\alpha) =\\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math>,\n\nwhere  <math> \\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math> is the inverse <math>\\Big(\\frac{1}{Ma}\\Big)</math> of the plane's [[Mach number]] (<math>Ma = \\frac{v_\\text{object}}{v_\\text{sound}}</math>).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.\n\nThere is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This \"[[overpressure]] profile\" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The \"boom\" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms \u2013 one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive \"double boom\" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.\n\nSince the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle <math> \\alpha </math>.\n\nFor today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]</ref> In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage \u2014 shattered glass, for example \u2014 will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\">USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996</ref>\n\nThe power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The \"length\" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore \"spread out\" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.<ref name=seebass>[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].\n\nThe later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape.

A NASA aerospace engineer is pictured here in a wind tunnel with the Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model.]]\n\nIn the late 1950s when [[supersonic transport]] (SST) designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the [[North American XB-70]] ''Valkyrie'' started flying, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000&nbsp;m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.\n\nRichard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at [[Cornell University]] studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a \"[[figure of merit]]\" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for [[Concorde]] and 1.9 for the [[Boeing 2707]]. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment mixed with politics eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Another way to express this is [[wing span]]. The [[fuselage]] of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important. The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt. A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like [[business jets]].<ref name=seebass/>\n\nSeebass and George also worked on the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused ([[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Boeing X-43]]) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nose cone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ([[Shock wave|bow shock]]), and using a swept back [[flying wing]] or an [[Oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their [[nose cone]] and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the [[area rule]]. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from {{convert|40000|ft|m}} to 60,000 feet (from 12,000&nbsp;m to 18,000&nbsp;m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.<ref name=seebass/>\n\n[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]\nThis remained untested for decades, until [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] started the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration|Quiet Supersonic Platform]] project and funded the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model.  The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level; one below the FM&nbsp;= 1 limit stated above, for instance.\n\nAs a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.\n\nThere are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.<ref name=seebass/>\n\nNASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.<ref>{{cite press release \n|last= \n|first= \n|date= 3 April 2018\n|title= NASA Awards Contract to Build Quieter Supersonic Aircraft\n|url= https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-build-quieter-supersonic-aircraft\n|location= \n|publisher= \n|agency= NASA\n|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Perception, noise and other concerns==\n[[File:Sonicboom animation.gif|thumb|A point source emitting spherical fronts while increasing its velocity linearly with time. For short times the Doppler effect is visible. When v=c the sonic boom is visible. When v>c the Mach cone is visible.]]\nThe sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double \"boom\" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, \"You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane \u2013 it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship \u2013 it's behind us.\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.\n\nSonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the \"torching\" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.\n\nThere has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom \"N\" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the [[Finger snapping|snapping of one's fingers]] in which the \"perceived\" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.\n\nThe energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1\u2013100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the over-pressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Over-pressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some maneuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other maneuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nDepending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&nbsp;\u00b0C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nThe composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly, [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the over-pressure of a sonic boom.\n\nCurrently there are no industry-accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom. However, work is underway to create metrics that will help in understanding how humans respond to the noise generated by sonic booms. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loubeau|first=Alexandra|last2=Naka|first2=Yusuke|last3=Cook|first3=Brian G.|last4=Sparrow|first4=Victor W.|last5=Morgenstern|first5=John M.|date=2015-10-28|title=A new evaluation of noise metrics for sonic booms using existing data|url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4934481|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1685|issue=1|pages=090015|doi=10.1063/1.4934481|issn=0094-243X}}</ref> Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.\n\n==Bullwhip==\n[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]\nThe cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''\"cracker\"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\"/>\n\nA bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.

They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it affects only observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.\n\n==Causes==\nWhen an aircraft passes through the air, it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.\n\n{{anchor|Mach cone}}In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the \"smooth flight\" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave <math> \\alpha </math> is given by:\n\n:<math>\\sin( \\alpha) =\\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math>,\n\nwhere  <math> \\frac{v_\\text{sound}}{v_\\text{object}} </math> is the inverse <math>\\Big(\\frac{1}{Ma}\\Big)</math> of the plane's [[Mach number]] (<math>Ma = \\frac{v_\\text{object}}{v_\\text{sound}}</math>).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.\n\nThere is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This \"[[overpressure]] profile\" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The \"boom\" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms \u2013 one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive \"double boom\" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.\n\nSince the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle <math> \\alpha </math>.\n\nFor today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.<ref>[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]</ref> In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage \u2014 shattered glass, for example \u2014 will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\">USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996</ref>\n\nThe power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The \"length\" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore \"spread out\" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.<ref name=seebass>[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSeveral smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines.

The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level; one below the FM&nbsp;= 1 limit stated above, for instance.\n\nAs a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.\n\nThere are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.<ref name=seebass/>\n\nNASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.<ref>{{cite press release \n|last= \n|first= \n|date= 3 April 2018\n|title= NASA Awards Contract to Build Quieter Supersonic Aircraft\n|url= https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-awards-contract-to-build-quieter-supersonic-aircraft\n|location= \n|publisher= \n|agency= NASA\n|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Perception, noise and other concerns==\n[[File:Sonicboom animation.gif|thumb|A point source emitting spherical fronts while increasing its velocity linearly with time. For short times the Doppler effect is visible. When v=c the sonic boom is visible. When v>c the Mach cone is visible.]]\nThe sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double \"boom\" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, \"You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane \u2013 it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship \u2013 it's behind us.\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]</ref>\n\nIn 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.\n\nSonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the \"torching\" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.\n\nThere has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom \"N\" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the over-pressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the [[Finger snapping|snapping of one's fingers]] in which the \"perceived\" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.\n\nThe energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1\u2013100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the over-pressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Over-pressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some maneuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other maneuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nDepending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&nbsp;\u00b0C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (\u221245&nbsp;\u00b0C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.<ref name=\"Fact Sheet\" />\n\nThe composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly, [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the over-pressure of a sonic boom.\n\nCurrently there are no industry-accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom. However, work is underway to create metrics that will help in understanding how humans will respond to the noise generated by sonic booms. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Loubeau|first=Alexandra|last2=Naka|first2=Yusuke|last3=Cook|first3=Brian G.|last4=Sparrow|first4=Victor W.|last5=Morgenstern|first5=John M.|date=2015-10-28|title=A new evaluation of noise metrics for sonic booms using existing data|url=https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4934481|journal=AIP Conference Proceedings|volume=1685|issue=1|pages=090015|doi=10.1063/1.4934481|issn=0094-243X}}</ref> Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.\n\n==Bullwhip==\n[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]\nThe cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''\"cracker\"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.<ref name=\"americanscientist.org\"/>\n\nA bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.
