In 1941, the first international competition in [[CONCACAF]], the international governing body for football in North America, Central America and the Caribbean, the [[CCCF Championship|Central American and Caribbean Championship (CCCF)]] took place in Costa Rica. El Salvador took part for the first time alongside Costa Rica, [[Cura\u00e7ao national football team|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], and Panama. El Salvador were runners-up, recording two wins, one tie, and one loss.<ref name=\"CCCF 1941\"/>\n\nThe [[1943 CCCF Championship]] took place in San Salvador with the participation of Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua.

At the end of the tournament, El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker. On December 21, Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference. This was the country's first international title. El Salvador's 10\u20121 set the team's record for the most goals scored in a single game yet . It was also the second time a Salvadoran player (Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz) had scored five goals in a single match.<ref name=\"CCCF 1943\"/> El Salvador defended their title in the [[1946 CCCF Championship]], hosted in [[Costa Rica]], alongside six other participants. ''La Selecta'' finished in third place, winning three matches and losing two.

Reasons for these refusals are unknown but might be due to the cost of travel, since at that time the team had never played so far from home.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During these years El Salvador had a good squad, with players like goalkeeper Manuel \"Tamal\u00f3n\" Garay, Rafael \"Chapuda\" Reyes, Conrado Miranda, Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz, Rafael Corado and Mando Rivas.\n\nIn the group stage of the [[Football at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games|1950 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in Mexico, El Salvador recorded two wins, one tie, and one loss.

El Salvador was placed in the four team group [[Honduras]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[Nicaragua]], which they topped with two wins and one draw.

The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team needed to train with. The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek. When Guevara Mora called to him to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him, and the ball went past Jovel in front of the net.{{cn|date=April 2020}} After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation.

The national team's first match was played in September 1921, when they were invited to participate in [[Independence Centenary Games|a tournament]] to celebrate 100 years of [[Central American declarations of independence|Central American Independence]].\n\nEl Salvador has made two [[FIFA World Cup]] appearances: first in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and again in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], but have never progressed beyond the first stage of a finals tournament.

El Salvador took part for the first time alongside Costa Rica, [[Cura\u00e7ao national football team|Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], and Panama. El Salvador were runners-up, recording two wins, one tie, and one loss.<ref name=\"CCCF 1941\"/>\n\nThe [[1943 CCCF Championship]] took place in San Salvador with the participation of Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. El Salvador was coached by former national player [[Am\u00e9rico Gonz\u00e1lez (footballer)|Am\u00e9rico Gonz\u00e1lez]]. At the end of the tournament, El Salvador and Guatemala ended up with the same number of points and so had to play a tiebreaker. On December 21, Guatemala failed to show up for the match resulting in El Salvador declaring themselves 1943 CCCF Championship winners by goal difference. This was the country's first international title. El Salvador's 10\u20121 set the team's record for the most goals scored in a single game yet . It was also the second time a Salvadoran player (Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz) had scored five goals in a single match.<ref name=\"CCCF 1943\"/> El Salvador defended their title in the [[1946 CCCF Championship]], hosted in [[Costa Rica]], alongside six other participants. ''La Selecta'' finished in third place, winning three matches and losing two.

Reasons for these refusals are unknown but might be due to the cost of travel, since at that time the team had never played so far from home.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} During these years El Salvador had a good squad, with players like goalkeeper Manuel \"Tamal\u00f3n\" Garay, Rafael \"Chapuda\" Reyes, Conrado Miranda, Miguel \"Americano\" Cruz, Rafael Corado and Mando Rivas.\n\nIn the group stage of the [[Football at the 1950 Central American and Caribbean Games|1950 Central American and Caribbean Games]] in Mexico, El Salvador recorded two wins, one tie, and one loss.

This marked the sixth time El Salvador participated in the CCCF Championship. For unknown reasons they didn't participate in the [[1957 CCCF Championship|1957]] and [[1960 CCCF Championship|1960]] CCCF Championships.\n\n===1960s===\nEl Salvador returned to participate in the [[1961 CCCF Championship]], hosted in Costa Rica, alongside nine other national teams. Due to the larger number of teams the CCCF Championship shifted to a two-round format with two [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] group stages. In the first round, there were two groups, one with five teams and one with four. The top two teams from both groups advanced to the second stage. El Salvador was placed in the four team group [[Honduras]], the [[Netherlands Antilles]], and [[Nicaragua]], which they topped with two wins and one draw. In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica, who won their seventh CCCF Championship. Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the [[CONCACAF Championship]].\n\n[[1963 CONCACAF Championship|The first CONCACAF Championship was hosted in 1963]] and El Salvador hosted both the qualification round and final tournament.

The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake.

The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek.

The Marine Corps is fully integrated into the [[Spanish Navy|Armada]]'s structure.\n\nThe Corps was formed in 1537 by [[Charles I of Spain]] (also known as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]), making it the oldest [[Marines|marine corps]] in existence in the world, drawing from the ''Compa\u00f1\u00edas Viejas del Mar de N\u00e1poles''.\n\n== Mission ==\n[[File:Unifor10.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish Marine Infantry uniform]]\nThe Spanish Marine Infantry is an elite corps, highly specialised in [[amphibious warfare]], that is, to project an amphibious force onto a hostile, or potentially hostile, coast. Its ability to embark on a short term notice with (land, air and naval) Navy assets, makes it a unit with a high strategic value. Adding to this a high degree of training, and the capability to deploy swiftly in international waters, results in a potent dissuasive force available at a short notice in distant regions.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of a marine is the uniform that he wears. On the sleeves of the Spanish Marines are the three \"Sardinetas\", which marks it as a member of the Royal House Corps. This was given in recognition for a heroic [[last stand]] in the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] against a [[British expedition against Cuba|British expedition]] in 1762. The only other unit to wear the sardinetas and red trouser stripes is the [[Spanish Royal Guard]]. Spanish Marines have modern assets to comply with its mission, having personnel specialised in [[artillery]], [[sapping]], [[helicopter]]s, [[Special forces|special operations]], communications, [[tank]]s, among others. Some vehicles form the ''Grupo Mecanizado Anfibio del Tercio de Armada'' (the Mechanized Amphibious Group of the Navy Tercio).\n\nThe Marines of Spain are not only a fleet force, as the Spanish Royal Marine Guard Company are responsible for the defense and security forces of naval bases and facilities, naval schools and training units, and all facilities that support the Marines themselves.\n\nThe most famous Spanish Marine is without a doubt [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of the novel [[Don Quixote]], who was wounded in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571. Another famous writer, [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]], also served with the marines.\n\n== History ==\n=== First period ===\n[[File:Seeschlacht von Lepanto von Pieter Br\u00fcnniche.jpg|thumb|Spanish marines fighting in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]], 1571]]\nThe ''Infanter\u00eda de Armada'' (Navy Infantry) was created by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1537, when he permanently assigned the ''Compa\u00f1\u00edas Viejas del Mar de N\u00e1poles'' (Old Sea Companies of [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]]) to the ''Escuadras de Galeras del Mediterr\u00e1neo'' (Mediterranean Galley Squadrons). But it was [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] who established today's concept of a [[Landing operation|landing force]]. This was a pure naval power projection ashore by forces deployed from ships that could maintain their ability to fight despite being based on board. This is the period of the famous [[Tercio]]s (literally \"One Third\", due to its organisation: one third of [[musketeer]]s, one third of [[sword]]smen and the final third of [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]]):<ref name=\"Sintesis\">''La Infanter\u00eda de Marina Espanola.

The first ones were named: Armada, Bajeles, Marina, Oceano, Mediterr\u00e1neo and Barlovento. Their mission was to form the \"Main body of landing columns and ship's soldiers tasks\" in a time that [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] was still a critical part of battle at sea. They were also gun crews.

In 1740 a marine artillery corps was founded. At mid 18th century there were 12,000 marine infantry and 3,000 marine gunners. The infantry formed boarding parties while the gunners manned the ship cannons. As needed landing parties were formed. Both corps also garrisoned the navy's coastal fortresses. During the [[War of Spanish Independence]] both the marine infantry and the marine artillery was reorganized as seven regiments, mainly fighting on land as part of army divisions.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nIn a 1793, a woman, Ana Maria de Soto, disguised as a man, and answering to the name of Antonio Maria de Soto, enlisted in the 6th company of 11\u00b0 Battalion of the Navy, being licensed with pension and honors in 1798, when she was discovered to be a woman. She was the first female marine in the world.\n\nThe major actions they took part in during this period were:\n* [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Sardinia]], 1717\n* Naples and Sicily, 1732\n* [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]], 1741\n* Defence of [[Havana]], 1762\n* Algiers expedition, 1775\n* [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)]]\n* [[Siege of Toulon]], 1793\n* Defense of [[Ferrol, Spain]], 1800\n* [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata#First invasion|Recapture]] of [[Buenos Aires]], 1806\n\n=== Third period ===\n[[File:BANDERA III REGIMIENTO INFANTER\u00cdA DE MARINA.svg|thumb|left|Color of the 3rd Marine Regiment of Cartagena, today ''Tercio de Levante'']]\nThe increasing efficiency of the naval artillery made boarding obsolete after the Napoleonic Wars, the marine infantry and marine artillery was merged in 1827 into a brigade, '' Brigada Real de Marina '' with focus on artillery. The brigade that consisted of two battalions was renamed the '' Real Cuerpo de Artiller\u00eda de Marina'' in 1833. In the [[First Carlist War]] 1834-39, three battalions of marine infantry were organized, serving as field infantry. In 1839 the corps was renamed ''Cuerpo de Artiller\u00eda and Infanteri\u00e1 de Marina''.<ref name = \"Sintesis\" /> In 1841 the infantry was transferred to the army.<ref>''Colecci\u00f3n de las leyes, Decretos y de Decaciones de La Cortes, y los Reales Decretos de 1841.'' Madrid 1842, p. 884.</ref> The marine artillery remained in the navy under the name of '' Cuerpo de Artiller\u00eda de Marina ''. However, in 1848, the naval infantry was re-established by the formation of a new Corps, '' Cuerpo de Infanter\u00eda de Marina, '' of three battalions. The marine artillery was abolished in 1857. The five battalions of marine infantry were reorganized in 1869 to three regiments, one for each naval station. By this time, the mission of the marines changed from naval garrison troops, to a landing force serving mainly in the colonies.<ref name=\"Sintesis\" />\n\nDuring the [[Third Carlist War]] 1872\u20131876 the marines fought as field infantry. In 1879, the marine infantry academy, the ''Academia General Central de Infanter\u00eda de Marina'' was founded. The colonial wars in the Philippines and on Cuba, with constant landing operations, lead to a reorganization of the marines into three brigades of two regiments each. In 1886 the marines contained four brigades, each with four tercios, while the reorganization of 1893 created three regiments of two battalions each. During the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the marines fought as part of army divisions.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nThough Spain's empire was dismembered in the nineteenth century the marines continued to be active abroad. Its most important actions in this period were:\n* [[French occupation of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (1804)\n* [[Cochinchina campaign|Cochinchina (Vietnam)]] (1858)\n* [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]] (1862)\n* [[Spanish\u2013American War|Cuba and Philippines]] (1898)\n* Morocco (1911)\n[[File:Escudo Infanter\u00eda de Marina Republica Espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|100px|Insignia during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican period]] (1931\u20131939)]] [[File:Escudo Infanter\u00eda Marina Espa\u00f1a Franquismo.svg|thumb|100px|Insignia during the [[Francoism|Francoist period]] (1939\u20131975)]] These actions were carried out by the ''Batallones Expedicionarios'' (Expeditionary Battalions), some of them campaigning abroad for up to ten years.\n\n=== Fourth period ===\n{{See also|Spanish Republican Navy}}\nAt the end of the [[World War I]], the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] made almost all countries abandon the idea of amphibious assault. The world's marine corps fell into a deep crisis, with the Spanish Marine Infantry being no exception, though it enjoyed success during the [[Rif War (1920)|Third Rif War]] in its innovative [[Alhucemas landing|Alhucemas amphibious assault]] in 1925, when it employed coordinated [[Close air support|air]] and [[Naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]] to support the assault.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nOwing to its high-profile action in the unpopular [[Rif War]]s, the Spanish Navy Marine corps was branded as a leftover of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial era]]. After the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in 1931, the reforms of the armed forces introduced by newly nominated Republican Minister of War [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] within the first months of the new government sought to disband the corps.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nBefore it was officially disbanded, however, the [[Spanish Civil War]] intervened and the corps split and served both sides with the garrisons of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and [[C\u00e1diz]] on the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist side]] and the garrison of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], as well as a detachment in [[Madrid]], on the [[Spanish Republican Navy|Republican side]]. During the bitterly fought war the Marines performed garrison duties, led landing parties, and provided expert artillery and machine gun crews.

In 1957, the ''Grupo Especial Anfibio'' (Amphibious Special Group) was created, and the Spanish Marine Infantry returned to its primary duty as a Landing Force Mission. In 1958 it established a [[beachhead]] in [[Spanish Sahara]] and [[Ifni]] during the [[Ifni War]]. The capabilities and strength of the Spanish Marine Infantry were increased: new amphibious vehicles, anti-tank weapons, individual equipment and artillery.\n\nThe '''''Tercio de Armada''''' (TEAR) became the main amphibious unit and has experienced several restructures that led to the E-01 Plan, which defines the requirements and structures from the year 2000 for the Spanish Marine Infantry. The Spanish Marines have been present in Europe, Central America and Asia in an anonymous role as an \"emergency force\" ready to evacuate civilians in conflict areas, or as a deterrence force in providing cover for the actions of allied forces.  The current base for the Spanish Marines is in [[San Fernando, C\u00e1diz|San Fernando]].\n\n===Modern Day===\nThe Spanish Marine Infantry have been deployed to various NATO operations such as Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenosnoticias/prefLang-en/00noticias--2013--03--NT-052-OP-AFGANISTAN-INLGES-en;jsessionid=xqsYh13MD0pZCfz0ZSFlmLx07n9fTJrddc62v3Q1knNvhBn71pCR!1717873538?_selectedNodeID=1162004&_pageAction=selectItem |title=The Spanish Marine Corps concludes advising tasks for the National Afghan Army |access-date=17 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917143221/http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenosnoticias/prefLang-en/00noticias--2013--03--NT-052-OP-AFGANISTAN-INLGES-en;jsessionid=xqsYh13MD0pZCfz0ZSFlmLx07n9fTJrddc62v3Q1knNvhBn71pCR!1717873538?_selectedNodeID=1162004&_pageAction=selectItem |archive-date=17 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\n\n==== Special operations deployments ====\n{{See also|Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial}}\nSince the 2009, the special operations units from the Spanish Navy (the Special Combat Divers Unit (UEBC), the Special Explosive Defusers Unit (UEDE) from the Navy Diving Center, and the [[Unidad de Operaciones Especiales|Special Operations Unit]] (UOE) from the Marine Infantry) are merged into the Special Naval Warfare Force, that is organized inside the Marines.

The Marine Corps is fully integrated into the [[Spanish Navy|Armada]]'s structure.\n\nThe Corps was formed in 1537 by [[Charles I of Spain]] (also known as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]), making it the oldest [[Marines|marine corps]] in existence in the world, drawing from the ''Compa\u00f1\u00edas Viejas del Mar de N\u00e1poles''.\n\n== Mission ==\n[[File:Unifor10.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish Marine Infantry uniform]]\nThe Spanish Marine Infantry is an elite corps, highly specialised in [[amphibious warfare]], that is, to project an amphibious force onto a hostile, or potentially hostile, coast. Its ability to embark on a short term notice with (land, air and naval) Navy assets, makes it a unit with a high strategic value. Adding to this a high degree of training, and the capability to deploy swiftly in international waters, results in a potent dissuasive force available at a short notice in distant regions.\n\nOne of the main characteristics of a marine is the uniform that he wears. On the sleeves of the Spanish Marines are the three \"Sardinetas\", which marks it as a member of the Royal House Corps. This was given in recognition for a heroic [[last stand]] in the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]] against a [[British expedition against Cuba|British expedition]] in 1762. The only other unit to wear the sardinetas and red trouser stripes is the [[Spanish Royal Guard]]. Spanish Marines have modern assets to comply with its mission, having personnel specialised in [[artillery]], [[sapping]], [[helicopter]]s, [[Special forces|special operations]], communications, [[tank]]s, among others. Some vehicles form the ''Grupo Mecanizado Anfibio del Tercio de Armada'' (the Mechanized Amphibious Group of the Navy Tercio).\n\nThe Marines of Spain are not only a fleet force, as the Spanish Royal Marine Guard Company are responsible for the defense and security forces of naval bases and facilities, naval schools and training units, and all facilities that support the Marines themselves.\n\nThe most famous Spanish Marine is without a doubt [[Miguel de Cervantes]], author of the novel [[Don Quixote]], who was wounded in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571. Another famous writer, [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]], also served with the marines.\n\n== History ==\n=== First period ===\n[[File:Seeschlacht von Lepanto von Pieter Br\u00fcnniche.jpg|thumb|Spanish marines fighting in the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]], 1571]]\nThe ''Infanter\u00eda de Armada'' (Navy Infantry) was created by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1537, when he permanently assigned the ''Compa\u00f1\u00edas Viejas del Mar de N\u00e1poles'' ([[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] Sea Old Companies) to the ''Escuadras de Galeras del Mediterr\u00e1neo'' (Mediterranean Galley Squadrons). But it was [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] who established today's concept of a [[Landing operation|landing force]]. This was a pure naval power projection ashore by forces deployed from ships that could maintain their ability to fight despite being based on board. This is the period of the famous [[Tercio]]s (literally \"One Third\", due to its organisation: one third of [[musketeer]]s, one third of [[spear]]men and the final third of [[Pike (weapon)|pikemen]]):<ref name=\"Sintesis\">''La Infanter\u00eda de Marina Espanola.

The first ones were named: Armada, Bajeles, Marina, Oceano, Mediterr\u00e1neo and Barlovento. Their mission was to form the \"Main body of landing columns and ship's soldiers tasks\" in a time that [[Boarding (attack)|boarding]] was still a critical part of battle at sea. They were also gun crews.

In 1740 a marine artillery corps was founded. At mid 18th century there were 12,000 marine infantry and 3,000 marine gunners. The infantry formed boarding parties while the gunners manned the ship cannons. As needed landing parties were formed. Both corps also garrisoned the navy's coastal fortresses. During the [[War of Spanish Independence]] both the marine infantry and the marine artillery was reorganized as seven regiments, mainly fighting on land as part of army divisions.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nIn a 1793, a woman, Ana Maria de Soto, disguised as a man, and answering to the name of Antonio Maria de Soto, enlisted in the 6th company of 11\u00b0 Battalion of the Navy, being licensed with pension and honors in 1798, when she was discovered to be a woman. She was the first female marine in the world.\n\nThe major actions they took part in during this period were:\n* [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Sardinia]], 1717\n* Naples and Sicily, 1732\n* [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias]], 1741\n* Defence of [[Havana]], 1762\n* Algiers expedition, 1775\n* [[Battle of Pensacola (1781)]]\n* [[Siege of Toulon]], 1793\n* Defense of [[Ferrol, Spain]], 1800\n* [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata#First invasion|Recapture]] of [[Buenos Aires]], 1806\n\n=== Third period ===\n[[File:BANDERA III REGIMIENTO INFANTER\u00cdA DE MARINA.svg|thumb|left|Color of the 3rd Marine Regiment of Cartagena, today ''Tercio de Levante'']]\nThe increasing efficiency of the naval artillery made boarding obsolete after the Napoleonic Wars, the marine infantry and marine artillery was merged in 1827 into a brigade, '' Brigada Real de Marina '' with focus on artillery. The brigade that consisted of two battalions was renamed the '' Real Cuerpo de Artiller\u00eda de Marina'' in 1833. In the [[First Carlist War]] 1834-39, three battalions of marine infantry were organized, serving as field infantry. In 1839 the corps was renamed ''Cuerpo de Artiller\u00eda and Infanteri\u00e1 de Marina''.<ref name = \"Sintesis\" /> In 1841 the infantry was transferred to the army.<ref>''Colecci\u00f3n de las leyes, Decretos y de Decaciones de La Cortes, y los Reales Decretos de 1841.'' Madrid 1842, p. 884.</ref> The marine artillery remained in the navy under the name of '' Cuerpo de Artiller\u00eda de Marina ''. However, in 1848, the naval infantry was re-established by the formation of a new Corps, '' Cuerpo de Infanter\u00eda de Marina, '' of three battalions. The marine artillery was abolished in 1857. The five battalions of marine infantry were reorganized in 1869 to three regiments, one for each naval station. By this time, the mission of the marines changed from naval garrison troops, to a landing force serving mainly in the colonies.<ref name=\"Sintesis\" />\n\nDuring the [[Third Carlist War]] 1872\u20131876 the marines fought as field infantry. In 1879, the marine infantry academy, the ''Academia General Central de Infanter\u00eda de Marina'' was founded. The colonial wars in the Philippines and on Cuba, with constant landing operations, lead to a reorganization of the marines into three brigades of two regiments each. In 1886 the marines contained four brigades, each with four tercios, while the reorganization of 1893 created three regiments of two battalions each. During the [[Philippine Revolution]] and the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the marines fought as part of army divisions.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nThough Spain's empire was dismembered in the nineteenth century the marines continued to be active abroad. Its most important actions in this period were:\n* [[French occupation of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (1804)\n* [[Cochinchina campaign|Cochinchina (Vietnam)]] (1858)\n* [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]] (1862)\n* [[Spanish\u2013American War|Cuba and Philippines]] (1898)\n* Morocco (1911)\n[[File:Escudo Infanter\u00eda de Marina Republica Espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|100px|Insignia during the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican period]] (1931\u20131939)]] [[File:Escudo Infanter\u00eda Marina Espa\u00f1a Franquismo.svg|thumb|100px|Insignia during the [[Francoism|Francoist period]] (1939\u20131975)]] These actions were carried out by the ''Batallones Expedicionarios'' (Expeditionary Battalions), some of them campaigning abroad for up to ten years.\n\n=== Fourth period ===\n{{See also|Spanish Republican Navy}}\nAt the end of the [[World War I]], the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] made almost all countries abandon the idea of amphibious assault. The world's marine corps fell into a deep crisis, with the Spanish Marine Infantry being no exception, though it enjoyed success during the [[Rif War (1920)|Third Rif War]] in its innovative [[Alhucemas landing|Alhucemas amphibious assault]] in 1925, when it employed coordinated [[Close air support|air]] and [[Naval gunfire support|naval gunfire]] to support the assault.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nOwing to its high-profile action in the unpopular [[Rif War]]s, the Spanish Navy Marine corps was branded as a leftover of the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial era]]. After the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in 1931, the reforms of the armed forces introduced by newly nominated Republican Minister of War [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] within the first months of the new government sought to disband the corps.<ref name=\"Sintesis\"/>\n\nBefore it was officially disbanded, however, the [[Spanish Civil War]] intervened and the corps split and served both sides with the garrisons of [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] and [[C\u00e1diz]] on the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist side]] and the garrison of [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]], as well as a detachment in [[Madrid]], on the [[Spanish Republican Navy|Republican side]]. During the bitterly fought war the Marines performed garrison duties, led landing parties, and provided expert artillery and machine gun crews.

In 1957, the ''Grupo Especial Anfibio'' (Amphibious Special Group) was created, and the Spanish Marine Infantry returned to its primary duty as a Landing Force Mission. In 1958 it established a [[beachhead]] in [[Spanish Sahara]] and [[Ifni]] during the [[Ifni War]]. The capabilities and strength of the Spanish Marine Infantry were increased: new amphibious vehicles, anti-tank weapons, individual equipment and artillery.\n\nThe '''''Tercio de Armada''''' (TEAR) became the main amphibious unit and has experienced several restructures that led to the E-01 Plan, which defines the requirements and structures from the year 2000 for the Spanish Marine Infantry. The Spanish Marines have been present in Europe, Central America and Asia in an anonymous role as an \"emergency force\" ready to evacuate civilians in conflict areas, or as a deterrence force in providing cover for the actions of allied forces.  The current base for the Spanish Marines is in [[San Fernando, C\u00e1diz|San Fernando]].\n\n===Modern Day===\nThe Spanish Marine Infantry have been deployed to various NATO operations such as Afghanistan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenosnoticias/prefLang-en/00noticias--2013--03--NT-052-OP-AFGANISTAN-INLGES-en;jsessionid=xqsYh13MD0pZCfz0ZSFlmLx07n9fTJrddc62v3Q1knNvhBn71pCR!1717873538?_selectedNodeID=1162004&_pageAction=selectItem |title=The Spanish Marine Corps concludes advising tasks for the National Afghan Army |access-date=17 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917143221/http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenosnoticias/prefLang-en/00noticias--2013--03--NT-052-OP-AFGANISTAN-INLGES-en;jsessionid=xqsYh13MD0pZCfz0ZSFlmLx07n9fTJrddc62v3Q1knNvhBn71pCR!1717873538?_selectedNodeID=1162004&_pageAction=selectItem |archive-date=17 September 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\n\n==== Special operations deployments ====\n{{See also|Fuerza de Guerra Naval Especial}}\nSince the 2009, the special operations units from the Spanish Navy (the Special Combat Divers Unit (UEBC), the Special Explosive Defusers Unit (UEDE) from the Navy Diving Center, and the [[Unidad de Operaciones Especiales|Special Operations Unit]] (UOE) from the Marine Infantry) are merged into the Special Naval Warfare Force, that is organized inside the Marines.

Loyalists targeted republicans/nationalists and attacked the wider Catholic community in what they described as retaliation. At times, there were bouts of sectarian [[tit-for-tat]] violence. The British security forces undertook both a policing and [[counter-insurgency]] role, primarily against republicans.

As the Penal Laws started to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was more competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the [[Irish Catholic]] ability to rent. With Roman Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades from which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the Protestant \"[[Peep O'Day Boys]]\"<ref name=\"Wright\">Frank Wright.

The result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican Presbyterians as part of a \"loyal\" Protestant community. Although [[Catholic emancipation]] was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination against Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland's population), Dissenters, and Jews, the [[Repeal Association]]'s campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Home Rule movement]] was created and served to define the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics), who sought the restoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants), who were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish Parliament and who tended to support continuing union with Britain.\n\nUnionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last=English |first=Richard |title=Irish Freedom: The History of Nationalism in Ireland |publisher=Pan Books |date=2006 |pages = 200\u2013231 |isbn=978-0-330-42759-3}}</ref>\n\n===1912\u20131922===\n{{Main|Partition of Ireland}}\n[[File:Ulster Covenant.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ulster Covenant]]'' was issued in protest against the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] in September 1912.]]\n[[File:Easter Proclamation of 1916.png|thumb|The ''[[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]]'' was issued during the [[Easter Rising]] of April 1916.]]\n\nBy the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. \nIn response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by [[Edward Carson]] signed the [[Ulster Covenant]] and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this end, they formed the paramilitary [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF).<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nIn response, nationalists led by [[Eoin MacNeill]] formed the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] in the event of British or unionist recalcitrance. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, and [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland's involvement in the war]], temporarily averted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the question of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British Parliament with [[Royal Assent]], was suspended for the duration of the war.\n\nThe Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, known as the [[National Volunteers]], supporting the war effort, and some of them joining Irish regiments of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]]. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] infiltrators. From these ranks came those who launched the [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin in 1916, led by [[Padraig Pearse]] and [[James Connolly]]. Two-and-a-half years after the executions of fifteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party won the December 1918 [[1918 Irish general election|general election in Ireland]] with 47% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 [[First D\u00e1il]] (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|threat of conscription for First World War service]]. The [[Irish War for Independence]] followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the [[Irish Free State]], which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In [[Ulster]], particularly in the six counties which became [[Northern Ireland]], Sinn F\u00e9in fared relatively poorly in the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] partitioned the island of Ireland into two separate jurisdictions, [[Southern Ireland (1921\u20131922)|Southern Ireland]] and Northern Ireland, both devolved regions of the United Kingdom. This [[partition of Ireland]] was confirmed when the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] exercised its right in December 1922 under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921 to ''\"opt out\"'' of the newly established Irish Free State.<ref name=\"Parliament\"/> A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary commission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would be in relation to its southern neighbour. After the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922\u20131923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin government led by [[W. T. Cosgrave]], and was quietly dropped. As counties [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] and border areas of [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and [[County Down|Down]] were mainly nationalist, the [[Irish Boundary Commission]] could reduce Northern Ireland to four counties or less.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nNorthern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a separate system of government whereby it was given its own [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|parliament]] and [[Devolution|devolved government]]. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to remain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition of Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will of the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was neither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] unionist majority.

The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]] passed the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to administer [[corporal punishment]] such as [[flogging]] to re-establish or preserve law and order.

From a unionist perspective, Northern Ireland's nationalists were inherently disloyal and determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen as justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment and other fields. The prevalence of larger families and thus the potential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a threat. Unionist governments ignored [[Edward Carson]]'s warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the 1930s and 1950s, and the IRA's brief [[Northern Campaign (IRA)|Northern Campaign]] in the 1940s and [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]] between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists.

There were gun battles between nationalists and the RUC, and between nationalists and loyalists. A group of about 30 IRA members was involved in the fighting in Belfast. The RUC deployed [[Shorland armoured car]]s mounted with heavy [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]].

The UK government in London, believing the Northern Ireland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought to take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to the Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through emergency legislation (the [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972]]) which suspended the unionist-controlled [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament and government, and introduced \"[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]\" from London. Direct rule was initially intended as a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-government to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both unionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the Troubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context of political deadlock. The existence of \"no-go areas\" in Belfast and Derry was a challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland, and the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over the areas in Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972.<ref name=\"coogan\"/><ref name=\"jbb\"/>\n\n===Sunningdale Agreement and UWC strike===\nIn June 1973, following the publication of a British [[White Paper]] and a [[1973 Northern Irish sovereignty referendum|referendum]] in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], was established. [[1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Elections]] to this were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the [[Sunningdale Agreement]], which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the Republic. The agreement provided for \"power-sharing\" \u2013 the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists\u2014and a \"Council of Ireland\" \u2013 a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic, designed to encourage cross-border co-operation. The similarities between the Sunningdale Agreement and the [[Good Friday Agreement|Belfast Agreement]] of 1998 has led some commentators to characterise the latter as \"Sunningdale for slow learners\".<ref name=\"\u00d3 Ceallaigh\">Dalt\u00fan \u00d3 Ceallaigh.

Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with those (nationalists) who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the \"Irish dimension\" and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young SDLP councillor, [[Hugh Logue]], to an audience at [[Trinity College Dublin]] that Sunningdale was the tool \"by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland\" also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, [[Brian Faulkner]] was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by [[Harry West]]. A [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|UK general election in February 1974]] gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan \"Dublin is only a Sunningdale away\", and the result galvanised their support: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists.<ref name=\"coogan\"/><ref name=\"jbb\"/>\n\nUltimately, however, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the part of loyalist paramilitaries (primarily the Ulster Defence Association, at that time over 20,000 strong{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}) and workers, who formed the [[Ulster Workers' Council]]. They organised a [[general strike]], the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]]. This severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential services such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British Government did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale initiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by [[MI5]], a part of their campaign to 'disorientate' British prime minister [[Harold Wilson]]'s government.<ref>''Keeping Secrets'', [[London Review of Books]], April 1987.</ref> Faced with such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-sharing government and the new regime collapsed.

During the meetings the parties discussed the possibility of British withdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland. The failure of Sunningdale led to the serious consideration in London until November 1975 of independence. Had the withdrawal occurred \u2013 which Wilson supported but others, including [[James Callaghan]], opposed \u2013 the region would have become a separate [[Dominion]] of the [[British Commonwealth]].{{r|fitzgerald2006}}\n\nThe British negotiations with an illegal organisation angered the Irish government. It did not know their proceedings but feared that the British were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Foreign Minister [[Garret FitzGerald]] discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of orderly withdrawal and independence, [[Repartition of Ireland|repartition of the island]] or a collapse of Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a negotiated independence as the best of the three \"worst case scenarios\", but concluded that the Irish government could do little.{{r|fitzgerald2006}}\n\nThe Irish government had already failed to prevent the IRA from burning down the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Dublin|British Embassy]] in 1972. It believed that it could not enlarge the country's small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war in Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for the Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect nationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene, despite Ireland's inability to do so, would \"threaten democratic government in the Republic\", which in turn jeopardised British and European security against Communist and other foreign nations.{{r|fitzgerald2006}}\n\nThe Irish government so dreaded the consequences of an independent Northern Ireland that FitzGerald refused to ask the British not to withdraw\u2014as he feared that openly discussing the issue could permit the British to proceed\u2014and other members of government opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred to as a \"doomsday scenario\". He wrote in 2006 that \"Neither then nor since has public opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came during the last two years of Harold Wilson's premiership.\"<ref name=\"fitzgerald2006\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf |title=The 1974\u20135 Threat of a British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland |author=Garret FitzGerald |journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs |year=2006 |volume=17 |pages=141\u2013150 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926091138/http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007|doi=10.3318/ISIA.2006.17.1.141 }}</ref>\n\n===Mid-1970s===\n[[File:CW.

In December, one month after the [[Birmingham pub bombings]] which killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings actually escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups.

Three of the bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of the UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus detonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were gunned down in [[Kingsmill massacre|Kingsmill, South Armagh]] after having been ordered off their bus by an armed republican gang, which called itself the [[South Armagh Republican Action Force]]. One man survived despite being shot 18 times, leaving ten fatalities.

When the Provisional IRA's December 1974 ceasefire had ended in early 1976 and it had returned to violence, it had lost the hope that it had felt in the early 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, and instead developed a strategy known as the \"Long War\", which involved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could continue indefinitely. The Official IRA ceasefire of 1972, however, became permanent, and the \"Official\" movement eventually evolved into the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]], which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from the \"Officials\"\u2014the [[Irish National Liberation Army]]\u2014continued a campaign of violence in 1974.<ref name=\"jbb\"/>\n\n===Late 1970s===\nBy the late 1970s, [[war-weariness]] was visible in both communities. One sign of this was the formation of a group known as \"[[Community for Peace People|Peace People]]\", which won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence. Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces.<ref name=\"dooley\">Brian Dooley.

Aspects included the removal of [[internment]] without trial and the removal of political status for paramilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in juryless [[Diplock courts]] to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they were to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among republican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the [[Maze prison]] initiating the \"[[blanket protest|blanket\"]] and [[dirty protest|\"dirty\"]] protests.

The UDA and UVF stepped up their attacks. The IRA responded with the [[Shankill Road bombing]] in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and one low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA retaliated with mass shootings in nationalist areas such as [[Greysteel massacre|Greysteel]] and Castlerock. Twelve people were killed at Greysteel and Castlerock, all but two of whom were Catholic.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nOn 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation Army killed a UVF member in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In revenge, three days later, the UVF [[Loughinisland massacre|killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub]] in [[Loughinisland]], County Down. The IRA, in the remaining month before its ceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and one from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a [[ceasefire]]. The loyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the \"[[Combined Loyalist Military Command]]\", reciprocated six weeks later. Although these ceasefires failed in the short run, they marked an effective end to large-scale political violence, as they paved the way for the final ceasefires.<ref name=\"coogan\"/><ref name=\"jbb\"/>\n\nIn 1995, the United States appointed [[George J.

The damage caused by the blast was estimated at \u00a3411&nbsp;million. [[Lance Bombardier]] Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier killed during the Troubles, was shot dead at a checkpoint on the Green Rd near Bessbrook on 12 February 1997 by the IRA's [[South Armagh Sniper (1990\u20131997)|South Armagh sniper]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/4958589/Northern-Ireland-shootings-The-last-soldier-murdered.html|title=Northern Ireland shootings: The last soldier murdered|work=The Telegraph|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=9 May 2017|last1=Bingham|first1=John}}</ref>\n\nThe IRA reinstated their ceasefire in July 1997, as negotiations for the document that became known as the Good Friday Agreement began without Sinn F\u00e9in. In September of the same year Sinn F\u00e9in signed [[Mitchell Principles|the Mitchell Principles]] and were admitted to the talks. The UVF was the first paramilitary grouping to split as a result of their ceasefire, spawning the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]] (LVF) in 1996. In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader [[Billy Wright (loyalist)|Billy Wright]], leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups.

Since then, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their \"own\" communities and at other factions within their organisations. The UDA, for example, has feuded with their fellow loyalists the UVF on two occasions since 2000. There have been internal struggles for power between \"brigade commanders\" and involvement in organised crime.<ref>{{cite news|author=Henry McDonald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/30/northernireland.henrymcdonald|title=New feud rips apart the UDA|work=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=30 July 2006}}</ref>\n\nProvisional IRA members have since been accused or convicted of involvement in the killings of [[Murder of Robert McCartney|Robert McCartney]], Matthew Burns, James Curran, and Andrew Kearney, among others.\n\n===Political process===\n[[File:Unidentified irish mural.jpg|thumb|A republican mural in Belfast during the mid-1990s bidding \"safe home\" ([[Sl\u00e1n Abhaile]]) to British troops. Security normalisation was one of the key points of the Good Friday Agreement.]]\n\nAfter the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement. These talks led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of \"power-sharing\". In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn F\u00e9in. Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]], which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the removal of [[Diplock courts]] under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.<ref>[http://www.nio.gov.uk/media-detail.htm?newsID=13803 Northern Ireland becoming a more normalised society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108133243/http://www.nio.gov.uk/media-detail.htm?newsID=13803 |date=8 January 2007 }} \u2013 Northern Ireland Office, 27 November 2006.</ref>\n\nA security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which comprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border observation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in [[Operation Banner]] \u2013 including the resident battalions of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] \u2013 that would be replaced by [[19th Light Brigade (United Kingdom)|an infantry brigade]], deployed in ten sites around Northern Ireland but with no operative role in the province.<ref name=\"MODreport\" />\n\nThe power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when unionists withdrew following \"[[Stormontgate]]\", a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the Provisional IRA's failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA decommissioning has since been completed (in September 2005) to the satisfaction of most parties.<ref>{{cite news|title=IRA 'has destroyed all its arms'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4283444.stm|publisher=BBC|date=26 September 2005|accessdate=6 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nA feature of Northern Ireland politics since the Agreement has been the eclipse in electoral terms of parties such as the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP), by rival parties such as Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP.

The parades are held to commemorate [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s victory in the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, which secured the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in [[Portadown]], where an Orange parade from [[Drumcree Church]] passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade, and also loyalist counter-riots against its banning.\n\nIn 1995, 1996 and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting throughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people died in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver, killed by the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]], and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a mixed-religion family) died when their house in [[Ballymoney]] was petrol-bombed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael McGoldrick, 64, Activist in Ulster, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/world/europe/06mcgoldrick.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 April 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis|title=Police hold six over loyalist turf war deaths|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/05/uk.northernireland1|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=5 August 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/12/newsid_2500000/2500503.stm|title=1998: Children die in Drumcree protests|work=BBC News|date=12 July 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Social repercussions==\n{{further|Paramilitary punishment attacks in Northern Ireland}}\n[[File:RUC, Crois.jpg|thumb|A watchtower at a heavily fortified RUC base in [[Crossmaglen]]]]\n[[File:Belfast peaceline Bombay Street.jpg|thumb|A \"[[peace lines|peace line]]\" at the back of a house on Bombay Street, Belfast]]\n\nThe impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] on the people of London.<ref>Dervla Murphy.

Many people were rendered homeless as a result of intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a role in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new, alien estates when older, decrepit districts such as [[Sailortown, Belfast|Sailortown]] and the [[Pound Loney]] were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah Nelson, this new social problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the breakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to exert a strong influence in certain districts.<ref name=\"nelson126\"/> Vandalism was also a major problem. In the 1970s there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.<ref>Murphy, p. 210.</ref>\n\nAccording to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles engendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern Ireland, resulting in a \"confused hedonism\" in respect of personal life.<ref>[[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]].

As the Penal Laws started to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was more competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the [[Irish Catholic]] ability to rent. With Roman Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades from which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the Protestant \"[[Peep O'Day Boys]]\"<ref name=\"Wright\">Frank Wright.

The [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], dates from this period and remains active to this day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/1422212.stm |title=Profile: The Orange Order |work=BBC News|date=4 July 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2008}}</ref>\n\nWith the [[Acts of Union 1800]] (which came into force on 1 January 1801), a new political framework was formed with the abolition of the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] and incorporation of Ireland into the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican Presbyterians as part of a \"loyal\" Protestant community. Although [[Catholic emancipation]] was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination against Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland's population), Dissenters, and Jews, the [[Repeal Association]]'s campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the [[Home Rule movement]] was created and served to define the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics), who sought the restoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants), who were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish Parliament and who tended to support continuing union with Britain.\n\nUnionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Ireland.<ref>{{cite book |last=English |first=Richard |title=Irish Freedom: The History of Nationalism in Ireland |publisher=Pan Books |date=2006 |pages = 200\u2013231 |isbn=978-0-330-42759-3}}</ref>\n\n===1912\u20131922===\n{{Main|Partition of Ireland}}\n[[File:Ulster Covenant.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ulster Covenant]]'' was issued in protest against the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] in September 1912.]]\n[[File:Easter Proclamation of 1916.png|thumb|The ''[[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]]'' was issued during the [[Easter Rising]] of April 1916.]]\n\nBy the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. \nIn response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by [[Edward Carson]] signed the [[Ulster Covenant]] and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this end, they formed the paramilitary [[Ulster Volunteers|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF).<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nIn response, nationalists led by [[Eoin MacNeill]] formed the [[Irish Volunteers]] in 1913, whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the [[Home Rule Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] in the event of British or unionist recalcitrance. The outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, and [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland's involvement in the war]], temporarily averted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the question of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British Parliament with [[Royal Assent]], was suspended for the duration of the war.\n\nThe Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, known as the [[National Volunteers]], supporting the war effort, and some of them joining Irish regiments of the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]]. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] infiltrators. From these ranks came those who launched the [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin in 1916, led by [[Padraig Pearse]] and [[James Connolly]]. Two-and-a-half years after the executions of fifteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party won the December 1918 [[1918 Irish general election|general election in Ireland]] with 47% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 [[First D\u00e1il]] (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|threat of conscription for First World War service]]. The [[Irish War for Independence]] followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the [[Irish Free State]], which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In [[Ulster]], particularly in the six counties which became [[Northern Ireland]], Sinn F\u00e9in fared relatively poorly in the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] partitioned the island of Ireland into two separate jurisdictions, [[Southern Ireland (1921\u20131922)|Southern Ireland]] and Northern Ireland, both devolved regions of the United Kingdom. This [[partition of Ireland]] was confirmed when the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] exercised its right in December 1922 under the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] of 1921 to ''\"opt out\"'' of the newly established Irish Free State.<ref name=\"Parliament\"/> A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary commission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would be in relation to its southern neighbour. After the [[Irish Civil War]] of 1922\u20131923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin government led by [[W. T. Cosgrave]], and was quietly dropped. As counties [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] and border areas of [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and [[County Down|Down]] were mainly nationalist, the [[Irish Boundary Commission]] could reduce Northern Ireland to four counties or less.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nNorthern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a separate system of government whereby it was given its own [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|parliament]] and [[Devolution|devolved government]]. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to remain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition of Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will of the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was neither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] unionist majority.

The [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|government of Northern Ireland]] passed the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922|Special Powers Act]] in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to intern suspects without trial and to administer [[corporal punishment]] such as [[flogging]] to re-establish or preserve law and order.

From a unionist perspective, Northern Ireland's nationalists were inherently disloyal and determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen as justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment and other fields. The prevalence of larger families and thus the potential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a threat. Unionist governments ignored [[Edward Carson]]'s warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the 1930s and 1950s, and the IRA's brief [[Northern Campaign (IRA)|Northern Campaign]] in the 1940s and [[Border Campaign (IRA)|Border Campaign]] between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists.

The UK government in London, believing the Northern Ireland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought to take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to the Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through emergency legislation (the [[Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972]]) which suspended the unionist-controlled [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] parliament and government, and introduced \"[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]]\" from London. Direct rule was initially intended as a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-government to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both unionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the Troubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context of political deadlock. The existence of \"no-go areas\" in Belfast and Derry was a challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland, and the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over the areas in Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972.<ref name=\"coogan\"/><ref name=\"jbb\"/>\n\n===Sunningdale Agreement and UWC strike===\nIn June 1973, following the publication of a British [[White Paper]] and a [[1973 Northern Irish sovereignty referendum|referendum]] in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the [[Northern Ireland Assembly, 1973|Northern Ireland Assembly]], was established. [[1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Elections]] to this were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the [[Sunningdale Agreement]], which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the Republic. The agreement provided for \"power-sharing\" \u2013 the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists\u2014and a \"Council of Ireland\" \u2013 a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic, designed to encourage cross-border co-operation. The similarities between the Sunningdale Agreement and the [[Good Friday Agreement|Belfast Agreement]] of 1998 has led some commentators to characterise the latter as \"Sunningdale for slow learners\".<ref name=\"\u00d3 Ceallaigh\">Dalt\u00fan \u00d3 Ceallaigh.

Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with those (nationalists) who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the \"Irish dimension\" and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young SDLP councillor, [[Hugh Logue]], to an audience at [[Trinity College Dublin]] that Sunningdale was the tool \"by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland\" also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, [[Brian Faulkner]] was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by [[Harry West]]. A [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|UK general election in February 1974]] gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan \"Dublin is only a Sunningdale away\", and the result galvanised their support: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists.<ref name=\"coogan\"/><ref name=\"jbb\"/>\n\nUltimately, however, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the part of loyalist paramilitaries (primarily the Ulster Defence Association, at that time over 20,000 strong{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}) and workers, who formed the [[Ulster Workers' Council]]. They organised a [[general strike]], the [[Ulster Workers' Council strike]]. This severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential services such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British Government did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale initiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by [[MI5]], a part of their campaign to 'disorientate' British prime minister [[Harold Wilson]]'s government.<ref>''Keeping Secrets'', [[London Review of Books]], April 1987.</ref> Faced with such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-sharing government and the new regime collapsed.

During the meetings the parties discussed the possibility of British withdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland. The failure of Sunningdale led to the serious consideration in London until November 1975 of independence. Had the withdrawal occurred \u2013 which Wilson supported but others, including [[James Callaghan]], opposed \u2013 the region would have become a separate [[Dominion]] of the [[British Commonwealth]].{{r|fitzgerald2006}}\n\nThe British negotiations with an illegal organisation angered the Irish government. It did not know their proceedings but feared that the British were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Foreign Minister [[Garret FitzGerald]] discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of orderly withdrawal and independence, [[Repartition of Ireland|repartition of the island]] or a collapse of Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a negotiated independence as the best of the three \"worst case scenarios\", but concluded that the Irish government could do little.{{r|fitzgerald2006}}\n\nThe Irish government had already failed to prevent the IRA from burning down the [[Embassy of the United Kingdom, Dublin|British Embassy]] in 1972. It believed that it could not enlarge the country's small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war in Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for the Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect nationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene, despite Ireland's inability to do so, would \"threaten democratic government in the Republic\", which in turn jeopardised British and European security against Communist and other foreign nations.{{r|fitzgerald2006}}\n\nThe Irish government so dreaded the consequences of an independent Northern Ireland that FitzGerald refused to ask the British not to withdraw\u2014as he feared that openly discussing the issue could permit the British to proceed\u2014and other members of government opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred to as a \"doomsday scenario\". He wrote in 2006 that \"Neither then nor since has public opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came during the last two years of Harold Wilson's premiership.\"<ref name=\"fitzgerald2006\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf |title=The 1974\u20135 Threat of a British Withdrawal from Northern Ireland |author=Garret FitzGerald |journal=Irish Studies in International Affairs |year=2006 |volume=17 |pages=141\u2013150 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926091138/http://www.ria.ie/cgi-bin/ria/papers/100573.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007|doi=10.3318/ISIA.2006.17.1.141 }}</ref>\n\n===Mid-1970s===\n[[File:CW.

In December, one month after the [[Birmingham pub bombings]] which killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings actually escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups.

Three of the bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of the UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus detonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were gunned down in [[Kingsmill massacre|Kingsmill, South Armagh]] after having been ordered off their bus by an armed republican gang, which called itself the [[South Armagh Republican Action Force]]. One man survived despite being shot 18 times, leaving ten fatalities.

When the Provisional IRA's December 1974 ceasefire had ended in early 1976 and it had returned to violence, it had lost the hope that it had felt in the early 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, and instead developed a strategy known as the \"Long War\", which involved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could continue indefinitely. The Official IRA ceasefire of 1972, however, became permanent, and the \"Official\" movement eventually evolved into the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]], which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from the \"Officials\"\u2014the [[Irish National Liberation Army]]\u2014continued a campaign of violence in 1974.<ref name=\"jbb\"/>\n\n===Late 1970s===\nBy the late 1970s, [[war-weariness]] was visible in both communities. One sign of this was the formation of a group known as \"[[Community for Peace People|Peace People]]\", which won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence.

Aspects included the removal of [[internment]] without trial and the removal of political status for paramilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in juryless [[Diplock courts]] to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they were to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among republican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the [[Maze prison]] initiating the \"[[blanket protest|blanket\"]] and [[dirty protest|\"dirty\"]] protests.

He predicted the war would last another 20 years. He conducted open talks with [[John Hume]] \u2013 the SDLP leader \u2013 and secret talks with government officials.

The IRA responded with the [[Shankill Road bombing]] in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and one low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA retaliated with mass shootings in nationalist areas such as [[Greysteel massacre|Greysteel]] and Castlerock. Twelve people were killed at Greysteel and Castlerock, all but two of whom were Catholic.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\nOn 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation Army killed a UVF member in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In revenge, three days later, the UVF [[Loughinisland massacre|killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub]] in [[Loughinisland]], County Down. The IRA, in the remaining month before its ceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and one from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a [[ceasefire]]. The loyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the \"[[Combined Loyalist Military Command]]\", reciprocated six weeks later.

In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader [[Billy Wright (loyalist)|Billy Wright]], leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups.

Since then, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their \"own\" communities and at other factions within their organisations.

These talks led to the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of \"power-sharing\". In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn F\u00e9in. Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]], which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the removal of [[Diplock courts]] under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.<ref>[http://www.nio.gov.uk/media-detail.htm?newsID=13803 Northern Ireland becoming a more normalised society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108133243/http://www.nio.gov.uk/media-detail.htm?newsID=13803 |date=8 January 2007 }} \u2013 Northern Ireland Office, 27 November 2006.</ref>\n\nA security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which comprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border observation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in [[Operation Banner]] \u2013 including the resident battalions of the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] \u2013 that would be replaced by [[19th Light Brigade (United Kingdom)|an infantry brigade]], deployed in ten sites around Northern Ireland but with no operative role in the province.<ref name=\"MODreport\" />\n\nThe power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when unionists withdrew following \"[[Stormontgate]]\", a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont.

The parades are held to commemorate [[William III of England|William of Orange]]'s victory in the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in 1690, which secured the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in [[Portadown]], where an Orange parade from [[Drumcree Church]] passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade, and also loyalist counter-riots against its banning.\n\nIn 1995, 1996 and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting throughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people died in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver, killed by the [[Loyalist Volunteer Force]], and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a mixed-religion family) died when their house in [[Ballymoney]] was petrol-bombed.<ref>{{cite news|title=Michael McGoldrick, 64, Activist in Ulster, Dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/06/world/europe/06mcgoldrick.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 April 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis|title=Police hold six over loyalist turf war deaths|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/aug/05/uk.northernireland1|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London, UK|date=5 August 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/12/newsid_2500000/2500503.stm|title=1998: Children die in Drumcree protests|work=BBC News|date=12 July 1986}}</ref>\n\n==Social repercussions==\n{{further|Paramilitary punishment attacks in Northern Ireland}}\n[[File:RUC, Crois.jpg|thumb|A watchtower at a heavily fortified RUC base in [[Crossmaglen]]]]\n[[File:Belfast peaceline Bombay Street.jpg|thumb|A \"[[peace lines|peace line]]\" at the back of a house on Bombay Street, Belfast]]\n\nThe impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] on the people of London.<ref>Dervla Murphy.

Many people were rendered homeless as a result of intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a role in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new, alien estates when older, decrepit districts such as [[Sailortown, Belfast|Sailortown]] and the [[Pound Loney]] were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah Nelson, this new social problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the breakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to exert a strong influence in certain districts.<ref name=\"nelson126\"/> Vandalism was also a major problem. In the 1970s there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.<ref>Murphy, p. 210.</ref>\n\nAccording to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles engendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern Ireland, resulting in a \"confused hedonism\" in respect of personal life.<ref>[[Jack Holland (writer)|Jack Holland]].
