It is also related to the Obelisk.\n\nIt is hypothesized by [[New York University]] [[Egyptologist]] Patricia Blackwell Gary and ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'' senior editor Richard Talcott that the shapes of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[pyramid]] and obelisk were derived from natural phenomena associated with the sun (the sun-god [[Ra]] being the Egyptians' greatest deity).<ref>Patricia Blackwell Gary and Richard Talcott, \"Stargazing in Ancient Egypt\", ''[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]]'', June 2006, pp. 62\u201367.</ref>  The [[pyramid]] and obelisk's significance have been previously overlooked, especially the astronomical phenomena connected with [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]: the [[zodiacal light]] and [[sun pillar]]s respectively.\n\n==== Nubian ====\nAncient [[Nubia|Nubian kings]]  of  the  [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|twenty-fifth Dynasty]]  sought  to  legitimize  their  rule  over  Egypt  by  constructing  Egyptianizing   monuments   in   the   Middle   Nile   region.

The Ancient Romans were awestruck by the obelisks they saw, and looted the various [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes, in one case they destroyed walls at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]] to haul them out. There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.\n\nThe largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> More well known is the [[Cultural icon|iconic]] {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]].<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> Brought to Rome by the Emperor [[Caligula]] in AD 37, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica.\n\n{{quote|The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].<ref>[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).</ref>}}\n\nPope [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dell\u00aaobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. \u2013 NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.\n\nThree more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the [[Piazza del Popolo]], in 1589.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel \u2013 Titelansicht \u2013 ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich (NEBIS) \u2013 e-rara|publisher=|doi = 10.3931/e-rara-117|year = 1590|last1 = Fontana|first1 = Domenico}}</ref> An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]]. Another obelisk in Rome is sculpted as carried on the back of an [[elephant]]. Rome lost one of its obelisks, the [[Boboli obelisk]] which had decorated the temple of Isis, where it was uncovered in the 16th century. The Medici claimed it for the [[Villa Medici]], but in 1790 they moved it to the [[Boboli Gardens]] attached to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]], and left a replica in its stead.\n\nNot all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome. [[Herod the Great]] imitated his Roman patrons and set up a red granite Egyptian obelisk in the [[hippodrome]] of his new city [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] in northern [[Judea]].

The obelisk was erected by either [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1050\u20131031 BC) or [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.\n\nThe Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments.

The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III's annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.\n\nThe Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh.

Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.\n\nThe largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})<ref>\"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World\" edited by Chris scarre 1999</ref> is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in \"stelae fields\".\n\n===Ancient Roman===\nThe Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style.

Burger, Abstract of \"The Life and Writings of Julio C.

This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations.

The Ancient Romans were awestruck by the obelisks they saw, and looted the various [[Egyptian temple|temple]] complexes, in one case they destroyed walls at the [[Karnak|Temple of Karnak]] to haul them out. There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.\n\nThe largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> More well known is the [[Cultural icon|iconic]] {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]].<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> Brought to Rome by the Emperor [[Caligula]] in AD 37, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica.\n\n{{quote|The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].<ref>[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).</ref>}}\n\nPope [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dell\u00aaobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. \u2013 NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.\n\nThree more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the [[Piazza del Popolo]], in 1589.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel \u2013 Titelansicht \u2013 ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich (NEBIS) \u2013 e-rara|publisher=|doi = 10.3931/e-rara-117|year = 1590|last1 = Fontana|first1 = Domenico}}</ref> An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]].

The Medici claimed it for the [[Villa Medici]], but in 1790 they moved it to the [[Boboli Gardens]] attached to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]], and left a replica in its stead.\n\nNot all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome.

The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.\n\nThe Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments.

The obelisk was erected by [[Shalmaneser III]] and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, [[Jehu]] the Israelite and Sua the Gilzanean, giving gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III's annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.\n\nThe Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh.

Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.\n\nThe largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})<ref>\"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World\" edited by Chris scarre 1999</ref> is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in \"stelae fields\".\n\n===Ancient Roman===\nThe Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style.

This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations.

[[Swami Haridas]] was a great saint-musician who championed [[Hindustani Classical Music]]. [[Tansen]], the great musician in Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]]'s court, was a disciple of [[Swami Haridas]].\n\n[[Kathak]], a classical dance form, involving gracefully coordinated movements of feet along with entire body, grew and flourished in Uttar Pradesh. [[Wajid Ali Shah]], the last [[Nawab of Awadh]], was a great patron and a passionate champion of Kathak. Today, the state is home to two prominent schools of this dance form, namely, Lucknow [[Gharana]] and Banaras [[Gharana]].\n\nWell-known music personalities such as [[Naushad Ali]], [[Talat Mehmood]], [[Begum Akhtar]], [[Anup Jalota]], [[Shubha Mudgal]], [[Bismillah Khan]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Kishan Maharaj]], [[Vikash Maharaj]], [[Hari Prasad Chaurasia]], [[Gopal Shankar Misra]], [[Siddheshwari Devi]], [[Girija Devi]] and Sir [[Cliff Richard]] were originally from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe region's folk heritage includes songs called [[rasiya]] (known and especially popular in [[Braj]]), which celebrate the divine love of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]]. These songs are accompanied by large [[drum]]s known as [[bumb (drum)|bumb]] and are performed at many festivals. Other folk dances or folk theater forms include [[Raslila]], [[Swang (dance drama)|Swang]], [[Ramlila]] (a dramatic enactment of the entire [[Ramayana]]), [[Nautanki]], [[Naqal]] (mimicry) and [[Qawwali]].\n\nThe [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]] is situated in Lucknow.\n\n== Languages ==\n{{Main|Languages of Uttar Pradesh}}\nThe common state-language of Uttar Pradesh is standard Hindi.

Most famous centres are the following:\n\n* [[Agra]] since the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] era has been home to numerous Mughal crafts, including the ''[[Pietra Dura]]'', still practised today.\n* [[Aligarh]] is famous for its Lock around the world; Aligarh boasts for its [[Zardozi|Zari work]], (a type of fabric decoration), 'Jhumka'&nbsp;\u2013 an intricate ear-rings or ear-pendants, [[Manja (kite)|Manja]] and Surma ([[Kohl (cosmetics)]]), despite all these craftwork, painter S.

[[Tansen]], the great musician in Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]]'s court, was a disciple of [[Swami Haridas]].\n\n[[Kathak]], a classical dance form, involving gracefully coordinated movements of feet along with entire body, grew and flourished in Uttar Pradesh. [[Wajid Ali Shah]], the last [[Nawab of Awadh]], was a great patron and a passionate champion of Kathak. Today, the state is home to two prominent schools of this dance form, namely, Lucknow [[Gharana]] and Banaras [[Gharana]].\n\nWell-known music personalities such as [[Naushad Ali]], [[Talat Mehmood]], [[Begum Akhtar]], [[Anup Jalota]], [[Shubha Mudgal]], [[Bismillah Khan]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Kishan Maharaj]], [[Vikash Maharaj]], [[Hari Prasad Chaurasia]], [[Gopal Shankar Misra]], [[Siddheshwari Devi]], [[Girija Devi]] and Sir [[Cliff Richard]] were originally from Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe region's folk heritage includes songs called [[rasiya]] (known and especially popular in [[Braj]]), which celebrate the divine love of [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]].

Other folk dances or folk theater forms include [[Raslila]], [[Swang (dance drama)|Swang]], [[Ramlila]] (a dramatic enactment of the entire [[Ramayana]]), [[Nautanki]], [[Naqal]] (mimicry) and [[Qawwali]].\n\nThe [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]] is situated in Lucknow.\n\n== Languages ==\n{{Main|Languages of Uttar Pradesh}}\nThe common state-language of Uttar Pradesh is standard Hindi.

It was situated beside the General Protestant Hospital which was itself located at the corner of Rideau Street and Charlotte Street. The Committee then obtained, accepted and approved of a plan and specifications. It called for tenders for the whole work of construction, and entered into contracts based upon the best offers submitted by September 11 from which time the building was erected. By January 26, 1891, at the First Annual Report, the sum of $13,885.50 was promised of which $11,600.50 was paid up. All the equipment and furniture of the Institute were provided by the Honorary President and Vice President with the assistance of a large number of women. The Institute was furnished at no cost to the funds of the Corporation. The Directors recorded the following: \"the great obligations under which the Institute is placed to Her Excellency and to Lady Macdonald for the great interest which they have shown in the scheme, and their untiring efforts towards making it a success.\"<ref>Page 8 of the original summary report of the Directors, copied and published by Scholar Select in The Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses</ref>\n\nBy May 21, 1891, the Institute was completed for the sum of $15,830 well under the budgeted amount. It was fully equipped and furnished for the sum of $3,000 free of charge to the corporation. An unknown friend of the Institute gave $4,000 to secure the cost of maintenance during the start of its operation.\n\nOn May 7, 1891, the board of Trustees appointed Miss Gertrude Warren Moore as Lady Superintendant to the Institute. She was a Canadian who graduated as a trained urse at Bellevue Hospital in New York, USA. She was highly recommended to the board by the Superintendant of the Bellevue Hospital, by many physicians and many others who where able to determine of her ability to assume her responsibility as Superintendant of the ''Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses''. Two others graduated nurses were employed to assist the Superintendant nurse in taking charge of the Hospital work. A third nurse was temporarly employed for the same reason. However, the board expected that in a few months only one nurse will suffice. It was expected that the nurse in training will have received enough experience to find among them one able to take the position of Head Nurse. This will make a considerable saving on the expenses. Currently, the Institute had eight nurses and two probationers. It was expecting to increase to twelve to fifteen nurse in training.\n\nOn June 1, 1891, an agreement was reached between the Directors of the Protestant General Hospital and the Directors of the Lady Stanley Institute for the Hospital to take charge of and conducting the nursing therein, and incidental thereto, for the admission of the pupil nurses of the Institute to the Wards of that Institution. Furthermore, the nurses have attended outside patients and they have done district work of a charitable character as part of their training. The ''Lady Stanley Institute for Trained Nurses'' was opened on July 1891. <ref>Pages 29 and 30 of Second Annual Report dated 11 January 1892 signed by J.P. Featherston Honorary Secretary and JNO.

This would help counterbalance the expenditures met in administrating the Institute. It was hoped the Institute would, within the next year (1892), been able to increase considerably its revenue while its expenditures would be greatly reduced. The board also arranged to deliver many courses during the winter. These courses were lectures given by members of the medical profession. These lectures were free of charge for the nurses in training.

It was the largest cruiser in the Danish fleet. The ship was used by [[Prince Valdemar of Denmark]] on a nine-month tour of East Asia in 1899 and 1900, visiting China, Japan, Thailand, and India. During [[World War I]], it was a station ship in the [[Danish West Indies]] from 1915 to 1917, until the islands were sold by Denmark to the [[United States]]. \n\n==Technical characteristics==\n''Valkyrien'' was built at the War Shipyard in [[Copenhagen]], started in 1886 and launched in 1888. The machinery was from [[Burmeister & Wain]] and provided 5,300 HP. The construction of ''Valkyrien'' was radically different from the previous Danish cruisers and was strongly inspired by the [[Chilean cruiser Esmeralda|Chilean cruiser ''Esmeralda'']], which was built a few years earlier at Armstrong in Elswick (near [[Newcastle]]). The ''Esmeralda'', completed in 1884, came to affect an entire generation of cruisers: the rigging was removed, and instead made room for a more powerful machinery and a double screw for better maneuverability. At that time, there were problems in making the armor powerful enough to withstand the cannon, so Armstrong chose to drop the side armor and settle for an armor tire, and in return bet on a powerful cannon armor. The ''Valkyrien'' followed the recipe from ''Esmeralda'' and was thus a modern ship when it was commissioned in 1890. With its top speed of 17.5 knots, the ''Valkyrien'' was able to evade most major warships and, in turn, could cope with smaller ships, a real [[cruiser]].<ref name=\"np\">[http://www.navypedia.org/ships/denmark/dk_cr_valkyrien.htm Navypedia].

Retrieved 16 April 2020.</ref><ref name=\"enc\">[https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/ww1/danish-navy-ww1 Danish Navy WW1]. Naval Encyclopedia.</ref>\n\nLike the other [[armored cruiser]]s, ''Valkyrien'' quickly became obsolete. New types of armor appeared that could withstand its guns, and new fast-firing artillery was developed, which was far more effective. Not until 1915 did the ''Valkyrien'' receive powerful, fast-firing cannons, namely two spare guns from the armored ship ''[[Danish ironclad Peder Skram|Peder Skram]].'' To illustrate the shooting speed, it can be mentioned that the 21 cm guns could fire one shot every three minutes and the original 15 cm guns one shot per shot. minute. The new 15 cm guns could fire 5-6 shots per day. minute. The classification of the Valkyrie was changed from cruiser-[[corvette]] to cruiser in 1910, and at the same time it was transferred to the reserve.<ref name=\"np\" /><ref name=\"dk\" />\n\nThe ''Valkyrien'' was also able to carry two small torpedo boats (No. 10 and 11), which were delivered by Thornycroft in 1888. The small boats of 17 t were 21 m long and resembled the boats that had already been delivered for the armored ships ''[[Danish ironclad Tordenskjold|Tordenskjold]]'', ''[[Danish ironclad Helgoland|Helgoland]]'' and ''[[Danish ironclad Iver Hvitfeldt|Iver Hvitfeldt]]''. From 1890 to 1893 they were used with the ''Valkyrien''. They were renamed the patrol boats P 10 and P 11 in 1912 and only decommissioned in 1917.\n\n==Operational history==\nThe Valkyrien entered service for the first time on June 4, 1890 and exercised with the maneuvering squadron from August 5, to be deactivated again on September 25, 1890. She was only put back into service on June 16, 1893, and then accompanied the royal yacht ''Dannebrog'' with guests to the wedding of the [[George V|Duke of York]] (grandson of the Danish king) with the princess [[Mary of Teck]], who later became the English royal couple. Afterwards it visited [[Madeira]]. From August 2 to September 28, 1893, the cruiser then again belonged to the maneuver squadron. The next activation of the ship began with a trip to a wedding in England. This time the trip was carried out with the coastal armored ship ''Iver Hvitfeldt'' and the wedding couple were the later Norwegian royal couple, [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Carl of Denmark]] and the [[Maud of Wales|English Princess Maud]], both grandchildren of the ruling monarchs. From July 13 to September 30, 1896, the usual naval service followed for the ''Valkyrien''.\n\nThe next activation took place on October 3, 1899, for an East Asia trip expressly advocated by the Danish parliament at the urging of Danish business interests, under the command of the youngest king's son, [[Prince Valdemar of Denmark|Prince Valdemar]]. It was a [[show the flag|show of the flag]] in the Far East by Denmark, where it had commercial interests, as no other Danish warship had been in East Asian waters since ''[[Danish ironclad Tordenskjold|Tordenskjold]]'' in 1870. With a crew of 272, the cruiser began its journey to [[Hong Kong]] via [[Plymouth]], [[Algiers]], [[Malta]], [[Port Said]], [[Aden]], [[Colombo]], [[Singapore]], [[Bangkok]], [[Saigon]]. The cruiser then visited [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Yokohama]], [[Kobe]], [[Nagasaki]] and then traveled back via [[Batavia]], [[Piraeus]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[Le Havre]]. Hans Niels Andersen from ''Det \u00d8stasiatiske Kompagni'' as a representative of the Copenhagen Chamber of Commerce and the journalist Henrik Cavling followed the cruiser to Thailand with a group of Copenhagen companies on the new freighter ''Annam''. The prince also visited the Siamese king [[Chulalongkorn]] and the Japanese [[emperor Meiji]]. In Shanghai the crew of the ship, Prince Valdemar, and other passengers attended a banquet. The cruiser returned to Copenhagen on July 31, 1900, and was already on its way back when the [[Boxer Rebellion|Chinese boxer uprising]] began.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUtAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=danish+cruiser+valkyrien&source=bl&ots=TJUSRE-1YJ&sig=ACfU3U0qhU2K86D6ho1MZqjFLQ4Se53p8w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwifwIuemu7oAhVjOX0KHdhBBLk4FBDoATAAegQIDBAn#v=onepage&q=danish%20cruiser%20valkyrien&f=false Commercial Relations of the United States with Foreign Countries, Volume 2].

From July 1 to September 30, 1903, the cruiser was again in service at home, initially undertaking individual trips and training and from August 3, it was part of the maneuvering squadron. The ship was not reactivated until 1910 and then allocated to the reserve.\n\nOn November 4, 1913, the Valkyria was reactivated to be used in the Mediterranean Sea until February 4, 1914. The operation took place after the end of the [[Balkan Wars]] with ongoing tensions between the states, whereby due to the close relationship of the royal families, Denmark had special relations with [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]]. The cruiser was converted for use and the old, very slow-firing 15 cm guns of the side battery were replaced by modern 75 mm rapid-fire cannons.\n\nWhen the Danish Navy set up its neutrality watch in [[World War I]] from August 1, 1914, the ''Valkyrien'' was assigned to the 2nd Squadron on the Great Belt as a residential and training ship. The modernization of weapons started in 1913 was continued and the two old 21 cm cannons were replaced by modern 15 cm Bofors guns. From April 14 to September 21, 1915, the cruiser served as a training ship for naval officers and prospective engineers.\n\n[[File:Last Danish Parade at Saint Croix.jpg|thumb|A parade as the Danish flag is lowered on Saint Croix, former Danish West Indies. ''Valkyrien'' in the background]]\nOn November 8, 1915 the ''Valkyrien'' was again the station ship for the Danish West Indies. There was general social unrest among the black population, so Denmark felt compelled to send the cruiser to restore calm and order. In January 1916, the United States and Denmark (again) agreed to sell the Danish West Indies. When the secret negotiations in Denmark became known in the summer of 1916, the nationalists protested. The question was first put to the Danish people's vote. The majority of the Danes [[1916 Danish West Indian Islands sale referendum|voted on December 14, 1916 for the sale of Danish West Indies]] to the United States. On April 1, 1917, the islands changed hands for $25 million. The commander of the ''Valkyrien'', Royal Danish Navy Captain [[Henri Konow]], was the last Danish governor of the islands and handled the handover, in a ceremony with the US-designated acting governor, [[United States Navy]] Commander [[E. T. Pollock]]. The islands became the [[United States Virgin Islands]] after the Danish flag was lowered and replaced by the US flag, in the presence of the crew of ''Valkyrien''. The cruiser returned to Denmark on May 10, 1917 and was deactivated.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJkXAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA565&lpg=PA565&dq=danish+cruiser+valkyrien&source=bl&ots=3Dbdnq0SEQ&sig=ACfU3U1ZEpQe8hmROMvPpgZD9f0Uth-ZEQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj91aLEl-7oAhVUHTQIHbGLC0A4ChDoATAFegQIChA-#v=onepage&q=danish%20cruiser%20valkyrien&f=false The Abridgment: Containing Messages of the President of the United States to the Two Houses of Congress with Reports of Departments and Selections from Accompanying Papers].

From May to September 1919 he was again a training ship for cadets. In July the ship was sent to Egypt and Malta to move North [[Schleswig]] under the German prisoners of war to return to Denmark. The ship returned with 160 men from the camps. From October to February 1920 trips to the Netherlands, Belgium and France followed, which brought another 135 \"s\u00f8nderjyder\" back to Denmark. In the summer of 1921 the ''Valkyrien'' was used for a trip by the Danish king to the [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Iceland]].\n\nFrom May 17 to September 15, 1923, the last active phase of the ship followed, which served as a training ship for the officers 'and officers' school. The ''Valkyrien'' was then sold for demolition, which was completed in Denmark in 1924.\n\n==Danish cruisers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\"\n|-\n!

It was the largest cruiser in the Danish fleet. The ship was used by [[Prince Valdemar of Denmark]] on a nine-month tour of East Asia in 1899 and 1900, visiting China, Japan, Thailand, and India. During [[World War I]], it was a station ship in the [[Danish West Indies]] from 1915 to 1917, until the islands were sold by Denmark to the [[United States]]. \n\n==Technical characteristics==\n''Valkyrien'' was built at the War Shipyard in [[Copenhagen]], started in 1886 and launched in 1888. The machinery was from [[Burmeister & Wain]] and provided 5,300 HP. The construction of ''Valkyrien'' was radically different from the previous Danish cruisers and was strongly inspired by the [[Chilean cruiser Esmeralda|Chilean cruiser ''Esmeralda'']], which was built a few years earlier at Armstrong in Elswick (near [[Newcastle]]). The ''Esmeralda'', completed in 1884, came to affect an entire generation of cruisers: the rigging was removed, and instead made room for a more powerful machinery and a double screw for better maneuverability. At that time, there were problems in making the armor powerful enough to withstand the cannon, so Armstrong chose to drop the side armor and settle for an armor tire, and in return bet on a powerful cannon armor. The ''Valkyrien'' followed the recipe from ''Esmeralda'' and was thus a modern ship when it was commissioned in 1890. With its top speed of 17.5 knots, the ''Valkyrien'' was able to evade most major warships and, in turn, could cope with smaller ships, a real [[cruiser]].<ref name=\"np\">[http://www.navypedia.org/ships/denmark/dk_cr_valkyrien.htm Navypedia]. Retrieved 16 April 2020.</ref><ref name=\"dk\">[https://www.navalhistory.dk/English/TheShips/VW/Valkyrien(1890).htm VALKYRIEN (1890-1923)] Danish Naval History. Retrieved 16 April 2020.</ref><ref name=\"enc\">[https://www.naval-encyclopedia.com/ww1/danish-navy-ww1 Danish Navy WW1]. Naval Encyclopedia.</ref>\n\nLike the other [[armored cruiser]]s, ''Valkyrien'' quickly became obsolete. New types of armor appeared that could withstand its guns, and new fast-firing artillery was developed, which was far more effective. Not until 1915 did the ''Valkyrien'' receive powerful, fast-firing cannons, namely two spare guns from the armored ship ''[[Danish ironclad Peder Skram|Peder Skram]].'' To illustrate the shooting speed, it can be mentioned that the 21 cm guns could fire one shot every three minutes and the original 15 cm guns one shot per shot. minute. The new 15 cm guns could fire 5-6 shots per day. minute. The classification of the Valkyrie was changed from cruiser-[[corvette]] to cruiser in 1910, and at the same time it was transferred to the reserve.<ref name=\"np\" /><ref name=\"dk\" />\n\nThe ''Valkyrien'' was also able to carry two small torpedo boats (No. 10 and 11), which were delivered by Thornycroft in 1888. The small boats of 17 t were 21 m long and resembled the boats that had already been delivered for the armored ships ''[[Danish ironclad Tordenskjold|Tordenskjold]]'', ''[[Danish ironclad Helgoland|Helgoland]]'' and ''[[Danish ironclad Iver Hvitfeldt|Iver Hvitfeldt]]''. From 1890 to 1893 they were used with the ''Valkyrien''. They were renamed the patrol boats P 10 and P 11 in 1912 and only decommissioned in 1917.\n\n==Operational history==\nThe Valkyrien entered service for the first time on June 4, 1890 and exercised with the maneuvering squadron from August 5, to be deactivated again on September 25, 1890. She was only put back into service on June 16, 1893, and then accompanied the royal yacht ''Dannebrog'' with guests to the wedding of the [[George V|Duke of York]] (grandson of the Danish king) with the princess [[Mary of Teck]], who later became the English royal couple. Afterwards it visited [[Madeira]]. From August 2 to September 28, 1893, the cruiser then again belonged to the maneuver squadron. The next activation of the ship began with a trip to a wedding in England. This time the trip was carried out with the coastal armored ship ''Iver Hvitfeldt'' and the wedding couple were the later Norwegian royal couple, [[Haakon VII of Norway|Prince Carl of Denmark]] and the [[Maud of Wales|English Princess Maud]], both grandchildren of the ruling monarchs. From July 13 to September 30, 1896, the usual naval service followed for the ''Valkyrien''.\n\nThe next activation took place on October 3, 1899, for an East Asia trip expressly advocated by the Danish parliament at the urging of Danish business interests, under the command of the youngest king's son, [[Prince Valdemar of Denmark|Prince Valdemar]]. It was a [[show the flag|show of the flag]] in the Far East by Denmark, where it had commercial interests, as no other Danish warship had been in East Asian waters since ''[[Danish ironclad Tordenskjold|Tordenskjold]]'' in 1870. With a crew of 272, the cruiser began its journey to [[Hong Kong]] via [[Plymouth]], [[Algiers]], [[Malta]], [[Port Said]], [[Aden]], [[Colombo]], [[Singapore]], [[Bangkok]], [[Saigon]]. The cruiser then visited [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], [[Yokohama]], [[Kobe]], [[Nagasaki]] and then traveled back via [[Batavia]], [[Piraeus]], [[Gibraltar]] and [[Le Havre]]. Hans Niels Andersen from ''Det \u00d8stasiatiske Kompagni'' as a representative of the Copenhagen Chamber of Commerce and the journalist Henrik Cavling followed the cruiser to Thailand with a group of Copenhagen companies on the new freighter ''Annam''. The prince also visited the Siamese king [[Chulalongkorn]] and the Japanese [[emperor Meiji]]. In Shanghai the crew of the ship, Prince Valdemar, and other passengers attended a banquet. The cruiser returned to Copenhagen on July 31, 1900, and was already on its way back when the [[Boxer Rebellion|Chinese boxer uprising]] began.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=dLUtAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=danish+cruiser+valkyrien&source=bl&ots=TJUSRE-1YJ&sig=ACfU3U0qhU2K86D6ho1MZqjFLQ4Se53p8w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwifwIuemu7oAhVjOX0KHdhBBLk4FBDoATAAegQIDBAn#v=onepage&q=danish%20cruiser%20valkyrien&f=false Commercial Relations of the United States with Foreign Countries, Volume 2].
