The constitution concentrates executive and legislative authority in the king.\n\nJordan has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]], the National Assembly, consisting of an upper house, the [[Senate of Jordan|Assembly of Senators]], appointed by the king and an elected lower house, the [[Parliament of Jordan|Chamber of Deputies]]. The members of both houses hold office for four-year terms. There are 60 seats in the Senate and 120 in the Chamber of Deputies. In the Chamber of Deputies 12 seats are reserved for women, 9 seats for Christian candidates, 9 for Bedouin candidates, and 3 for Jordanians of Chechen or Circassian descent.<ref name=CIAFactbook-Jordan/> The Assembly of Senators is responsible to the [[Chamber of Deputies]] and can be dismissed by \"a vote of no confidence\". The king may dissolve the National Assembly, forcing new elections. King Abdullah did that on 24 November 2009, and the government ruled by decree through most of 2010, until new elections were held in November. Parliamentary elections have been deemed credible by international observers. The king signs and executes all laws, but his veto power can be overridden by two-thirds vote of the National Assembly. The judicial branch is completely independent. Security forces report to civilian authorities.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThe law does not provide citizens the right to change their monarch or government. The king appoints and dismisses the prime minister, cabinet, the Assembly of Senators, and judges, may dissolve parliament, commands the military, and directs major public policy initiatives. The cabinet, based on the prime minister's recommendation, appoints the mayors of Amman, Wadi Musa (Petra), and Aqaba, a special economic zone. The mayors of the other 93 municipalities are elected.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nOpposition movements are legal in Jordan and are involved in Jordan's political life. The government licenses political parties and other associations and prohibits membership in unlicensed political parties. There are over 50 licensed political parties, but only a few have a substantial impact at the national level.\n\nJordan ranked sixth among the 19 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, and 50th out of 178 countries worldwide in the 2010 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI) issued by [[Transparency International]], where 1st is the least corrupt.<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results \"Corruption Perceptions Index 2010 Results\"], Transparency International</ref> Jordan's 2010 CPI score was 4.7 on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean).

Jordan's score was 37 on a scale from 0 (most free) to 105 (least free).<ref>[http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html Press Freedom Index 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721221055/http://en.rsf.org/press-freedom-index-2010,1034.html |date=21 July 2011 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 20 October 2010</ref>\n\nThe law provides for up to three years' imprisonment for insulting the king, slandering the government or foreign leaders, offending religious beliefs, or stirring sectarian strife and sedition. In practice citizens are generally able to criticize the government, although they reportedly exercise caution in regard to the king, the royal family, the [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|General Intelligence Directorate]] (GID), and other sensitive topics such as religion.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThe government continues to enforce bans on the publication of selected books for religious, moral, and political reasons, some foreign films are edited prior to release, and the media is directly and indirectly censored. Authorities monitor and censor printing presses and edit articles deemed offensive before they can be printed. Journalists claim the government uses informants in newsrooms and that GID officials monitor reporting. Editors reportedly receive telephone calls from security officials instructing them how to cover events or to refrain from covering certain topics or events. Government officials also reportedly bribe journalists to influence their reporting. Media observers note that when covering controversial subjects, government-owned [[Jordan Radio and Television]] and [[Jordan News Agency]] reported only the government's position.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nJournalists report that the threat of detention and imprisonment under the penal code for a variety of offenses, and stringent fines of as much as 20,000 dinars ($28,000) under the press and publications law for defamation leads to self-censorship. According to a 2009 Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists survey, 95 percent of journalists polled exercised self-censorship. The survey also reported that 70 percent of journalists thought the government used \"soft containment\", such as financial support, scholarships for relatives, and special invitations, to control the media at a medium to high degree. Ninety-four percent said they avoid writing about or broadcasting military matters, and 83 percent said they avoid discussing religious topics.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThere were several cases in which the government prohibited journalists from reporting on high-profile court cases. For example, a [[State Security Court]] attorney general prohibited the press from reporting or commenting on the case of the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company expansion project without his personal approval, purportedly to allow the judicial authorities to work \"calmly\" on the case.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThe clash between Jordanian media and the Lower House has been a chronic struggle for decades. The state of press freedom in Jordan is very fickle, at one point Jordan had one of the most vocal media in the Arab World, but a series of laws passed by Parliament greatly restricted press freedom. The Jordanian media has been very vocal expressing its opposition towards Parliament often leading to clashes. One Jordanian journalist wrote a fiery article called \"For God Sake, Abdullah\", in which he called on King Abdullah to dissolve the corrupt Lower House.<ref>[http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/6143-jordans-news-websites-running-legal-cover \"Jordan's news websites running for legal cover\"], Oula Farawati, Menassat, 11 March 2009</ref> He was prosecuted by the Lower House, but was later acquitted by the judiciary.\n\nIn October 2001, the government amended the Penal Code and introduced a restrictive Press Law that effectively revokes the relative freedom of the press guaranteed by the 1993 Press Law and punishes any act that can be deemed critical of the Jordanian government. Anyone who \"slanders\" the King or other members of the royal family can be sentenced to three years imprisonment. The introduction of these new laws has led to the detention and imprisonment of several journalists and leaders of peaceful associations.\n\nIn May 2006, two journalists involved in reprinting three of the 12 [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]] were issued a two-month prison sentence.<ref>[http://ar.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=17864 \"First prison sentences announced for reprinting Mohammed cartoons\"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Reporters Without Borders, 31 May 2006, accessed 13 September 2012</ref> Jordan was the only Muslim country to reprint the Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammed in one of its newspapers. The two Jordanian editors responsible were sacked and pressured to issue a public apology.\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, King Abdullah II issued a royal decree forbidding jailing of journalists in Jordan, an act praised by human rights groups in Jordan and around the world.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nAccording to [[Human Rights Watch]], Jordanian authorities has used counterterrorism laws to prosecute activists, [[dissident]]s, [[journalist]]s and Islamic preachers for speech offenses, the authorities depends largely on counterterrorism law that extended the definition of [[terrorism]] to include acts such as disturbing Jordan's relations with a foreign state. In February, a senior [[Muslim Brotherhood]] figure, Zaki Bani Irsheid, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after a post on [[Facebook]] criticizing the [[United Arab Emirates]]. In June, Eyad Qunaibi, an Islamic preacher, was arrested after posting Facebook comments criticizing the liberal lifestyle of a segment of the Jordanian society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/jordan|title=Jordan|date=2016-01-11|access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>\n\nJordan is listed as engaged in selective internet filtering in the political area and as showing no evidence of filtering in the social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) in August 2009. Internet censorship in Jordan is relatively light, with filtering selectively applied to only a small number of sites. However, media laws and regulations encourage some measure of self-censorship in cyberspace, and citizens have reportedly been questioned and arrested for Web content they have authored. Internet censorship in Jordan is mainly focused on political issues that might be seen as a threat to national security due to the nation's close proximity to regional hotspots of [[Israel]], Iraq, [[Lebanon]], and the [[Palestinian territories]].<ref>[http://opennet.net/research/profiles/jordan \"ONI Country Profile: Jordan\"], OpenNet Initiative, 6 August 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2013, however, the Press and Publications Department initiated a ban on Jordanian news websites which had not registered and been licensed by government agency. The order issued to Telecommunication Regulatory Commission contained a list of over 300 websites to be blocked. The mandatory registration of websites was a part of amendments made to the Press and Publications Law in September 2012. The amendments included articles that would hold online news sites accountable for the comments left by their readers, prohibiting them from publishing comments that are deemed \"irrelevant\" or \"unrelated\" to the article. The restriction caused several prominent sites to turn off their comments sections. Online news sites are required to archive all comments for at least six months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://7iber.com/2013/06/internet-blocking-begins-in-jordan/|title=Internet Blocking Begins In Jordan|date=2013-06-02|accessdate=2013-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Freedom of religion===\n{{main|Freedom of religion in Jordan}}\n\nAccording to US Department of State's Human Rights Reports in 2015 legal and societal discrimination and harassment remained a problem for religious minorities, and religious converts.<ref name=\"US State\">{{cite web|title=JORDAN 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/253143.pdf|website=US Department of State|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Jordanian Constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion in accordance with the customs in the Kingdom, unless they violate public order or morality. Jordan's state religion is Islam. The Government bans conversion from Islam and efforts to proselytize Muslims. While proselytizing to Christians may not be banned, it is equally not favored and very hampered with bureaucratic red tape that renders it near impossible to legalize.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101123110822/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148826.htm \"Country report for Jordan\"], ''International Religious Freedom Report 2010'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 17 November 2010</ref>\n\nThe US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report of 2009 indicated that there were \"no reports that the practice of any faith was prohibited\" in Jordan. In fact, Jordan has been highlighted as a model of interfaith dialogue.

At least one Christian holds a ministerial post in every government, nine seats in the 120-seat Parliament are reserved for Christians, and a similar number is appointed to the Upper House by the King. In addition, Christians have traditionally prospered in the kingdom to the extent that Jordanian Christians are believed to own or run about a third of the Jordanian economy despite making up only 6% of the total population.

In addition, a few Chinese, Bangladeshi, Indian, Sri Lankan, and Vietnamese men and women encountered conditions indicative of forced labor in a few factories in the garment sector, including factories in Jordan's Qualifying Industrial Zones, such as the unlawful withholding of passports, delayed payment of wages, and, in a few cases, verbal and physical abuse.<ref>[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/Nov/07/Jordan-not-protecting-rights-of-women-migrant-workers.ashx#axzz1N6WZEOyz \"Jordan 'not protecting' rights of women migrant workers\"], Agence France Presse (AFP) in the ''Daily Star'', 7 November 2008</ref> Instances of forced labor reportedly continued to decline due to enhanced labor inspections and other recent measures undertaken by the government within the garment sector.

According to Amnesty International, despite addressing important issues, the regulations are loosely worded and open to interpretation in certain respects, fail to specify mechanisms for determining wages, or to resolve long-standing problems related to nonpayment of wages or low wages. They also fail to provide effective safeguards against physical violence and sexual abuse by employers of domestic workers, the great majority of whom are women, and appear to place women at risk by requiring domestic workers to obtain their employer's permission before leaving their house.<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-jordan-2010?page=2 \"Migrants' rights \u2013 domestic workers\"], on page 2 of ''Annual Report: Jordan 2010'', Amnesty International, 28 May 2010</ref>\n\nWhile there has been some improvement in combating human trafficking, Jordan remains a Tier 2 country (countries whose governments do not fully comply with the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act's minimum standards,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100619082931/http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142765.htm \"Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Div.

In a few cases, the media and human rights organizations reported that authorities kept detainees in solitary confinement and denied them access to lawyers.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nHuman rights observers claimed that police make arrests before obtaining warrants and prosecutors fail to file charges or seek extensions in a timely manner. Prosecutors routinely request and are granted extensions that increase the period to file formal charges to as long as six months for a felony and two months for a misdemeanor. This practice can lengthen pretrial detention for protracted periods. Some detainees report not being allowed timely access to a lawyer, but authorities generally permit visits by family members.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nIn facilities operated by the General Intelligence Directorate (GID) there are allegations of long periods of incommunicado detention, lengthy pretrial detention without being informed of charges, and not allowing defendants to meet with their lawyers or permitting meetings only shortly before trial.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nUnder the Crime Prevention Law, provincial governors may detain individuals suspected of planning to commit a crime or those who allegedly shelter thieves, habitually steal, or constitute a danger to the public, and in practice they used this provision widely. Those accused are subject to imprisonment or house arrest as \"administrative detention\" without formal charges. A detention order may be for as long as one year, but governors can impose new orders to prolong detentions. International and national NGOs noted that governors routinely abused the law, imprisoning individuals when there was not enough evidence to convict them and prolonging detentions of prisoners whose sentences had expired. The law was also widely used to incarcerate women at risk of being honor crime victims.<ref name=HRW-Jordan/><ref name=AIR-2011/><ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/><ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/05/26/jordan-end-administrative-detention \"Jordan: End Administrative Detention\"], Human Rights Watch, 26 May 2009</ref>\n\nJordanian law provides for an independent judiciary; however, the judiciary's independence in practice may be compromised by nepotism and the influence of special interests.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/><ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/>\n\nThe law presumes that all defendants are innocent until proven guilty. Juries are not used. Most trials in civilian courts are open and procedurally sound, but the [[State Security Court]] (SSC) may close its proceedings to the public.<ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/> Defendants are entitled to legal counsel, provided at public expense for the indigent in cases involving the death penalty or potential life imprisonment. In many cases defendants have no legal representation. Defendants can present witnesses on their behalf and question witnesses against them. Defense attorneys were generally granted access to government-held evidence relevant to their clients' cases. Defendants can appeal verdicts and appeals are automatic for cases involving the death penalty.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThere are significant problems with the conditions in prisons, including poor legal services, under staffing, inadequate food and health care, poor sanitation standards, poor ventilation, extreme temperatures, inadequate access to potable water, ineffective pre-release and post-release programs, and insufficient basic and emergency medical care.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2009/08/21/jordan-prison-reform-promises-broken \"Jordan: Prison Reform Promises Broken\"], Human Rights Watch, 21 August 2009</ref> Some detainees report abuse and mistreatment by guards.<ref name=AIR-2011/> Hunger strikes remain common, but prison riots and allegations of mistreatment have decreased.

Women have assumed high-level governmental positions in greater numbers, gaining appointments as ministers and lawmakers with increasing frequency. An average of three ministerial portfolios has been assigned to women in each cabinet since 2004, and a gender-based quota system, first introduced for the lower house of parliament in 2003, was expanded to municipal councils in 2007.<ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/>\n\nFrom 2004 until the end of 2009, the women's movement made a number of important gains, including the publication of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in the official gazette, which gave it the force of law. Additionally, the government has taken steps to address the problem of domestic abuse, including the February 2007 opening of the country's first major women's shelter, the Family Reconciliation House, and the March 2008 promulgation of the Family Protection Law, designed to regulate the handling of domestic abuse cases by medical workers and law enforcement bodies.<ref name=FHCountryRatings-Jordan-2010/>\n\nToday, Jordanian women largely enjoy legal equality in freedom of movement, health care, education, political participation, and employment.

The constitution concentrates executive and legislative authority in the king.\n\nJordan has a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]], the National Assembly, consisting of an upper house, the [[Senate of Jordan|Assembly of Senators]], appointed by the king and an elected lower house, the [[Parliament of Jordan|Chamber of Deputies]]. The members of both houses hold office for four-year terms. There are 60 seats in the Senate and 120 in the Chamber of Deputies. In the Chamber of Deputies 12 seats are reserved for women, 9 seats for Christian candidates, 9 for Bedouin candidates, and 3 for Jordanians of Chechen or Circassian descent.<ref name=CIAFactbook-Jordan/> The Assembly of Senators is responsible to the [[Chamber of Deputies]] and can be dismissed by \"a vote of no confidence\". The king may dissolve the National Assembly, forcing new elections. King Abdullah did that on 24 November 2009, and the government ruled by decree through most of 2010, until new elections were held in November. Parliamentary elections have been deemed credible by international observers. The king signs and executes all laws, but his veto power can be overridden by two-thirds vote of the National Assembly. The judicial branch is completely independent. Security forces report to civilian authorities.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThe law does not provide citizens the right to change their monarch or government. The king appoints and dismisses the prime minister, cabinet, the Assembly of Senators, and judges, may dissolve parliament, commands the military, and directs major public policy initiatives. The cabinet, based on the prime minister's recommendation, appoints the mayors of Amman, Wadi Musa (Petra), and Aqaba, a special economic zone. The mayors of the other 93 municipalities are elected.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nOpposition movements are legal in Jordan and are involved in Jordan's political life. The government licenses political parties and other associations and prohibits membership in unlicensed political parties. There are over 50 licensed political parties, but only a few have a substantial impact at the national level.\n\nJordan ranked sixth among the 19 countries in the Middle East and North Africa region, and 50th out of 178 countries worldwide in the 2010 [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI) issued by [[Transparency International]], where 1st is the least corrupt.<ref>[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results \"Corruption Perceptions Index 2010 Results\"], Transparency International</ref> Jordan's 2010 CPI score was 4.7 on a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 10 (very clean).

In practice citizens are generally able to criticize the government, although they reportedly exercise caution in regard to the king, the royal family, the [[General Intelligence Directorate (Jordan)|General Intelligence Directorate]] (GID), and other sensitive topics such as religion.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThe government continues to enforce bans on the publication of selected books for religious, moral, and political reasons, some foreign films are edited prior to release, and the media is directly and indirectly censored. Authorities monitor and censor printing presses and edit articles deemed offensive before they can be printed. Journalists claim the government uses informants in newsrooms and that GID officials monitor reporting. Editors reportedly receive telephone calls from security officials instructing them how to cover events or to refrain from covering certain topics or events. Government officials also reportedly bribe journalists to influence their reporting. Media observers note that when covering controversial subjects, government-owned [[Jordan Radio and Television]] and [[Jordan News Agency]] reported only the government's position.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nJournalists report that the threat of detention and imprisonment under the penal code for a variety of offenses, and stringent fines of as much as 20,000 dinars ($28,000) under the press and publications law for defamation leads to self-censorship. According to a 2009 Center for Defending the Freedom of Journalists survey, 95 percent of journalists polled exercised self-censorship. The survey also reported that 70 percent of journalists thought the government used \"soft containment\", such as financial support, scholarships for relatives, and special invitations, to control the media at a medium to high degree. Ninety-four percent said they avoid writing about or broadcasting military matters, and 83 percent said they avoid discussing religious topics.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThere were several cases in which the government prohibited journalists from reporting on high-profile court cases. For example, a [[State Security Court]] attorney general prohibited the press from reporting or commenting on the case of the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company expansion project without his personal approval, purportedly to allow the judicial authorities to work \"calmly\" on the case.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nThe clash between Jordanian media and the Lower House has been a chronic struggle for decades. The state of press freedom in Jordan is very fickle, at one point Jordan had one of the most vocal media in the Arab World, but a series of laws passed by Parliament greatly restricted press freedom. The Jordanian media has been very vocal expressing its opposition towards Parliament often leading to clashes. One Jordanian journalist wrote a fiery article called \"For God Sake, Abdullah\", in which he called on King Abdullah to dissolve the corrupt Lower House.<ref>[http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/6143-jordans-news-websites-running-legal-cover \"Jordan's news websites running for legal cover\"], Oula Farawati, Menassat, 11 March 2009</ref> He was prosecuted by the Lower House, but was later acquitted by the judiciary.\n\nIn October 2001, the government amended the Penal Code and introduced a restrictive Press Law that effectively revokes the relative freedom of the press guaranteed by the 1993 Press Law and punishes any act that can be deemed critical of the Jordanian government. Anyone who \"slanders\" the King or other members of the royal family can be sentenced to three years imprisonment. The introduction of these new laws has led to the detention and imprisonment of several journalists and leaders of peaceful associations.\n\nIn May 2006, two journalists involved in reprinting three of the 12 [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons]] were issued a two-month prison sentence.<ref>[http://ar.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=17864 \"First prison sentences announced for reprinting Mohammed cartoons\"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Reporters Without Borders, 31 May 2006, accessed 13 September 2012</ref> Jordan was the only Muslim country to reprint the Danish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammed in one of its newspapers. The two Jordanian editors responsible were sacked and pressured to issue a public apology.\n\nAt the beginning of 2009, King Abdullah II issued a royal decree forbidding jailing of journalists in Jordan, an act praised by human rights groups in Jordan and around the world.<ref name=USDOS-HumanRights-Jordan/>\n\nAccording to [[Human Rights Watch]], Jordanian authorities has used counterterrorism laws to prosecute activists, [[dissident]]s, [[journalist]]s and Islamic preachers for speech offenses, the authorities depends largely on counterterrorism law that extended the definition of [[terrorism]] to include acts such as disturbing Jordan's relations with a foreign state. In February, a senior [[Muslim Brotherhood]] figure, Zaki Bani Irsheid, was sentenced to 18 months in prison after a post on [[Facebook]] criticizing the [[United Arab Emirates]]. In June, Eyad Qunaibi, an Islamic preacher, was arrested after posting Facebook comments criticizing the liberal lifestyle of a segment of the Jordanian society.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/jordan|title=Jordan|date=2016-01-11|access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>\n\nJordan is listed as engaged in selective internet filtering in the political area and as showing no evidence of filtering in the social, conflict/security, and Internet tools areas by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) in August 2009. Internet censorship in Jordan is relatively light, with filtering selectively applied to only a small number of sites. However, media laws and regulations encourage some measure of self-censorship in cyberspace, and citizens have reportedly been questioned and arrested for Web content they have authored. Internet censorship in Jordan is mainly focused on political issues that might be seen as a threat to national security due to the nation's close proximity to regional hotspots of [[Israel]], Iraq, [[Lebanon]], and the [[Palestinian territories]].<ref>[http://opennet.net/research/profiles/jordan \"ONI Country Profile: Jordan\"], OpenNet Initiative, 6 August 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2013, however, the Press and Publications Department initiated a ban on Jordanian news websites which had not registered and been licensed by government agency. The order issued to Telecommunication Regulatory Commission contained a list of over 300 websites to be blocked. The mandatory registration of websites was a part of amendments made to the Press and Publications Law in September 2012. The amendments included articles that would hold online news sites accountable for the comments left by their readers, prohibiting them from publishing comments that are deemed \"irrelevant\" or \"unrelated\" to the article. The restriction caused several prominent sites to turn off their comments sections. Online news sites are required to archive all comments for at least six months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://7iber.com/2013/06/internet-blocking-begins-in-jordan/|title=Internet Blocking Begins In Jordan|date=2013-06-02|accessdate=2013-06-02}}</ref>\n\n===Freedom of religion===\n{{main|Freedom of religion in Jordan}}\n\nAccording to US Department of State's Human Rights Reports in 2015 legal and societal discrimination and harassment remained a problem for religious minorities, and religious converts.<ref name=\"US State\">{{cite web|title=JORDAN 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/253143.pdf|website=US Department of State|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Jordanian Constitution provides for the freedom to practice one's religion in accordance with the customs in the Kingdom, unless they violate public order or morality.

At least one Christian holds a ministerial post in every government, nine seats in the 120-seat Parliament are reserved for Christians, and a similar number is appointed to the Upper House by the King. In addition, Christians have traditionally prospered in the kingdom to the extent that Jordanian Christians are believed to own or run about a third of the Jordanian economy despite making up only 6% of the total population. They serve in the military, many have high positions in the army, and they have established good relations with the royal family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jordan-business.net/magazine/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=235&Itemid=40 |title=Born Again Problems |publisher=Jordan Business |accessdate=2010-06-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501092232/http://www.jordan-business.net/magazine/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=235&Itemid=40 |archive-date=1 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Pope has been to Jordan, where he was welcomed by the royal family.\n\n==Human trafficking and migrant workers==\n{{main|Human trafficking in Jordan}}\nJordan is a destination for women and men subjected to [[Human trafficking|trafficking in persons]], specifically conditions of [[forced labor]] and, to a lesser extent, forced prostitution.

According to Amnesty International, despite addressing important issues, the regulations are loosely worded and open to interpretation in certain respects, fail to specify mechanisms for determining wages, or to resolve long-standing problems related to nonpayment of wages or low wages. They also fail to provide effective safeguards against physical violence and sexual abuse by employers of domestic workers, the great majority of whom are women, and appear to place women at risk by requiring domestic workers to obtain their employer's permission before leaving their house.<ref>[http://www.amnestyusa.org/research/reports/annual-report-jordan-2010?page=2 \"Migrants' rights \u2013 domestic workers\"], on page 2 of ''Annual Report: Jordan 2010'', Amnesty International, 28 May 2010</ref>\n\nWhile there has been some improvement in combating human trafficking, Jordan remains a Tier 2 country (countries whose governments do not fully comply with the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act's minimum standards,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100619082931/http://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142765.htm \"Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, Div.

Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected the return of refugees in the Israeli Cabinet decision of June 1948 reiterated in a letter to the UN of 2 August 1949 containing the Text of a statement made by [[Moshe Sharett]] on 1 August 1948 where the basic attitude of the Israeli Government was that a solution must be sought, not through the return of the refugees to Israel, but through the resettlement of the Palestinian Arab refugee population in other states.<ref>[http://domino.un.org/pdfs/AAC25IS33.pdf UN Doc.

That the ceasefire line should be treated as an international border, pending full ''de jure'' recognition in a final peace agreement.\n*3. The right to settle Jews on all the land within their territory, with the right to develop the economy without having to take into account the rights of the previous owners.\nThe Arab nations conversely also saw the General Armistice Agreements as conferring 3 rights:<ref name=\"AS1\"/>\n*1. That the agreements were a truce and therefore did not end the state of war.\n*2. That the ceasefire lines were temporary and were not an international border.\n*3. The Armistice Agreements did not cancel out the refugees right of return.\n\n===Security===\nIsraeli security was thought of on two levels general security and daily security.<ref>Journal of Strategic Studies, Volume 31, Issue 2 April 2008, pages 295 - 324 'Pounding Their Feet': Israeli Military Culture as Reflected in Early IDF Combat History</ref> The general security covered the threat of invasion while daily security was to secure Israeli territory from infiltration. This was achieved by three processes. The transfer of [[Israeli Arabs]] away from the ceasefire lines to urban areas of concentration such as [[Jaffa]] and [[Haifa]]; the resettlement of the areas cleared, mainly by [[mizrahi]]m (oriental Jews) in [[moshavim]] along the ceasefire lines; and operating a free fire policy.<ref>Avi Shlaim \"The Iron Wall; Israel and the Arab World Penguin Books {{ISBN|0-14-028870-8}} p. 82</ref>\n\nOnce the fighting phase of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war had ceased with a truce, the Israeli bureaucracy was faced with the overwhelming task of ruling effectively over dozens of severely disrupted Israeli Arab villages and towns, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had taken refuge. Since the Israeli state did not trust its Israeli Arab citizens seeing them as a potential 5th Column, it placed this entire population under a tight military regime supervised by the Central Committee for Arab Affairs. Established in 1954, the committee had representatives from the police and the domestic intelligence agency, [[Shin Bet|Shabak]], as well as the prime minister\u2019s consultant for Arab affairs and the commander-in-chief of military rule. In concert, the committee presided over three regional sub-committees (south, center and north), which dealt with the daily business of governance.\n\nThe Registration of Residents ordinance of 1949 left those unregistered Palestinian Arabs without legal status and vulnerable to deportation. The abandoned Property law of 1950; where the moveable and immovable property belonging to the refugees was effectively appropriated by the state of Israel applied not just to Palestinian refugees who had left Israeli territory but also to Palestinian Arabs who had remained in Israel but who had left their ordinary place of residence. One quarter of the Arab citizens of Israel are \"internal refugees,\" who until 1948 resided in villages that were destroyed in the war.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981354.html Ha\u2019aretz] World Likud chief calls for cancellation of Nakba Day procession By Yoav Stern, Haaretz Correspondent Monday, 19 May 2008</ref>\n\n====Infiltration====\nThe estimates for 1949 to 1956 was that 90% of all infiltration was motivated by social and economic concerns.<ref>Benny Morris, (1993). \"Israel's Border Wars, 1949-1956; Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation and the Countdown to the Suez War\"; Oxford Clarendon Press, {{ISBN|0-19-829262-7}} pp 49 & 412.</ref> It was naturally difficult to prevent [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]] who were living on a bare subsistence level, from crossing lines beyond which they hope to find fodder for their hungry sheep, or for scarce fuel. Additionally there occurred occasional nightly clandestine smuggling between Gaza and Hebron. The smuggling was largely motivated by the great discrepancy of prices prevailing in the two areas.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/> Most of these complaints in 1950 concerned the shooting by Israelis of refugee civilians and livestock, said to have illegally crossed the demarcation lines. In the most serious case of this kind, Egypt complained that Israeli military Forces, on the 7 and 14 October 1950, had shelled and machine-gunned the Arab villages of [[Abassan]] and [[Beit Hanoun]] in Egyptian controlled territory of the Gaza strip. This action caused the death of seven and the wounding of twenty civilians. Israel on the other hand complained of infiltration incidents which had resulted in the death of four Israeli settlers and the wounding of twenty others.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/>\n\nThe pejorative term infiltrator was also applied to refugee non-residents who had not left Israel as in the case in [[Nazareth]]. On the 21 November 1949 the Arab member of the Knesset Mr. Amin Jarjura ([[Mapai]]) asked in the Knesset permission for the refugees (6,000) of Nazareth to be allowed to return to their surrounding villages; at the same time the IDF were conducting a sweep through the city of Nazareth rounding up non-residents who the [[Jerusalem Post|Palestine Post]] then termed infiltrators.<ref>[http://jic.tau.ac.il/Default/Skins/PalestineP/Client.asp?Enter=true&Skin=PalestineP&AppName=2&GZ=T&AW=1215689774750 Jerusalem Post]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 22 November 1949 p. 3 col 2 and col 4</ref>\n\n====Arab countries anti-infiltration policies====\nThe Israeli Government position was that the Arab countries were aiding and abetting the infiltrators in an extension of the Arab Israeli conflict by using the infiltrators as guerillas. This has been described as inaccurate by some historians.<ref name=\"AV2\"/>\n\nThe problem of establishing and guarding the demarcation line separating the [[Gaza Strip]] from the Israeli-held [[Negev]] area, proved a vexing one: largely due to the presence of more than 200,000 Palestinian Arab refugees in this Gaza area.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/> The terms of the Armistice Agreement restricted Egypt\u2019s use and deployment of regular armed forces in the Gaza strip. In keeping with this restriction the Egyptian Government\u2019s answer was to form a Palestinian para-military police force. The Palestinian Border police was created in December 1952. The Border police were placed under the command of [[\u2018Abd-al-Man\u2019imi \u2018Abd-al-Ra\u2019uf]], a former Egyptian air brigade commander, member of the Muslim Brotherhood and member of the Revolutionary Council. 250 Palestinian volunteers started training in March 1953 with further volunteers coming forward for training in May and December 1953. Part of the Border police personnel were attached to the Military Governor\u2019s office and placed under \u2018Abd-al-\u2018Azim al-Saharti to guard public installations in the Gaza strip.<ref>Yezid Sayigh (1999) Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement 1949-1993.

Initially, the mixed patrols along the Egyptian demarcation line worked satisfactorily.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/> The Egyptian Authorities maintained a policy of \"incarcerating\" the inhabitants of the Gaza strip until 1955.<ref name=\"AV2\">Avi Shlaim (2000) \"The Iron Wall; Israel and the Arab World\" Penguin Books {{ISBN|0-14-028870-8}} p 84</ref>\n\n====Free fire policy====\nA free fire policy was adopted by the IDF.

The early reprisal raids failed to achieve their objectives and managed to increase hatred for Israel amongst the Arab countries and the refugees.

This looting, United Nations Observers report, appeared to have been as systematic as army trucks were used for transportation. The situation, states the report, created a new influx of refugees into Lebanon. Israeli forces, he stated, have occupied the area in Galilee formerly occupied by Kaukji's forces, and have crossed the Lebanese frontier. Bunche goes on to say \"that Israeli forces now hold positions inside the south-east corner of Lebanon, involving some fifteen Lebanese villages which are occupied by small Israeli detachments\".<ref>[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/a1c20f7009def4fe85256a70006891fd UN Doc.

We therefore looked for means which did not force us into employing force, in order to cause the tens of thousands of sulky Arab who remained in the Galilee to flee, for in case of an Arab invasion they were likely to strike us in the rear.\n\nI gathered all the Jewish Mukhtars who had contact with Arabs in different villages, and asked to whisper in the ear of some Arabs that great Jewish reinforcements had arrived in Galilee and that it is going to burn all the villages of the Huleh.

The [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] was then redrawn in blue ink on the southern map to give the impression that a movement in the Green line had been made. However, this replacement involved a considerable change of the lines, a change which could not be carried out without inflicting serious hardships upon the population and the affected areas.

However, when the villagers returned to Wadi Fukin under the supervision of the United Nations observers on 6 September, they found most of their houses destroyed and were again compelled by the Israeli Army to return to Jordanian controlled territory. The United Nations Chairman of the Mixed Commission, Colonel Garrison B.

Israel had been condemned by the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation]] (UNTSO) in some instances but had taken no steps to allow the return of the Arabs. On 17 September 1952, the senior Jordan Military Delegate to the [[Mixed Armistice Commissions|Mixed Armistice Commission]], Major Itzaq, inform the MAC that the Israelis had expelled ten families of the es-Sani tribe and that they were now situated inside the Jordan border south of Hebron. On 22 September Commander Hutchison USNR of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission]] (HKJMAC) went into the area and counted over 100 families, nearly 1,000 members of the es-Sani tribe. Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim informed the MAC that the es-Sani had been forced off their cultivated lands southeast of Beersheba, at El Sharia, to El Laqiya, north-east of Beersheba. On the new area at El Laqiya, for the next three years the es-Sani had made it productive to the extent that Israel then declared a quantity of their grain as surplus crop and demanded that it be sold to the Israeli government at a fixed price. The Military Governor of Beersheba, Lt. Colonel Hermann, informed Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim that Israel was going to establish a settlement at El Laqiya and that his tribe would have to move to Tel Arad. Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim had then led the es-Sani over the Jordan/Israel ceasefire land rather that move to the inferior land around Tel Arad.\n\n<blockquote>The Sheikh's story of the court action was true. On 28 September 1952, under the heading, * 'Bedouin Tribe Moved/' the Israel press announced that \"Tribesmen of the Kiderat El Sana Teljaha tribe were last week moved from their former homes at El Laqiya, east of the Beersheba-Hebron road, to a new site at Tel Arad. ... On 15 September, the High Court in Jerusalem issued an order 'nisi* against the Military Governor and the Ministry of Defence against the enforced move of the tribe.\"</blockquote>\n\nAfter negotiations lasting days it was arranged for the es-Sani to return to Israel; although the Israelis wanted the es-Sani transported inside Jordan to a point opposite and closer to Tel Arad which the Jordanians refused to do this and it was finally settled that the transfer would be made at the original point of crossing, on the Hebron-Beersheba road.<ref>Violent Truce by E H Hutchison A Military Observer Looks at the Arab-Israeli Conflict 1951 1955</ref>\n\n==Encouraged Exodus==\nThe Jewish National Fund under Yosef Weitz actively encouraged Palestinian Arab emigration.<ref>Benny Morris (1993) p 176</ref> In the village of [[Ar'ara]] 2,500 dunums (625 acres) were purchased.

This was achieved by three processes. The transfer of [[Israeli Arabs]] away from the ceasefire lines to urban areas of concentration such as [[Jaffa]] and [[Haifa]]; the resettlement of the areas cleared, mainly by [[mizrahi]]m (oriental Jews) in [[moshavim]] along the ceasefire lines; and operating a free fire policy.<ref>Avi Shlaim \"The Iron Wall; Israel and the Arab World Penguin Books {{ISBN|0-14-028870-8}} p. 82</ref>\n\nOnce the fighting phase of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war had ceased with a truce, the Israeli bureaucracy was faced with the overwhelming task of ruling effectively over dozens of severely disrupted Israeli Arab villages and towns, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had taken refuge. Since the Israeli state did not trust its Israeli Arab citizens seeing them as a potential 5th Column, it placed this entire population under a tight military regime supervised by the Central Committee for Arab Affairs. Established in 1954, the committee had representatives from the police and the domestic intelligence agency, [[Shin Bet|Shabak]], as well as the prime minister\u2019s consultant for Arab affairs and the commander-in-chief of military rule. In concert, the committee presided over three regional sub-committees (south, center and north), which dealt with the daily business of governance.\n\nThe Registration of Residents ordinance of 1949 left those unregistered Palestinian Arabs without legal status and vulnerable to deportation. The abandoned Property law of 1950; where the moveable and immovable property belonging to the refugees was effectively appropriated by the state of Israel applied not just to Palestinian refugees who had left Israeli territory but also to Palestinian Arabs who had remained in Israel but who had left their ordinary place of residence. One quarter of the Arab citizens of Israel are \"internal refugees,\" who until 1948 resided in villages that were destroyed in the war.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/981354.html Ha\u2019aretz] World Likud chief calls for cancellation of Nakba Day procession By Yoav Stern, Haaretz Correspondent Monday, 19 May 2008</ref>\n\n====Infiltration====\nThe estimates for 1949 to 1956 was that 90% of all infiltration was motivated by social and economic concerns.<ref>Benny Morris, (1993). \"Israel's Border Wars, 1949-1956; Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation and the Countdown to the Suez War\"; Oxford Clarendon Press, {{ISBN|0-19-829262-7}} pp 49 & 412.</ref> It was naturally difficult to prevent [[Palestinian refugee|refugees]] who were living on a bare subsistence level, from crossing lines beyond which they hope to find fodder for their hungry sheep, or for scarce fuel. Additionally there occurred occasional nightly clandestine smuggling between Gaza and Hebron. The smuggling was largely motivated by the great discrepancy of prices prevailing in the two areas.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/> Most of these complaints in 1950 concerned the shooting by Israelis of refugee civilians and livestock, said to have illegally crossed the demarcation lines. In the most serious case of this kind, Egypt complained that Israeli military Forces, on the 7 and 14 October 1950, had shelled and machine-gunned the Arab villages of [[Abassan]] and [[Beit Hanoun]] in Egyptian controlled territory of the Gaza strip. This action caused the death of seven and the wounding of twenty civilians. Israel on the other hand complained of infiltration incidents which had resulted in the death of four Israeli settlers and the wounding of twenty others.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/>\n\nThe pejorative term infiltrator was also applied to refugee non-residents who had not left Israel as in the case in [[Nazareth]]. On the 21 November 1949 the Arab member of the Knesset Mr. Amin Jarjura ([[Mapai]]) asked in the Knesset permission for the refugees (6,000) of Nazareth to be allowed to return to their surrounding villages; at the same time the IDF were conducting a sweep through the city of Nazareth rounding up non-residents who the [[Jerusalem Post|Palestine Post]] then termed infiltrators.<ref>[http://jic.tau.ac.il/Default/Skins/PalestineP/Client.asp?Enter=true&Skin=PalestineP&AppName=2&GZ=T&AW=1215689774750 Jerusalem Post]{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 22 November 1949 p. 3 col 2 and col 4</ref>\n\n====Arab countries anti-infiltration policies====\nThe Israeli Government position was that the Arab countries were aiding and abetting the infiltrators in an extension of the Arab Israeli conflict by using the infiltrators as guerillas. This has been described as inaccurate by some historians.<ref name=\"AV2\"/>\n\nThe problem of establishing and guarding the demarcation line separating the [[Gaza Strip]] from the Israeli-held [[Negev]] area, proved a vexing one: largely due to the presence of more than 200,000 Palestinian Arab refugees in this Gaza area.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/> The terms of the Armistice Agreement restricted Egypt\u2019s use and deployment of regular armed forces in the Gaza strip. In keeping with this restriction the Egyptian Government\u2019s answer was to form a Palestinian para-military police force. The Palestinian Border police was created in December 1952. The Border police were placed under the command of [[\u2018Abd-al-Man\u2019imi \u2018Abd-al-Ra\u2019uf]], a former Egyptian air brigade commander, member of the Muslim Brotherhood and member of the Revolutionary Council. 250 Palestinian volunteers started training in March 1953 with further volunteers coming forward for training in May and December 1953. Part of the Border police personnel were attached to the Military Governor\u2019s office and placed under \u2018Abd-al-\u2018Azim al-Saharti to guard public installations in the Gaza strip.<ref>Yezid Sayigh (1999) Armed Struggle and the Search for State: The Palestinian National Movement 1949-1993.

This looting, United Nations Observers report, appeared to have been as systematic as army trucks were used for transportation. The situation, states the report, created a new influx of refugees into Lebanon. Israeli forces, he stated, have occupied the area in Galilee formerly occupied by Kaukji's forces, and have crossed the Lebanese frontier.

The [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] was then redrawn in blue ink on the southern map to give the impression that a movement in the Green line had been made. However, this replacement involved a considerable change of the lines, a change which could not be carried out without inflicting serious hardships upon the population and the affected areas. It was inevitable that thousands of people, in the course of this redrawing of demarcation lines, were cut off from the fields that were their livelihood, cut off from their only resources of water and from the meager pastures on which they used to graze their cattle.<ref name=\"S/1459\"/> It has been estimated that 15 villages were ceded to Israel and a further 15,000 Palestinian Arabs became refugees.<ref>Morris Birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited (2004) p 533. \"The Military Government ''informed the [permanent] inhabitants that they must not employ the refugees, [must] raise difficulties in housing them and refuse to accept their children into schools...The Government would regard it favourably it they [i.e. the inhabitants] pressured them to leave the area. the inhabitants took the hint and acted accordingly and within a fortnight close to 8,500 refugees left the area.''</ref><ref>The Politics of Partition; King Abdullah, The Zionists, and Palestine 1921-1951 Avi Shlaim Oxford University Press Revised Edition 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-829459-X}} pp. 299, 312</ref>\n\nDuring the Lausanne Peace Conference The US consul, William Burdett, reported on a meeting of the Jordan/Israel [[Mixed Armistice Commission|Armistice Commission]] which dealt with a case where 1,000 (UN estimates 1,500) Palestinian Arab inhabitants of [[Baqa al-Gharbiyye]] had been expelled and forced across the ceasefire line.<ref name=\"S/1459\" /><ref>1949 the First Israelis Tom Segev 1986 reprinted 1998 {{ISBN|0-8050-5896-6}} p 33.

The Mixed Armistice Commission decided on 31 August, by a majority vote, that Israel had violated the Armistice Agreement by expelling villagers of Wadi Fukin across the demarcation line and decided that the villagers should be allowed to return to their homes. However, when the villagers returned to Wadi Fukin under the supervision of the United Nations observers on 6 September, they found most of their houses destroyed and were again compelled by the Israeli Army to return to Jordanian controlled territory. The United Nations Chairman of the Mixed Commission, Colonel Garrison B. Coverdale (US), pressed for a solution of this issue to be found in the Mixed Armistice Commission, in an amicable and UN spirit. After some hesitation, an adjustment in the Green Line was accepted and finally an agreement was reached whereby the Armistice line was changed to give back Wadi Fukin to the Jordanian authority who, in turn, agreed to transfer some uninhabited, but fertile territory south of Bethlehem to the Israeli authority.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/7b5942522358001885256a76006377eb |title=Press Release PAL/537 4 November 1949 |access-date=2017-06-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522222215/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/7b5942522358001885256a76006377eb |archive-date=2014-05-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Northern District===\nIsraeli forces attacked Jalbun village, with small arms, on the 5 December 1949, they then expelled the inhabitants from their village causing fatal casualties amongst the villagers.

Israel had been condemned by the [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation]] (UNTSO) in some instances but had taken no steps to allow the return of the Arabs. On 17 September 1952, the senior Jordan Military Delegate to the [[Mixed Armistice Commissions|Mixed Armistice Commission]], Major Itzaq, inform the MAC that the Israelis had expelled ten families of the es-Sani tribe and that they were now situated inside the Jordan border south of Hebron. On 22 September Commander Hutchison USNR of the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission]] (HKJMAC) went into the area and counted over 100 families, nearly 1,000 members of the es-Sani tribe. Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim informed the MAC that the es-Sani had been forced off their cultivated lands southeast of Beersheba, at El Sharia, to El Laqiya, north-east of Beersheba. On the new area at El Laqiya, for the next three years the es-Sani had made it productive to the extent that Israel then declared a quantity of their grain as surplus crop and demanded that it be sold to the Israeli government at a fixed price. The Military Governor of Beersheba, Lt. Colonel Hermann, informed Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim that Israel was going to establish a settlement at El Laqiya and that his tribe would have to move to Tel Arad. Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim had then led the es-Sani over the Jordan/Israel ceasefire land rather that move to the inferior land around Tel Arad.\n\n<blockquote>The Sheikh's story of the court action was true.
