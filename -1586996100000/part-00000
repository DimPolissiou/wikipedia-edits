{"title_page": "Media of Serbia", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}\n\n{{Culture of Serbia}}\n\nThe '''media of Serbia''' refers to mass media outlets based in [[Serbia]]. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Serbia]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]].\n\nSerbia's media system is under transformation, which is yet \"slow, incoherent and incomplete\". According to the [[European Journalism Centre]], \"democratisation of the media system has failed to become a factor in the democratisation of society as a whole, which was a widespread hope in 2000 based on the achievements of the decade-long struggle against media repression in the Milosevic regime.\"<ref name=EJC>{{Cite web|first1=Jovanka|last1=Matic|first2=Larisa|last2=Rankovic|url=https://medialandscapes.org/country/serbia|title=Serbia|website=EJC Media Landscapes|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref> Serbia ranks 59th out of 180 countries in the 2016 [[Press Freedom Index]] report compiled by [[Reporters without borders]].\n\n==History==\nThe 1990s saw the end of [[state monopoly]] over the media. Throughout the decade, media remained divided between state-controlled and independent ones. Media autonomy and the survival of independent media remained a major bone of contention during the rule of [[Slobodan Milosevic]]. During this time, the media was a tool against domestic and international enemies. Civil society and international donors stood behind the creation of independent media. According to the Association for Private Broadcasting Development, in the year 2000 Serbia hosted 480 radio and TV stations, of which 300 were privately owned and the rest were local, public media.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe control over the media was reached through different strategies. On the one hand, the legal framework on the media system was purposefully left chaotic, while the state maintained the monopoly over the distribution of frequencies and production of newsprints, printing facilities, and distribution networks. Moreover, non-aligned journalists, media outlets and media advertisers were harassed, jammed and/or forcefully closed down \u2013 particularly if perceived as dangerous to the government, such as elections, the 1996\u201397 mass demonstrations, and the 1998\u201399 war in Kosovo.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nAfter the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], most state media changed overnight and supported the new ruling coalition, [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia|DOS]]. The political changes made way for the reconstruction of the media sector. Yet, post-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 governments were unable to bring the transition to completion. A [[media policy]] was neglected for the whole decade 2001-2010, not to risk electoral support by unsettling the status quo.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe media sector was thus reformed slowly and incoherently, after a long delay. In 2010, Serbia had 523 print media, 201 radio stations, 103 TV stations and 66 online media. Almost 2.2&nbsp;million Serbian citizens regularly read print media every day and listen to radio for on average almost three hours a day. Yet, media sustainability remains at risk due to small advertisement revenues. New challenges include increasing concentration of the advertisement sector, opening up to the risk of pressures from economic groups linked to political parties, as well as the dire general economic conditions in the wake of the global economic crisis.<ref name=EJC/> The South East European Media Observatory estimated that 25-40% of media advertising revenue in 2014 came from the state; such public spending is not regulated.<ref name=FH/>\n\n==Legislative framework==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\nSerbia is part of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and of the UN [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], both imposing obligations to protect freedom of expression and information.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Serbia]] guarantees [[freedom of expression]] (including [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]], [[:s:Constitution of Serbia#Freedom of thought and expression|art. 46]]) and allows for its restriction only \"to protect the rights and reputation of others, to uphold the authority and objectivity of the courts and to protect public health, morals of a democratic society and national security of the Republic of Serbia\" \u2013 as in compliance with the standards set by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].\n\nIt is a constitutional right, in Serbia, to freely establish media without prior authorization ([[:s:Constitution of Serbia#Freedom of the media|art. 50]]).

Media are increasingly reliant on state subsidies, which are allocated opaquely, particularly in case of irregular or one-off grants, thus reinforcing the avenues for political pressures. The advertising market is also occupied by state-owned companies<ref name=EP/>\n\n===Status and self-regulation of journalists===\nThe category of journalist is not a registered or licensed profession in Serbia, with formal criteria and procedures.<ref name=Matic2012/> There is no legal definition {{clarify|date=March 2016}} of \"journalist\" (\"novinar\") and its usage is intended in a broad sense.

Most journalists have irregular income and no health insurance; their average pay is half of the national average salary, and seven times lower than public officials' salaries. Unfavourable working conditions lead to work overload, low quality productions, and a lack of attractiveness of the profession for the talented youth.<ref name=EP/>\n\nJournalists' organisations remain unable to provide efficient protection and secure professional dignity; journalists are poorly paid and have a very low public reputation. The context of business and political pressures, coupled with the lack of legal protection and the difficult working conditions make so that the general perception of the category by the broad public is of politicised and corrupt \"dictaphone holders\".<ref name=Matic2014>Matic, Jovanka (2014), [http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/flash-report-3-serbia Flash Report 3: Serbia].

''Politika'' was launched in 1904 and it still exists as the first modern, civic-oriented daily; it is the oldest daily newspaper in the Balkans. Politika introduced fact-based reporting, editorials, sport sections, and female journalists, hence contributing to the modernization and Europeanization of journalistic standards in Serbia.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nDuring the socialist period, the press in Yugoslavia worked as a propaganda tool of the ruling Communist Party. The media landscape was dominated by the Communist Party daily, [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]. Politika remained as house organ of the People's Front, a wide union of anti-fascist and socialist forces. The 1960s, with the introduction of [[workers' self-management]], saw the start of the liberation of Serbian media from the total dominance of the Party.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the print media were split among supporters and opposers. The circulation and influence of alternative press media rose throughout the 1990s, and were deemed an avant-garde of democratisation. Politika and Borba switched roles: after decades of keeping distance from the Socialist leadership, Politika became completely aligned with the government, while Borba became a free and critically oriented newspaper.<ref>Matic, Jovanka (2004).

Many news outlets were privatized, some of them also in hands of foreign investors, including ''[[Politika]]'' and ''[[Blic]]''. The lack of transparency over ownership of media groups remains an issue, especially for short-lived political tabloids, which are often used for political campaigns. Tabloids in Serbia are deemed \"characterised by conservativism, nationalistic ideology, hate speech, and disregard of professional and ethical norms\",<ref name=EJC/> possibly linked to secret services or political and business interests. The quality press, often the leading independent papers back in the 1990s, suffer today from limited readership and financial difficulties after the withdrawal of external donors. They do not manage to expand the themes covered, and their journalists specialise mostly on political issues rather than in wider topics, from economics to environment, that may attract new readers interested in quality columns.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nCurrently, there are 340 [[newspapers]] published in Serbia.<ref name=\"pod2.stat.gov.rs\">[http://pod2.stat.gov.rs/ObjavljenePublikacije/G2012/pdf/G20122007.pdf STATISTICAL YEARBOOK OF THE REPUBLIC OF SERBIA 2012]</ref> Some 12 daily newspapers are published in the country out of which 10 are nationwide dailies.

The earlier local radio stations appeared after World War Two \u2013 the first one in [[Zaje\u010dar]] in 1944 \u2013 and started growing since the 1960s. They were funded by local governments and set up with the expertise of Radio Beograd, as part of the media instruments of local governments, together with local newspapers and later TV stations.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nCommercial radio stations were established only in the 1990s. A precursors was [[RTV Studio B|Studio B]], set up in 1970 by the journalists of [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] (back then the Communist Party's newspaper), based on the model of western radio stations, with a lot of music and some short local news programmes focusing on everyday life's issues and how to solve them \u2013 as opposed to the much more establishment-style (top-down and politics-focused) of Radio Belgrade. Its style found a country-wide success.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe 1990s saw the explosion of free radios: between 500 and 700 operated throughout the country at that time, most of them without licenses. The biggest radios (including Radio Belgrade) remained under government control. Private stations worked as alternative sources of news. [[Radio B92]] gained a special prominence in this period: starting as an experimental youth initiative in Belgrade in 1989, it conquered its audience with irony and mockery, developing from an underground project to the most prominent alternative media, promoting liberal and humanistic spirit and antiwar and anti-nationalist orientation. The government closed it down four times, but every time it gathered even stronger support. B92 also spurred the growth of a network of independent radios (ANEM), re-broadcasting B92 news programmes together with locally produced contents. The role of B92 in fostering free media won it the [[MTV Free Your Mind]] award in 1998, together with many other awards.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe 2002 Broadcasting Law ended the 1990s legislative chaos in the radio field. Frequences and licenses' allocations were completed only five years later. Altogether, 277 licences were issued: 3 channels for the public service provider [[Radio Belgrade]], and 5 nationwide private stations ([[Radio B92]] - later renamed Play Radio, Radio S which recently became Radio S1, Radio Index - recently renamed Radio S2, Roadstar Radio which became Radio Hit FM, and Radio Fokus which is now defunct); 37 regional radios, and 235 local ones. Yet, regulation did not solve all problems of the radio sector. The market remains overcrowded, with many small outlets competing for an equally small advertising market. Only 4% of the advertisement expenses were devoted to radio ads in 2009 (TV got 59%). The press received six times more advertisement expenses.\n\nThere are currently 220 radio stations in Serbia<ref name=\"pod2.stat.gov.rs\"/>. Out of these, seven are radio stations with national coverage, including three of public broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia]] ('''''[[Radio Belgrade|Radio Belgrade 1]]''''', '''''[[Radio Belgrade|Radio Belgrade 2/Radio Belgrade 3]]''''' and '''''Radio Belgrade 202'''''), and four private ones ('''''Radio S1''''', '''''Radio S2''''', '''''Play Radio''''', and '''''Radio Hit FM''''').

The RTS headquarters were bombed during the NATO action against Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The system developed from a public monopoly, with regional centres ([[TV Novi Sad]], [[TV Pristina]]) into a dual, public and private system.

Traditional media have taken up online position too, following the lead of [[B92]] and its concept of ''super desk'', editing stories for radio, TV and website alike.

No organisation advocates for the rights of freelance journalists.<ref name=FH/>\n\nUNS was founded in Belgrade in 1881, and in Socialist times defended the autonomy of the media within the limis of the self-government ideology of the Yugoslav Communist Party. During Milosevic' rule, journalists split between those interested in the protection of the \"national interest\", seeing the media as a state tool, and those interested in the protection of the profession, focusing on the development of a pluralist society and the need for impartiality and balance in the journalistic profession, thus trying to resist to political pressures. UNS leaders promoted the defense of \"Serbian interests\" and \"patriotic journalism\". Many members of the association left it and founded NUNS in 1994. UNS disassociated itself from its previous behaviour after Milosevic's fall: in 2001 it excluded eight former leading journalists. Yet, its collaboration with the previous government remains a bone of contention with NUNS, that pushes for a ban over all journalists associated with the former administration's promotion of war, hate speech, ethnic and political discrimination. In 2009 NUNS launched criminal charges against those journalist who had been working in RTV Belgrade, ''RTV Novi Sad'' and dailies ''Vecernje Novosti'' and ''Politika'' in the 1990s, while UNS defended them as persons who \"just did their job\" and remains opposed to the re-examination of media behaviour in the 1990s.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nIn 2000 UNS declared 1,514 members, NUNS declared 1,410 members, while around 3,000 journalists remained unassociated. Today, UNS remains the main journalists' association in Serbia, with about 6,000 members, against NUNS' 2,400. Both associations are members of the [[International Federation of Journalists]], and strive for the protection of the legal and social aspects of journalism, the promotion of free journalism and media pluralism, and the development of professional norms and ethical standards.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nSerbia does not have a tradition of journalists' trade unions and media business organisations, as associations have been dealing with social protection in the past. Journalists in Serbia remain underpaid and under-employed, often withour a regular contract and below minimal wages. Journalists working in local media at risk of bankruptcy are particularly exposed, since they are left without social protection.<ref name=EJC/>\n* In 2003, UNS established the [[Journalists Union of Serbia]], with around 800 members, to draft a national collective agreement and help journalists bargain with media owners.\n* The Association of Independent Electronic Media (''Asocijacija nezavisnih elektronskih medija'' \u2013 ANEM), is a business organisation of 28 radio stations and 16 television companies (national and local, big and small), plus other organisations, launched in 1993 to strengthen the independence of media non-affiliated with the government. It strives for the establishment of a politically independent legal framework, for an economically viable environment for the development of electronic media, and for the improvement of professional and technical standards in the media sphere. ANEM provides lobbying for the media laws, education of media staff, legal help, and technical support for its members.\n* The Association of Local Independent Media (\"Local Press\") is the media organisation of the local print media, established in 1995 and with 25 members. \n* Media Association (''Asocijacija medija'') gathers some big publishers, including Vecernje Novosti, Ringier Serbia, Color Press Group, Politika newspaper and magazines, Press Publishing Group, Adria Media Serbia, Dnevnik-Vojvodinapress, Ekonomist, Vreme and VojvodinaInfo. It aims at improving professional standards in journalism (such as the Press Council) and securing the independence of its members from political and economic pressures.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n===Regulatory authorities===\nThe regulation of the media sphere is a task for several agencies. The Republic Broadcasting Agency (RRA) was established in 2005, followed by the Republic Telecommunication Agency (RATEL), in charge of the [[Telecommunications in Serbia|telecommunications field]]. The print media is not regulated, but since 2010 the Press Council works as a self-regulatory body to ensure the implementation of the journalists' Ethical Code. New media are not regulated.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n====Republic Broadcasting Agency====\nThe RRA is defined as an \"autonomous legal entity\", \"functionally independent of any state organ, as well as of any organisation or person involved in the production and broadcasting of radio and TV programmes\".<ref name=Matic2012>Mati\u0107, Jovanka(2012), ''Serbian Media Scene vs European Standards. Report Based on Council of Europe's Indicators for Media in a Democracy''. ANEM/NUNS/LocalPress/NDNV/CivilRightsDefenders, Stockholm</ref>\n\nThe RRA has taken over wide competencies formerly tasked to state bodies, including issuing broadcasting licences (which is legally conditioned to the lack of owners' affiliations to political parties<ref name=EP/> and setting the rules during electoral campaigns or mourning periods. It also monitors the compliance of Serbian media with the Broadcasting Law, and decides on complaints. It oversees the transformation of RTS in a public service broadcaster and appoints the managing board of RTS, which chooses its directors.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe independence of the RRA is formally guaranteed by a couple of mechanisms:<ref name=Matic2012/>\n* First, its Board members are elected by the Parliament, based on nominations coming from civil society organisations (the Culture and Media Committee of the National Assembly, the Assembly of the Province of [[Vojvodina]], academia, NGOs and the professional media community). Candidates cannot be state or party officials, nor have vested interest in programming production or broadcasting.<ref name=Matic2012/>\n* Second, the RRA has its own sources of revenues in the broadcasting license fees.\n\nYet, the independence, accountability and impartiality of the RRA, as well as its capacities, remains in doubt.<ref name=Marko2013>Marko, Davor (2013), [http://analitika.ba/en/publications/media-reforms-turbulent-times-role-media-assistance-establishmentindependent-media Media Reforms in Turbulent Times: The Role of Media Assistance in the Establishment of Independent Media Institutions in Serbia]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Analitika Centre for Social Research.</ref> Selection and nomination rules are open to multiple interpretations and give way to arbitrariness and possible political pressures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\nAccording to the [[European Journalism Centre]], the RRA lacks human and financial resources to perform its tasks. It does not manage to monitor the broadcasters nor to publish its results. While broadcasters have admittedly violated advertisement regulators, the RRA pressed charges against them only in 2010. The Agency is deemed not transparent enough, and recurrent squabbles over the nomination of its board have reduced its credibility in the eyes of the public.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe establishment of independent regulatory bodies in Serbia went through several issues. The appointment of the first RRA Council created a two-years long political crisis for the breach of rules for their nomination. The delay meant that the Broadcasting Law was implemented slowly too, including the tendering for and issuing of 467 broadcasting licences, the privatisation of broadcasting media and transformation of the national and Vojvodina province state broadcasters into a public service. The RRA remained crippled by the original credibility crisis and the two-years long process of frequency allocation gave rise to doubts about its independence. Subsequent amendments to the Broadcasting Law opened up new avenues for possible political pressures over the RRA, e.g. when nominees of the Parliament and government got a longer term mandate than the nominees of professional and civil society organisations.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nAccording to journalists, the RRA charges excessive and arbitrary license fees to broadcasters. Print and online media are exempt from license requirements.<ref name=FH/>\n\n====Republic Telecommunications Agency====\nThe Republic Telecommunications Agency (RATEL) was foreseen by the 2003 Telecommunications Law and started operating in 2005. It defines the conditions for radio frequency spectrum usage, the Radio Frequency Allocation Plan, allocates radio and TV frequencies, and monitors their usage.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n====Press Council====\nThe Press Council is a self-regulatory body for the print media. It was established at the beginning of 2010, after years of planning and debating its structure, decision-making, sources of finance. It includes representatives of press publishers, professional journalistic organisations, and it aims to monitor the respect of the 2006 Ethical Code and deal with complaints by individuals and institutions.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Media freedom in Serbia]]\n* [[Censorship in Serbia]]\n* [[Television in Serbia]]\n* [[List of newspapers in Serbia]]\n* [[Serbian culture#Serbian media]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|author=Miroslav Savi\u0107evi\u0107 |year=1995|work=The history of Serbian Culture|title=Television|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/msavicevic-television.html|publisher=Rastko}}\n*{{cite web|author=Mihailo Bjelica|year=1995|work=The history of Serbian Culture|title=Journalism and publicist writing|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/mbjelica-journalism.html|publisher=Rastko}}\n\n{{Serbia topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Europe topic|Media of}}\n\n[[Category:Media in Serbia| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2015}}\n\n{{Culture of Serbia}}\n\nThe '''media of Serbia''' refers to mass media outlets based in [[Serbia]]. Television, magazines, and newspapers are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, [[subscription]], and other sales-related revenues. The [[Constitution of Serbia]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]].\n\nSerbia's media system is under transformation, which is yet \"slow, incoherent and incomplete\". According to the [[European Journalism Centre]], \"democratisation of the media system has failed to become a factor in the democratisation of society as a whole, which was a widespread hope in 2000 based on the achievements of the decade-long struggle against media repression in the Milosevic regime.\"<ref name=EJC>{{Cite web|first1=Jovanka|last1=Matic|first2=Larisa|last2=Rankovic|url=https://medialandscapes.org/country/serbia|title=Serbia|website=EJC Media Landscapes|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref> Serbia ranks 59th out of 180 countries in the 2016 [[Press Freedom Index]] report compiled by [[Reporters without borders]].\n\n==History==\nThe 1990s saw the end of [[state monopoly]] over the media. Throughout the decade, media remained divided between state-controlled and independent ones. Media autonomy and the survival of independent media remained a major bone of contention during the rule of [[Slobodan Milosevic]]. During this time, the media was a tool against domestic and international enemies. Civil society and international donors stood behind the creation of independent media. According to the Association for Private Broadcasting Development, in the year 2000 Serbia hosted 480 radio and TV stations, of which 300 were privately owned and the rest were local, public media.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe control over the media was reached through different strategies. On the one hand, the legal framework on the media system was purposefully left chaotic, while the state maintained the monopoly over the distribution of frequencies and production of newsprints, printing facilities, and distribution networks. Moreover, non-aligned journalists, media outlets and media advertisers were harassed, jammed and/or forcefully closed down \u2013 particularly if perceived as dangerous to the government, such as elections, the 1996\u201397 mass demonstrations, and the 1998\u201399 war in Kosovo.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nAfter the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], most state media changed overnight and supported the new ruling coalition, [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia|DOS]]. The political changes made way for the reconstruction of the media sector. Yet, post-Milo\u0161evi\u0107 governments were unable to bring the transition to completion. A [[media policy]] was neglected for the whole decade 2001-2010, not to risk electoral support by unsettling the status quo.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe media sector was thus reformed slowly and incoherently, after a long delay. In 2010, Serbia had 523 print media, 201 radio stations, 103 TV stations and 66 online media. Almost 2.2&nbsp;million Serbian citizens regularly read print media every day and listen to radio for on average almost three hours a day. Yet, media sustainability remains at risk due to small advertisement revenues. New challenges include increasing concentration of the advertisement sector, opening up to the risk of pressures from economic groups linked to political parties, as well as the dire general economic conditions in the wake of the global economic crisis.<ref name=EJC/> The South East European Media Observatory estimated that 25-40% of media advertising revenue in 2014 came from the state; such public spending is not regulated.<ref name=FH/>\n\n==Legislative framework==\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}\nSerbia is part of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and of the UN [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], both imposing obligations to protect freedom of expression and information.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Serbia]] guarantees [[freedom of expression]] (including [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]], [[:s:Constitution of Serbia#Freedom of thought and expression|art. 46]]) and allows for its restriction only \"to protect the rights and reputation of others, to uphold the authority and objectivity of the courts and to protect public health, morals of a democratic society and national security of the Republic of Serbia\" \u2013 as in compliance with the standards set by the [[European Convention on Human Rights]].\n\nIt is a constitutional right, in Serbia, to freely establish media without prior authorization ([[:s:Constitution of Serbia#Freedom of the media|art. 50]]). Licenses, required for TV and radio stations, are granted by an independent body, the Republic Broadcasting Agency (RBA). Censorship is prohibited by the Constitution.<ref name=EP>Elda Brogi, Alina Dobreva, and Pier Luigi Parcu, \"[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2014/534982/EXPO_STU(2014)534982_EN.pdf Freedom of Media in the Western Balkans]\", study for the [[European Parliament]]'s Subcommittee on Human Rights, October 2014, EXPO/B/DROI/2013/16</ref>\n\nThe legislative framework on the media in Serbia includes a Law on Public Information, a Law on Broadcasting, a Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance and a Law on Elections of the Members of the Parliament (regulating electoral coverage).<ref name=\"EP\"/> The Public Information Law explicitly protects journalistic secrecy, and the Criminal Code excludes journalists from the obligation to disclose their sources to the courts, unless for grave crimes (punishable by more than 5 years sentences, art.41)<ref name=EP/> Despite the 2004 Law on Free Access to Information of Public Importance, media efforts are often obstructed by authorities.<ref name=FH/>\n\nThe Broadcasting Law foresees a specific media concentration regime, restricting the ownership of two or more terrestrial TV or radio stations within the same or overlapping area, as well as the cross-ownership of TVs, radios, daily newspapers and news agencies.

The laws also establishes a media register for the disclosure of media ownership structures, and the preparation for digitalisation of television by 2015. Their implementation remains to be checked.<ref name=FH>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/serbia 2015 report on press freedom in Serbia]</ref><ref>Dragan Janji\u0107, [http://www.balcanicaucaso.org/eng/Regions-and-countries/Serbia/The-privatization-of-the-Serbian-media-154966 \"The privatization of the Serbian media\"], ''[[Osservatorio Balcani e Caucaso]]'', 13 August 2014.</ref>\n\nThe government is committed to the completion of the [[privatisation]] strategy for media outlets, but in the past several privatisations have failed, while others have given rise to doubts about lack of transparency, state interference, pressures and deals to keep them under hidden state control.<ref name=BHRN/> Foreign investors are allowed to own up to 49% of the capital of broadcast license holders, but their actual influence on the editorial line is hard to determine.<ref name=EP/>\n\nThe Serbian media market remains underdeveloped and saturated. The global economic crisis, with the shrinking of the advertising market, has hindered the financial viability of several media (between 2010 and 2014, the RRA agency has revoked more than 90 licenses, particularly from regional and local media, for lack of payment of license fees), with an overall decrease in the quality of contents as well as in the number of media outlets, and an increase in the risks of business and political pressures. Media are increasingly reliant on state subsidies, which are allocated opaquely, particularly in case of irregular or one-off grants, thus reinforcing the avenues for political pressures. The advertising market is also occupied by state-owned companies<ref name=EP/>\n\n===Status and self-regulation of journalists===\nThe category of journalist is not a registered or licensed profession in Serbia, with formal criteria and procedures.<ref name=Matic2012/> There is no legal definition {{clarify|date=March 2016}} of \"journalist\" (\"novinar\") and its usage is intended in a broad sense. The Journalists' Association recorded in early 2016 around 6,000 journalists in Serbia.<ref name=beta>[http://beta.rs/vesti/drustvo-vesti-srbija/23986-novinarstvo-bi-napustila-skoro-polovina-novinara Novinarstvo bi napustila skoro polovina novinara], beta.rs; accessed 11 March 2016.</ref>\n\nJournalists in Serbia have a low social status and low social protection. Most journalists have irregular income and no health insurance; their average pay is half of the national average salary, and seven times lower than public officials' salaries. Unfavourable working conditions lead to work overload, low quality productions, and a lack of attractiveness of the profession for the talented youth.<ref name=EP/>\n\nJournalists' organisations remain unable to provide efficient protection and secure professional dignity; journalists are poorly paid and have a very low public reputation. The context of business and political pressures, coupled with the lack of legal protection and the difficult working conditions make so that the general perception of the category by the broad public is of politicised and corrupt \"dictaphone holders\".<ref name=Matic2014>Matic, Jovanka (2014), [http://mediaobservatory.net/radar/flash-report-3-serbia Flash Report 3: Serbia].

Both agreed to a common Ethical Code of Serbian Journalists (''Eticki kodeks novinara Srbije'') in 2006. ANEM also adopted an Ethical Code for Broadcasters in 2002, placing truthful reporting at the top.<ref name=EJC/> Yet, several violations of the Codes have been reported, particularly by daily political tabloid papers, concerning the [[presumption of innocence]], protection of privacy, and protection of minors.<ref name=BHRN/> Since 2010, its respect is monitored by the Press Council, a self-regulatory body for the print media.<ref name=EP/> The council can only publish public statements, as sanctions.<ref name=Matic2012/>\n\nA 2015 survey among journalists reported about the casualisation and precariousness of work relations in the profession, but also testified to the persistent professional integrity of Serbian journalists. 75% of Serbian journalists said they believe that [[self-censorship]] is widespread, and 80% believe that the state controls the media.

''Politika'' was launched in 1904 and it still exists as the first modern, civic-oriented daily; it is the oldest daily newspaper in the Balkans. Politika introduced fact-based reporting, editorials, sport sections, and female journalists, hence contributing to the modernization and Europeanization of journalistic standards in Serbia.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nDuring the socialist period, the press in Yugoslavia worked as a propaganda tool of the ruling Communist Party. The media landscape was dominated by the Communist Party daily, [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]]. Politika remained as house organ of the People's Front, a wide union of anti-fascist and socialist forces. The 1960s, with the introduction of [[workers' self-management]], saw the start of the liberation of Serbian media from the total dominance of the Party.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the print media were split among supporters and opposers. The circulation and influence of alternative press media rose throughout the 1990s, and were deemed an avant-garde of democratisation.

Tabloids in Serbia are deemed \"characterised by conservativism, nationalistic ideology, hate speech, and disregard of professional and ethical norms\",<ref name=EJC/> possibly linked to secret services or political and business interests. The quality press, often the leading independent papers back in the 1990s, suffer today from limited readership and financial difficulties after the withdrawal of external donors.

The earlier local radio stations appeared after World War Two \u2013 the first one in [[Zaje\u010dar]] in 1944 \u2013 and started growing since the 1960s. They were funded by local governments and set up with the expertise of Radio Beograd, as part of the media instruments of local governments, together with local newspapers and later TV stations.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nCommercial radio stations were established only in the 1990s. A precursors was [[RTV Studio B|Studio B]], set up in 1970 by the journalists of [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] (back then the Communist Party's newspaper), based on the model of western radio stations, with a lot of music and some short local news programmes focusing on everyday life's issues and how to solve them \u2013 as opposed to the much more establishment-style (top-down and politics-focused) of Radio Belgrade. Its style found a country-wide success.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe 1990s saw the explosion of free radios: between 500 and 700 operated throughout the country at that time, most of them without licenses. The biggest radios (including Radio Belgrade) remained under government control. Private stations worked as alternative sources of news. [[Radio B92]] gained a special prominence in this period: starting as an experimental youth initiative in Belgrade in 1989, it conquered its audience with irony and mockery, developing from an underground project to the most prominent alternative media, promoting liberal and humanistic spirit and antiwar and anti-nationalist orientation. The government closed it down four times, but every time it gathered even stronger support. B92 also spurred the growth of a network of independent radios (ANEM), re-broadcasting B92 news programmes together with locally produced contents. The role of B92 in fostering free media won it the [[MTV Free Your Mind]] award in 1998, together with many other awards.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe 2002 Broadcasting Law ended the 1990s legislative chaos in the radio field. Frequences and licenses' allocations were completed only five years later. Altogether, 277 licences were issued: 3 channels for the public service provider [[Radio Belgrade]], and 5 nationwide private stations ([[Radio B92]] - later renamed Play Radio, Radio S which recently became Radio S1, Radio Index - recently renamed Radio S2, Roadstar Radio which became Radio Hit FM, and Radio Fokus which is now defunct); 37 regional radios, and 235 local ones. Yet, regulation did not solve all problems of the radio sector. The market remains overcrowded, with many small outlets competing for an equally small advertising market. Only 4% of the advertisement expenses were devoted to radio ads in 2009 (TV got 59%). The press received six times more advertisement expenses.\n\nThere are currently 220 radio stations in Serbia<ref name=\"pod2.stat.gov.rs\"/>. Out of these, seven are radio stations with national coverage, including three of public broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia]] ('''''[[Radio Belgrade|Radio Belgrade 1]]''''', '''''[[Radio Belgrade|Radio Belgrade 2/Radio Belgrade 3]]''''' and '''''Radio Belgrade 202'''''), and four private ones ('''''Radio S1''''', '''''Radio S2''''', '''''Play Radio''''', and '''''Radio Hit FM'''''). Also, there are 49 regional stations and 162 local stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rra.org.rs/pages/browse_permits/cirilica/national|title=\u041d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u045a\u0435|author=nbgteam graphic and web design|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Television broadcasting===\n[[File:TV B92 zgrada.jpg|Old B92 headquarters in [[Novi Beograd]]|thumb]]\n{{Main article|Television in Serbia}}\nTelevision broadcasting started in 1958 with every country in the former Yugoslavia having its own station. In Serbia, the state television station was known as Television Belgrade (RTB) and became known as Radio Television of Serbia after the breakup of Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The second channel was launched in 1972 and the Third in 1989. Under the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communists]] and Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, state broadcasting was controlled by the ruling party. The RTS headquarters were bombed during the NATO action against Yugoslavia.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The system developed from a public monopoly, with regional centres ([[TV Novi Sad]], [[TV Pristina]]) into a dual, public and private system. The government, while suppressing the development of alternative statewide channels, allowed the broadcasts of regional and local commercial stations (who could profit from unlimited advertisement time to sell), as well as new pro-government local TV outlets.<ref name=EJC/> After the fall of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, RTS became known as Nova RTS as an assertion of independence while B92 commenced broadcasting.\n\nTelevision remains the most widespread and popular medium in Serbia. According to AGB Nielsen Research in 2009, Serbs on average watch five hours of television per day, making it the highest average in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danas.rs/vesti/drustvo/televizijske_serije_kao_obrok_.55.html?news_id=177701|title=Televizijske serije kao obrok, December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> Television is the main source of news and information for citizens (85%, against 11% for the press and 2% for radio and internet each), while the biggest share of audience goes to entertainment programmes.<ref name=EJC/> The financial sustainability of the whole sector remains in doubt, and broadcasters favour cheap and light programmes rather than high-quality in-house productions.\n\nThe TV market in Serbia used to be and still is to some extent saturated. In 2001 there were 253 TV stations and they are more than halved to 109 licenses nowadays. There are seven nationwide [[free-to-air]] television channels, with public broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia|Radio Television of Serbia (RTS)]] operating three ('''''[[RTS1]]''''', '''''[[RTS2]]''''' and '''''RTS3''''') and remaining four are private broadcasters: '''''[[Prva Srpska Televizija|Prva]]''''', '''''[[B92|O2.TV]]''''', '''''[[RTV Pink|Pink]]''''' and '''''[[Happy TV]]'''''. Viewing shares for these channels in 2016 were as follows: 19.2% for RTS1, 14.8% for Pink, 9.7% for Prva, 7.9% for Happy TV, 5.8% for B92, and 3.1% for RTS2.<ref>[http://rtvforum.net/thread-2142.html Godi\u0161nji udeli u gledanosti najzna\u010dajnijih kanala u poslednjih 10 godina ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820215623/http://rtvforum.net/thread-2142.html |date=20 August 2013 }}</ref> There are 28 regional channels and 74 local channels<ref name=\"pod2.stat.gov.rs\"/>. Besides terrestrial channels there are a dozen Serbian television channels available only on cable or satellite.\n\nSerbia completed the transition to [[digital broadcasting]] in 2015, having chosen MPEG-4 compression standard and DVB-T2 standard for signal transmission.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n=== News agencies ===\n\nThere are two national news agencies in Serbia: [[Beta News Agency|Beta]] and [[Fonet]]. Both are modern, multimedia news agencies, with print, audio, and video services, as well as cell-phone text news.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n* '''''[[Beta News Agency|Beta]]''''' was launched in 1994 by 12 journalists and has today more than 200 employees, providing services in Serbian, English, and minority languages (Hungarian, Albanian, Romani) on the event in the wider Southeast Europe region. Beta founded and manages two radio stations: [[Radio Beta-RFI]] in Belgrade, in cooperation with [[Radio France Internationale]], and Radio Sto Plus in [[Novi Pazar]]. It also runs the web portal ''Argus'' focused on the fight to corruption and organised crime. Its ownership is still in the hands of the founder journalists, who invested all profits in the development of the agency.<ref name=EJC/>\n* '''''Fonet''''' is the smaller of the two, with about 50 employees, and provides a special service on EU news (''Euroservice'').<ref name=EJC/>\n\n''[[Tanjug]]'' was former state-owned news agency, founded in 1945 which ceased its operation in 2015.<ref>http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2015&mm=11&dd=03&nav_category=12&nav_id=1058962</ref> derives from Tito's resistance's \"Telegraph Agency of the New Yugoslavia\", and achieved international prominence in the 1970s, covering West, East and non-aligned countries' events \u2013 taking part in the Non-Aligned News Agency Pool, and ranking among the top 10 largest news agencies in the world with 48 correspondents, 900 employees, and 400 news items per day. In the 1990s, it became the main tool for the government's position. Journalists left for either newly established state news agencies in other post-Yugoslav countries, or for new private agencies Fonet (February 1994) and [[Beta News Agency|Beta]] (May 1994), that allowed media pluralism to persist in 1990s Serbia. Its photo archives, with 3.5&nbsp;million negatives about the most important events in former Yugoslavia, Serbia and abroad, starting from World War II, remained the most important in the region and after the liquidation of the agency they were transferred to the [[Archives of Yugoslavia]].<ref>http://www.danas.rs/danasrs/drustvo/vucic_potpisao_gasenje_tanjuga_.55.html?news_id=310637</ref>\n\n===Online media===\n{{See also|Internet in Serbia}}\nThe total number of online publications in Serbia is not known. The Serbian Business Registers Agency counted 66 registered Internet media outlets in May 2010. [[Freedom House]] reports around 200 online news portals in 2014, and  54% of Serbian residents with internet access.<ref name=FH/>\n\nInternet media have long remained marginal in the Serbian media market. In 2009, the Nielsen survey reported that they accounted for only 1.6% of the total media revenue in the country. Traditional media have taken up online position too, following the lead of [[B92]] and its concept of ''super desk'', editing stories for radio, TV and website alike. B92's website was launched in 1995, and the internet represented a useful alternative for news circulation during periods of radio bans by the state.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the most visited websites in Serbian (mainly on the [[.rs]] domain) are the Serbian version of Google followed by online editions of printed daily [[Blic]], news web-portal of [[B92]] broadcaster, news portal of printed daily [[Kurir]] and classifieds [[Kupujemprodajem.com|KupujemProdajem]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries;1/RS|title=Alexa \u2013 Top Sites in Serbia|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nSerbia's internet domain shifted gradually from .yu (''Yugoslavia'') to .rs (''Republic of Serbia'') after 2008. The national authority on internet domains is the Serbian National Register of Internet Domain Names (''Registar nacionalnog internet domena Srbije'', RNIDS).<ref name=EJC/>\n\n====Online local media====\n{{Expand section|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Media Organisations ==\n\n=== Trade unions ===\nSerbia has two national professional jounalistic associations: the [[Journalist Association of Serbia]] (''Udruzenje novinara Srbije'' \u2013 UNS) and the [[Independent Journalist Association of Serbia]] (''Nezavisno udruzenje novinara Srbije'' \u2013 NUNS), often in conflict.<ref name=EJC/> NUNS has a regional affiliate in the Independent Journalists' Association of Vojvodina (NDNV). No organisation advocates for the rights of freelance journalists.<ref name=FH/>\n\nUNS was founded in Belgrade in 1881, and in Socialist times defended the autonomy of the media within the limis of the self-government ideology of the Yugoslav Communist Party. During Milosevic' rule, journalists split between those interested in the protection of the \"national interest\", seeing the media as a state tool, and those interested in the protection of the profession, focusing on the development of a pluralist society and the need for impartiality and balance in the journalistic profession, thus trying to resist to political pressures. UNS leaders promoted the defense of \"Serbian interests\" and \"patriotic journalism\". Many members of the association left it and founded NUNS in 1994. UNS disassociated itself from its previous behaviour after Milosevic's fall: in 2001 it excluded eight former leading journalists. Yet, its collaboration with the previous government remains a bone of contention with NUNS, that pushes for a ban over all journalists associated with the former administration's promotion of war, hate speech, ethnic and political discrimination. In 2009 NUNS launched criminal charges against those journalist who had been working in RTV Belgrade, ''RTV Novi Sad'' and dailies ''Vecernje Novosti'' and ''Politika'' in the 1990s, while UNS defended them as persons who \"just did their job\" and remains opposed to the re-examination of media behaviour in the 1990s.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nIn 2000 UNS declared 1,514 members, NUNS declared 1,410 members, while around 3,000 journalists remained unassociated. Today, UNS remains the main journalists' association in Serbia, with about 6,000 members, against NUNS' 2,400. Both associations are members of the [[International Federation of Journalists]], and strive for the protection of the legal and social aspects of journalism, the promotion of free journalism and media pluralism, and the development of professional norms and ethical standards.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nSerbia does not have a tradition of journalists' trade unions and media business organisations, as associations have been dealing with social protection in the past. Journalists in Serbia remain underpaid and under-employed, often withour a regular contract and below minimal wages. Journalists working in local media at risk of bankruptcy are particularly exposed, since they are left without social protection.<ref name=EJC/>\n* In 2003, UNS established the [[Journalists Union of Serbia]], with around 800 members, to draft a national collective agreement and help journalists bargain with media owners.\n* The Association of Independent Electronic Media (''Asocijacija nezavisnih elektronskih medija'' \u2013 ANEM), is a business organisation of 28 radio stations and 16 television companies (national and local, big and small), plus other organisations, launched in 1993 to strengthen the independence of media non-affiliated with the government. It strives for the establishment of a politically independent legal framework, for an economically viable environment for the development of electronic media, and for the improvement of professional and technical standards in the media sphere. ANEM provides lobbying for the media laws, education of media staff, legal help, and technical support for its members.\n* The Association of Local Independent Media (\"Local Press\") is the media organisation of the local print media, established in 1995 and with 25 members. \n* Media Association (''Asocijacija medija'') gathers some big publishers, including Vecernje Novosti, Ringier Serbia, Color Press Group, Politika newspaper and magazines, Press Publishing Group, Adria Media Serbia, Dnevnik-Vojvodinapress, Ekonomist, Vreme and VojvodinaInfo. It aims at improving professional standards in journalism (such as the Press Council) and securing the independence of its members from political and economic pressures.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n===Regulatory authorities===\nThe regulation of the media sphere is a task for several agencies. The Republic Broadcasting Agency (RRA) was established in 2005, followed by the Republic Telecommunication Agency (RATEL), in charge of the [[Telecommunications in Serbia|telecommunications field]]. The print media is not regulated, but since 2010 the Press Council works as a self-regulatory body to ensure the implementation of the journalists' Ethical Code. New media are not regulated.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n====Republic Broadcasting Agency====\nThe RRA is defined as an \"autonomous legal entity\", \"functionally independent of any state organ, as well as of any organisation or person involved in the production and broadcasting of radio and TV programmes\".<ref name=Matic2012>Mati\u0107, Jovanka(2012), ''Serbian Media Scene vs European Standards. Report Based on Council of Europe's Indicators for Media in a Democracy''. ANEM/NUNS/LocalPress/NDNV/CivilRightsDefenders, Stockholm</ref>\n\nThe RRA has taken over wide competencies formerly tasked to state bodies, including issuing broadcasting licences (which is legally conditioned to the lack of owners' affiliations to political parties<ref name=EP/> and setting the rules during electoral campaigns or mourning periods. It also monitors the compliance of Serbian media with the Broadcasting Law, and decides on complaints. It oversees the transformation of RTS in a public service broadcaster and appoints the managing board of RTS, which chooses its directors.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe independence of the RRA is formally guaranteed by a couple of mechanisms:<ref name=Matic2012/>\n* First, its Board members are elected by the Parliament, based on nominations coming from civil society organisations (the Culture and Media Committee of the National Assembly, the Assembly of the Province of [[Vojvodina]], academia, NGOs and the professional media community). Candidates cannot be state or party officials, nor have vested interest in programming production or broadcasting.<ref name=Matic2012/>\n* Second, the RRA has its own sources of revenues in the broadcasting license fees.\n\nYet, the independence, accountability and impartiality of the RRA, as well as its capacities, remains in doubt.<ref name=Marko2013>Marko, Davor (2013), [http://analitika.ba/en/publications/media-reforms-turbulent-times-role-media-assistance-establishmentindependent-media Media Reforms in Turbulent Times: The Role of Media Assistance in the Establishment of Independent Media Institutions in Serbia]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Analitika Centre for Social Research.</ref> Selection and nomination rules are open to multiple interpretations and give way to arbitrariness and possible political pressures.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\nAccording to the [[European Journalism Centre]], the RRA lacks human and financial resources to perform its tasks. It does not manage to monitor the broadcasters nor to publish its results. While broadcasters have admittedly violated advertisement regulators, the RRA pressed charges against them only in 2010. The Agency is deemed not transparent enough, and recurrent squabbles over the nomination of its board have reduced its credibility in the eyes of the public.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nThe establishment of independent regulatory bodies in Serbia went through several issues. The appointment of the first RRA Council created a two-years long political crisis for the breach of rules for their nomination. The delay meant that the Broadcasting Law was implemented slowly too, including the tendering for and issuing of 467 broadcasting licences, the privatisation of broadcasting media and transformation of the national and Vojvodina province state broadcasters into a public service. The RRA remained crippled by the original credibility crisis and the two-years long process of frequency allocation gave rise to doubts about its independence. Subsequent amendments to the Broadcasting Law opened up new avenues for possible political pressures over the RRA, e.g. when nominees of the Parliament and government got a longer term mandate than the nominees of professional and civil society organisations.<ref name=EJC/>\n\nAccording to journalists, the RRA charges excessive and arbitrary license fees to broadcasters. Print and online media are exempt from license requirements.<ref name=FH/>\n\n====Republic Telecommunications Agency====\nThe Republic Telecommunications Agency (RATEL) was foreseen by the 2003 Telecommunications Law and started operating in 2005. It defines the conditions for radio frequency spectrum usage, the Radio Frequency Allocation Plan, allocates radio and TV frequencies, and monitors their usage.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n====Press Council====\nThe Press Council is a self-regulatory body for the print media. It was established at the beginning of 2010, after years of planning and debating its structure, decision-making, sources of finance. It includes representatives of press publishers, professional journalistic organisations, and it aims to monitor the respect of the 2006 Ethical Code and deal with complaints by individuals and institutions.<ref name=EJC/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Media freedom in Serbia]]\n* [[Censorship in Serbia]]\n* [[Television in Serbia]]\n* [[List of newspapers in Serbia]]\n* [[Serbian culture#Serbian media]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|author=Miroslav Savi\u0107evi\u0107 |year=1995|work=The history of Serbian Culture|title=Television|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/msavicevic-television.html|publisher=Rastko}}\n*{{cite web|author=Mihailo Bjelica|year=1995|work=The history of Serbian Culture|title=Journalism and publicist writing|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/mbjelica-journalism.html|publisher=Rastko}}\n\n{{Serbia topics|state=collapsed}}\n{{Europe topic|Media of}}\n\n[[Category:Media in Serbia| ]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_of_Serbia"}

The [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] is based in the [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]] district of Los Angeles inside the [[20th Century Studios]] studio lot, while another complex, the [[Fox Television Center]], is in [[West Los Angeles]]. [[CBS]] owns [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] and previously owned [[Television City]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]], although the network still maintains operations on that lot. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and its parent company [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], produce TV programs both at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and at [[The Prospect Studios]] in the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California|Los Feliz]] neighborhood. [[NBC]] use to primarily produce at what is now [[The Burbank Studios]] before its parent company [[NBCUniversal]] moved these operations in 2014 to a new complex across the street from the [[Universal Studios]] lot. Several other film studios may also produce TV shows on their respective lots.\n\nThe building that now houses the [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]], at 1313 North Vine Street in Hollywood, played a pivotal role in the history of Los Angeles television, as three area television stations (channels [[KCBS-TV|2]], [[KCAL-TV|9]], and [[KCET|28]]) each used this facility to begin their initial broadcast operations in different points in time, as well as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] using this building as a secondary studio facility to their Prospect lot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcet.org/kcet-50th-anniversary/kcets-first-hollywood-home-the-historic-mutual-don-lee-studios|title=KCET's First Hollywood Home: The Historic Mutual-Don Lee Studios|last=Masters|first=Nathan|date=2014-10-15|website=KCET|language=en|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> The building, one of the first broadcast facilities built for television use, opened in August 1948 as the [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]]-[[Don Lee (broadcaster)|Don Lee]] Broadcasting System Building, and it is where Channel 2 (then operating as KTSL, the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network's original Los Angeles affiliate) first began its broadcast operations after receiving its FCC license just three months prior.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodheritage.com/newsarchive/summer01/Lee.html|title=Don Lee Mutual Broadcasting Building|website=www.hollywoodheritage.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> After Channel 2 was sold to CBS in 1951 (and was re-christened as KNXT thereafter), the station remained at 1313 North Vine until it relocated to near-by [[CBS Columbia Square|Columbia Square]] (at 6121 Sunset Boulevard, between El Centro and Gower Avenues) in 1961; Channel 9 also operated in this building until the early 1960s, when it and its then-sister radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ (930 AM)]] moved to the former Capitol Records building at 5515 [[Melrose Avenue]], adjacent to the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Pictures Studios]].  Channel 9 would remain at 5515 Melrose until 2002, after the station was purchased by CBS Corporation, and consolidated its operations with Channel 2 at Columbia Square; both stations moved to a dedicated television broadcast facility on the CBS Studio Center lot in 2007.  \n\nKCET Channel 28 used the Vine facility from its original sign-on in 1964 until 1971, when the station purchased and relocated to the former [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram Pictures studio lot]] at 4401 Sunset Boulevard, where it remained until 2011, when the station moved to a new broadcast center in Burbank, across from the former NBC studio lot (now operating as [[The Burbank Studios]]).  From the mid-1960s until the 1980s, ABC also used this facility (then operating as the Vine Street Theater) to produce several shows there, including the original run of ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', the first season of the ABC daytime version of ''[[Family Feud]]'', and the situation comedy ''[[Barney Miller]]'' among other series.\n\nIn all, every major Los Angeles television station, including all seven original VHF stations (channels 2, [[KNBC|4]], [[KTLA|5]], [[KABC-TV|7]], 9, [[KTTV|11]], and [[KCOP-TV|13]]), Spanish-language independent [[KWHY-TV|KWHY]] (channel 22), KCET, and [[Univision]] flagship station [[KMEX-DT|KMEX]] (channel 34) were based in Hollywood at various points in time, and nearly all of them (except for channels 13 and 34) were located on or near [[Sunset Boulevard]].  As most of these stations in proceeding years relocated to other parts of Greater Los Angeles, KTLA remains the only local broadcaster (television or radio) to be based in Hollywood, having been located at [[Old Warner Brothers Studio|5800 Sunset]] since 1958; prior to that, Channel 5 originally operated from the Paramount Melrose lot from its 1947 sign-on until the relocation six blocks to the north along Van Ness Avenue on Sunset, eleven years later.\n\nChannel 4, then known as KRCA-TV (unrelated to the current KRCA, on [[KRCA|channel 62]]) was the first Los Angeles television station to leave Hollywood (being based at the [[The Burbank Studios#History|NBC Radio City]] building on Sunset and Vine since its 1949 sign-on), as the station moved to the NBC Burbank studio lot in November 1962, and the station changed its call letters to KNBC upon the move to the San Fernando Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/NBCStudio4.html|title=Scotty Moore - NBC TV Studio Burbank|website=www.scottymoore.net|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> In 1997, KTTV, having been based at [[Metromedia Square|5746 Sunset]] (across Van Ness from KTLA) since 1950<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seeing-stars.com/TVstudios/FoxKTTV.shtml|title=Metromedia Square (formerly Fox Television/KTTV Studio)|website=www.seeing-stars.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> moved to a new broadcast center in [[West Los Angeles]], on Bundy Drive near Olympic Boulevard, and after being purchased by KTTV parent Fox Television Stations in the early 2000s, KCOP moved from its longtime studios on La Brea and Willoughby Avenues on the Los Angeles/[[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] boundary line<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seeing-stars.com/TVStudios/KCOP.shtml|title=KCOP Studios|website=www.seeing-stars.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>, to the KTTV facility on Bundy and Olympic.  Near the end of 2000, KABC-TV left its longtime home at the then-ABC Television Center at Prospect Avenue and Talmadge Street (less than one mile north of the former KCET Sunset studios), and moved to a new studio facility as part of Disney's [[Grand Central Airport (California)#Grand Central Creative Campus|Grand Central Creative campus]] in Glendale.\n\nKMEX, one of the first Spanish-language television stations in the United States<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icwblog.wordpress.com/2018/03/09/tuning-into-the-past-the-birth-of-spanish-language-television-in-los-angeles/|title=Tuning into the Past: The Birth of Spanish-Language Television in Los Angeles|date=2018-03-10|website=The ICW Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>, was originally located at 5420 Melrose (across from Paramount) from its September 1962 launch until 1993, where it moved to the Howard Hughes Center in the [[Westchester, Los Angeles|Westchester]] neighborhood of the city, near the [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] border and [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]].  Although KMEX moved to the Hughes Center in 1993, originally occupying space in one of the office towers on the site upon its move, Univision built a dedicated broadcast center in 2002 in another area of the complex, and has housed KMEX, sister station KFTR (Channel 46), four co-owned radio stations, and the network's West Coast operations since then.\n\n===Stations===\n[[File:Mt Wilson antenna farm winter.jpeg|thumb|right|Antennas on [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], a major transmitter site for Los Angeles radio and TV stations]]\n\nThe following are full-powered stations serving the Los Angeles television market.

There are also a wide variety of smaller regional newspapers, alternative weeklies and magazines, including ''[[LA Weekly]]'', ''[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]'' magazine, the ''[[Los Angeles Business Journal]]'', the ''[[Los Angeles Daily Journal]]'', and the ''[[Los Angeles Downtown News]]''. In addition to the English- and Spanish-language papers, numerous local periodicals serve immigrant communities in their native languages, including Korean, Persian, Russian and Japanese.\n\nThe [[Southern California News Group]], a subsidiary of [[Digital First Media]], operates eleven other regional daily newspapers in greater Los Angeles, with all covering four of the five Los Angeles DMA counties.  The ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', published in the [[San Fernando Valley]] community of [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], serves as the flagship newspaper of SCNG; other publications under the SCNG umbrella include the [[Torrance, California|Torrance]]-based ''[[Daily Breeze]]'' (serving the [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and southwestern Los Angeles County), ''[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]]'', ''[[Pasadena Star-News]]'', and the ''[[Orange County Register]]'', which SCNG acquired (along with the ''[[Riverside Press-Enterprise]]'') from [[Freedom Communications]] in March 2016.

The [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] is based in the [[Century City, Los Angeles|Century City]] district of Los Angeles inside the [[20th Century Studios]] studio lot, while another complex, the [[Fox Television Center]], is in [[West Los Angeles]]. [[CBS]] owns [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] and previously owned [[Television City]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]], although the network still maintains operations on that lot. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and its parent company [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], produce TV programs both at the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and at [[The Prospect Studios]] in the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California|Los Feliz]] neighborhood. [[NBC]] use to primarily produce at what is now [[The Burbank Studios]] before its parent company [[NBCUniversal]] moved these operations in 2014 to a new complex across the street from the [[Universal Studios]] lot. Several other film studios may also produce TV shows on their respective lots.\n\nThe building that now houses the [[Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study]], at 1313 North Vine Street in Hollywood, played a pivotal role in the history of Los Angeles television, as three area television stations (channels [[KCBS-TV|2]], [[KCAL-TV|9]], and [[KCET|28]]) each used this facility to begin their initial broadcast operations in different points in time, as well as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] using this building as a secondary studio facility to their Prospect lot<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcet.org/kcet-50th-anniversary/kcets-first-hollywood-home-the-historic-mutual-don-lee-studios|title=KCET's First Hollywood Home: The Historic Mutual-Don Lee Studios|last=Masters|first=Nathan|date=2014-10-15|website=KCET|language=en|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>.  The building, one of the first broadcast facilities built for television use, opened in August 1948 as the [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual]]-[[Don Lee (broadcaster)|Don Lee]] Broadcasting System Building, and it is where Channel 2 (then operating as KTSL, the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] network's original Los Angeles affiliate) first began its broadcast operations after receiving its FCC license just three months prior<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodheritage.com/newsarchive/summer01/Lee.html|title=Don Lee Mutual Broadcasting Building|website=www.hollywoodheritage.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>.  After Channel 2 was sold to CBS in 1951 (and was re-christened as KNXT thereafter), the station remained at 1313 North Vine until it relocated to near-by [[CBS Columbia Square|Columbia Square]] (at 6121 Sunset Boulevard, between El Centro and Gower Avenues) in 1961; Channel 9 also operated in this building until the early 1960s, when it and its then-sister radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ (930 AM)]] moved to the former Capitol Records building at 5515 [[Melrose Avenue]], adjacent to the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Pictures Studios]].  Channel 9 would remain at 5515 Melrose until 2002, after the station was purchased by CBS Corporation, and consolidated its operations with Channel 2 at Columbia Square; both stations moved to a dedicated television broadcast facility on the CBS Studio Center lot in 2007.  \n\nKCET Channel 28 used the Vine facility from its original sign-on in 1964 until 1971, when the station purchased and relocated to the former [[Monogram Pictures|Monogram Pictures studio lot]] at 4401 Sunset Boulevard, where it remained until 2011, when the station moved to a new broadcast center in Burbank, across from the former NBC studio lot (now operating as [[The Burbank Studios]]).  From the mid-1960s until the 1980s, ABC also used this facility (then operating as the Vine Street Theater) to produce several shows there, including the original run of ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'', the first season of the ABC daytime version of ''[[Family Feud]]'', and the situation comedy ''[[Barney Miller]]'' among other series.\n\nIn all, every major Los Angeles television station, including all seven original VHF stations (channels 2, [[KNBC|4]], [[KTLA|5]], [[KABC-TV|7]], 9, [[KTTV|11]], and [[KCOP-TV|13]]), Spanish-language independent [[KWHY-TV|KWHY]] (channel 22), KCET, and [[Univision]] flagship station [[KMEX-DT|KMEX]] (channel 34) were based in Hollywood at various points in time, and nearly all of them (except for channels 13 and 34) were located on or near [[Sunset Boulevard]].  As most of these stations in proceeding years relocated to other parts of Greater Los Angeles, KTLA remains the only local broadcaster (television or radio) to be based in Hollywood, having been located at [[Old Warner Brothers Studio|5800 Sunset]] since 1958; prior to that, Channel 5 originally operated from the Paramount Melrose lot from its 1947 sign-on until the relocation six blocks to the north along Van Ness Avenue on Sunset, eleven years later.\n\nChannel 4, then known as KRCA-TV (unrelated to the current KRCA, on [[KRCA|channel 62]]) was the first Los Angeles television station to leave Hollywood (being based at the [[The Burbank Studios#History|NBC Radio City]] building on Sunset and Vine since its 1949 sign-on), as the station moved to the NBC Burbank studio lot in November 1962, and the station changed its call letters to KNBC upon the move to the San Fernando Valley<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/NBCStudio4.html|title=Scotty Moore - NBC TV Studio Burbank|website=www.scottymoore.net|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>.  In 1997, KTTV, having been based at [[Metromedia Square|5746 Sunset]] (across Van Ness from KTLA) since 1950<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seeing-stars.com/TVstudios/FoxKTTV.shtml|title=Metromedia Square (formerly Fox Television/KTTV Studio)|website=www.seeing-stars.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> moved to a new broadcast center in [[West Los Angeles]], on Bundy Drive near Olympic Boulevard, and after being purchased by KTTV parent Fox Television Stations in the early 2000s, KCOP moved from its longtime studios on La Brea and Willoughby Avenues on the Los Angeles/[[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] boundary line<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seeing-stars.com/TVStudios/KCOP.shtml|title=KCOP Studios|website=www.seeing-stars.com|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>, to the KTTV facility on Bundy and Olympic.  Near the end of 2000, KABC-TV left its longtime home at the then-ABC Television Center at Prospect Avenue and Talmadge Street (less than one mile north of the former KCET Sunset studios), and moved to a new studio facility as part of Disney's [[Grand Central Airport (California)#Grand Central Creative Campus|Grand Central Creative campus]] in Glendale.\n\nKMEX, one of the first Spanish-language television stations in the United States<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icwblog.wordpress.com/2018/03/09/tuning-into-the-past-the-birth-of-spanish-language-television-in-los-angeles/|title=Tuning into the Past: The Birth of Spanish-Language Television in Los Angeles|date=2018-03-10|website=The ICW Blog|language=en|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref>, was originally located at 5420 Melrose (across from Paramount) from its September 1962 launch until 1993, where it moved to the Howard Hughes Center in the [[Westchester, Los Angeles|Westchester]] neighborhood of the city, near the [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] border and [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]].  Although KMEX moved to the Hughes Center in 1993, originally occupying space in one of the office towers on the site upon its move, Univision built a dedicated broadcast center in 2002 in another area of the complex, and has housed KMEX, sister station KFTR (Channel 46), four co-owned radio stations, and the network's West Coast operations since then.\n\n===Stations===\n[[File:Mt Wilson antenna farm winter.jpeg|thumb|right|Antennas on [[Mount Wilson (California)|Mount Wilson]], a major transmitter site for Los Angeles radio and TV stations]]\n\nThe following are full-powered stations serving the Los Angeles television market.

The mission conducted the first docking of two spacecraft in orbit, but suffered the first critical in-space system failure of a U.S. spacecraft which threatened the lives of the astronauts and required an immediate abort of the mission. The crew was returned to Earth safely.\n\nCommand pilot [[Neil Armstrong]]'s flight marked the second time a U.S. civilian flew into space ([[Joseph Albert Walker|Joe Walker]] became the first on [[X-15 Flight 90]]<ref name=\"Civilians in Space\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}</ref><ref name=\"Space.com Joseph A Walker\">{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}</ref>), and the first time a U.S. civilian flew into orbit. Armstrong had resigned his commission in the [[United States Naval Reserve]] in 1960.

After being launched into an {{convert|87|by|146|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit, on the fourth revolution it was to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with an [[Agena target vehicle]], which had been earlier launched into a {{convert|161|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular orbit. This was to be the first space docking in history. Four separate dockings were planned.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=2}}\n\nDuring the first docking, Pilot David Scott planned to perform an ambitious, two-hour-and-10-minute [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA), which would have been the first since [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]'s June 1965 spacewalk on [[Gemini 4|Gemini IV]]. On a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} tether for one and a half revolutions around the Earth, Scott would have retrieved a nuclear emulsion radiation experiment from the front of the Gemini's spacecraft adapter, then activate a [[micrometeoroid]] experiment on the Agena. Then he was to move back to the Gemini and test a minimum-reaction power tool by loosening and tightening bolts on a work panel.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=2}}\n\nDuring the EVA, after Armstrong undocked from the Agena, Scott was to don and test an Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP) stored at the back of the spacecraft adapter. This was a backpack with a self-contained oxygen supply, extra [[Freon]] propellant for his Hand Held Maneuvering Unit, and a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}} extension to his tether. He would practice several maneuvers in formation with the Gemini and Agena vehicles (separated at distances up to {{convert|60|ft|m}}, in concert with Armstrong in the Gemini.{{sfn|NASA|1966|pp=3, 18\u201319, 40\u201343}} Scott never got to perform this EVA, due to the abort of the flight because of an emergency which occurred shortly after docking.\n\nThe flight also carried an additional three scientific, four technological, and one medical experiment.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=3}}\n\n==Flight==\n\n===Agena Target Vehicle===\nFive months earlier, NASA had launched an [[Agena target vehicle|Agena Target Vehicle]] for [[Gemini 6]], but the [[Atlas-Agena]] launch failed when the Agena's engine exploded during orbital injection and the mission had to be rescheduled. The next attempt succeeded.  Everything worked perfectly; the Agena put itself into a 298 kilometer circular [[orbit]] and oriented itself to the correct attitude for the docking. The Gemini spacecraft itself was launched into a 160 by 272 kilometer orbit by a modified [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] on March 16, 1966 (coincidentally the 40th anniversary of the launch of the world's first liquid-fueled rocket by Dr. [[Robert H. Goddard]]), at 10:41:02&nbsp;a.m. EST. Gemini 8's launch was nominal and no significant anomalies occurred with either the Titan II or the spacecraft.[[File:Gemini 8 Atlas-Agena launch.jpg|thumb|left|The Agena Target Vehicle is launched into space on an Atlas rocket in preparation for Gemini 8]] \n[[File:Gemini 8 launch.jpg|thumb|A [[Titan II GLV|Gemini-Titan]] launch vehicle lofts ''Gemini 8'' into orbit, March 16, 1966.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | \n! scope=\"col\" | Gemini 8 Agena info\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Target vehicle\n| GATV-5003\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | NSSDC ID:\n| 1966-019A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mass\n| {{convert|3,175|kg}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch site\n| LC-14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch date\n| March 16, 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch time\n| 15:00:03 UTC\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st perigee\n| {{convert|299.1|km|nmi|sp=us}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st apogee\n| {{convert|299.7|km|nmi|sp=us}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Period\n| 90.47 m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inclination\n| 28.86\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Reentered\n| September 15, 1967\n|}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Rendezvous and docking===\n[[File:The First Docking in Space - GPN-2000-001344.jpg|thumb|left|The Agena Target Vehicle as seen from Gemini 8 during rendezvous.]]\n\nTheir first course adjustment was made at one hour and 34 minutes into the mission, when the astronauts lowered their apogee slightly with a five-second [[Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]] (OAMS) thruster burn. The second adjustment was made near apogee of the second orbit, and raised both the apogee and perigee by adding {{convert|49|ft/s|m/s}} to their speed. The third adjustment was made over the Pacific Ocean, a southward orbital plane change, made with a {{convert|59|ft/s|m/s}} sideways thruster burn. When they were over Mexico, [[Jim Lovell]], the Houston [[capsule communicator]], told them they needed one last correction, a {{convert|2.6|ft/s|m/s}} speed addition.\n\nThe rendezvous radar acquired the Agena Target Vehicle at a distance of {{convert|179|nmi|km}}. At 3 hours, 48 minutes and 10 seconds into the mission they performed another burn that put them in a circular orbit {{convert|15|nmi|km}} below the Agena. They first sighted it when they were {{convert|76|nmi|km}} away, and at {{convert|55|nmi|km}} they gave the computer automatic control.\n\nAfter several small burns they were {{convert|151|ft|m}} away and with no relative velocity. After 30 minutes of visually inspecting the Agena to make sure that it had not been damaged by the launch, they were given the go for docking. Armstrong started to move towards the Agena at 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) per second. In a matter of minutes, the Agena's docking latches clicked and a green light indicated that the docking had been successfully completed. \"Flight, we are docked! Yes, it's really a smoothie,\" Scott radioed to the ground.\n\n===Emergency===\nThere was some suspicion on the ground that the Agena's [[attitude control]] system was malfunctioning and might not have the correct program stored in it. This suspicion was found to be incorrect. Shortly before radio blackout, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] cautioned the astronauts to immediately abort the docking if any abnormalities occurred with the Agena.\n\nAfter the Agena began execution of its stored command program, which instructed the Agena to turn the combined spacecraft 90\u00b0 to the right, Scott noticed that they were rolling. Armstrong used the Gemini's OAMS thrusters to stop the roll, but after it stopped, it immediately started again. Gemini 8 was out of range of ground communications at this time.\n\n[[File:Rcs-gemini.jpg|thumb|Location of Gemini OAMS and Reentry (mislabeled \"Reaction\") Control System thrusters]]\nArmstrong reported that the OAMS fuel had dropped to 30%, indicating that the problem could be on their own spacecraft. With concern that the high rate of rotation might damage one or both spacecraft or even cause the propellant-heavy Agena to rupture or explode, the crew decided to undock from the Agena so they could analyze the situation. Scott switched the Agena control back to ground command, while Armstrong struggled to stabilize the combined vehicle enough to permit undocking. Scott then hit the undock button, and Armstrong fired a long burst of translation thrusters to back away from the Agena. Without the added mass of the Agena, Gemini started rotating more rapidly.\n\nThe astronauts realized that the problem was on the Gemini. By now the tumble rate had reached 296 degrees per second and Armstrong decided to shut down the OAMS and use the Reentry Control System (RCS) thrusters, located on the Gemini's nose, to stop the tumble.  Scott later praised Armstrong's actions as their spacecraft spun: \"The guy was brilliant. He knew the system so well. He found the solution, he activated the solution, under extreme circumstances ... it was my lucky day to be flying with him.\"<ref name=\"nova20141203\">{{Cite episode |title=First Man on the Moon |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/first-man-on-moon.html |series=Nova |series-link=Nova (American TV series) |network=PBS |date=2014-12-03 |season=41 |number=23}}</ref> The spacecraft came in range of the ground communications ship ''[[Coastal Sentry Quebec]]''. After steadying the spacecraft, the crew tested each OAMS thruster in turn and found that Number 8 had stuck on. Almost 75% of the reentry maneuvering fuel had been used to stop the tumble,{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=176}} and mission rules dictated that the flight be aborted once the Reentry Control System was fired for any reason. Gemini 8 immediately prepared for an emergency landing.\n\n===Landing and recovery===\n[[Image:Armstrong and Scott with Hatches Open - GPN-2000-001413.jpg|thumb|Scott (L) and Armstrong (R) await USS ''Leonard F. Mason'']]\n\nIt was decided to let the spacecraft reenter one orbit later so that it could land in a place that could be reached by the secondary recovery forces. The original plan was for Gemini 8 to land in the Atlantic, but that was supposed to be three days later. {{USS|Leonard F. Mason|DD-852|6}} started to steam towards the new landing site {{convert|800|km|nmi mi|sp=us}} east of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] and {{convert|1,000|km|nmi mi|sp=us}} south of [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]].\n\nReentry took place over China, out of range of NASA tracking stations.\n\nPlanes were also dispatched, and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilot [[Les Schneider]] spotted the spacecraft as it descended precisely on time and on target. Three pararescuers jumped from their [[C-54]] and attached a flotation collar to the capsule.  The three pararescuers ([[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force PJs]]) were A/2C Glenn M. Moore; A/1C Eldridge M. Neal; and S/Sgt Larry D. Huyett.<ref name=\"Gemini 8 Crew and PJs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~7~7~32671~136538:Gemini-8-crew-stands-on-deck-of-rec |title=Gemini8 Crew and PJs |accessdate=2010-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727151042/http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~7~7~32671~136538%3AGemini-8-crew-stands-on-deck-of-rec |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\nAll of the pararescuers and astronauts suffered from seasickness.  Three hours after [[splashdown]], ''Leonard F. Mason'', which had been outfitted with quarantine equipment, had both the men and the spacecraft on board. The astronauts were exhausted, but had otherwise survived the flight and their time on the water in good condition. They were briefly checked and slept for nine hours.\n\nThe next morning, the ship docked at the port of [[Naha]].  Fellow Astronaut [[Walter Schirra]] and other NASA officials flew in to greet them before the astronauts were summoned back to the ship for medical tests and debriefing.  After release, they were brought by limousine to waiting helicopters where they flew to [[Kadena Air Base]] and then on to Florida on a [[C-135]].<ref>[http://www.stripes.com/news/astronauts-arrive-on-okinawa-1.28085 Astronauts arrive on Okinawa] (March 19, 1966);  AP, ''Stars and Stripes'', Retrieved: December 12, 2016.</ref>\n\nUpon the return, the spacecraft was covered with a tarp. As part of the investigation into the mishap, ground controllers tested the Agena stage for the next several days by ordering it to perform various in-orbit maneuvers until exhausting its propellant and electrical power.\n\nFour months later, the crew of [[Gemini 10]] rendezvoused with the inert Agena and astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] retrieved its micrometeorite collector.\n\n==Cause and outcome==\nNo conclusive reason for the thruster malfunction was found. The most probable cause was determined to be an electrical short, most likely due to a [[static electricity]] discharge. Power still flowed to the thruster, even when it was switched off. To prevent recurrence of this problem, spacecraft designs were changed so each thruster would have an isolated circuit.\n[[File:Press conference - GT-VIII - prime and backup crew.jpg|thumb|The Gemini 8 crews answer questions at an MSC press conference.]]\n\nThe Deputy Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans|Dr. Robert Seamans]], was attending a celebratory dinner sponsored by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], at which Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the guest speaker, when the problem arose.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Seamans, Jr.\n  | first = Robert C.\n  | authorlink = Robert Seamans\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions\n  | journal = Monographs in Aerospace History\n  | volume = 37\n  | publisher = NASA\n  | id = SP-2005-4537\n  | year = 2005\n  | location = Washington, D.C.\n  | pages = \n  | url = https://history.nasa.gov/monograph37.pdf  \n  | doi = \n  | isbn = }}\n</ref> The incident inspired Seamans to review NASA's problem investigation procedures, modeled after military crash investigations, and on April 14, 1966, to formalize a new procedure in '''Management Instruction 8621.1, Mission Failure Investigation Policy And Procedures'''. This gave the Deputy Administrator the option of performing independent investigations of major failures, beyond those failure investigations for which the various Program Office officials were normally responsible. It declared: \"It is NASA policy to investigate and document the causes of all major mission failures which occur in the conduct of its space and aeronautical activities and to take appropriate corrective actions as a result of the findings and recommendations.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n  | author = Dr. Robert C.

It was also invoked after the next critical in-flight failure, which occurred on the [[Apollo 13]] lunar mission in April 1970.\n\n[[McDonnell Aircraft Corporation]], the Gemini spacecraft prime contractor, also changed its procedures.

The mission conducted the first docking of two spacecraft in orbit, but suffered the first critical in-space system failure of a U.S. spacecraft which threatened the lives of the astronauts and required an immediate abort of the mission. The crew was returned to Earth safely.\n\nCommand pilot [[Neil Armstrong]]'s flight marked the second time a U.S. civilian flew into space ([[Joseph Albert Walker|Joe Walker]] became the first on [[X-15 Flight 90]]<ref name=\"Civilians in Space\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2006-08/000736.html|title=Civilians in Space}}</ref><ref name=\"Space.com Joseph A Walker\">{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/adastra/adastra_joewalker_061127.html|title=Space.com Joseph A Walker}}</ref>), and the first time a U.S. civilian flew into orbit.

After being launched into an {{convert|87|by|146|nmi|km|adj=on}} orbit, on the fourth revolution it was to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|dock]] with an [[Agena target vehicle]], which had been earlier launched into a {{convert|161|nmi|km|adj=on}} circular orbit. This was to be the first space docking in history. Four separate dockings were planned.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=2}}\n\nDuring the first docking, Pilot David Scott planned to perform an ambitious, two-hour-and-10-minute [[extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA), which would have been the first since [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]'s June 1965 spacewalk on [[Gemini 4|Gemini IV]]. On a {{convert|25|ft|m|adj=on}} tether for one and a half revolutions around the Earth, Scott would have retrieved a nuclear emulsion radiation experiment from the front of the Gemini's spacecraft adapter, then activate a [[micrometeoroid]] experiment on the Agena. Then he was to move back to the Gemini and test a minimum-reaction power tool by loosening and tightening bolts on a work panel.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=2}}\n\nDuring the EVA, after Armstrong undocked from the Agena, Scott was to don and test an Extravehicular Support Pack (ESP) stored at the back of the spacecraft adapter. This was a backpack with a self-contained oxygen supply, extra [[Freon]] propellant for his Hand Held Maneuvering Unit, and a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}} extension to his tether. He would practice several maneuvers in formation with the Gemini and Agena vehicles (separated at distances up to {{convert|60|ft|m}}, in concert with Armstrong in the Gemini.{{sfn|NASA|1966|pp=3, 18\u201319, 40\u201343}} Scott never got to perform this EVA, due to the abort of the flight because of an emergency which occurred shortly after docking.\n\nThe flight also carried an additional three scientific, four technological, and one medical experiment.{{sfn|NASA|1966|p=3}}\n\n==Flight==\n\n===Agena Target Vehicle===\nFive months earlier, NASA had launched an [[Agena target vehicle|Agena Target Vehicle]] for [[Gemini 6]], but the [[Atlas-Agena]] launch failed when the Agena's engine exploded during orbital injection and the mission had to be rescheduled. The next attempt succeeded.  Everything worked perfectly; the Agena put itself into a 298 kilometer circular [[orbit]] and oriented itself to the correct attitude for the docking. The Gemini spacecraft itself was launched into a 160 by 272 kilometer orbit by a modified [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] on March 16, 1966 (coincidentally the 40th anniversary of the launch of the world's first liquid-fueled rocket by Dr. [[Robert H. Goddard]]), at 10:41:02&nbsp;a.m. EST. Gemini 8's launch was nominal and no significant anomalies occurred with either the Titan II or the spacecraft.[[File:Gemini 8 Atlas-Agena launch.jpg|thumb|left|The Agena Target Vehicle is launched into space on an Atlas rocket in preparation for Gemini 8]] \n[[File:Gemini 8 launch.jpg|thumb|A [[Titan II GLV|Gemini-Titan]] launch vehicle lofts ''Gemini 8'' into orbit, March 16, 1966.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n! scope=\"col\" | \n! scope=\"col\" | Gemini 8 Agena info\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Target vehicle\n| GATV-5003\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | NSSDC ID:\n| 1966-019A\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Mass\n| {{convert|3,175|kg}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch site\n| LC-14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch date\n| March 16, 1966\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Launch time\n| 15:00:03 UTC\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st perigee\n| {{convert|299.1|km|nmi|sp=us}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1st apogee\n| {{convert|299.7|km|nmi|sp=us}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Period\n| 90.47 m\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Inclination\n| 28.86\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Reentered\n| September 15, 1967\n|}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n===Rendezvous and docking===\n[[File:The First Docking in Space - GPN-2000-001344.jpg|thumb|left|The Agena Target Vehicle as seen from Gemini 8 during rendezvous.]]\n\nTheir first course adjustment was made at one hour and 34 minutes into the mission, when the astronauts lowered their apogee slightly with a five-second [[Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]] (OAMS) thruster burn. The second adjustment was made near apogee of the second orbit, and raised both the apogee and perigee by adding {{convert|49|ft/s|m/s}} to their speed. The third adjustment was made over the Pacific Ocean, a southward orbital plane change, made with a {{convert|59|ft/s|m/s}} sideways thruster burn. When they were over Mexico, [[Jim Lovell]], the Houston [[capsule communicator]], told them they needed one last correction, a {{convert|2.6|ft/s|m/s}} speed addition.\n\nThe rendezvous radar acquired the Agena Target Vehicle at a distance of {{convert|179|nmi|km}}. At 3 hours, 48 minutes and 10 seconds into the mission they performed another burn that put them in a circular orbit {{convert|15|nmi|km}} below the Agena. They first sighted it when they were {{convert|76|nmi|km}} away, and at {{convert|55|nmi|km}} they gave the computer automatic control.\n\nAfter several small burns they were {{convert|151|ft|m}} away and with no relative velocity. After 30 minutes of visually inspecting the Agena to make sure that it had not been damaged by the launch, they were given the go for docking. Armstrong started to move towards the Agena at 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) per second. In a matter of minutes, the Agena's docking latches clicked and a green light indicated that the docking had been successfully completed. \"Flight, we are docked! Yes, it's really a smoothie,\" Scott radioed to the ground.\n\n===Emergency===\nThere was some suspicion on the ground that the Agena's [[attitude control]] system was malfunctioning and might not have the correct program stored in it. This suspicion was found to be incorrect. Shortly before radio blackout, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] cautioned the astronauts to immediately abort the docking if any abnormalities occurred with the Agena.\n\nAfter the Agena began execution of its stored command program, which instructed the Agena to turn the combined spacecraft 90\u00b0 to the right, Scott noticed that they were rolling. Armstrong used the Gemini's OAMS thrusters to stop the roll, but after it stopped, it immediately started again. Gemini 8 was out of range of ground communications at this time.\n\n[[File:Rcs-gemini.jpg|thumb|Location of Gemini OAMS and Reentry (mislabeled \"Reaction\") Control System thrusters]]\nArmstrong reported that the OAMS fuel had dropped to 30%, indicating that the problem could be on their own spacecraft. With concern that the high rate of rotation might damage one or both spacecraft or even cause the propellant-heavy Agena to rupture or explode, the crew decided to undock from the Agena so they could analyze the situation. Scott switched the Agena control back to ground command, while Armstrong struggled to stabilize the combined vehicle enough to permit undocking. Scott then hit the undock button, and Armstrong fired a long burst of translation thrusters to back away from the Agena. Without the added mass of the Agena, Gemini started rotating more rapidly.\n\nThe astronauts realized that the problem was on the Gemini. By now the tumble rate had reached 296 degrees per second and Armstrong decided to shut down the OAMS and use the Reentry Control System (RCS) thrusters, located on the Gemini's nose, to stop the tumble.  Scott later praised Armstrong's actions as their spacecraft spun: \"The guy was brilliant. He knew the system so well. He found the solution, he activated the solution, under extreme circumstances ... it was my lucky day to be flying with him.\"<ref name=\"nova20141203\">{{Cite episode |title=First Man on the Moon |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/first-man-on-moon.html |series=Nova |series-link=Nova (American TV series) |network=PBS |date=2014-12-03 |season=41 |number=23}}</ref> The spacecraft came in range of the ground communications ship ''[[Coastal Sentry Quebec]]''. After steadying the spacecraft, the crew tested each OAMS thruster in turn and found that Number 8 had stuck on. Almost 75% of the reentry maneuvering fuel had been used to stop the tumble,{{sfn|Gatland|1976|p=176}} and mission rules dictated that the flight be aborted once the Reentry Control System was fired for any reason. Gemini 8 immediately prepared for an emergency landing.\n\n===Landing and recovery===\n[[Image:Armstrong and Scott with Hatches Open - GPN-2000-001413.jpg|thumb|Scott (L) and Armstrong (R) await USS ''Leonard F. Mason'']]\n\nIt was decided to let the spacecraft reenter one orbit later so that it could land in a place that could be reached by the secondary recovery forces. The original plan was for Gemini 8 to land in the Atlantic, but that was supposed to be three days later. {{USS|Leonard F. Mason|DD-852|6}} started to steam towards the new landing site {{convert|800|km|nmi mi|sp=us}} east of [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]] and {{convert|1,000|km|nmi mi|sp=us}} south of [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], [[Japan]].\n\nReentry took place over China, out of range of NASA tracking stations.\n\nPlanes were also dispatched, and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] pilot [[Les Schneider]] spotted the spacecraft as it descended precisely on time and on target. Three pararescuers jumped from their [[C-54]] and attached a flotation collar to the capsule.  The three pararescuers ([[United States Air Force Pararescue|Air Force PJs]]) were A/2C Glenn M. Moore; A/1C Eldridge M. Neal; and S/Sgt Larry D. Huyett.<ref name=\"Gemini 8 Crew and PJs\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~7~7~32671~136538:Gemini-8-crew-stands-on-deck-of-rec |title=Gemini8 Crew and PJs |accessdate=2010-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727151042/http://www.nasaimages.org/luna/servlet/detail/nasaNAS~7~7~32671~136538%3AGemini-8-crew-stands-on-deck-of-rec |archivedate=2011-07-27 }}</ref>\n\nAll of the pararescuers and astronauts suffered from seasickness.  Three hours after [[splashdown]], ''Leonard F. Mason'', which had been outfitted with quarantine equipment, had both the men and the spacecraft on board. The astronauts were exhausted, but had otherwise survived the flight and their time on the water in good condition. They were briefly checked and slept for nine hours.\n\nThe next morning, the ship docked at the port of [[Naha]].  Fellow Astronaut [[Walter Schirra]] and other NASA officials flew in to greet them before the astronauts were summoned back to the ship for medical tests and debriefing.  After release, they were brought by limousine to waiting helicopters where they flew to [[Kadena Air Base]] and then on to Florida on a [[C-135]].<ref>[http://www.stripes.com/news/astronauts-arrive-on-okinawa-1.28085 Astronauts arrive on Okinawa] (March 19, 1966);  AP, ''Stars and Stripes'', Retrieved: December 12, 2016.</ref>\n\nUpon the return, the spacecraft was covered with a tarp. As part of the investigation into the mishap, ground controllers tested the Agena stage for the next several days by ordering it to perform various in-orbit maneuvers until exhausting its propellant and electrical power.\n\nFour months later, the crew of [[Gemini 10]] rendezvoused with the inert Agena and astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] retrieved its micrometeorite collector.\n\n==Cause and outcome==\nNo conclusive reason for the thruster malfunction was found. The most probable cause was determined to be an electrical short, most likely due to a [[static electricity]] discharge. Power still flowed to the thruster, even when it was switched off. To prevent recurrence of this problem, spacecraft designs were changed so each thruster would have an isolated circuit.\n[[File:Press conference - GT-VIII - prime and backup crew.jpg|thumb|The Gemini 8 crews answer questions at an MSC press conference.]]\n\nThe Deputy Administrator of NASA, [[Robert Seamans|Dr. Robert Seamans]], was attending a celebratory dinner sponsored by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], at which Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]] was the guest speaker, when the problem arose.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Seamans, Jr.\n  | first = Robert C.\n  | authorlink = Robert Seamans\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions\n  | journal = Monographs in Aerospace History\n  | volume = 37\n  | publisher = NASA\n  | id = SP-2005-4537\n  | year = 2005\n  | location = Washington, D.C.\n  | pages = \n  | url = https://history.nasa.gov/monograph37.pdf  \n  | doi = \n  | isbn = }}\n</ref> The incident inspired Seamans to review NASA's problem investigation procedures, modeled after military crash investigations, and on April 14, 1966, to formalize a new procedure in '''Management Instruction 8621.1, Mission Failure Investigation Policy And Procedures'''.
