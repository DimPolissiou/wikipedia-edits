Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in ''Things As They Are'', 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as \"Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Stein-gertrude |encyclopedia=Jewish Women Encyclopedia |last=Simon |first=Linda |title=Gertrude Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |magazine=Style Magazine |last=Rudacille |first=Deborah |title=Baltimore Blues |access-date=October 17, 2012 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528023126/http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |archive-date=May 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's \"controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty\" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAsked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled \"The Value of College Education for Women\", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:\n\n{{quote|\"average middle class woman [supported by] some male relative, a husband or father or brother,...[is] not worth her keep economically considered. [This economic dependence caused her to become] oversexed...adapting herself to the abnormal sex desire of the male...and becoming a creature that should have been first a human being and then a woman into one that is a woman first and always.\"|source=<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>}}\n\nWhile a student at Johns Hopkins and purportedly still na\u00efve about sexual matters, Stein experienced an awakening of her latent sexuality. Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with [[Mary Bookstaver]] who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her \"erotic awakening\". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In 1902 Stein's brother [[Leo Stein]] left for [[London]], and Stein followed. The following year the two relocated to Paris, where Leo hoped to pursue an art career.<ref name=\"poetryfoundation\"/>\n\n==Art collection==\n[[File:Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpg|thumb|left|Gertrude and Leo Stein bought [[Henri Matisse]]'s, ''[[Woman with a Hat]]'', 1905, a portrait of the artist's wife, Amelia, now in the [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]]]\n\n[[File:Leo, Gertrude, Michael Stein.jpg|thumb|Leo, Gertrude, and Michael Stein]]\nFrom 1903 until 1914, when they dissolved their common household, Gertrude and her brother Leo shared living quarters near the [[Luxembourg Gardens]] on the [[Left Bank]] of Paris in a two-story apartment (with adjacent studio) located on the interior courtyard at [[27 rue de Fleurus]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]]. Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.\n\nThe gallery space was furnished with imposing [[Renaissance]]-era furniture from [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

Where [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], C\u00e9zanne, Matisse, and Picasso's works dominated Leo and Gertrude's collection, the collection of Michael and [[Sarah Stein]] emphasized [[Matisse]].<ref>[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], p. 28.</ref> In April 1914 Leo relocated to [[Settignano|Settignano, Italy, near Florence]], and the art collection was divided. The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:\n\n{{quote |The C\u00e9zanne apples have a unique importance to me that nothing can replace. The Picasso landscape is not important in any such sense. We are, as it seems to me on the whole, both so well off now that we needn't repine. The C\u00e9zannes had to be divided. I am willing to leave you the Picasso oeuvre, as you left me the Renoir, and you can have everything except that. I want to keep the few drawings that I have. This leaves no string for me, it is financially equable either way for estimates are only rough & ready methods, & I'm afraid you'll have to look upon the loss of the apples as an act of God. I have been anxious above all things that each should have in reason all that he wanted, and just as I was glad that Renoir was sufficiently indifferent to you so that you were ready to give them up, so I am glad that Pablo is sufficiently indifferent to me that I am willing to let you have all you want of it.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 207\u20138.</ref><ref>An image of \"the C\u00e9zanne apples\" appears in [[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]], plate 19.</ref>}}\n\nLeo departed with sixteen Renoirs, and relinquishing the Picassos and most of Matisse to his sister, took only a portrait sketch Picasso had done of him. He remained dedicated to C\u00e9zanne, nonetheless, leaving all the artist's works with his sister, taking with him only a C\u00e9zanne painting of \"5 apples\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The split between brother and sister was acrimonious. Stein did not see Leo Stein again until after [[World War I]], and then through only a brief greeting on the street in Paris. After this accidental encounter, they never saw or spoke to each other again.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Steins' holdings were dispersed eventually by various methods and for various reasons.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/specials/stein-family.html ''The Family Knew What It Liked'']. ''The New York Times'', 3 May 1998.</ref>\nAfter Stein's and Leo's households separated in 1914, she continued to collect examples of Picasso's art, which had turned to [[Cubism]], a style Leo did not appreciate. At her death, Gertrude's remaining collection emphasized the artwork of Picasso and [[Juan Gris]], most of her other pictures having been sold.<ref name=\"MoMA\">[[#MOMA|MoMA (1970)]]</ref>\n\nGertrude Stein's personality has dominated the provenance of the Stein art legacy. It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser. Alfred Barr Jr., the founding director of New York's [[Museum of Modern Art]], said that between the years of 1905 and 1907, \"[Leo] was possibly the most discerning connoisseur and collector of 20th century painting in the world.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Favored Strangers: Gertrude Stein and Her Family |author=Linda Wagner-Martin |page=67 |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2uyupUrgNkC&pg=PA67 |isbn=978-0-8135-2474-0 }}</ref> After the artworks were divided between the two Stein siblings, it was Gertrude who moved on to champion the works of what proved to be lesser talents in the 1930s. She concentrated on the work of [[Juan Gris]], [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], and Sir [[Francis Cyril Rose|Francis Rose]]. In 1932, Stein asserted: \"painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nIn 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter [[Francisco Riba Rovira]] (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:<blockquote>I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what C\u00e9zanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that C\u00e9zanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.\n\nThe only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which C\u00e9zanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what C\u00e9zanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.<ref>Gertrude Stein. \"A la recherche d'un jeune peintre\", revue ''Fontaine'' no. 42, pp. 287\u2013288, 1945</ref><ref>Gertrude Stein. \"Looking for a young painter\" (Riba-Rovira) Yale University U.S.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon==\n[[File:Plaque Gertrude Stein, 27 rue de Fleurus, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[27 rue de Fleurus]]]]\nThe gatherings in the Stein home \"brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art\".

It was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room.\n\nGertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of C\u00e9zanne: \"Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 84.</ref>\n\nAmong Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]] (artist), [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] (artist), [[Max Jacob]] (poet), [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (poet), [[Marie Laurencin]] (artist, and Apollinaire's mistress), [[Henri Rousseau]] (painter), and [[Joseph Stella]].<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nHemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway \"yellow\" in ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.''<ref name=\":0\" /> Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child.<ref name=\"Meyers1\">Meyers, Jeffrey - ''Hemingway: A Biography'', Macmillan, New York, 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-333-42126-0}}</ref> While Stein has been credited with inventing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 273\u20134.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer [[Paul Bowles]] to go to [[Tangier]], where she and Alice had vacationed.\n\n==Literary style==\n[[File:Gertrude stein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Van Vechten]], ''Portrait of Gertrude Stein'', 1934]]\nStein's writing can be placed in three categories: \"hermetic\" works best illustrated by ''[[The Making of Americans]]: The Hersland Family''; popularized writing such as ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which ''[[Brewsie and Willie]]'' is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, [[libretti]] and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]\"; \"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle\"; about her childhood home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], \"There is no there there\"; and \"The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.\"\n\nThese [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as [[Cubism]], plasticity, and [[collage]]. Many of the experimental works such as ''Tender Buttons'' have since been interpreted by critics as a [[feminist]] reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on \"[[automatic writing]]\" with [[William James]], she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThough Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of [[C\u00e9zanne]]. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: \"the whole field of the canvas is important\" (p.&nbsp;8{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, \"Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.\" It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: \"The important thing is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.\"\n\nHer use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the \"bottom nature\" of her characters, such as in ''The Making of Americans'' where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as \"As I was saying\" and \"There will be now a history of her.\" Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with \"too much association\". Social judgment is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nStein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous present in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes \"play\" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: \"rather than the [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses ''play''.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 18.</ref> In addition Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly Grahn argues that one must \"''inster''stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 21.</ref> In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of ''The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook'', which was written by Toklas.\n\nSeveral of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including [[Virgil Thomson]]'s operas ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' and ''The Mother of Us All'', and [[James Tenney]]'s setting of ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose'' as a [[canon (music)|canon]] dedicated to [[Philip Corner]], beginning with \"a\" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. \"a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.\"\n\n==Literary career==\n[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Portrait of Gertrude Stein]]'', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.

Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was ''[[Three Lives (book)|Three Lives]]''. In 1911, [[Mildred Aldrich]] introduced Stein to [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.\n\nMabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication ''The Makings of Americans'' and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of ''Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia''.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/> Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Regiment]] [[Armory Show]] in 1913, \"the first avant-garde art exhibition in America\".<ref name=\"MoMA\"/>\n\nIn addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in \"Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose\", published in a special March 1913 publication of ''Arts and Decoration''.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\">[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 170.</ref> Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in \"Speculations\":\n\n{{quote |In Gertrude Stein's writing every word lives and, apart from concept, it is so exquisitely rhythmical and cadenced that if we read it aloud and receive it as pure sound, it is like a kind of sensuous music. Just as one may stop, for once, in a way, before a canvas of Picasso, and, letting one's reason sleep for an instant, may exclaim: \"It ''is'' a fine pattern!\" so, listening to Gertrude Stein's words and forgetting to try to understand what they mean, one submits to their gradual charm.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\"/>}}\n\nStein and [[Carl Van Vechten]], the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was \"Papa Woojums\", and Stein, \"Baby Woojums\". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.<ref name=\"brbl-archive.library.yale.edu\"/>\n\n===America (1934\u20131935)===\nIn October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in [[Times Square]] announced to all that \"Gertrude Stein Has Arrived\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-gertrude-stein-toured-america-105320781/ |title=When Gertrude Stein Toured America |date=October 14, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref> Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nStein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that \"Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures.\" Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a [[speech disorder]], [[palilalia]], which caused her \"to stutter over words and phrases\".

An antiquarian copy was valued at over $1,200 in 2007. It is currently in print, and was re-released as ''Tender Buttons: The Corrected Centennial Edition'' by [[City Lights Publishers]] in March 2014.\n\nIn an interview with [[:de:Robert Bartlett Haas|Robert Bartlett Haas]] in \"A Transatlantic Interview - 1946\", Stein insisted that this work was completely \"realistic\" in the tradition of [[Gustave Flaubert]], stating the following: \"I used to take objects on a table, like a tumbler or any kind of object and try to get the picture of it clear and separate in my mind and create a word relationship between the word and the things seen.\" Commentators have indicated that what she meant was that the ''reference'' of objects remained central to her work, although the ''representation'' of them had not.<ref name=\"Perloff\">{{cite web|url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19342|title=The Difference is Spreading: on Gertrude Stein|last=Perloff|first=Marjorie|year=2000|accessdate=30 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011190719/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/19342|archive-date=11 October 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Scholar [[Marjorie Perloff]] had said of Stein that \"[u]nlike her contemporaries ([[T.S.

That summer, Stein stayed with Michael and Sarah Stein, their son Allan, and Leo in a nearby villa. Gertrude and Alice's summer of 1908 is memorialized in images of the two of them in Venice, at the piazza in front of Saint Mark's.<ref name=\"Mellow 1974, p. 122\"/>\n\nToklas arrived in 1907 with Harriet Levy, with Toklas maintaining living arrangements with Levy until she moved to 27 Rue de Fleurus in 1910.

Soon after she purchased them from [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s gallery,<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 209.</ref> the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of ''Three Lives'', to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 210\u20135.</ref> When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in England.

Stein is credited with bringing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" into use.]]\nDuring the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass market publication of ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''. She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the [[Ain]] district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named \"Basket\" whose successor, \"Basket II\", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, [[Ain]], in the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] region. Gertrude and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to [[Bernard Fa\u00ff]] who was a collaborator with the [[Vichy regime]] and had connections to the [[Gestapo]], or possibly because Gertrude was an American and a famous author. Gertrude's book \"Wars I Have Seen\" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to [[Keystone cops]]. When Fa\u00ff was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Gertrude and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Fa\u00ff's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in [[Berchtesgaden]]. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: \"Off We All Went To See Germany.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103918/barbara-will-gertrude-stein-christopher-benfey |work=The New Republic |last=Benfey |first=Christopher |title=The Alibi of Ambiguity |date=June 28, 2012 |access-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, a cabinet in the [[Yale University]] [[Beinecke Library]], which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was \"Baby Precious\", in turn Stein was for Toklas, \"Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle\".<ref name=\"poetryfoundation\" />\n\n===Lesbian relationships===\nStein is the author of one of the earliest [[coming out]] stories, \"''Q.E.D.''\" (published in 1950 as ''Things as They Are''), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of [[romantic friendship]] as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested \"passion in its many disguised forms\". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with [[Mary Bookstaver]] (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.<ref name=\"Blackmer 1995 pp. 681\"/>\n\nStein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of [[Otto Weininger]]'s ''Sex and Character'' (1906). Weininger, though [[Jewish]] by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.<ref name=Ramsay>Ramsay, Tamara Ann (1998).

Toklas]]. [[Ernest Hemingway]] describes how Alice was Gertrude's \"wife\" in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway's) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two \"wives\" to chat.<ref name=\"Grahn\">[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]]</ref>\n\nThe more affirming essay \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\" is one of the first [[lesbian literature|homosexual revelation stories]] to be published. The work, like ''Q.E.D.'', is informed by Stein's growing involvement with a homosexual community,<ref name=\"Grahn\"/> though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars.<ref name=\"Blackmer\">[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]]</ref> The work contains the word \"[[gay]]\" over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word \"gay\" in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them,<ref name = \"Blackmer\" /> and, thus, uninformed readers missed the lesbian content. A similar essay of homosexual men begins more obviously with the line \"Sometimes men are kissing\" but is less well known.<ref name=\"Blackmer\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Tender buttons: objects, food, rooms|Tender Buttons]]'' Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with \"highly condensed layers of public and private meanings\" created by wordplay including puns on the words \"box\", \"cow\", and in titles such as \"tender buttons\".<ref name=\"Blackmer\"/>\n\n{{anchor|nothere}}\n\n==\"There is no there there\"==\nAlong with Stein's widely known \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]\"<ref>Cf. Natias Neutert about Gertrude Stein's Rose\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw</ref> quotation, \"there is no there there\" is also one of her most famous. It appears in ''Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). \n\nStein wrote:\n\n{{quote |She took us to see her granddaughter who was teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael, we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not changed but Goat Island might just as well not have been there, anyway what was the use of my having come from Oakland it was not natural to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if I like but not there, there is no there there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stefan Metaal |url=http://members.chello.nl/smetaal/usu1.htm |title=No There there |publisher=Members.chello.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n...but not there, there is no there there. ...

She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the [[industrial revolution]] had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline.

Stein had met Fa\u00ff in 1926, and he became her \"dearest friend during her life\", according to Alice B. Toklas. Fa\u00ff had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933\u201334 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, ''The Autobiography of Alice B.

In her introduction, Stein crafts an analogy between [[George Washington]] and P\u00e9tain. She writes of the high esteem in which P\u00e9tain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler.

Accustomed to a life of entitlement since birth, Stein may have been convinced her wealth and notoriety would exempt her from what had befallen other European Jews. In an essay written for the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in November, 1940, Stein had written about her decision not to leave France: \"it would be awfully uncomfortable and I am fussy about my food.\" Stein continued to praise P\u00e9tain after the war ended, this at a time when P\u00e9tain had been sentenced to death by a French court for treason.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAuthor [[Djuna Barnes]] provided a caustic assessment of Stein's book, ''Wars I Have Seen'':\n\n:\"You do not feel that she [Stein] is ever really worried about the sorrows of the people.

Writing in the June 2005 edition of ''The New Yorker'', Janet Malcolm describes:\n{{quote |On July 27, 1946, Stein was operated on for what proved to be inoperable stomach cancer and died before coming out of anesthesia.  In \"What Is Remembered,\" Toklas wrote of the \"troubled, confused and very uncertain\" afternoon of the surgery. \"I sat next to her and she said to me early in the afternoon, What is the answer? I was silent. In that case, she said, what is the question?\" However, in a letter to Van Vechten ten years earlier, Toklas had written:\n{{quote |About Baby's last words. She said upon waking from a sleep--What is the question. And I didn't answer thinking she was not completely awakened. Then she said again--What is the question and before I could speak she went on--If there is no question then there is no answer.}}\n\nStein's biographers have naturally selected the superior \"in that case what is the question?\" version. Strong narratives win out over weak ones when no obstacle of factuality stands in their way. What Stein actually said remains unknown. That Toklas cited the lesser version in a letter of 1953 is suggestive but not conclusive.<ref>Malcolm, Janet, \"Someone Says Yes to It,\" ''The New Yorker'' 81/17 (June 13, 2005): 148</ref>}} Stein named writer and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]] as her [[literary executor]], and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Here is one artist who has been able to accept ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half forgotten city.}}\n\nIn a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, \"As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.{{Sfn | Mellow | 1974 | p = 260}}\"\n\nOther critics took a more negative view of Stein's work. F. W. Dupee (1990, p.&nbsp;IX) defines \"Steinese\" as \"gnomic, repetitive, illogical, sparsely punctuated... a scandal and a delight, lending itself equally to derisory parody and fierce denunciation\".\n\nComposer Constant Lambert (1936) compares Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" in ''L'Histoire du Soldat'' to Gertrude Stein's in \"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\" (1922), specifically: \"[E]veryday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday.\" He writes that the \"effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\", apparently missing the pun frequently employed by Stein.\n\n[[James Thurber]] wrote:\n{{quote |Anyone who reads at all diversely during these bizarre 1920s cannot escape the conclusion that a number of crazy men and women are writing stuff which remarkably passes for important composition among certain persons who should know better. Stuart P. Sherman, however, refused to be numbered among those who stand in awe and admiration of one of the most eminent of the idiots, Gertrude Stein. He reviews her ''Geography and Plays'' in the August 11 issue of the ''Literary Review'' of the ''New York Evening Post'' and arrives at the conviction that it is a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all.<ref>{{Citation | first = James | last = Thurber | author-link = James Thurber | title = Collecting Himself | editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Rosen}}</ref>}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''\"The interesting writer is where there is an adversary, a problem.

Wilson deemed that Stein's technique was one of flawed methodology, using words analogous to the way [[Cubists]] manipulated abstract forms in their artworks. As Wilson wrote, unlike the [[plastic arts]], literature deals with\n\n:\"human speech [which] is a tissue of ideas.&nbsp;...

Born in the [[Allegheny West (Pittsburgh)|Allegheny West]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh]] and raised in [[Oakland, California]], Stein moved to [[Paris]] in 1903, and made France her home for the remainder of her life. She hosted a Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]], where the leading figures of modernism in literature and art, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F.

Men dominated the medical field, and the inclusion of women in the profession was not unreservedly or unanimously welcomed. Writing of this period in her life (in ''Things As They Are'', 1903) Stein often revealed herself as a depressed young woman dealing with a paternalistic culture, struggling to find her own identity, which she realized could not conform to the conventional female role. Her uncorseted physical appearance and eccentric mode of dress aroused comment and she was described as \"Big and floppy and sandaled and not caring a damn\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/Stein-gertrude |encyclopedia=Jewish Women Encyclopedia |last=Simon |first=Linda |title=Gertrude Stein |access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |magazine=Style Magazine |last=Rudacille |first=Deborah |title=Baltimore Blues |access-date=October 17, 2012 |date= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528023126/http://www.baltimorestyle.com/index.php/style/features_article/fe_gertrude_stein_nov08/ |archive-date=May 28, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> According to Linda Wagner-Martin, Stein's \"controversial stance on women's medicine caused problems with the male faculty\" and contributed to her decision to leave without finishing her degree.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAsked to give a lecture to a group of Baltimore women in 1899, Stein gave a controversial speech titled \"The Value of College Education for Women\", undoubtedly designed to provoke the largely middle-class audience. In the lecture Stein maintained:\n\n{{quote|\"average middle class woman [supported by] some male relative, a husband or father or brother,...[is] not worth her keep economically considered.

Sometime in 1899 or 1900, she became infatuated with [[Mary Bookstaver]] who was involved in a relationship with a medical student, Mabel Haynes. Witnessing the relationship between the two women served for Stein as her \"erotic awakening\". The unhappy love triangle demoralized Stein, arguably contributing to her decision to abandon her medical studies.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> In 1902 Stein's brother [[Leo Stein]] left for [[London]], and Stein followed.

Here they accumulated the works of art that formed a collection that became renowned for its prescience and historical importance.\n\nThe gallery space was furnished with imposing [[Renaissance]]-era furniture from [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

The division of the Steins' art collection was described in a letter by Leo:\n\n{{quote |The C\u00e9zanne apples have a unique importance to me that nothing can replace.

It was, however, her brother Leo who was the astute art appraiser.

In 1932, Stein asserted: \"painting now after its great period has come back to be a minor art.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nIn 1945, in a preface for the first exhibition of Spanish painter [[Francisco Riba Rovira]] (who painted a portrait of her), Stein wrote:<blockquote>I explained that for me, all modern painting is based on what C\u00e9zanne nearly made, instead of basing itself on what he almost managed to make. When he could not make a thing, he hijacked it and left it. He insisted on showing his incapacity: he spread his lack of success: showing what he could not do, became an obsession for him. People influenced by him were also obsessed by the things which they could not reach and they began the system of camouflage. It was natural to do so, even inevitable: that soon became an art, in peace and in war, and Matisse concealed and insisted at the same time on that C\u00e9zanne could not realize, and Picasso concealed, played and tormented all these things.\n\nThe only one who wanted to insist on this problem, was Juan Gris. He persisted by deepening the things which C\u00e9zanne wanted to do, but it was too hard a task for him: it killed him. And now here we are, I find a young painter who does not follow the tendency to play with what C\u00e9zanne could not do, but who attacks any right the things which he tried to make, to create the objects which have to exist, for, and in themselves, and not in relation.<ref>Gertrude Stein. \"A la recherche d'un jeune peintre\", revue ''Fontaine'' no. 42, pp. 287\u2013288, 1945</ref><ref>Gertrude Stein. \"Looking for a young painter\" (Riba-Rovira) Yale University U.S.A.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==27 rue de Fleurus: The Stein salon==\n[[File:Plaque Gertrude Stein, 27 rue de Fleurus, Paris 6.jpg|thumb|Plaque at [[27 rue de Fleurus]]]]\nThe gatherings in the Stein home \"brought together confluences of talent and thinking that would help define modernism in literature and art\". Dedicated attendees included [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Gavin Williamson (harpsichordist)|Gavin Williamson]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Sherwood Anderson]], [[Francis Cyril Rose]], [[Bob Brown (writer, poet, publisher)|Bob Brown]], [[Ren\u00e9 Crevel]], [[\u00c9lisabeth de Gramont]], [[Francis Picabia]], [[Claribel Cone]], [[Mildred Aldrich]], [[Jane Peterson]], [[Carl Van Vechten]] and [[Henri Matisse]].<ref name=\"brbl-archive.library.yale.edu\"/> Saturday evenings had been set as the fixed day and time for formal congregation so Stein could work at her writing uninterrupted by impromptu visitors. It was Stein's partner Alice who became the de facto hostess for the wives and girlfriends of the artists in attendance, who met in a separate room.\n\nGertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, as people began visiting to see his paintings and those of C\u00e9zanne: \"Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began.\"<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 84.</ref>\n\nAmong Picasso's acquaintances who frequented the Saturday evenings were: [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]] (artist), [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] (artist), [[Max Jacob]] (poet), [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] (poet), [[Marie Laurencin]] (artist, and Apollinaire's mistress), [[Henri Rousseau]] (painter), and [[Joseph Stella]].<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 94\u201395.</ref>\n\nHemingway frequented Stein's salon, but the two had an uneven relationship. They began as close friends, with Hemingway admiring Stein as a mentor, but they later grew apart, especially after Stein called Hemingway \"yellow\" in ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas.''<ref name=\":0\" /> Upon the birth of his son, Hemingway asked Stein to be the godmother of his child.<ref name=\"Meyers1\">Meyers, Jeffrey - ''Hemingway: A Biography'', Macmillan, New York, 1985. {{ISBN|978-0-333-42126-0}}</ref> While Stein has been credited with inventing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" for those whose defining moment in time and coming of age had been World War I and its aftermath, there are at least three versions of the story that led to the phrase, two by Hemingway and one by Stein.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 273\u20134.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1931, Stein advised the young composer and writer [[Paul Bowles]] to go to [[Tangier]], where she and Alice had vacationed.\n\n==Literary style==\n[[File:Gertrude stein.jpg|thumb|right|[[Carl Van Vechten]], ''Portrait of Gertrude Stein'', 1934]]\nStein's writing can be placed in three categories: \"hermetic\" works best illustrated by ''[[The Making of Americans]]: The Hersland Family''; popularized writing such as ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''; and speech writing and more accessible autobiographical writing of later years, of which ''[[Brewsie and Willie]]'' is a good example. Her works include novels, plays, stories, [[libretti]] and poems written in a highly idiosyncratic, playful, repetitive, and humorous style. Typical quotes are: \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]\"; \"Out of kindness comes redness and out of rudeness comes rapid same question, out of an eye comes research, out of selection comes painful cattle\"; about her childhood home in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], \"There is no there there\"; and \"The change of color is likely and a difference a very little difference is prepared. Sugar is not a vegetable.\"\n\nThese [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] experiments, rhythmical essays or \"portraits\", were designed to evoke \"the excitingness of pure being\" and can be seen as literature's answer to visual art styles and forms such as [[Cubism]], plasticity, and [[collage]]. Many of the experimental works such as ''Tender Buttons'' have since been interpreted by critics as a [[feminist]] reworking of patriarchal language. These works were well received by avant-garde critics but did not initially achieve mainstream success. Despite Stein's work on \"[[automatic writing]]\" with [[William James]], she did not see her work as automatic, but as an 'excess of consciousness'.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThough Stein collected cubist paintings, especially those of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of [[C\u00e9zanne]]. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: \"the whole field of the canvas is important\" (p.&nbsp;8{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, \"Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered as much as any other.\" It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: \"The important thing is that you must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality.\"\n\nHer use of repetition is ascribed to her search for descriptions of the \"bottom nature\" of her characters, such as in ''The Making of Americans'' where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as \"As I was saying\" and \"There will be now a history of her.\" Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with \"too much association\". Social judgment is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide how to think and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nStein predominantly used the present progressive tense, creating a continuous present in her work, which Grahn argues is a consequence of the previous principles, especially commonality and centeredness. Grahn describes \"play\" as the granting of autonomy and agency to the readers or audience: \"rather than the [[psychological manipulation|emotional manipulation]] that is a characteristic of linear writing, Stein uses ''play''.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 18.</ref> In addition Stein's work is funny, and multilayered, allowing a variety of interpretations and engagements. Lastly Grahn argues that one must \"''inster''stand... engage with the work, to mix with it in an active engagement, rather than 'figuring it out.' Figure it in.\"<ref>[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]], p. 21.</ref> In 1932, using an accessible style to appeal to a wider audience, she wrote ''The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas''; the book would become her first best-seller. Despite the title, it was actually Stein's autobiography. The style was quite similar to that of ''The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook'', which was written by Toklas.\n\nSeveral of Stein's writings have been set to music by composers, including [[Virgil Thomson]]'s operas ''[[Four Saints in Three Acts]]'' and ''The Mother of Us All'', and [[James Tenney]]'s setting of ''Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose'' as a [[canon (music)|canon]] dedicated to [[Philip Corner]], beginning with \"a\" on an upbeat and continuing so that each repetition shuffles the words, e.g. \"a/rose is a rose/is a rose is/a rose is a/rose.\"\n\n==Literary career==\n[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|[[Pablo Picasso]], ''[[Portrait of Gertrude Stein]]'', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.

Her earliest writings were mainly retellings of her college experiences. Her first critically acclaimed publication was ''[[Three Lives (book)|Three Lives]]''. In 1911, [[Mildred Aldrich]] introduced Stein to [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] and they began a short-lived but fruitful friendship during which the wealthy Mabel Dodge promoted Gertrude's legend in the United States.\n\nMabel was enthusiastic about Stein's sprawling publication ''The Makings of Americans'' and, at a time when Stein had much difficulty selling her writing to publishers, privately published 300 copies of ''Portrait of Mabel Dodge at Villa Curonia''.<ref name=\"MoMA\"/> Dodge was also involved in the publicity and planning of the [[69th Infantry Regiment (New York)|69th Regiment]] [[Armory Show]] in 1913, \"the first avant-garde art exhibition in America\".<ref name=\"MoMA\"/>\n\nIn addition, she wrote the first critical analysis of Stein's writing to appear in America, in \"Speculations, or Post-Impressionists in Prose\", published in a special March 1913 publication of ''Arts and Decoration''.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\">[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 170.</ref> Foreshadowing Stein's later critical reception, Dodge wrote in \"Speculations\":\n\n{{quote |In Gertrude Stein's writing every word lives and, apart from concept, it is so exquisitely rhythmical and cadenced that if we read it aloud and receive it as pure sound, it is like a kind of sensuous music. Just as one may stop, for once, in a way, before a canvas of Picasso, and, letting one's reason sleep for an instant, may exclaim: \"It ''is'' a fine pattern!\" so, listening to Gertrude Stein's words and forgetting to try to understand what they mean, one submits to their gradual charm.<ref name=\"Mellow_170\"/>}}\n\nStein and [[Carl Van Vechten]], the noted critic and photographer, became acquainted in Paris in 1913. The two became lifelong friends, devising pet names for each other: Van Vechten was \"Papa Woojums\", and Stein, \"Baby Woojums\". Van Vechten served as an enthusiastic champion of Stein's literary work in the United States, in effect becoming her American agent.<ref name=\"brbl-archive.library.yale.edu\"/>\n\n===America (1934\u20131935)===\nIn October 1934, Stein arrived in America after a 30-year absence. Disembarking from the ocean liner in New York, she encountered a throng of reporters. Front-page articles on Stein appeared in almost every New York City newspaper. As she rode through Manhattan to her hotel, she was able to get a sense of the publicity that would hallmark her US tour. An electric sign in [[Times Square]] announced to all that \"Gertrude Stein Has Arrived\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/when-gertrude-stein-toured-america-105320781/ |title=When Gertrude Stein Toured America |date=October 14, 2011 |access-date=October 21, 2012}}</ref> Her six-month tour of the country encompassed 191 days of travel, criss-crossing 23 states and visiting 37 cities. Stein prepared her lectures for each stop-over in a formally structured way, and the audience was limited to five hundred attendees for each venue. She spoke, reading from notes, and provided for an audience question and answer period at the end of her presentation.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nStein's effectiveness as a lecture speaker received varying evaluations. At the time, some maintained that \"Stein's audiences by and large did not understand her lectures.\" Some of those in the psychiatric community weighed in, judging that Stein suffered from a [[speech disorder]], [[palilalia]], which caused her \"to stutter over words and phrases\". The predominant feeling, however, was that Stein was a compelling presence, a fascinating personality who had the ability to hold listeners with the \"musicality of her language\".<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\nIn Washington, D.C. Stein was invited to have tea with the President's wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. In [[Beverly Hills]], California, she visited actor and filmmaker [[Charlie Chaplin]], who reportedly discussed the future of cinema with her.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> Stein left America in May 1935, a newly minted American celebrity with a commitment from [[Random House]], who had agreed to become the American publisher for all of her future works.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/><ref>[[#Jaillant|Jaillant (2015)]]</ref> The ''[[Chicago Daily Tribune]]'' wrote after Stein's return to Paris: \"No writer in years has been so widely discussed, so much caricatured, so passionately championed.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/>\n\n===Books===\n====''Q.E.D''.====\nStein completed ''Q.E.D.'', her first novel, on October 24, 1903.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 53\u201358.</ref> One of the earliest [[coming out]] stories,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baughman|first1=Judith|title=Gertrude Stein|url=http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/BiographiesDetailsPage/BiographiesDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=true&displayGroupName=Biographies&currPage=&scanId=&query=&source=&prodId=BIC1&search_within_results=&p=BIC1&mode=view&catId=&u=loym48904&limiter=&display-query=&displayGroups=&contentModules=&action=e&sortBy=&documentId=GALE%7CK1602000898&windowstate=normal&activityType=&failOverType=&commentary=true|website=Biography in Context|publisher=Gale|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref> it is about a romantic affair involving Stein and her friends Mabel Haynes, Grace Lounsbury and [[Mary Bookstaver]], and occurred between 1897 and 1901 while she was studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore.<ref name=\"Blackmer 1995 pp. 681\">[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]], pp. 681\u20136.</ref> <!-- This story is discussed more completely later in this article in the section on \"Lesbian relationships\". -->\n\n====''Fernhurst'' (1904)====\nIn 1904 Stein began ''Fernhurst'', a fictional account of a scandalous three-person romantic affair involving a dean ([[M.

Stein described:\n\n{{cquote| that the stylistic method of ''(Three Lives)'' had been influenced by the C\u00e9zanne portrait under which she sat writing. The portrait of Madame C\u00e9zanne is one of the monumental examples of the artist's method, each exacting, carefully negotiated plane\u2014from the suave reds of the armchair and the gray blues of the sitter's jacket to the vaguely figured wallpaper of the background\u2014having been structured into existence, seeming to fix the subject for all eternity.

Soon after she purchased them from [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s gallery,<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], p. 209.</ref> the Great War began, Kahnweiler's stock was confiscated and he was not allowed to return to Paris. Gris, who before the war had entered a binding contract with Kahnweiler for his output, was left without income. Gertrude attempted to enter an ancillary arrangement in which she would forward Gris living expenses in exchange for future pictures. Stein and Toklas had plans to visit England to sign a contract for the publication of ''Three Lives'', to spend a few weeks there, and then journey to Spain. They left Paris on July 6, 1914 and returned on October 17.<ref>[[#Mellow|Mellow (1974)]], pp. 210\u20135.</ref> When Britain declared war on Germany, Stein and Toklas were visiting [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in England.

Stein is credited with bringing the term \"[[Lost Generation]]\" into use.]]\nDuring the 1930s, Stein and Toklas became famous with the 1933 mass market publication of ''[[The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas]]''. She and Alice had an extended lecture tour in the United States during this decade. They also spent several summers in the town of Bilignin, in the [[Ain]] district of eastern France situated in the picturesque region of the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. The two women doted on their beloved poodle named \"Basket\" whose successor, \"Basket II\", comforted Alice in the years after Gertrude's death.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Stein and Toklas relocated to a country home that they had rented for many years previously in Bilignin, [[Ain]], in the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] region. Gertrude and Alice, who were both Jewish, escaped persecution probably because of their friendship to [[Bernard Fa\u00ff]] who was a collaborator with the [[Vichy regime]] and had connections to the [[Gestapo]], or possibly because Gertrude was an American and a famous author. Gertrude's book \"Wars I Have Seen\" written before the German surrender and before the liberation of German concentration camps, likened the German army to [[Keystone cops]]. When Fa\u00ff was sentenced to hard labor for life after the war, Gertrude and Alice campaigned for his release. Several years later, Toklas would contribute money to Fa\u00ff's escape from prison. After the war, Stein was visited by many young American soldiers. The August 6, 1945 issue of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured a photo of Stein and American soldiers posing in front of Hitler's bunker in [[Berchtesgaden]]. They are all giving the Nazi salute and Stein is wearing the traditional Alpine cap, accompanied by the text: \"Off We All Went To See Germany.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{cite news |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/103918/barbara-will-gertrude-stein-christopher-benfey |work=The New Republic |last=Benfey |first=Christopher |title=The Alibi of Ambiguity |date=June 28, 2012 |access-date=October 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, a cabinet in the [[Yale University]] [[Beinecke Library]], which had been locked for an indeterminate number of years, was opened and found to contain some 300 love letters written by Stein and Toklas. They were made public for the first time, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Stein's endearment for Toklas was \"Baby Precious\", in turn Stein was for Toklas, \"Mr. Cuddle-Wuddle\".<ref name=\"poetryfoundation\" />\n\n===Lesbian relationships===\nStein is the author of one of the earliest [[coming out]] stories, \"''Q.E.D.''\" (published in 1950 as ''Things as They Are''), written in 1903 and suppressed by the author. The story, written during travels after leaving college, is based on a three-person romantic affair in which she became involved while studying at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]] in Baltimore. The affair was complicated, as Stein was less experienced with the social dynamics of [[romantic friendship]] as well as her own sexuality and any moral dilemmas regarding it. Stein maintained at the time that she detested \"passion in its many disguised forms\". The relationships of Stein's acquaintances Mabel Haynes and Grace Lounsbury ended as Haynes started one with [[Mary Bookstaver]] (also known as May Bookstaver). Stein became enamored of Bookstaver but was unsuccessful in advancing their relationship. Bookstaver, Haynes, and Lounsbury all later married men.<ref name=\"Blackmer 1995 pp. 681\"/>\n\nStein began to accept and define her pseudo-masculinity through the ideas of [[Otto Weininger]]'s ''Sex and Character'' (1906). Weininger, though [[Jewish]] by birth, considered Jewish men effeminate and women as incapable of selfhood and genius, except for female homosexuals who may approximate masculinity. As Stein equated genius with masculinity, her position as a female and an intellectual becomes difficult to synthesize and modern feminist interpretations of her work have been called into question.<ref name=Ramsay>Ramsay, Tamara Ann (1998).

Toklas]]. [[Ernest Hemingway]] describes how Alice was Gertrude's \"wife\" in that Stein rarely addressed his (Hemingway's) wife, and he treated Alice the same, leaving the two \"wives\" to chat.<ref name=\"Grahn\">[[#Grahn|Grahn (1989)]]</ref>\n\nThe more affirming essay \"Miss Furr and Miss Skeene\" is one of the first [[lesbian literature|homosexual revelation stories]] to be published. The work, like ''Q.E.D.'', is informed by Stein's growing involvement with a homosexual community,<ref name=\"Grahn\"/> though it is based on lesbian partners Maud Hunt Squire and Ethel Mars.<ref name=\"Blackmer\">[[#Blackmer|Blackmer (1995)]]</ref> The work contains the word \"[[gay]]\" over 100 times, perhaps the first published use of the word \"gay\" in reference to same-sex relationships and those who have them,<ref name = \"Blackmer\" /> and, thus, uninformed readers missed the lesbian content. A similar essay of homosexual men begins more obviously with the line \"Sometimes men are kissing\" but is less well known.<ref name=\"Blackmer\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Tender buttons: objects, food, rooms|Tender Buttons]]'' Stein comments on lesbian sexuality and the work abounds with \"highly condensed layers of public and private meanings\" created by wordplay including puns on the words \"box\", \"cow\", and in titles such as \"tender buttons\".<ref name=\"Blackmer\"/>\n\n{{anchor|nothere}}\n\n==\"There is no there there\"==\nAlong with Stein's widely known \"[[Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose]]\"<ref>Cf. Natias Neutert about Gertrude Stein's Rose\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzrmmZmPZVw</ref> quotation, \"there is no there there\" is also one of her most famous. It appears in ''Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography'' (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated what she really meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the farmland had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). \n\nStein wrote:\n\n{{quote |She took us to see her granddaughter who was teaching in the Dominican convent in San Raphael, we went across the bay on a ferry, that had not changed but Goat Island might just as well not have been there, anyway what was the use of my having come from Oakland it was not natural to have come from there yes write about it if I like or anything if I like but not there, there is no there there.<ref>{{cite web|author=Stefan Metaal |url=http://members.chello.nl/smetaal/usu1.htm |title=No There there |publisher=Members.chello.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref>\n\n...but not there, there is no there there. ...

When you live there you know it so well that it is like an identity a thing that is so much a thing that it could not ever be any other thing and then you live somewhere else and years later, the address that was so much an address that it was like your name and you said it as if it was not an address but something that was living and then years after you do not know what the address was and when you say it is not a name anymore but something you cannot remember.

We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. There is no reason why we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance. But if we shut down on immigration completely we shall become stagnant. The French may not like the competition of foreigners, but they let them in. They accept the challenge and derive the stimulus.

She was outspoken in her hostility to some liberal reforms of progressive politics. To Stein, the [[industrial revolution]] had acted as a negative societal force, disrupting stability, degrading values, and subsequently affecting cultural decline. Stein idealized the 18th century as the golden age of civilization, epitomized in America as the era of its founding fathers and what was in France, the glory of its pre-revolutionary [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |last=Will |first=Barbara |journal=Humanities |title=The Strange Politics of Gertrude Stein |date=March\u2013April 2012 |volume=33 |number=2 |access-date=October 14, 2012 |url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2012/marchapril/feature/the-strange-politics-gertrude-stein}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/gertrude-stein-why-her-fascist-politics-matter/ |last=Herschthal |first=Eric |title=Gertrude Stein: Why Her Fascist Politics Matter |work=The Jewish Week |date=April 24, 2012 |access-date=October 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180522043309/http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/gertrude-stein-why-her-fascist-politics-matter/ |archive-date=May 22, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> At the same time, she was pro-immigrant, pro-democratic, and anti-patriarchal.<ref>Christopher Sawyer-Laucanno, ''\"Courage to Be Courageous\": The Last Works and Days of Gertrude Stein'', from ''The Continual Pilgrimage: American Writers in Paris, 1944\u20131960''Grove Presm 1992</ref> Her last major work was the [[libretto]] of the feminist opera ''[[The Mother of Us All]]'' (1947) about the socially progressive suffragette movement and another work from this time, ''Brewsie and Willie'' (1946), expressed strong support for American G.I.s.\n\nA compendium of source material confirms that Stein may have been able to save her life and sustain her lifestyle through the protection of powerful [[Vichy government]] official [[Bernard Fa\u00ff]]. Stein had met Fa\u00ff in 1926, and he became her \"dearest friend during her life\", according to Alice B. Toklas. Fa\u00ff had been the primary translator of Stein's work into French and subsequently masterminded her 1933\u201334 American book tour, which gave Stein celebrity status and proved to be a highly successful promotion of her memoir, ''The Autobiography of Alice B.

She writes of the high esteem in which P\u00e9tain is held by his countrymen; France respected and admired the man who had struck an armistice with Hitler.

Then she said again--What is the question and before I could speak she went on--If there is no question then there is no answer.}}\n\nStein's biographers have naturally selected the superior \"in that case what is the question?\" version. Strong narratives win out over weak ones when no obstacle of factuality stands in their way. What Stein actually said remains unknown. That Toklas cited the lesser version in a letter of 1953 is suggestive but not conclusive.<ref>Malcolm, Janet, \"Someone Says Yes to It,\" ''The New Yorker'' 81/17 (June 13, 2005): 148</ref>}} Stein named writer and photographer [[Carl Van Vechten]] as her [[literary executor]], and he helped to publish works of hers that remained unpublished at the time of her death.

Here is one artist who has been able to accept ridicule, who has even forgone the privilege of writing the great American novel, uplifting our English speaking stage, and wearing the bays of the great poets to go live among the little housekeeping words, the swaggering bullying street-corner words, the honest working, money saving words and all the other forgotten and neglected citizens of the sacred and half forgotten city.}}\n\nIn a private letter to his brother Karl, Anderson said, \"As for Stein, I do not think her too important. I do think she had an important thing to do, not for the public, but for the artist who happens to work with words as his material.{{Sfn | Mellow | 1974 | p = 260}}\"\n\nOther critics took a more negative view of Stein's work. F. W. Dupee (1990, p.&nbsp;IX) defines \"Steinese\" as \"gnomic, repetitive, illogical, sparsely punctuated... a scandal and a delight, lending itself equally to derisory parody and fierce denunciation\".\n\nComposer Constant Lambert (1936) compares Stravinsky's choice of \"the drabbest and least significant phrases\" in ''L'Histoire du Soldat'' to Gertrude Stein's in \"Helen Furr and Georgine Skeene\" (1922), specifically: \"[E]veryday they were gay there, they were regularly gay there everyday.\" He writes that the \"effect would be equally appreciated by someone with no knowledge of English whatsoever\", apparently missing the pun frequently employed by Stein.\n\n[[James Thurber]] wrote:\n{{quote |Anyone who reads at all diversely during these bizarre 1920s cannot escape the conclusion that a number of crazy men and women are writing stuff which remarkably passes for important composition among certain persons who should know better. Stuart P. Sherman, however, refused to be numbered among those who stand in awe and admiration of one of the most eminent of the idiots, Gertrude Stein. He reviews her ''Geography and Plays'' in the August 11 issue of the ''Literary Review'' of the ''New York Evening Post'' and arrives at the conviction that it is a marvellous and painstaking achievement in setting down approximately 80,000 words which mean nothing at all.<ref>{{Citation | first = James | last = Thurber | author-link = James Thurber | title = Collecting Himself | editor-first = Michael | editor-last = Rosen}}</ref>}}\n{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=right|quote=''\"The interesting writer is where there is an adversary, a problem.

Wilson deemed that Stein's technique was one of flawed methodology, using words analogous to the way [[Cubists]] manipulated abstract forms in their artworks. As Wilson wrote, unlike the [[plastic arts]], literature deals with\n\n:\"human speech [which] is a tissue of ideas.&nbsp;... Miss Stein no longer understands the conditions under which literary effects have to be produced&nbsp;... There is sometimes genuine music in the most baffling of her works, but there are rarely any communicated emotions.\"<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879\">Wilson, Edmund, \"A Guide to Gertrude Stein\", ''Vanity Fair'', September 1923, ''Literary Essays and Reviews of the 1920s & 1930s'', Library of America, 2007, p. 878\u2013879</ref>\n\nAn elevated observer, perched high above everything below, he likened Stein to a self-conceived \"[[Buddha]]...registering impressions like some august seismograph\".<ref name=\"Wilson, Edmund 1923, p. 878-879\"/>\n\nStein's literary output was a subject of amusement for her brother Leo Stein, who characterized her writing as an \"abomination\". Later detractors of Stein's work deemed her experimentation as the serendipitous result of her alleged inability to communicate through linguistic convention, deficient in the skills required \"to deal effectively with language, so that she made her greatest weakness into her most remarkable strength\".<ref name=\"Benstock, Shari 1987\"/>\n\nIn his 1938 biographical novel ''[[The Green Fool]],'' Irish poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]] describes the works of Gertrude Stein fondly as being \"like whisky to me; her strange rhythms broke up the clich\u00e9 formation of my thought.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kavanagh|first=Patrick|title=The Green Fool|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1975|isbn=0-14-004005-6|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|pages=244}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy and commemoration==\nStein has been the subject of many artistic works.\n\nIn the 1998 Latin American literary classic ''Yo-Yo Boing!'', novelist [[Giannina Braschi]] pays homage to Stein as an imaginary mentor.\n\nIn 2005, playwright/actor [[Jade Esteban Estrada]] portrayed Stein in the solo musical ''ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 1'' at [[Princeton University]].

In April 1595 and in 1597 he raided [[Tynedale]] in England with a 100 or 1,000 men. They killed at least 30 residents, and burnt houses at Thorneburn, Donkleywood, Stokoe, Hordley Hill House and others including the home of a widow, Catherine Dodd of Bruntbank, and caused damage valued at \u00a3191, and killed four members of the Charlton family at Bought Hill (now [[Charlton, Northumberland]]).<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 525-6.</ref>\n\nAs Keeper of Liddesdale he rescued [[Kinmont Willie Armstrong]] from prison in Carlisle, an exploit famous in [[Border country|border]] lore.

He was taken to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and imprisoned in [[Carlisle Castle]]. Buccleuch, as Keeper of Liddesdale, petitioned the English Warden [[Scrope|Sir Thomas Scrope]] for Armstrong\u2019s release without success. Unable to release Armstrong by diplomatic means, on the night of 13 April 1596 Buccleuch led a party of about eighty men to Carlisle.  Leaving the main body of his men a small distance outside the city to ambush any pursuers, Buccleuch took a small raiding party on to the castle where Armstrong was imprisoned. Finding their ladders too short to scale the walls, the raiding party breached a postern gate \u2014 or more probably bribed a contact inside the castle to open it for them \u2014 located Armstrong\u2019s cell and freed him, returning him back across the Scottish border. No fatalities were occasioned on either side.\n\nThe raid on Carlisle created a diplomatic incident between [[England]] and Scotland, and war between the two nations appeared imminent until Buccleuch surrendered himself to the English authorities.

Online racing is also featured in the game. The game has been described as different from the \"Prologue\" titles seen in the past in the series and features more content. Unlike ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'' and ''[[Gran Turismo 6]]'', the game does not feature a dynamic weather system or day-night cycle. However, players still have the option to modify the race's time of day before entering the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2016/05/30/gt-sport-drops-dynamic-weather-and-time/|title=GT Sport drops dynamic weather and time|first=Shabana|last=Arif|work=[[VG247]]|date=30 May 2016|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref> It includes 324 cars<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gran-turismo.com/de/products/gtsport/carlist/|title=Carlist|website=gran-turismo.com|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> and 82 configurations in 32 locations to race on as of December 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Product information|url=https://www.gran-turismo.com/de/products/gtsport/|website=gran-turismo.com|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time in the series, the game features [[Porsche]] vehicles included in the game after [[Electronic Arts]]' licensing rights to the Porsche brand had expired (previous ''Gran Turismo'' games only included [[Ruf Automobile|Ruf]] as a substitute).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gtplanet.net/porsche-officially-confirmed-for-gran-turismo-sport/|date=11 April 2017 |title=Porsche Officially Confirmed for Gran Turismo Sport |url-status=live |accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport Mode ===\nSport Mode consists of three daily races that reset every week. Drivers are assigned a Driver Rating (DR) and a Sportsmanship Rating (SR). The highest generally available levels are A+ for Driver Rating, and S for Sportsmanship Rating, with the lowest being E for both.

Yet, conversely, this is possibly the most focused, directly enjoyable game Polyphony Digital has put out since the heady days of ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''.\" Robinson praised the improved sound design and addition of a livery editor and GT Auto, now part of update, that allow players to create their own designs online.<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Martin |date=26 January 2016 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-17-gran-turismo-sport-review |title=Gran Turismo Sport review |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> The website later ranked the game 21st on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\".<ref>{{cite web |date=28 December 2017 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-28-eurogamers-top-50-games-of-2017-30-21 |title=Eurogamer's Top 50 Games of 2017: 30-21 |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[IGN]] likewise noted that ''GT Sport''{{'}}s garage and track selection is smaller when compared to other racing games, a decision they found impossible to forgive, but described the shift to online racing as serious, sensible, and well-structured. \"That PvP online environment, or Sport Mode as its dubbed, is where developer Polyphony Digital has gambled all its chips. The good news is that it has indeed created a sturdy online racing venue.\" Luke Reilly observed the introduction of a Sportsmanship Rating that, over time, separates poor drivers from good ones, and while less than perfect \"rewards clean sectors, fair overtakes, and respectful racing.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nRay Carsillo of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' considered the game to be visually gorgeous and thought the cars handled well, \"easily the strongest aspect of the game\", but was scathing in his assessment of the always online approach to play. \"If you don't play the game online, you can't save the game, and most of the games features\u2013only single arcade races are available offline\u2013are locked away.\" Carsillo awarded the game a 6/10 concluding it will disappoint anyone hoping for a more traditional ''Gran Turismo'' experience.<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\nJason Faulkner of [[Game Revolution]] was equally critical of the game, devoting a large portion of his review to observing the differences between ''GT Sport'' and racing games of rival color. \"You'll get a lot more feeling of the weight of the cars as you drive them in this game than you do in ''Forza'', but there's still something lacking when compared to ''[[Project Cars 2]]''.\" While the cars are stunningly recreated with excellent handling, Faulkner said there simply aren't enough of them, especially when contrasted with the two aforementioned titles. \"The track list is sparse as well. There are only 17 locations available in GT Sport, with variations bringing the total number of circuits up to 40.\" Faulkner lamented the loss of single-player content in favor of ''GT Sport''{{'}}s new online mode, which no matter how well crafted, would be unavailable when not connected to the servers.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/>\n\nJustin Towell of [[GamesRadar]] awarded ''GT Sport'' 4/5, citing superb tracks, solid controls and incredible handling nuance across a range of high powered vehicles. Towell said that although the game continues to offer an educational single player experience with a collection of scenarios to overcome, it's somewhat \"pedestrian\" and not a patch on ''[[Forza Motorsport 7|Forza 7]]''{{'}}s career mode. Instead, the central pillar of ''GT Sport'', and the game's main selling point, are the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-recognised online game modes: \"Winning a slipstreaming race around an oval against real opponents is far more exciting than any offline mode. And with the real-world calendar of events taking place at set times, it all feels like it really ''means'' something.\" Towell noted the inconvenience that can arise when players lose internet connection but presumed the measure was \"to keep an eye on cheaters\".<ref name=\"GRadar\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Reader's Choice Best of 2017 Awards, the game came in second place for

However, players still have the option to modify the race's time of day before entering the race.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2016/05/30/gt-sport-drops-dynamic-weather-and-time/|title=GT Sport drops dynamic weather and time|first=Shabana|last=Arif|work=[[VG247]]|date=30 May 2016|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref> It includes 324 cars<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gran-turismo.com/de/products/gtsport/carlist/|title=Carlist|website=gran-turismo.com|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> and 82 configurations in 32 locations to race on as of December 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Product information|url=https://www.gran-turismo.com/de/products/gtsport/|website=gran-turismo.com|accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time in the series, the game features [[Porsche]] vehicles included in the game after [[Electronic Arts]]' licensing rights to the Porsche brand had expired (previous ''Gran Turismo'' games only included [[Ruf Automobile|Ruf]] as a substitute).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gtplanet.net/porsche-officially-confirmed-for-gran-turismo-sport/|date=11 April 2017 |title=Porsche Officially Confirmed for Gran Turismo Sport |url-status=live |accessdate=11 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport Mode ===\nSport Mode consists of three daily races that reset every week. Drivers are assigned a Driver Rating (DR) and a Sportsmanship Rating (SR). The highest generally available levels are A+ for Driver Rating, and S for Sportsmanship Rating, with the lowest being E for both. There is also a special S Driver Rating reserved for players ranked in the top 200 worldwide. Car performance within each category is equalized using Balance of Performance adjustments to weight and power. \n\n==== FIA Gran Turismo Online Championship ====\n{{Main|FIA-Certified Gran Turismo Championships}}\n''Gran Turismo Sport'' also features two championships held simultaneously throughout the year: the Nations Cup, where players represent their country, and the Manufacturers Cup, where players represent their favorite car manufacturer. The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] manages the series directly as they would with any of their other race series. The winners of the championships are honored at the FIA's annual prize-giving ceremony in Paris.<ref name=\"GTSport\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/products/gtsport/|title=Gran Turismo Sport|website=Granturismo.com|date=27 October 2015|accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe winner of the inaugural FIA GT Sport Nations Cup in 2018 was Americas regional champion [[Igor Fraga]] (Brazil, IOF_RACING17).

X - Concept cars (including ''Vision Gran Turismo'' cars), as well as every other car that does not fit into any of the above categories (such as [[electric car]]s, [[safety car]]s, and [[track day]] cars)\n\n=== PlayStation VR support ===\n''Gran Turismo Sport'' was originally announced to be fully compatible with [[Sony Interactive Entertainment|Sony]]'s virtual reality headset, [[PlayStation VR]].

Yet, conversely, this is possibly the most focused, directly enjoyable game Polyphony Digital has put out since the heady days of ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''.\" Robinson praised the improved sound design and addition of a livery editor and GT Auto, now part of update, that allow players to create their own designs online.<ref>{{cite web |last=Robinson |first=Martin |date=26 January 2016 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-17-gran-turismo-sport-review |title=Gran Turismo Sport review |website=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> The website later ranked the game 21st on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\".<ref>{{cite web |date=28 December 2017 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-28-eurogamers-top-50-games-of-2017-30-21 |title=Eurogamer's Top 50 Games of 2017: 30-21 |website=Eurogamer |accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[IGN]] likewise noted that ''GT Sport''{{'}}s garage and track selection is smaller when compared to other racing games, a decision they found impossible to forgive, but described the shift to online racing as serious, sensible, and well-structured. \"That PvP online environment, or Sport Mode as its dubbed, is where developer Polyphony Digital has gambled all its chips. The good news is that it has indeed created a sturdy online racing venue.\" Luke Reilly observed the introduction of a Sportsmanship Rating that, over time, separates poor drivers from good ones, and while less than perfect \"rewards clean sectors, fair overtakes, and respectful racing.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/>\n\nRay Carsillo of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' considered the game to be visually gorgeous and thought the cars handled well, \"easily the strongest aspect of the game\", but was scathing in his assessment of the always online approach to play. \"If you don't play the game online, you can't save the game, and most of the games features\u2013only single arcade races are available offline\u2013are locked away.\" Carsillo awarded the game a 6/10 concluding it will disappoint anyone hoping for a more traditional ''Gran Turismo'' experience.<ref name=\"EGM\"/>\n\nJason Faulkner of [[Game Revolution]] was equally critical of the game, devoting a large portion of his review to observing the differences between ''GT Sport'' and racing games of rival color. \"You'll get a lot more feeling of the weight of the cars as you drive them in this game than you do in ''Forza'', but there's still something lacking when compared to ''[[Project Cars 2]]''.\" While the cars are stunningly recreated with excellent handling, Faulkner said there simply aren't enough of them, especially when contrasted with the two aforementioned titles. \"The track list is sparse as well. There are only 17 locations available in GT Sport, with variations bringing the total number of circuits up to 40.\" Faulkner lamented the loss of single-player content in favor of ''GT Sport''{{'}}s new online mode, which no matter how well crafted, would be unavailable when not connected to the servers.<ref name=\"GameRev\"/>\n\nJustin Towell of [[GamesRadar]] awarded ''GT Sport'' 4/5, citing superb tracks, solid controls and incredible handling nuance across a range of high powered vehicles. Towell said that although the game continues to offer an educational single player experience with a collection of scenarios to overcome, it's somewhat \"pedestrian\" and not a patch on ''[[Forza Motorsport 7|Forza 7]]''{{'}}s career mode. Instead, the central pillar of ''GT Sport'', and the game's main selling point, are the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]]-recognised online game modes: \"Winning a slipstreaming race around an oval against real opponents is far more exciting than any offline mode. And with the real-world calendar of events taking place at set times, it all feels like it really ''means'' something.\" Towell noted the inconvenience that can arise when players lose internet connection but presumed the measure was \"to keep an eye on cheaters\".<ref name=\"GRadar\"/>\n\nIn ''[[Game Informer]]''{{'}}s Reader's Choice Best of 2017 Awards, the game came in second place for

In London he was a King's Serjeant and then a justice of the common pleas in 1426<ref>Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/717; Year 1440; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no717/bCP40no717dorses/IMG_1902.htm; 4th entry as defendant against John Fastolf, knight</ref> by his wife Joan, daughter of Nicholas Orrell.  He was appointed [[High Sheriff of Yorkshire]] in 1446, 1453, and 1469 and was [[Yorkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|returned for the county]] to the parliaments of 1449 and 1460 and 1461\u20132.\n\nA [[Yorkist]], he fought at the [[First battle of St Albans|1st battle of St Albans]] in 1455, [[Battle of Blore Heath|Blore Heath]] in 1459, and [[Battle of Wakefield|Wakefield]] in 1460.  His career was informative during that year, at the start of which in March the Lancastrians confirmed his post as High Sheriff of the North Riding. His previous conduct might have hinted at other allegiances for in 1459 the king appointed a northern embassy to Scotland, but Strangeways refused to travel.  That summer Edward, Earl of March, headed a Yorkist invasion force that marched into the Midlands. On 30 July 1460 they decisively defeated the King's army.  But by that time the administration had already removed Strangeways from his post.  The parliament of October 1460 was almost wholly Yorkist.  \n\nStrangeways was returned for Yorkshire with his brother-in-law, the other 'knight of the shire', Sir Thomas Montford.  Reappointed as a JP of the North Riding, he rode with the Yorkist nobles into southern Yorkshire to arrest and imprison the Lancastrian knights there.  Strangeways made extensive use of an arbitrary piece of law ''Scandalum magnatum'' widely abused by the Yorkist regime.  It enabled the arrest for just cause for uttering alleged falsehoods, and artisans who breached patent laws in manufacture.  Its application was generalised by court officials.   When Somerset's army defeated and killed the duke of York at Wakefield at the end of the year the earl of March was not present.  It is likely Strangeways was captured but released by Edward when he was reported as killed at the [[Battle of Towton|Towton]] on 10 May 1461.  He was immediately reinstated as JP for West Riding with his son as JP for North Riding.  He was charged by the charismatic soldier-king to find and imprison leading Lancastrian rebels.  Dr [[John Morton (cardinal)|John Morton]] and [[Sir John Conyers]] were leading members of Henry VI's affinity.  Morton was a former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a senior court official.  Conyers\u2019 wife was a co-heiress to the Darcy fortune into which Strangeways had married.  This was taxation by stealth, later known as Morton's Fork, one of Edward's cunning dynastic devices.  The Commission of [[Oyer et Terminer]] was a [[State Trial]] that aimed at the truth about bringing lawless opponents of the regime to book through summary procedures.  King Edward thanked his faithful [[Retainer (medieval)|retainer]] after his great victories of 1461 when the Yorkist army marched into London to announce a new reign.  Edward was generous to his friends, but wrathful to those who were disloyal.\n\nStrangeways' fealty was rewarded with [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] in the first parliament of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] which met in November 1461.<ref>''Official Return of Members of Parliament'', I, 340, 356, App.XXIV.; J.S. Roskell, ''Parliaments and Politics in Late Medieval England'', II, 279.</ref> For the first time in English history the speaker addressed the king, immediately after his presentation and allowance, in a long speech reviewing the state of affairs and recapitulating the history of the civil war. The parliament transacted hardly any business other than numerous [[acts of attainder]] against [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]]. It was prorogued to 6 May 1462 and then dissolved. Strangeways, who was paid 200 marks for being a 'diligent' Speaker, then served on various commissions for the defence of the kingdom and suppression of rebellions.  He also sat regularly on the commissions of the peace for the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire.  \n\nWith the death of the Earl of Salisbury, Strangeways drew closer to the Neville faction and  [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Warwick the Kingmaker]] from 1463 onwards.  He remained a northerner at heart in the fastness of Yorkshire dominated by the Neville family and its castles.<ref>J.S. Roskell, The Speakers in the Commons and House of Parliament, 1376-1523, MUP, 1965, p.271.</ref> He held the powerful position of Chief Justice of Durham Palatinate in the Yorkist interest until the [[Readeption]].  Sir James\u2019 second marriage was to Elizabeth Eure.  An ancient Norman family, de Eure could trace their lineage through the Plantagenets, securing Strangeways immortality among the noble elites.<ref name=\"Richardson 2011 128\"/> The Yorkist administration asked Strangeways to visit Scotland twice on embassy.  Edward was eager to secure a mutual and profitable peace in 1464 and 1466.  On the latter occasion the Scots\u2019 delegation met Sir James and others, including his eldest son and heir, Sir Richard at New Castle on the River Tyne.  His second wife made Sir James join the [[Guild of Corpus Christi]] of York to atone by religious devotions.<ref>B.Skaife, ''Register of the Guild of Corpus Christi in the City of York'', Surtees Society, 75 (1872), 75</ref>\n\nHe died in 1480 (or 1516<ref name=\"NDB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Strangeways, James}}</ref>), and was buried in the [[Southwark Cathedral|abbey church of St. Mary Overy's]], [[Southwark]].\n\n==Family==\nHe had married twice; firstly Elizabeth Darcy (1417\u201361), daughter of [[Baron Darcy de Knayth|Sir Philip Darcy, 6th Baron Darcy of Knayth]], with whom he had at least 11 sons and four daughters<ref>{{ODNBweb|id=26642|title=Strangways, Sir James|first=Julian|last=Lock}}</ref> including Robert Strangeways<ref name=\"Richardson 2011 128\">{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Douglas|title=Magna Carta ancestry : a study in colonial and medieval families, Vol IV|year=2011|publisher=Douglas Richardson.|location=Salt Lake City, UT.|isbn=9781460992708|page=128|edition=2nd }}</ref> whose daughter, Joan Strangeways, married Christopher Boynton, son of Sir Christopher Boynton (died 1452) of Sedbury,<ref>{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Douglas|title=Magna Carta ancestry : a study in colonial and medieval families, Vol IV|year=2011|publisher=Douglas Richardson.|location=Salt Lake City, UT.|isbn=9781460992708|page=189|edition=2nd }}</ref> and was buried at [[St Mary's Church, South Cowton]].

{"title_page": "Action at a distance", "text_new": "{{Distinguish|Action (physics)}}\n{{For|the anti-pattern in computer science|Action at a distance (computer programming)}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''action at a distance''' is the concept that an object can be moved, changed, or otherwise affected without being physically touched (as in mechanical contact) by another object. That is, it is the nonlocal interaction of objects that are separated in space.\n\nThis term was used most often in the context of early theories of [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]] to describe how an object responds to the influence of distant objects. For example, [[Coulomb's law]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] are such early theories.\n\nMore generally \"action at a distance\" describes the failure of early [[atomism|atomistic]] and [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic theories]] which sought to reduce all physical interaction to collision. The exploration and resolution of this problematic phenomenon led to significant developments in physics, from the concept of a field, to descriptions of [[quantum entanglement]] and the [[gauge boson|mediator particles]] of the [[Standard Model]].<ref name=\"Hesse\">{{cite journal |title=Action at a Distance in Classical Physics |journal=Isis |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=337\u2013353 |author=Hesse, Mary B. |authorlink=Mary Hesse |jstor=227576 |date=December 1955 |doi=10.1086/348429 }}</ref>\n\n==Electricity and magnetism==\nPhilosopher [[William of Ockham]] discussed action at a distance to explain [[magnetism]] and the ability of the Sun to heat the Earth's atmosphere without affecting the intervening space.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tachau |first=Katherine H. |title=Vision and Certitude in the Age of Ockham: Optics, Epistemology, and the Foundations of Semantics, 1250\u20131345 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=9004085521 |p=133}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to account for action at a distance in the theory of electromagnetism led to the development of the concept of a [[field (physics)|field]] which mediated interactions between currents and charges across empty space. According to field theory, we account for the [[Coulomb]] (electrostatic) interaction between charged particles through the fact that charges produce around themselves an [[electric field]], which can be felt by other charges as a force. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] directly addressed the subject of action-at-a-distance in chapter 23 of his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1873.<ref>[[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] (1873) [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00maxwgoog A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism], pages 426\u2013438, link from [[Internet Archive]]</ref> He began by reviewing the explanation of [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|Amp\u00e8re's formula]] given by [[Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]]. On page 437 he indicates the physicists' disgust with action at a distance. In 1845 Gauss wrote to Weber desiring \"action, not instantaneous, but propagated in time in a similar manner to that of light\". This aspiration was developed by Maxwell with the theory of an [[electromagnetic field]] described by [[Maxwell's equations]], which used the field to elegantly account for all electromagnetic interactions, as well as light (which, until then, had been seen as a completely unrelated phenomenon). In Maxwell's theory, the field is its own physical entity, carrying momenta and energy across space, and action-at-a-distance is only the apparent effect of local interactions of charges with their surrounding field.\n\nElectrodynamics was later described without fields (in [[Minkowski space]])  as the direct interaction of particles with [[Lightlike#Causal structure|lightlike]] separation vectors.{{Dubious|date=August 2015}} This resulted in the Fokker-Tetrode-Schwarzschild action integral. This kind of electrodynamic theory is often called \"direct interaction\" to distinguish it from field theories where action at a distance is mediated by a localized field (localized in the sense that its dynamics are determined by the nearby field parameters).<ref>Barut, A. O. \"Electrodynamics and Classical Theory of Fields and Particles\"</ref> This description of electrodynamics, in contrast with Maxwell's theory, explains apparent action at a distance not by postulating a mediating entity (a field) but by appealing to the natural geometry of special relativity.\n\nDirect interaction electrodynamics is explicitly symmetrical in time and avoids the infinite energy predicted in the field immediately surrounding point particles.  Feynman and Wheeler have shown that it can account for radiation and [[radiative damping]] (which had been considered strong evidence for the independent existence of the field). However, various proofs, beginning with that of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], have shown that direct interaction theories (under reasonable assumptions) do not admit [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations (these are the so-called [[No Interaction Theorems]]). Also significant is the measurement and theoretical description of the [[Lamb shift]]  which strongly suggests that charged particles interact with their own field.  Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in [[Quantum Field Theory]] and [[Modern physics]] has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.\n\n==Gravity==\n{{Main article|Speed of gravity}}\n\n===Newton===\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. <!--Newton had shown mathematically that if the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous, [[angular momentum]] is not conserved,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and--> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a [[Euclidean geometry]].) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008).<ref name=\"sep-qm-action-distance\"/>\n\nA related question, raised by [[Ernst Mach]], was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe.

If one of the interacting objects were to suddenly be displaced from its position, the other object would feel its influence instantaneously, meaning information had been transmitted faster than the [[speed of light]].\n\nOne of the conditions that a relativistic theory of gravitation must meet is that gravity is mediated with a speed that does not exceed {{math|'''''c'''''}}, the speed of light in a vacuum. From the previous success of electrodynamics, it was foreseeable that the relativistic theory of gravitation would have to use the concept of a [[Field (physics)|field]], or something similar.\n\nThis has been achieved by Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], in which gravitational interaction is mediated by deformation of space-time geometry. Matter warps the geometry of space-time, and these effects are\u2014as with electric and magnetic fields\u2014propagated at the speed of light. Thus, in the presence of matter, space-time becomes [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]], resolving the apparent conflict between Newton's proof of the conservation of angular momentum and Einstein's theory of [[special relativity]].\n\nMach's question regarding the bulging of rotating bodies is resolved because local space-time geometry is informing a rotating body about the rest of the universe. In Newton's theory of motion, space acts on objects, but is not acted upon. In Einstein's theory of motion, matter acts upon space-time geometry, deforming it; and space-time geometry acts upon matter, by affecting the behavior of [[geodesic]]s.\n\nAs a consequence, and unlike the classical theory, general relativity predicts that accelerating masses emit [[gravitational wave]]s, i.e. disturbances in the curvature of spacetime that propagate outward at lightspeed.

Whether or not this is interpreted as evidence for [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] depends on one's [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].\n\nNon-standard interpretations of quantum mechanics vary in their response to the EPR-type experiments. The [[Bohm interpretation]] gives an explanation based on nonlocal hidden variables for the correlations seen in entanglement. Many advocates of the [[many-worlds interpretation]] argue that it can explain these correlations in a way that does not require a violation of locality,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rubin |title=Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics |year=2001 |pages=301\u2013322 |volume=14 |journal=Found.

What happens in entanglement is that a measurement on one entangled particle yields a random result, then a later measurement on another particle in the same entangled (shared) quantum state must always yield a value correlated with the first measurement. Since no force, work, or information is communicated (the first measurement is random), the [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|speed of light]] limit does not apply (see [[Quantum entanglement]] and [[Bell test experiments]]). In the standard [[Copenhagen interpretation]], as discussed above, entanglement demonstrates a genuine [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal effect]] of quantum mechanics, but does not communicate information, either quantum or classical.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dynamism (metaphysics)]]\n* [[Einstein's thought experiments]]\n* [[Interaction-free measurement]]\n* [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy]]\n* [[Quantum teleportation]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{Free-content attribution\n\n| title = Newton\u2019s action at a distance \u2013 Different views\n\n| author = Nicolae Sfetcu\n\n| documentURL = https://www.setthings.com/en/newtons-action-at-a-distance-different-views/\n\n| license = CC-BY-SA\n\n}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Juan Yin and others (2013) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0614 Bounding the speed of \"Spooky Action at a Distance']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Action At A Distance (Physics)}}\n[[Category:Interaction|Action at a distance]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|Action (physics)}}\n{{For|the anti-pattern in computer science|Action at a distance (computer programming)}}\n\nIn [[physics]], '''action at a distance''' is the concept that an object can be moved, changed, or otherwise affected without being physically touched (as in mechanical contact) by another object. That is, it is the nonlocal interaction of objects that are separated in space.\n\nThis term was used most often in the context of early theories of [[gravity]] and [[electromagnetism]] to describe how an object responds to the influence of distant objects. For example, [[Coulomb's law]] and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] are such early theories.\n\nMore generally \"action at a distance\" describes the failure of early [[atomism|atomistic]] and [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic theories]] which sought to reduce all physical interaction to collision. The exploration and resolution of this problematic phenomenon led to significant developments in physics, from the concept of a field, to descriptions of [[quantum entanglement]] and the [[gauge boson|mediator particles]] of the [[Standard Model]].<ref name=\"Hesse\">{{cite journal |title=Action at a Distance in Classical Physics |journal=Isis |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=337\u2013353 |author=Hesse, Mary B. |authorlink=Mary Hesse |jstor=227576 |date=December 1955 |doi=10.1086/348429 }}</ref>\n\n==Electricity and magnetism==\nPhilosopher [[William of Ockham]] discussed action at a distance to explain [[magnetism]] and the ability of the Sun to heat the Earth's atmosphere without affecting the intervening space.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tachau |first=Katherine H. |title=Vision and Certitude in the Age of Ockham: Optics, Epistemology, and the Foundations of Semantics, 1250\u20131345 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=9004085521 |p=133}}</ref>\n\nEfforts to account for action at a distance in the theory of electromagnetism led to the development of the concept of a [[field (physics)|field]] which mediated interactions between currents and charges across empty space. According to field theory, we account for the [[Coulomb]] (electrostatic) interaction between charged particles through the fact that charges produce around themselves an [[electric field]], which can be felt by other charges as a force. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] directly addressed the subject of action-at-a-distance in chapter 23 of his ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' in 1873.<ref>[[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]] (1873) [https://archive.org/details/atreatiseonelec00maxwgoog A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism], pages 426\u2013438, link from [[Internet Archive]]</ref> He began by reviewing the explanation of [[Amp\u00e8re's force law|Amp\u00e8re's formula]] given by [[Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]]. On page 437 he indicates the physicists' disgust with action at a distance. In 1845 Gauss wrote to Weber desiring \"action, not instantaneous, but propagated in time in a similar manner to that of light\". This aspiration was developed by Maxwell with the theory of an [[electromagnetic field]] described by [[Maxwell's equations]], which used the field to elegantly account for all electromagnetic interactions, as well as light (which, until then, had been seen as a completely unrelated phenomenon). In Maxwell's theory, the field is its own physical entity, carrying momenta and energy across space, and action-at-a-distance is only the apparent effect of local interactions of charges with their surrounding field.\n\nElectrodynamics was later described without fields (in [[Minkowski space]])  as the direct interaction of particles with [[Lightlike#Causal structure|lightlike]] separation vectors.{{Dubious|date=August 2015}} This resulted in the Fokker-Tetrode-Schwarzschild action integral. This kind of electrodynamic theory is often called \"direct interaction\" to distinguish it from field theories where action at a distance is mediated by a localized field (localized in the sense that its dynamics are determined by the nearby field parameters).<ref>Barut, A. O. \"Electrodynamics and Classical Theory of Fields and Particles\"</ref> This description of electrodynamics, in contrast with Maxwell's theory, explains apparent action at a distance not by postulating a mediating entity (a field) but by appealing to the natural geometry of special relativity.\n\nDirect interaction electrodynamics is explicitly symmetrical in time and avoids the infinite energy predicted in the field immediately surrounding point particles.  Feynman and Wheeler have shown that it can account for radiation and [[radiative damping]] (which had been considered strong evidence for the independent existence of the field). However, various proofs, beginning with that of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], have shown that direct interaction theories (under reasonable assumptions) do not admit [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations (these are the so-called [[No Interaction Theorems]]). Also significant is the measurement and theoretical description of the [[Lamb shift]]  which strongly suggests that charged particles interact with their own field.  Fields, because of these and other difficulties, have been elevated to the fundamental operators in [[Quantum Field Theory]] and [[Modern physics]] has thus largely abandoned direct interaction theory.\n\n==Gravity==\n{{Main article|Speed of gravity}}\n\n===Newton===\n[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s classical theory of gravity offered no prospect of identifying any mediator of gravitational interaction. His theory assumed that gravitation acts instantaneously, regardless of distance. <!--Newton had shown mathematically that if the gravitational interaction is not instantaneous, [[angular momentum]] is not conserved,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and--> [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]'s observations gave strong evidence that in planetary motion angular momentum is conserved. (The mathematical proof is valid only in the case of a [[Euclidean geometry]].) Gravity is also known as a force of attraction between two objects because of their mass.\n\nFrom a Newtonian perspective, action at a distance can be regarded as \"a phenomenon in which a change in intrinsic properties of one system induces a change in the intrinsic properties of a distant system, independently of the influence of any other systems on the distant system, and without there being a process that carries this influence contiguously in space and time\" (Berkovitz 2008).<ref name=\"sep-qm-action-distance\"/>\n\nA related question, raised by [[Ernst Mach]], was how rotating bodies know how much to bulge at the equator. This, it seems, requires an action-at-a-distance from distant matter, informing the rotating object about the state of the universe. Einstein coined the term [[Mach's principle]] for this question.\n\n{{quote|It is inconceivable that inanimate Matter should, without the Mediation of something else, which is not material, operate upon, and affect other matter without mutual Contact\u2026That Gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to Matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance thro' a Vacuum, without the Mediation of any thing else, by and through which their Action and Force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an Absurdity that I believe no Man who has in philosophical Matters a competent Faculty of thinking can ever fall into it.

In the 1960s [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]] derived an inequality that indicated a testable difference between the predictions of quantum mechanics and local [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] theories.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=John S. | title=On the Problem of Hidden Variables in Quantum Mechanics | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics | publisher=American Physical Society (APS) | volume=38 | issue=3 | date=1966-07-01 | issn=0034-6861 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.38.447 | pages=447\u2013452}}</ref>  To date, all [[Bell test experiments|experiments]] testing Bell-type inequalities in situations analogous to the EPR thought experiment have results consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, suggesting that local hidden variables theories can be ruled out. Whether or not this is interpreted as evidence for [[quantum nonlocality|nonlocality]] depends on one's [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]].\n\nNon-standard interpretations of quantum mechanics vary in their response to the EPR-type experiments. The [[Bohm interpretation]] gives an explanation based on nonlocal hidden variables for the correlations seen in entanglement. Many advocates of the [[many-worlds interpretation]] argue that it can explain these correlations in a way that does not require a violation of locality,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Rubin |title=Locality in the Everett Interpretation of Heisenberg-Picture Quantum Mechanics |year=2001 |pages=301\u2013322 |volume=14 |journal=Found. Phys. Lett. |arxiv=quant-ph/0103079 |doi=10.1023/A:1012357515678 |issue=4|bibcode=2001quant.ph..3079R }}</ref> by allowing measurements to have non-unique outcomes.\n\nIf 'action' is defined as a force, physical [[Work (physics)|work]] or [[Physical information|information]], then it should be stated clearly that [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] cannot communicate action between two entangled particles (Einstein's worry about \"spooky action at a distance\" does not actually violate [[special relativity]]). What happens in entanglement is that a measurement on one entangled particle yields a random result, then a later measurement on another particle in the same entangled (shared) quantum state must always yield a value correlated with the first measurement. Since no force, work, or information is communicated (the first measurement is random), the [[Speed of light#Upper limit on speeds|speed of light]] limit does not apply (see [[Quantum entanglement]] and [[Bell test experiments]]). In the standard [[Copenhagen interpretation]], as discussed above, entanglement demonstrates a genuine [[Quantum nonlocality|nonlocal effect]] of quantum mechanics, but does not communicate information, either quantum or classical.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dynamism (metaphysics)]]\n* [[Einstein's thought experiments]]\n* [[Interaction-free measurement]]\n* [[Quantum pseudo-telepathy]]\n* [[Quantum teleportation]]\n* [[Remote sensing]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{Free-content attribution\n\n| title = Newton\u2019s action at a distance \u2013 Different views\n\n| author = Nicolae Sfetcu\n\n| documentURL = https://www.setthings.com/en/newtons-action-at-a-distance-different-views/\n\n| license = CC-BY-SA\n\n}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Juan Yin and others (2013) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0614 Bounding the speed of \"Spooky Action at a Distance']\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Action At A Distance (Physics)}}\n[[Category:Interaction|Action at a distance]]\n", "name_user": "Jaydavidmartin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNewton:comma placement", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_at_a_distance"}
