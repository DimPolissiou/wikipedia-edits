The Llano River location was chosen in an [[election]] held on June 14, 1856, under a [[live oak]] on the south bank of the river, near the present site of Roy Inks Bridge in Llano. Into the 1870s, the town was little more than a [[frontier]] trading center, with a few log buildings housing business establishments, a [[post office]], and a few homes. In 1879, the first bank, Moore, Foster, and Company, was founded, and during the 1880s, Llano acquired a number of new enterprises that served the county's [[farmer]]s and [[rancher]]s. After the county outgrew the one-story stone building that had housed its public offices, in 1885, an ornate brick [[courthouse]] was completed on the square on the south side of the river. A fire on January 22, 1892, destroyed this courthouse; the present county courthouse was completed and occupied on August 1, 1893. It is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIn the 1880s the ''Llano Rural'', the town's first [[newspaper]], was established, followed by the ''Iron City News'', the name of which reflects growing interest in the county's [[mineral]] resources. The ''Rural'' eventually incorporated several other newspapers, including the ''Advocate'', the ''Searchlight'', and the ''Gazette'', to become the [http://www.llanonews.com/ ''Llano News''] by the early 1900s. The ''Llano Times'' was where [[J. Marvin Hunter]], author and historian of the [[American West]], worked on the staff for a brief time early in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gard|first=Wayne|title=John Marvin Hunter |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhu35|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref>\n\nAnticipation of significant economic growth based on the iron deposits discovered at Iron Mountain in northwestern Llano County attracted capital from [[Dallas]] and from northern states, and the [[Economic boom|boom]] years of Llano-from 1886 to 1893-were launched. The Llano Improvement and Furnace Company undertook plans for an iron furnace and [[foundry]], as well as for the development of commercial [[real estate]], on the hitherto undeveloped north side of the river. [[Charters]] were undertaken for a [[dam]], an electric [[power plant]], a [[streetcar]] system, and [[electric street lights]], while expectations of growth were high. [[Steel]]-town names such as [[Birmingham]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] were chosen for streets on the north side; Llano was to be the \"Pittsburgh of the West\", but only a small dam and the street lighting were completed. By one report, the population reached 7,000 in 1890. In 1892, at the peak of the boom period, the town was incorporated, the river was bridged, and the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was extended to a terminal on the north side of Llano. Because of the improved transportation, several granite cutting and finishing businesses moved to town in this period. Many of the new businesses were begun in the boom period, and substantial brick establishments were constructed around the public square on the north side of the river. Among these, the Algona Hotel became a focal point for the town's new social life. It was damaged by a [[cyclone]] in 1900 and burned to the ground in 1923. Because the county's mineral resources, with the significant exception of granite, did not exist in commercially exploitable concentrations, the boom period soon faded. Plans to connect Llano with [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]] via an extension of the [[San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway]] were not fulfilled. A series of fires in the early 1890s, probably set to collect insurance on unprofitable properties, destroyed many of the new business establishments. Such fires were so numerous, fire insurance was denied to the town for several years.\n\nFarming, ranching, and the granite industry remained the foundations of the town's economy in the 20th century. In the 1920s, Llano was a major shipping point for cattle; the cotton industry flourished in the county through the 1930s, but declined thereafter into insignificance. Granite quarrying and finishing retained their importance, amounting to a million-dollar-a-year industry by the 1950s. The Roy Inks Bridge, named for a former mayor, was built after a flood crest of 42 feet in 1935 swept away the 1892 structure. By 1964, the town had a new hospital, a post office, school buildings, a community center, a rodeo area, and a golf course, along with a city park and improved water system. Llano was an important link in the Highland Lakes chain of tourist areas, and attracted many hunters during the deer season. A winery, feed processing, and insecticide and commercial talc production represented new industry. Actress [[Sophia Loren]], friend and correspondent of [[Netherlands]] native Anthony Goossens, priest of Holy Trinity [[Catholic Church]] in Llano, contributed to the church fund-raising campaign in 1975. By 1983, the National Register of Historic Places listed, in addition to the courthouse, the Llano jail, the Southern Hotel, and the Badu Building, former bank and home of French immigrant and mineralogist N. J. Badu, now a bed-and-breakfast establishment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heckert-Greene|first=James B|title=Llano, Texas|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hgl09|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==2018 flood==\n\nIn October 2018, Llano experienced heavy rainfall and flooding following [[Hurricane Sergio (2018)|Hurricane Sergio]].<ref>{{cite news |first1=Don |title=Deadly floods hit Texas after extreme rainfall, state of emergency declared |url=https://watchers.news/2018/10/17/texas-flood-october-2018/ |author=Teo Bla\u0161kovi\u0107 |date=October 17, 2018 |website=The Watchers |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref> Rainfall in Llano exceeded {{convert|250|mm|in|order=flip}} and the sea level of Llano River rose about {{convert|25|ft|m}} in 12 hours.<ref>{{cite news|author=Caroline Floyd|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/flooding-destroys-washes-out-bridge-texas-heavy-rain-evacuations-must-see-video/115160|title=Stunning video shows bridge washed away in Texas flood|publisher=The Weather Network|date=October 16, 2018|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref> The body of an unidentified woman was found on the banks alongside the Colorado River following the flooding in Llano.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://weather.com/amp/news/news/2018-10-16-texas-flooding-evacuations.html|title=Texas Flooding Kills 2; Bus Driver Arrested for Endangering a Child|publisher=The Weather Channel|date=October 17, 2018|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Registered historical places==\n\n===Badu Building===\n{{details|Badu Building}}\n\n===Llano County Courthouse and Red Top Jail===\n{{details|Llano County Courthouse and Jail}}\n\n===Southern Hotel===\n{{details|Southern Hotel (Llano, Texas)}}\n\n==Llano County Museum==\n\nThe Llano County Museum is located in the former Bruhl's Drugstore owned by German native Louis Herman Bruhl (1849\u20131931).

The Llano River location was chosen in an [[election]] held on June 14, 1856, under a [[live oak]] on the south bank of the river, near the present site of Roy Inks Bridge in Llano. Into the 1870s, the town was little more than a [[frontier]] trading center, with a few log buildings housing business establishments, a [[post office]], and a few homes. In 1879, the first bank, Moore, Foster, and Company, was founded, and during the 1880s, Llano acquired a number of new enterprises that served the county's [[farmer]]s and [[rancher]]s. After the county outgrew the one-story stone building that had housed its public offices, in 1885, an ornate brick [[courthouse]] was completed on the square on the south side of the river. A fire on January 22, 1892, destroyed this courthouse; the present county courthouse was completed and occupied on August 1, 1893. It is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].\n\nIn the 1880s the ''Llano Rural'', the town's first [[newspaper]], was established, followed by the ''Iron City News'', the name of which reflects growing interest in the county's [[mineral]] resources. The ''Rural'' eventually incorporated several other newspapers, including the ''Advocate'', the ''Searchlight'', and the ''Gazette'', to become the [http://www.llanonews.com/ ''Llano News''] by the early 1900s. The ''Llano Times'' was where [[J. Marvin Hunter]], author and historian of the [[American West]], worked on the staff for a brief time early in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gard|first=Wayne|title=John Marvin Hunter |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhu35|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref>\n\nAnticipation of significant economic growth based on the iron deposits discovered at Iron Mountain in northwestern Llano County attracted capital from [[Dallas]] and from northern states, and the [[Economic boom|boom]] years of Llano-from 1886 to 1893-were launched. The Llano Improvement and Furnace Company undertook plans for an iron furnace and [[foundry]], as well as for the development of commercial [[real estate]], on the hitherto undeveloped north side of the river. [[Charters]] were undertaken for a [[dam]], an electric [[power plant]], a [[streetcar]] system, and [[electric street lights]], while expectations of growth were high. [[Steel]]-town names such as [[Birmingham]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Bessemer process|Bessemer]] were chosen for streets on the north side; Llano was to be the \"Pittsburgh of the West\", but only a small dam and the street lighting were completed. By one report, the population reached 7,000 in 1890. In 1892, at the peak of the boom period, the town was incorporated, the river was bridged, and the Austin and Northwestern Railroad was extended to a terminal on the north side of Llano. Because of the improved transportation, several granite cutting and finishing businesses moved to town in this period. Many of the new businesses were begun in the boom period, and substantial brick establishments were constructed around the public square on the north side of the river. Among these, the Algona Hotel became a focal point for the town's new social life. It was damaged by a [[cyclone]] in 1900 and burned to the ground in 1923. Because the county's mineral resources, with the significant exception of granite, did not exist in commercially exploitable concentrations, the boom period soon faded. Plans to connect Llano with [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]] via an extension of the [[San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway]] were not fulfilled. A series of fires in the early 1890s, probably set to collect insurance on unprofitable properties, destroyed many of the new business establishments. Such fires were so numerous, fire insurance was denied to the town for several years.\n\nFarming, ranching, and the granite industry remained the foundations of the town's economy in the 20th century. In the 1920s, Llano was a major shipping point for cattle; the cotton industry flourished in the county through the 1930s, but declined thereafter into insignificance. Granite quarrying and finishing retained their importance, amounting to a million-dollar-a-year industry by the 1950s. The Roy Inks Bridge, named for a former mayor, was built after a flood crest of 42 feet in 1935 swept away the 1892 structure. By 1964, the town had a new hospital, a post office, school buildings, a community center, a rodeo area, and a golf course, along with a city park and improved water system. Llano was an important link in the Highland Lakes chain of tourist areas, and attracted many hunters during the deer season. A winery, feed processing, and insecticide and commercial talc production represented new industry. Actress [[Sophia Loren]], friend and correspondent of [[Netherlands]] native Anthony Goossens, priest of Holy Trinity [[Catholic Church]] in Llano, contributed to the church fund-raising campaign in 1975. By 1983, the National Register of Historic Places listed, in addition to the courthouse, the Llano jail, the Southern Hotel, and the Badu Building, former bank and home of French immigrant and mineralogist N. J. Badu, now a bed-and-breakfast establishment.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heckert-Greene|first=James B|title=Llano, Texas|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hgl09|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=2010-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==2018 flood==\n\nIn October 2018, Llano experienced heavy rainfall and flooding following [[Hurricane Sergio (2018)|Hurricane Sergio]].<ref>{{cite news |first1=Don |title=Deadly floods hit Texas after extreme rainfall, state of emergency declared |url=https://watchers.news/2018/10/17/texas-flood-october-2018/ |author=Teo Bla\u0161kovi\u0107 |date=October 17, 2018 |website=The Watchers |accessdate=29 November 2018}}</ref> Rainfall in Llano exceeded {{convert|250|mm|in|order=flip}} and the sea level of Llano River rose about {{convert|25|ft|m}} in 12 hours.<ref>{{cite news|author=Caroline Floyd|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/flooding-destroys-washes-out-bridge-texas-heavy-rain-evacuations-must-see-video/115160|title=Stunning video shows bridge washed away in Texas flood|publisher=The Weather Network|date=October 16, 2018|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref> The body of an unidentified woman was found on the banks alongside the Colorado River following the flooding in Llano.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://weather.com/amp/news/news/2018-10-16-texas-flooding-evacuations.html|title=Texas Flooding Kills 2; Bus Driver Arrested for Endangering a Child|publisher=The Weather Channel|date=October 17, 2018|accessdate=October 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Registered historical places==\n\n===Badu Building===\n{{details|Badu Building}}\n\n===Llano County Courthouse and Red Top Jail===\n{{details|Llano County Courthouse and Jail}}\n\n===Southern Hotel===\n{{details|Southern Hotel (Llano, Texas)}}\n\n==Llano County Museum==\n\nThe Llano County Museum is located in the former Bruhl's Drugstore owned by German native Louis Herman Bruhl (1849\u20131931).

College students from Colegio Mascarones and Colegio Marista de la Perpetua formed two football teams with the names R\u00e9cord and Col\u00f3n. On 12 October 1916, the two squads decided to consolidate to make a more competitive squad. Many names were considered for this new squad, and team player Pedro \"Cheto\" Quintanilla suggested the name \"Am\u00e9rica\", since they had formed the team on [[Columbus Day]] ''(D\u00eda del descubrimiento de Am\u00e9rica)''. The players agreed and soon designed a crest which had the map of the Americas centered with a 'C' for \"Club\" on the left and an 'A' for \"Am\u00e9rica\" on the right. The players had to decide on their team colours. [[Rafael Garza Guti\u00e9rrez]] went to get some of his father's navy blue trousers and a yellow shirt and it was decided amongst the group that those would be the club's colors.<ref name=\"Uniforme\">{{cite web|title=Primer uniforme del Club Am\u00e9rica, que chingue su madre el America.|url=http://www.clubamerica.com.mx/el-primer-uniforme-del-club-america|publisher=Club Am\u00e9rica&nbsp;\u2013 Sitio Oficial}}</ref>\n\n[[File:America23dz7.jpg|thumb|250px|Am\u00e9rica squad 1924\u20131925]]\nIn 1916, Club Am\u00e9rica had to prove itself to the Mexican Football League, which consisted primarily of foreign-born players.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} At the time, Am\u00e9rica was the only club in Mexico City with Mexican-born players.

Used since 1920, it is the reason the club used the colorways it did. Back then, the jerseys were a cream color while the shorts and socks were blue.\n\n\u2022 '''[[Atlantic canary|Canaries]]''': This was one of the nicknames they have been known as since the 1940s.

With the club looking for a new image, they wanted to have a representation of an animal that would show pride and domination of its environment.

The first match between the two clubs took place on 1 July 1962, where Am\u00e9rica hosted UNAM, who had recently been promoted from the second division. In Mexico the match is often perceived as the representation of a struggle between two antagonistic powers and institutions: Club Am\u00e9rica is regarded as the club representing the establishment and the wealthy. The fact that the club is owned by the mass media company [[Televisa]] has further intensified this image. Club Universidad, representing the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico]], identifies itself as the club of the intellectuals and middle-class.<ref>{{cite web|title=FIFA Classic Rivalries: CF Am\u00e9rica VS Pumas UNAM&nbsp;\u2013 Mexico City's grudge game|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/rivalries/newsid=1333144/index.html|publisher=FIFA.com}}</ref> The rivalry is particularly fierce from UNAM's side: according to surveys the majority of their supporters consider Am\u00e9rica as their main rival.

College students from Colegio Mascarones and Colegio Marista de la Perpetua formed two football teams with the names R\u00e9cord and Col\u00f3n. On 12 October 1916, the two squads decided to consolidate to make a more competitive squad. Many names were considered for this new squad, and team player Pedro \"Cheto\" Quintanilla suggested the name \"Am\u00e9rica\", since they had formed the team on [[Columbus Day]] ''(D\u00eda del descubrimiento de Am\u00e9rica)''. The players agreed and soon designed a crest which had the map of the Americas centered with a 'C' for \"Club\" on the left and an 'A' for \"Am\u00e9rica\" on the right. The players had to decide on their team colours. [[Rafael Garza Guti\u00e9rrez]] went to get some of his father's navy blue trousers and a yellow shirt and it was decided amongst the group that those would be the club's colors.<ref name=\"Uniforme\">{{cite web|title=Primer uniforme del Club Am\u00e9rica|url=http://www.clubamerica.com.mx/el-primer-uniforme-del-club-america|publisher=Club Am\u00e9rica&nbsp;\u2013 Sitio Oficial}}</ref>\n\n[[File:America23dz7.jpg|thumb|250px|Am\u00e9rica squad 1924\u20131925]]\nIn 1916, Club Am\u00e9rica had to prove itself to the Mexican Football League, which consisted primarily of foreign-born players.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} At the time, Am\u00e9rica was the only club in Mexico City with Mexican-born players.

Club Am\u00e9rica had declined from its then-prime of the 1920s and 1930s: aging players, diminishing financial resources, and resulting lack of interest made the team a bottom-feeder at the start of the beginning stage of the professional era<sup>[[#7|7]]</sup>.\n\nIt was also during this time that the rivalry with [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] was born; especially during the 1945\u20131946 season when Guadalajara beat Am\u00e9rica by 6\u20134 and 4\u20132 scorelines. The 1951\u20131952 season saw Am\u00e9rica finish in 11th place out of 12, with a 3-point-advantage over [[C.D. Veracruz|Veracruz]], who were relegated.

Used since 1920, it is the reason the club used the colorways it did. Back then, the jerseys were a cream color while the shorts and socks were blue.\n\n\u2022 '''[[Atlantic canary|Canaries]]''': This was one of the nicknames they have been known as since the 1940s. This was given to them because of the yellow found in the uniform.\n\n\u2022 '''Millionaires''': This is a derogatory reference or version of the word millionaire.

With the club looking for a new image, they wanted to have a representation of an animal that would show pride and domination of its environment.

In the film, a [[great white shark|man-eating great white]] shark attacks beachgoers at a summer [[resort town]], prompting police chief [[Martin Brody]] ([[Roy Scheider]]) to hunt it with the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]). [[Murray Hamilton]] plays the mayor, and [[Lorraine Gary]] portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].\n\nShot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]], ''Jaws'' had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] gave the film what was then an exceptionally [[wide release]] for a [[Major film studio|major studio]] picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n\nConsidered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]], ''Jaws'' was the prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It was the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple [[high-concept]] premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. ''Jaws'' was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]], all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries, usually for popular films, are set between 400-700 words. -->\nDuring a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]] in the ocean. While [[treading water]], she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a [[shark attack]] leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined and points out that the town has never had trouble with sharks. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter, with the shark killing a young boy paddling on his raft in full daylight on a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\u2014an unusually large one.\n\nWhen local fishermen catch a [[tiger shark]], the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable [[great white shark]]'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby [[estuary]], killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\n\nQuint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the ''Orca'', to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a [[Chumming|chum]] line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at {{convert|25|ft|m}} and weight at {{convert|3|t}}, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\n\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\n\nWith the ''Orca'' slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] and enters the water in a [[shark-proof cage]], intending to lethally inject the shark with [[strychnine]], using a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks and is lost. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark escapes and leaps onto the sinking deck of the boat, dragging Quint down and devouring him. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], producers at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], independently heard about Peter Benchley's novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]''. Brown came across it in the literature section of lifestyle magazine ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment \"might make a good movie\".<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e96\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=6}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scanlon|2009|p=197}}</ref> The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was \"the most exciting thing that they had ever read\" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished.<ref name=jawschap1>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans-title=\"From Novel to Script\"}}</ref> They purchased the film rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000 (equivalent to $990,000 in 2018).<ref name=\"Brode 50\">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref> Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.<ref name=\"McBride 231\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=231}}</ref>\n\nTo direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker [[John Sturges]]\u2014whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9 included another maritime adventure, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]''\u2014before offering the job to [[Dick Richards]], whose directorial debut, ''[[The Culpepper Cattle Co.]]'' had come out the previous year.<ref name=\"McBride232\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=232}}</ref> However, they grew irritated by Richards's habit of describing the shark as a whale and soon dropped him from the project.<ref name=\"McBride232\"/> Meanwhile, [[Steven Spielberg]] very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated.<ref name=\"Brode 50\"/> He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' in that both deal with \"these leviathans targeting [[everyman|everymen]]\".<ref name=jawschap1/> He also revealed in \"The Making of ''Jaws''\" documentary on the 2012 DVD release that he directly referenced ''Duel'' by repurposing the sound of the truck being destroyed as the death roar of the shark.

The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], the obsessed captain of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' who devotes his life to hunting a [[sperm whale]]. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[Orca|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277\u2013289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], its copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': \"''Jaws'' is&nbsp;... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>\n\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\".

When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".<ref name=\"Sinyard32\"/>\n\n===Scholarly criticism===\n''Jaws'' has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]]. He argues that Brody represents the \"white male middle class\u2014[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film\", who restores public order \"with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=510}}</ref> Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine ''Jaws'' as a signal example of the film as \"industrial product\" that sells on the basis of \"the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of ''Jaws'' is to be the most profitable movie)\".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=514}}</ref>\n\nAndrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it \"a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence.\" He suggests that the experience of the film is \"inconceivable\" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=237}}</ref> In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that \"individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change\".<ref name=Britton239>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=239}}</ref> [[Peter Biskind]] argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip [[counterculture]] figures vs. \"[[The Man]]\"\u2014the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>\n\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening&nbsp;... irrational and out of control\". Hooper, meanwhile, is \"associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency\"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Biskind |title=''Jaws'': Between the teeth |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |pages=1\u201329 |year=1975|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |issue=9}}</ref> Britton sees the film more as concerned with the \"vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them\", which in turn helps generate a \"pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=238}}</ref>\n\n[[Fredric Jameson]]'s analysis highlights the [[polysemy]] of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read\u2014from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very \"polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones&nbsp;... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=26\u201327}}</ref> He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, [[New Deal]] America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an \"allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations&nbsp;... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n[[Neal Gabler]] analyzed the film as showing three different approaches to solving an obstacle: science (represented by Hooper), spiritualism (represented by Quint), and the common man (represented by Brody).

In the film, a [[great white shark|man-eating great white]] shark attacks beachgoers at a summer [[resort town]], prompting police chief [[Martin Brody]] ([[Roy Scheider]]) to hunt it with the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter ([[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]]). [[Murray Hamilton]] plays the mayor, and [[Lorraine Gary]] portrays Brody's wife. The screenplay is credited to Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].\n\nShot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]], ''Jaws'' had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks often malfunctioned, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the shark's presence, employing an ominous and minimalist theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate its impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] gave the film what was then an exceptionally [[wide release]] for a [[Major film studio|major studio]] picture, on over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise.\n\nConsidered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films ever made]], ''Jaws'' was the prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history, and it won several awards for its music and editing. It was the [[Timeline of highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film]] until the release of ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977. Both films were pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which pursues high box-office returns from action and adventure films with simple [[high-concept]] premises, released during the summer in thousands of theaters and heavily advertised. ''Jaws'' was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]], all without Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers. In 2001, it was selected by the [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please review WP:FILMPLOT before adding material. Plot summaries, usually for popular films, are set between 400-700 words. -->\nDuring a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]] in the ocean. While [[treading water]], she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a [[shark attack]] leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined and points out that the town has never had trouble with sharks. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter, with the shark killing a young boy paddling on his raft in full daylight on a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\u2014an unusually large one.\n\nWhen local fishermen catch a [[tiger shark]], the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable [[great white shark]]'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby [[estuary]], killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\n\nQuint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the ''Orca'', to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a [[Chumming|chum]] line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at {{convert|25|ft|m}} and weight at {{convert|3|t}}, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\n\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the [[USS Indianapolis (CA-35)|USS ''Indianapolis'']]. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\n\nWith the ''Orca'' slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] and enters the water in a [[shark-proof cage]], intending to lethally inject the shark with [[strychnine]], using a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks and is lost. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark escapes and leaps onto the sinking deck of the boat, dragging Quint down and devouring him. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n[[Richard D.

Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[Orca|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to the death of Ahab in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277\u2013289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater. However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], its copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': \"''Jaws'' is&nbsp;... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway.\"<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>\n\nThe underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as \"a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel\";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where \"the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera\".

When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a \"deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play\".<ref name=\"Sinyard32\"/>\n\n===Scholarly criticism===\n''Jaws'' has received attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]].

Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era\u2014involving Us vs. Them, hip [[counterculture]] figures vs. \"[[The Man]]\"\u2014the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>\n\nWhereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. \"Authority must be restored\", he writes, \"but not by Quint\". The seaman's \"working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening&nbsp;... irrational and out of control\".

The first four rounds of the competition were held at the home ground of the higher seed, while the College Cup (semifinals and [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|final]]) were held at [[WakeMed Soccer Park]] in [[Cary, North Carolina]]. The [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|championship match]] took place December 15, 2019.\n\n== Qualification ==\n{{main|2019 NCAA Division I men's soccer season}}\n\nAs in previous editions of the NCAA Division I Tournament, the tournament features 48 participants out of a possible field of 203 teams. Of the 48 berths, 24 are allocated to the 21 conference tournament champions and to the regular season winners of the Ivy League, Pac-12 Conference, and West Coast Conference, which do not have tournaments. The remaining 24 berths are supposed to be determined through an at-large process based upon the [[Ratings Percentage Index]] (RPI) of teams that did not automatically qualify.\n\nThe NCAA Selection Committee also names the top sixteen seeds for the tournament, with those teams receiving an automatic bye into the second round of the tournament. The remaining 32 teams play in a single-elimination match in the first round of the tournament for the right to play a seeded team in the second round.\n\n=== Qualified teams ===\n{| class=\"wikitable

Division I Men's Soccer Tournament''' was the 61st edition of the [[NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], a postseason tournament to determine the national champion of [[NCAA Division I]] men's [[college soccer]]. The first four rounds of the competition were held at the home ground of the higher seed, while the College Cup (semifinals and [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|final]]) were held at [[WakeMed Soccer Park]] in [[Cary, North Carolina]]. The [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship Game|championship match]] took place December 15, 2019.\n\n== Qualification ==\n{{main|2019 NCAA Division I men's soccer season}}\n\nAs in previous editions of the NCAA Division I Tournament, the tournament features 48 participants out of a possible field of 203 teams. Of the 48 berths, 24 are allocated to the 21 conference tournament champions and to the regular season winners of the Ivy League, Pac-12 Conference, and West Coast Conference, which do not have tournaments. The remaining 24 berths are supposed to be determined through an at-large process based upon the [[Ratings Percentage Index]] (RPI) of teams that did not automatically qualify.\n\nThe NCAA Selection Committee also names the top sixteen seeds for the tournament, with those teams receiving an automatic bye into the second round of the tournament. The remaining 32 teams play in a single-elimination match in the first round of the tournament for the right to play a seeded team in the second round.\n\n=== Qualified teams ===\n{| class=\"wikitable

A significant body of research has explored \"overuse\" phenomena, commonly known as \"digital [[addiction]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.psycom.net/iadcriteria.html|title=Internet Addiction Disorder - Signs, Symptoms, and Treatments|website=Psycom.net - Mental Health Treatment Resource Since 1986|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191120074912/https://www.psycom.net/iadcriteria.html|archive-date=20 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|first=Erik|last=Peper|last2=Harvey|first2=Richard|date=2018-03-30|title=Digital Addiction: Increased Loneliness, Anxiety, and Depression|journal=NeuroRegulation|language=en|volume=5|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.15540/nr.5.1.3|issn=2373-0587|doi-access=free}}</ref>\", or \"digital [[Psychological dependence|dependencies]]\". These phenomena manifest differently in many societies and cultures. Some experts have investigated the benefits of moderate [[digital media]] use in various domains, including in [[mental health]], and the treatment of mental health problems with novel technological solutions.\n\nThe delineation between beneficial and [[pathology|pathological]] use of digital media has not been established. There are no widely accepted [[diagnostic criteria]], although some experts consider overuse a manifestation of underlying [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorders]]. The prevention and treatment of pathological digital media use is also not standardised, although guidelines for safer media use for children and families have been developed. The [[DSM-5|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'']] (DSM-5) does not include diagnoses for [[internet addiction disorder|problematic internet use]], [[social media addiction|problematic social media use]], and [[gaming disorder]] (commonly known as video game addiction), whereas the eleventh revision of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-11) recognises gaming disorder. Experts are still debating how and when to diagnose these conditions. The use of the term ''addiction'' to refer to these phenomena and diagnoses has also been questioned.\n\nDigital media and [[screen time]] have changed how children think, interact and develop in positive and negative ways, but researchers are unsure about the existence of hypothesised causal links between digital media use and mental health outcomes.

These phenomena manifest differently in many societies and cultures. Some experts have investigated the benefits of moderate [[digital media]] use in various domains, including in [[mental health]], and the treatment of mental health problems with novel technological solutions.\n\nThe delineation between beneficial and [[pathology|pathological]] use of digital media has not been established. There are no widely accepted [[diagnostic criteria]], although some experts consider overuse a manifestation of underlying [[Mental disorder|psychiatric disorders]]. The prevention and treatment of pathological digital media use is also not standardised, although guidelines for safer media use for children and families have been developed. The [[DSM-5|''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'']] (DSM-5) does not include diagnoses for [[internet addiction disorder|problematic internet use]], [[social media addiction|problematic social media use]], and [[gaming disorder]] (commonly known as video game addiction), whereas the eleventh revision of the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Classification of Diseases]] (ICD-11) recognises gaming disorder. Experts are still debating how and when to diagnose these conditions. The use of the term ''addiction'' to refer to these phenomena and diagnoses has also been questioned.\n\nDigital media and [[screen time]] have changed how children think, interact and develop in positive and negative ways, but researchers are unsure about the existence of hypothesised causal links between digital media use and mental health outcomes. Those links appear to depend on the individual and the platforms they use. Several large technology firms have made commitments or announced strategies to try to reduce the risks of digital media use.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== History and terminology ==\n[[File:Boysmartphone.jpg|thumb|alt=A child looks into a smartphone|right|A young boy engaged with a smartphone]]\nThe relationship between digital technology and mental health has been investigated from many perspectives.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite web|url=http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Portals/0/PDF%20reviews%20and%20summaries/Systematic%20Map%20of%20Reviews%20on%20Screen-based%20activties_08.01.19.pdf?ver=2019-01-29-155200-517|title=Screen-based activities and children and young people's mental health: A Systematic Map of Reviews| vauthors=Dickson K, Richardson M |date=1 January 2019|website=Department of Health Reviews Facility|publisher=[[EPPI-Centre]], Social Science Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education, University College London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211144646/http://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Portals/0/PDF%20reviews%20and%20summaries/Systematic%20Map%20of%20Reviews%20on%20Screen-based%20activties_08.01.19.pdf?ver=2019-01-29-155200-517|archive-date=11 February 2019|access-date=15 May 2019|last3=Kwan|first3=I|last4=MacDowall|first4=W|last5=Burchett|first5=H|last6=Stansfield|first6=C|last7=Brunton|first7=G|last8=Sutcliffe|first8=K|last9=Thomas|first9=J|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Children-digital-technology-wellbeing.pdf|title=How does the time children spend using digital technology impact their mental well-being, social relationships and physical activity? \u2013 An evidence-focused literature review|last=Kardefelt-Winther|first=Daniel|date=1 February 2017|website=[[UNICEF]] Office of Research \u2013 Innocenti|publisher=[[UNICEF]] Office of Research|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190705215123/https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/Children-digital-technology-wellbeing.pdf|archive-date=5 July 2019|access-date=12 May 2019|name-list-format=vanc|url-status=live}}</ref> Benefits of digital media use in childhood and adolescent development have been found.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal | vauthors=Reid Chassiakos YL, Radesky J, Christakis D, Moreno MA, Cross C | title=Children and Adolescents and Digital Media | journal=[[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] | volume=138 | issue=5 | pages=e20162593 | date=November 2016 | pmid=27940795 | doi=10.1542/peds.2016-2593| doi-access=free }}</ref> Concerns have been expressed by researchers, clinicians and the public in regard to apparent [[Compulsive behavior|compulsive behaviours]] of digital media users, as correlations between technology overuse and mental health problems become apparent.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal | vauthors=Stiglic N, Viner RM | title=Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a systematic review of reviews | journal=[[BMJ Open]] | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=e023191 | date=January 2019 | pmid=30606703 | pmc=6326346 | doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2018-023191}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTerminologies used to refer to compulsive digital-media-use behaviours are not standardised or universally recognised.
