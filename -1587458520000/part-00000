The group is also present in [[Rome]], [[Turin]], [[Brescia]], [[Cagliari]], [[Parma]], [[Busto Arsizio]], [[Gallarate]], [[Bergamo]], [[Palermo]], [[Monza]], [[Campomarino]], [[Novara]], [[Como]], [[Varese]], Albenga, Savona, Lecco and Lecce; since 2014, they have also been active in Lugano and Chiasso, Switzerland.\nIn Milan, the City Angels have twice received the \"Ambrogino d'Oro\", the city's highest official recognition. In 2008, the Ambrogino was awarded to the honorary City Angel Edward \"Eddie\" Gardner, a Ghanaian man who risked dying on July 20 of that year after being stabbed, in a racist attack, by three drug dealers shouting \"dirty nigger!\" because he was trying to convince young people not to take drugs.<ref>[http://milano.corriere.it/cronache/articoli/2008/12/08/ambrogini_festa_plemiche_biagi_islam_coreis_tettamanzi.shtml The Ambrogino d'Oro to the Ghanian man Edward Gardner]</ref><ref>[http://www.02blog.it/post/3358/edward-gardner-city-angel-ad-honorem The Ghanian man stabbed dubbed as City Angel ad honorem]</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n\nCity Angels are volunteers who assist citizens and homeless in emergency and distress, by helping those who are marginalized: homeless, immigrants, drug addicts and the elderly. They are the only non-profit association in Italy also involved in preventing and fighting street crime, in cooperation with law enforcement agents. In [[Milan]], they run \"Casa Silvana\", the only home for families open all night and even hosting the homeless animals; and they also run other two shelters for the homeless, one just for men and the other also for women and families. They generally operate in areas with major social problems, which in many cities is usually around the railway stations.\n\nThe City Angels have been working closely for many years with the institutions, which often contact them to open new chapters. The President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, has received them in his Quirinale office on December 9, 2009 and has complimented them, saying they represent, as volunteers, \"the best of Italy\". Pope Benedict XVIth has called them \"Scouts of the XXIst century\".\n\nCity Angels have always publicly expressed their opposition to vigilante groups. \"Vigilantes - Mario Furlan explains - are in search of the enemy. We are in search of people to help.\"\n\nAmong City Angel activities are:\n* '''help the homeless''', by distributing food, clothes, blankets and sleeping bags, accompanying them in shelters and huddle with them a relationship of friendship and trust\n* '''help drug addicts and alcoholics''', directing them toward a detoxification pathway\n* '''help prostitutes''', through the distribution of [[condoms]] used to get in touch with them and convince them to turn to gated communities and to denounce their exploiters\n* '''give a \"good example\"''', acting to instill civic sense in the others\n* '''help immigrants''', helping them to become integrated in the society\n* '''help the elderly''', carrying out a daily monitoring service and distribution of meals to 300 [[elderly]] people living alone in the sole city of [[Milan]]\n* '''help disabled people''', accompanying them on the road\n* '''contrast''', due to their uniform, '''crime'''\n* '''help victims of crime''', carrying out a service of the territory in the most \"risky\" areas and providing an escort service for those who are afraid to walk alone in certain areas (especially women and the elderly)\n* '''act in case of crime and call the police''' when it is needed\n* '''help the prisoners''', serving in prisons for detainees from the moment they enter the prison\n* '''help students''' involved in middle and high schools to hold meetings on the issue of combating drugs and bullying\n* '''help the animals''', by taking action every time an animal is mistreated or abandoned and promoting initiatives to raise public awareness about the love for animals and nature.\nIn Switzerland the Angels are particularly active in helping the disabled and the elderly. In Chiasso, at the border with Italy, they help the border police.\nThe City Angels of Italy and Switzerland are founding members of Eunwa (European neighbourhood watch association), based in Vienna, Austria.\n\n==City Angel uniform==\n\nCity Angels are required to wear a uniform that is designed to make them recognizable by the \"road users\", i.e. [[immigrants]], [[homeless]], [[drug addicts]], [[alcoholics]] but also by ordinary [[citizens]] and [[tourists]] that can ask Angels for help.\n\nTheir uniform consists of: \n* black sneakers or black boots, useful to walk through broken glass, syringes and mud\n* black trousers with pockets, to hold the equipment of the volunteer\n* red shirt / sweatshirt / jacket, with the emblem of the City Angels (red color = emergency)\n* blue beret with the badge of the City Angels (blue = color of peace)\n\nThe uniform of the City Angels, along with other information about City Angels, is exhibited since May 2009 in the Museo del Risorgimento in [[Milan]].\n\n==Emblem==\n\nThe City Angels' emblem is an eagle with outstretched wings, protecting a city skyline. The eagle represents courage, foresight, nobility of the soul. Above this symbol are the words \"City Angels\" and below is the mission of the association, \"Solidarity and Security\".\n\n==Training course==\n\nThe Angels are mostly between 18 and 45 years, of all nationalities (there is no upper age limit); 50,8% of them are women, 27% are immigrants. They do not carry any weapon. They wear a red shirt or jacket and the blue beret of the [[United Nations]], to emphasize the fact of being a force for peace.\n\nVolunteers have to be well trained, brave and balanced. To become a City Angel a candidate has to undergo a training course lasting two months, for a total of 16 lessons, twice a week. After passing an aptitude test, the candidate has to compile the application for admission, pay an annual insurance fee and handle the following documents: certificate of good health, passport photos, photocopy of identity card. Twelve classes are held in twelve lessons in gym (compulsory attendance). In class, concepts like first aid, alcohol and drug addiction are explained; also, rules of procedure and legal, psychology and communication concepts are taught. In the gym, lessons on teamwork and self-defense techniques are given. The self-defense used by City Angels is called Wilding, has been created by the founder Mario Furlan and is based on psychology and instinct.\nThose who finish the course may take the final exam: before passing the final exam a candidate is not yet a City Angel, but an \"auxiliary\", and circulates with a bib instead of the red shirt. \nIn an average of ten aspiring volunteers, six pass an aptitude test, three come to the final exam and two pass it. As the president and founder Furlan says, \"we are interested in quality rather than quantity, of volunteers.\"\n\n==Public initiatives==\n\nFrom their birth, City Angels have been organizing public initiatives to promote tolerance, solidarity, [[anti-racism]] and brotherhood among people. Among their events, the multi-religious prayer the day before Christmas and [[Easter]] in the [[Milano Centrale railway station|Milan Central Station]]: representatives of various religions ([[priests]], [[imams]], [[rabbis]], Protestant [[pastors]], ...) pray together in the middle of the homeless.\nAnother event is the \"Angel Day\" at the main Milan soup kitchen: a day in which the mayor, together with political leaders and with television, entertainment, sports and culture stars, wear the uniform of the Angels and act as waiters to the [[homeless]].\n\n==Awards and prizes==\n\nThe City Angels have received several awards in their history by the institutions. Among these the most important are:\n\n* 1999: \"Ambrogino d'Oro\", the most important recognition in the City of [[Milan]]\n* 2000: Motta Goodness Award\n* 2007: Paul Harris Award of the Rotary Club International to Mario Furlan, founder of City Angels \n* 2008: \"Ambrogino d'Oro\" (to the honorary City Angel Eddy Gardner)\n* 2008: Ambassador for Peace Award of the World Peace Organisation\n* 2009: The Gift of Humanity Award\n* 2013: Carlo Porta Award\n* 2018: Gold medal of the City of Bergamo\n* 2019: \"Bronzi di Riace\" award to Mario Furlan, founder of City Angels\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat}}\n* [http://www.cityangels.it/ Official Italian site]\n* [http://www.cityangelssvizzera.ch/ Official Swiss site]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/cityangels.it FB page for City Angels Italy]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/cityangelssvizzera FB page for City Angels Switzerland]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/user/cityangelsitaly YouTube channel]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Non-profit organisations based in Italy]]\n[[Category:Volunteer cooperatives]]\n[[Category:Community development organizations]]\n[[Category:Civil crime prevention]]\n", "text_old": "{{notability|date=April 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox non-profit\n| name              = City Angels\n| image             = [[File:Logo city angels.jpeg|250px|alt=City Angels logo]]\n| type              = \n| founded_date      = 1994\n| tax_id            = \n| registration_id   =\n| founder           = Mario Furlan\n| location          = \n| coordinates       = \n| origins           = \n| key_people        = \n| area_served       = [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]]\n| product           = \n| mission           = Help homeless and people in need on the street, prevent crime\n| focus             = \n| method            = \n| revenue           = \n| endowment         = \n| num_volunteers    = 600\n| num_employees     = 10\n| num_members       = 600\n| subsid            = \n| opponents         = \n| owner             = \n| non-profit_slogan = Solidarity and Security\n| former name       =\n| homepage          = [http://www.cityangels.it/ www.cityangels.it]\n| dissolved         = \n| footnotes         = \n}}\n\nThe '''City Angels''' group is an independent, multiethnic and [[anti-racist]] group of street volunteers, founded in 1994 in Milan by Mario Furlan, an Italian journalist, writer and university professor of motivation and personal growth.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

His abusive father Aftab Shakir Ahmed ([[Vijay Raaz]]) brings home a much younger second wife, much to the chagrin of the family. Murad nurtures a fascination for [[rap]] music. His longtime and overtly possessive girlfriend Safeena Firdausi ([[Alia Bhatt]]) is training to be a surgeon and routinely meets him in secret. \n\nForced to work part-time as a chauffeur after his father is injured, Murad starts to write, with his lyrics informed by the inequalities he observes while on the job. Making the acquaintance of local rapper Shrikant \"MC Sher\" Bhosle ([[Siddhant Chaturvedi]]) whom he saw performing in his college fest, he is drawn into performing his lyrics at underground shows and rap battles and eventually uploading a video on YouTube.\n\n[[Berklee College of Music|Berklee College]] student Shweta \"Sky\" Mehta ([[Kalki Koechlin]]), an evolving musician, reaches out to Murad and Sher after seeing the video, offering to collaborate on a new song. The accompanying video, which is shot in Dharavi, rapidly becomes popular. Murad shares an intimate moment with Sky, later lying to Safeena about it. When Safeena finds out, she reacts violently towards Sky by smashing a bottle of beer on her head. \n\nAs a result, she is brought in by the police but is not arrested as Sky doesn't press charges against her. Murad eventually breaks up with Safeena due to her possessive attitude. As Aftab's violence towards him, his brother and his mother escalates, Murad decides to leave home with his mother and brother and work full-time for his uncle Ateeq Khan ([[Vijay Maurya]]).\n\nLater, when Sky expresses her romantic feelings for him, he declines her as he still loves Safeena and decides to reconcile with her. Murad and Sher enter a contest to open for [[Nas]] at his Mumbai concert, and Murad advances to the finals after a successful rap battle. Murad's confidence grows from interacting with rap fans' appreciation of his performances, and he finally stands up to Aftab and Ateeq when they belittle his passion. He later gets back together with Safeena. He goes on to win the contest and becomes one of India's top rappers. The film ends with his friends, family  and Safeena watching him happily as he begins his opening performance.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ranveer Singh]] as Murad Ahmed a.k.a.

Not fleeing the police on grim streets, Dre's gangstas were cruising sunny boulevards in modified 1964 [[Chevy Impala]]<nowiki/>s, showcasing them at street rallies, mingling at barbecues, and, after nightfall, drinking [[malt liquor]] at parties, at any moment puffing weed, altogether, at that time, \"a glamorous brand of gangsta rap\".

It increased the powers of the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and implemented some of the suggestions from the [[Packard Commission]], commissioned by President [[Reagan]] in 1985. Among other changes, '''Goldwater\u2013Nichols''' streamlined the military [[chain of command]], which now runs from the president through the [[Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]] directly to [[combatant commander]]s (CCDRs, all four-star generals or admirals), bypassing the service chiefs. The service chiefs were assigned to an advisory role to the president and the secretary of defense, as well as given the responsibility for training and equipping personnel for the [[Unified Combatant Command|unified combatant commands]].\n\nNamed after Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona]]) and Representative [[William Flynt Nichols|William Flynt \"Bill\" Nichols]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Alabama]]), the bill passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], 383\u201327, and the [[United States Senate|Senate]], 95\u20130. It was signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan|President Reagan]] on October 1, 1986. Admiral [[William J. Crowe]] was the first chairman to serve under this new legislation.\n\n==History==\nThe Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act was an attempt to fix problems caused by [[inter-service rivalry]], which had emerged during the [[Vietnam War]], contributed to the catastrophic failure of the [[Operation Eagle Claw|Iranian hostage rescue mission]] in 1980, and which were still evident in the [[invasion of Grenada]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Ronald H.|title=Grenada, Panama, and Haiti: Joint Operational Reform|journal=Joint Force Quarterly|date=1999|issue=20 (Autumn/Winter 1998-99)|pages=57\u201374|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a422959.pdf|accessdate=20 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/chapter12.htm|chapter=Chapter 12: Rebuilding the Army Vietnam to Desert Storm |title=American Military History, Volume II|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V2/AMH%20V2/index.htm#cont |editor=Richard W. Stewart |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref>\n\nSuch problems existed as well in World War II, during which two independent lines of command flowed from the President, one through the [[Secretary of the Navy]] to naval forces, and the other through the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] to land and air forces. In 1947, the military restructuring placed all military forces, including the newly independent [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], under a single civilian [[Secretary of Defense]].\n\nHowever, the United States military was still organized along lines of command that reported to their respective service chiefs ([[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], Chiefs of Staff of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army]] and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[Chief of Naval Operations]]). These service chiefs in turn made up the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]]. The Joint Chiefs of Staff elected a chairman to communicate with the civilian government. The [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs]] in turn reported to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the civilian head of the military.  Both the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Secretary of Defense reported to the [[President of the United States]] who holds the position of Commander-in-Chief (CINC) of all [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]].\n\nThis system led to counter-productive inter-service rivalry.  Peacetime activities (such as procurement and creation of [[Military Science|doctrine]], etc.) were tailored for each service in isolation.  Additionally, wartime activities of each service were largely planned, executed, and evaluated independently.  These practices resulted in division of effort and an inability to profit from [[economies of scale]], and inhibited the development of modern warfare doctrine.\n\nThe formulation of the [[AirLand Battle]] doctrine in the late 1970s and early 1980s laid bare the difficulty of coordinating efforts among various service branches. AirLand Battle attempted to synthesize all of the capabilities of the service arms of the military into a single doctrine. The system envisioned ground, naval, air, and space based systems acting in concert to attack and defeat an opponent in depth. The structure of the armed forces effectively blocked realization of this ideal. The U.S. [[Operation Urgent Fury|invasion of Grenada]] in 1983 further exposed the problems with the military command structure. Although the United States forces easily prevailed, its leaders expressed major concerns over both the inability of the different service branches to coordinate and communicate with each other, and the consequences of a lack of coordination if faced with a more threatening foe.\n\n==Effects==\nThe Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act brought sweeping changes to the way the U.S. military forces were organized. The first successful test of Goldwater\u2013Nichols was the 1989 [[United States Invasion of Panama|United States invasion of Panama]] (code-named [[Operation Just Cause]]), where it functioned exactly as planned, allowing the U.S. commander, Army General [[Maxwell Reid Thurman]], to exercise full control over [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] assets without having to negotiate with the individual services.\n\n===Chain of command and military advice===\nUnder the Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act, military advice was centralized in the [[chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] as opposed to the service chiefs. The chairman was designated as the principal military adviser to the [[president of the United States]], [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] and [[secretary of defense]]. The act also established the position of [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and simplified the chain of command. Additionally, the act states that the chairman and vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff cannot be representatives from the same service branch. It increased the ability of the chairman to direct overall strategy, but provided greater command authority to \"unified\" and \"specified\" field commanders.  According to the act, the chairman ''may not exercise military command over the Joint Chiefs of Staff or any of the armed forces''.<ref>Section 152c of the Act</ref>\n\nSection 162(b) of the act prescribes that \"unless otherwise directed by the president, the chain of command to a unified or specified combatant command runs\u2014\n\n# \"from the president to the secretary of defense,\" and\n# \"from the secretary of defense to the commander of the combatant command\".<ref>Goldwater\u2013Nicholls DOD Reorganization Act, 10 USC 162, Combatant Commands; Assigned Forces; Chain of Command, Section (b), Chain of Command.</ref>\n\n===Interaction of services===\nGoldwater\u2013Nichols changed the way the services interact. The services themselves \"organize, train and equip\" forces for use by the [[combatant commander]]s (CCDRs), and the service chiefs no longer exercise any operational control over their forces. Rather than reporting to a service chief operationally, the service component forces support the commander responsible for a specific function ([[United States Special Operations Command|special operations]], [[United States Strategic Command|strategic]], and [[United States Transportation Command|transportation]]) or a geographic region of the globe ([[United States Northern Command|Northern]], [[United States Central Command|Central]], [[United States European Command|European]], [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific]], [[United States Southern Command|Southern]], and [[United States Africa Command|Africa]] Commands). The combatant commanders then field a force capable of employing AirLand Battle doctrine (or its successors) using all assets available to the integrated unified action plan, including the military, interagency organizations of the US Government such as USAID and the Department of State, and intelligence agencies. The restructuring afforded a combination of effort, integrated planning, shared procurement, and a reduction or elimination of inter-service rivalry. It also provided unity of command, conforming with leading [[military science]]. Individual services changed from relatively autonomous war-fighting entities into organizational and training units, responsible for acquisition, modernization, force-development, and readiness as a component of the integrated force. Thus [[USCENTCOM]] (U.S. Central Command), for example, would be assigned air, ground, naval, Marine, and special operations assets to achieve its objectives, not the previously less efficient method of individual services planning, supporting, and fighting the same war. This was successfully demonstrated during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n===Personnel management of officers===\nAnother major effect of the Act is the way it has dramatically changed the personnel management of military officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title10/html/USCODE-2011-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap38-sec661.htm|title=U.S.C. Title 10 - ARMED FORCES|website=www.gpo.gov}}</ref> Many officers are assigned to joint duty positions (occasionally more than once), and are educated in Department of Defense [[Joint Professional Military Education]] (JPME) schools as part of their career development and progression. For example, in order to be competitive for promotion to general or flag officer (admiral) (pay grade O-7 or above/NATO OF-6), active component colonels (pay grade O-6/NATO OF-5) (Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force) or Navy captains must have completed at least one joint duty assignment, as well as having completed (or currently be enrolled in) a JPME school that grants JPME Level II credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2155|title=10 U.S. Code \u00a7 2155 - Joint professional military education Phase II program of instruction|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n===Shared procurement===\nShared procurement allowed the various branches to share technological advances such as [[stealth technology|stealth]] and [[smart bomb|smart weapons]] quickly, and provided other ancillary benefits (such as improved interoperability of radios and communications between units and members of different services). Joint implementation of new technology allowed for joint development of supporting doctrine. The Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act could be seen as the initial step of the currently ongoing [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) with its concept of [[Network Centric Warfare]] (NCW).\n\n==Changes since 1986==\nOn October 24, 2002, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] ordered that the functional and regional commanders be referred to not as \"[[Commander-in-chief|CINCs]]\" but as \"combatant commanders\" when applied to \"unified\" regional organizations (e.g., USCENTCOM), or \"commander\" when talking about \"specified\" units such as the U.S. Strategic Command ([[USSTRATCOM]]). Rumsfeld said the term \"CINC\" was inappropriate, notwithstanding its employment for many decades, because under the United States Constitution, the president is the Nation's only C[[commander-in-chief|ommander-in-Chief]]. His decision was described as intending to clarify and strengthen the [[Civilian control of the military|military's subordination to civilian government]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Garamone|first=Jim|url= http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42568|title='CINC' Is Sunk|work=defenselink.mil|publisher=[[American Forces Press Service]]|date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2016-11-20}}</ref>\n\nOn November 10, 2015, Senator [[John McCain]] announced at a hearing of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], the beginning of a new effort to \"reconsider, and possibly update\" Goldwater\u2013Nichols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/15-85%20-%2011-10-15.pdf|title=Hearing to Receive Testimony on 30 Years of Goldwater-Nichols Reform|publisher=Alderson Reporting Company|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2016-01-12}}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2016, the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] issued a memorandum directing an internal review with the objective \"to make recommendations for updates or adjustments to organizational relationships and authorities\" based on 30 years of experience under Goldwater\u2013Nichols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidedefense.com//sites/insidedefense.com/files/documents/jan2016/01112016_dcmo.pdf|title=Review of the Organization and Responsibilities of the DoD|publisher=Inside Defense|date=2016-01-04|accessdate=2016-01-12}}</ref>\n\nOn April 5, 2016, Defense Secretary [[Ash Carter]] outlined reforms in a speech at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/event/160405_breaking_new_ground_transcript.pdf|title=Breaking New Ground: Preparing DoD for the Future with Secretary Ash Carter [Transcript]|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|date=2016-04-05|accessdate=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n===Sources===\n* Bourne, Chistopher.

The services themselves \"organize, train and equip\" forces for use by the [[combatant commander]]s (CCDRs), and the service chiefs no longer exercise any operational control over their forces. Rather than reporting to a service chief operationally, the service component forces support the commander responsible for a specific function ([[United States Special Operations Command|special operations]], [[United States Strategic Command|strategic]], and [[United States Transportation Command|transportation]]) or a geographic region of the globe ([[United States Northern Command|Northern]], [[United States Central Command|Central]], [[United States European Command|European]], [[United States Pacific Command|Pacific]], [[United States Southern Command|Southern]], and [[United States Africa Command|Africa]] Commands).

Individual services changed from relatively autonomous war-fighting entities into organizational and training units, responsible for acquisition, modernization, force-development, and readiness as a component of the integrated force. Thus [[USCENTCOM]] (U.S. Central Command), for example, would be assigned air, ground, naval, Marine, and special operations assets to achieve its objectives, not the previously less efficient method of individual services planning, supporting, and fighting the same war. This was successfully demonstrated during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n===Personnel management of officers===\nAnother major effect of the Act is the way it has dramatically changed the personnel management of military officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title10/html/USCODE-2011-title10-subtitleA-partII-chap38-sec661.htm|title=U.S.C. Title 10 - ARMED FORCES|website=www.gpo.gov}}</ref> Many officers are assigned to joint duty positions (occasionally more than once), and are educated in Department of Defense [[Joint Professional Military Education]] (JPME) schools as part of their career development and progression. For example, in order to be competitive for promotion to general or flag officer (admiral) (pay grade O-7 or above/NATO OF-6), active component colonels (pay grade O-6/NATO OF-5) (Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force) or Navy captains must have completed at least one joint duty assignment, as well as having completed (or currently be enrolled in) a JPME school that grants JPME Level II credit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/2155|title=10 U.S. Code \u00a7 2155 - Joint professional military education Phase II program of instruction|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\n===Shared procurement===\nShared procurement allowed the various branches to share technological advances such as [[stealth technology|stealth]] and [[smart bomb|smart weapons]] quickly, and provided other ancillary benefits (such as improved interoperability of radios and communications between units and members of different services). Joint implementation of new technology allowed for joint development of supporting doctrine. The Goldwater\u2013Nichols Act could be seen as the initial step of the currently ongoing [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) with its concept of [[Network Centric Warfare]] (NCW).\n\n==Changes since 1986==\nOn October 24, 2002, Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] ordered that the functional and regional commanders be referred to not as \"[[Commander-in-chief|CINCs]]\" but as \"combatant commanders\" when applied to \"unified\" regional organizations (e.g., USCENTCOM), or \"commander\" when talking about \"specified\" units such as the U.S. Strategic Command ([[USSTRATCOM]]). Rumsfeld said the term \"CINC\" was inappropriate, notwithstanding its employment for many decades, because under the United States Constitution, the president is the Nation's only C[[commander-in-chief|ommander-in-Chief]]. His decision was described as intending to clarify and strengthen the [[Civilian control of the military|military's subordination to civilian government]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Garamone|first=Jim|url= http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=42568|title='CINC' Is Sunk|work=defenselink.mil|publisher=[[American Forces Press Service]]|date=2002-10-25|accessdate=2016-11-20}}</ref>\n\nOn November 10, 2015, Senator [[John McCain]] announced at a hearing of the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]], the beginning of a new effort to \"reconsider, and possibly update\" Goldwater\u2013Nichols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/15-85%20-%2011-10-15.pdf|title=Hearing to Receive Testimony on 30 Years of Goldwater-Nichols Reform|publisher=Alderson Reporting Company|date=2015-11-10|accessdate=2016-01-12}}</ref>\n\nOn January 4, 2016, the [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] issued a memorandum directing an internal review with the objective \"to make recommendations for updates or adjustments to organizational relationships and authorities\" based on 30 years of experience under Goldwater\u2013Nichols.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidedefense.com//sites/insidedefense.com/files/documents/jan2016/01112016_dcmo.pdf|title=Review of the Organization and Responsibilities of the DoD|publisher=Inside Defense|date=2016-01-04|accessdate=2016-01-12}}</ref>\n\nOn April 5, 2016, Defense Secretary [[Ash Carter]] outlined reforms in a speech at the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/event/160405_breaking_new_ground_transcript.pdf|title=Breaking New Ground: Preparing DoD for the Future with Secretary Ash Carter [Transcript]|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|date=2016-04-05|accessdate=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n===Sources===\n* Bourne, Chistopher.

Its main research is devoted to dynamic studies of chemical and biochemical reactions in liquids next to different solid-state applications. With a powerful laser as pump source, it permits studies with femtosecond time resolution exploiting different observables via a suite of hard X-ray tools (which may be further expanded over time):\n\n * X-ray diffraction (XRD)\n * X-ray diffuse scattering (XDS), or wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)\n * X-ray emission spectroscopies (XES): non-resonant, or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS)\n * X-ray absorption spectroscopies: X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), or extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)\n\n=== Single Particles, Clusters, and Biomolecules & Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SPB/SFX) ===\n\n=== Spectroscopy and Coherent Scattering (SCS) ===\n\n=== Small Quantum Systems (SQS) ===\nThe SQS instrument is developed to investigate fundamental processes of light-matter interaction in the soft X-ray wavelength radiation.

The [[wavelength]] of the X-ray laser may be varied from 0.05 to 4.7&nbsp;nm, enabling measurements at the [[atom]]ic length scale.<ref name=\"factsandfigures\" />\n\nInitially, one [[photon]] beamline with two experimental stations can be used.<ref name=\"factsandfigures\" /> Later this will be upgraded to five photon beamlines and a total of ten experimental stations.<ref name=\"howitworks\">{{cite web|url=https://www.xfel.eu/facility/overview/how_it_works/index_eng.html|title=How it works|accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe experimental beamlines enable unique scientific experiments using the high intensity, coherence and time structure of the new source to be conducted in a variety of disciplines spanning [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[biology]] and [[nanotechnology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.xfel.eu/science/index_eng.html|title=Science|accessdate=4 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:European XFEL DESY Beschleunigermodule 1.jpg|thumb|Accelerator modules during construction in 2015]]\nThe [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] granted permission to build the facility on 5 June 2007 at a cost of \u20ac850 million, under the provision that it should be financed as a European project.<ref>{{cite web |title=Launch of the European XFEL|url=http://hasylab.desy.de/news__events/announcements/archive/archive_of_2007/launch_of_the_european_xfel_project_june_5_2007/index_eng.html}}</ref> The European XFEL [[GmbH]] that built and operates the facility was founded in 2009.<ref>European XFEL news: [https://www.xfel.eu/news_and_events/news/index_eng.html?openDirectAnchor=1352 \"HRB 111165: The European XFEL GmbH has been founded!\"]</ref> Civil construction of the facility began on 8 January 2009.
