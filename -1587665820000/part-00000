{"title_page": "List of streets in George Town, Penang", "text_new": "[[Image:Beach Street Penang Dec 2006 014 remake.svg|thumb|500px|Plan of [[Beach Street, George Town|Beach Street]] and side streets]]\n[[Image:Beach Street Penang Dec 2006 004.jpg|thumb|CIMB Bank Berhad Tanjung Branch on Beach Street]]\n[[Image:Georgetown Penang December 2007 002.jpg|thumb|Old colonial buildings in a street in George Town, Penang, opposite the entrance to the Leong San Tong Khoo Kongsi temple]]\nThe '''street names''' of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]] reflect the multicultural heritage of the city, the capital of the former [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Straits Settlements|settlement]] of [[Penang]], now part of [[Malaysia]].\n\nMost streets in the city were built and named during the colonial era, and the historic [[English language|English]] names generally remain and are still used by most Penangites. Since the passage of the National Language Act 1967, government policy has been to use the [[Malay language]] for all official purposes, and the Malay translations of the street names are the primary official versions that are used on street signs, now supplemented with names in English (and, in some places, Chinese, Tamil and Arabic).\n\n== Changes in street names ==\nSince independence, there have been some changes to the official names of some streets. On the whole, however, like [[Singapore]] and unlike many other cities in Malaysia, George Town has retained most of its colonial street names, although they used to be indicated on street signs only in their Malay translations.\n\nUntil 2007, street signs in George Town were only written in Malay, as a result of the national language policy. Unfortunately, this had the effect of confusing tourists, who found it difficult to match the English names commonly used by Penangites with the Malay names on street signs which were often very different. In the case of proper nouns, the English name is easily recognisable, e.g. Kimberley Street is ''Lebuh Kimberley''. In other cases, however, the Malay translation may be unfamiliar to those who do not speak the language, e.g. Church St is literally translated as ''Lebuh Gereja'' (from the [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] ''igreja''). A few streets have been given completely new names in Malay.\n\nEven where official street names have changed, the local population have largely continued informally to use the old names when referring to streets. This is partly because the new names are often unwieldy (e.g. Green Lane vs ''Jalan Masjid Negeri'', [[Pitt Street, George Town|Pitt Street]] vs ''Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling'', or [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] vs ''Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah''), but also reflects a strong conservatism in the local population, who see Penang's colonial history as part of their local identity. When Scott Road was renamed ''Jalan D S Ramanathan'', after the first Mayor of the City of George Town, the new street signs were repeatedly defaced and had to be replaced several times, eventually forcing the city authorities to fix a replacement street sign fifteen feet up a lamppost (instead of at waist-height, as was then usual).\n\n== Street sign design ==\n[[Image:Market Cross, George Town, Penang.jpg|thumb|Colonial-era street sign at Market Cross]]\n\n[[Image:Lebuh Armenian Penang Dec 2006 002.jpg|thumb|National-language street sign at [[Armenian Street, George Town|Armenian Street]] (''Lebuh Armenian'')]]\n\n[[Image:Victoria St, George Town, Penang.jpg|thumb|New bilingual street sign at Victoria Street (''Lebuh Victoria'')]]\n\n[[Image:China St Ghaut, George Town, Penang.jpg|thumb|New multilingual street sign at China Street Ghaut (''Gat Lebuh China'')]]\n\nThe oldest street signs in the centre of George Town are rectangular and made of painted metal plate (blue with white lettering), usually affixed to corner shop-houses at the top of the ground floor, and many can still be seen. In the suburbs, rectangular cast-iron signs with indented corners (white with black lettering and edging) in English and sometimes [[Jawi script]], fixed at head-height to a black iron pole surmounted with a finial, could also be seen. Almost all of these have been replaced by the modern road signs.\n\nBy 2007, rectangular reflective road signs (green with white lettering) in the Malay [[Latin alphabet|Rumi script]] had largely replaced the older signs. These were initially at waist-height, fixed to two black metal supports, and subsequently at head-height, fixed to a single black metal support. These signs also indicated the postal town and [[postcode]].\n\nSince 2007, new bilingual reflective street signs based on the old suburban signs have started to replace the Malay-only street signs. These are partly based on the old white signs, and are rectangular with indented corners (green with white lettering) and mounted at head-height to a black iron pole surmounted with an onion dome. The street name is given in Malay and English, together with the town and postcode.\n\nIn June 2007, while Penang was under the rule of [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]], street signs in Chinese were illegally set up by Penang's [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) Socialist Youth division along several roads in George Town under the justification it helps attract tourists from China, only to be removed by the [[Municipal Council of Penang Island|Penang Municipal Council]].<ref name=\"DAP and Gerakan nak\">{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/22/nation/21882573 |title=Gerakan puts up road names in Chinese as reminders to state govt |accessdate=2008-07-25 |author=Tan Sin Chow |date=2008-07-22 |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star Online]] }}</ref>\n\nOn July 22, 2008, following DAP's [[Malaysian general election, 2008|electoral victory]] in Penang and George Town's entry into [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]] list, Gerakan was reported to have placed Chinese-language on existing street signs at six roads, claiming the signs were now vital with George Town's recognition by UNESCO and serve as a reminder to DAP of its earlier promises to erect such signs if voted into office.<ref name=\"DAP and Gerakan nak\"/> DAP Socialist Youth National Organizing secretary [[Koay Teng Hai]] had also proposed to include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Jawi script|Jawi]] translations, depending on the cultural background of the area, along with Chinese street names.<ref name=\"DAP and Gerakan nak\"/>\n\nDespite opposition from Malay political parties and individuals at state and federal levels, the bilingual street signs with Chinese, Arabic and Tamil names were put up in November 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/11/22/nation/2617837&sec=nation |title=Multilingual road signs put up to boost Penang's tourism |accessdate=2008-12-31 |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] }}</ref> These multilingual road signs remain in use to this day.\n\n== Standard translations ==\n[[Image:Beach Street Penang Dec 2006 001.jpg|thumb|The remaining wing of the old Penang Secretariat on Beach Street]]\nIn translating the English words for street, road, lane, etc., the city authorities follow a fairly regular system to avoid confusion between many streets of similar names. There are exceptions to this rule where the historic Malay usage is different and there is no chance of confusion, e.g. Hutton Lane has always been known as ''Jalan Hutton'' (see e.g. the ''Mesjid Jalan Hatin'' (mosque) there) rather than *''Lorong Hutton''.\n\n*Avenue - ''Lebuhraya'' (e.g. Peel Avenue/''Lebuhraya Peel''; context usually prevents confusion with the normal meaning of ''lebuhraya'', viz. highway/expressway)\n*Circus - ''Lilitan'' (e.g. Hargreaves Circus/''Lilitan Hargreaves'')\n*Close - ''Solok'' (e.g. Scott Close/''Solok Scott'')\n*Court - ''Halaman'' (e.g. Cantonment Court/''Halaman Cantonment'')\n*Crescent - ''Lengkok'' (e.g. Jesselton Crescent/''Lengkok Jesselton'')\n*Cross - ''Lintang'' (e.g. Burmah Cross/''Lintang Burma'')\n*Drive - ''Persiaran'' (e.g. [[Gurney Drive, George Town|Gurney Drive]]/''Pesiaran Gurney'')\n*Gardens - ''Taman'' (e.g. Western Gardens/''Taman Western'')\n*Lane - ''Lorong'' (e.g. Prangin Lane/''Lorong Perangin'')\n*Place - ''Pesara'' (e.g. Claimant Place/''Pesara Claimant'')\n*Quay - ''Pengkalan'' (e.g. [[Weld Quay, George Town|Weld Quay]]/''Pengkalan Weld'')\n*Road - ''Jalan'' (e.g. Perak Road/''Jalan Perak'')\n*Square - ''Medan'' (e.g. College Square/''Medan Maktab''; also used for some new square-shaped roads that are not open squares, e.g. York Square/''Medan York'')\n*Street - ''Lebuh'' (e.g. Campbell Street/''Lebuh Campbell'')\n*Street Ghaut - ''Gat Lebuh'' (e.g. China Street Ghaut/''Gat Lebuh China'')\n*Terrace - ''Tingkat'' (e.g. Erskine Terrace/''Tingkat Erskine'')\n\nThe word \"Ghaut\" at the end of some street names reflects the fact that they are extensions of the original streets beyond the original waterfront at Beach St with the reclamation of the Ghauts and the construction of [[Weld Quay, George Town|Weld Quay]], ''[[ghats|ghat]]'' being a [[Hindi]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word meaning a flight of steps leading down to a body of water.\n\n== List of street names ==\nThis list is by no means exhaustive.

Since the passage of the National Language Act 1967, government policy has been to use the [[Malay language]] for all official purposes, and the Malay translations of the street names are the primary official versions that are used on street signs, now supplemented with names in English (and, in some places, Chinese, Tamil and Arabic).\n\n== Changes in street names ==\nSince independence, there have been some changes to the official names of some streets. On the whole, however, like [[Singapore]] and unlike many other cities in Malaysia, George Town has retained most of its colonial street names, although they used to be indicated on street signs only in their Malay translations.\n\nUntil 2007, street signs in George Town were only written in Malay, as a result of the national language policy. Unfortunately, this had the effect of confusing tourists, who found it difficult to match the English names commonly used by Penangites with the Malay names on street signs which were often very different. In the case of proper nouns, the English name is easily recognisable, e.g. Kimberley Street is ''Lebuh Kimberley''. In other cases, however, the Malay translation may be unfamiliar to those who do not speak the language, e.g. Church St is literally translated as ''Lebuh Gereja'' (from the [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] ''igreja''). A few streets have been given completely new names in Malay.\n\nEven where official street names have changed, the local population have largely continued informally to use the old names when referring to streets. This is partly because the new names are often unwieldy (e.g. Green Lane vs ''Jalan Masjid Negeri'', [[Pitt Street, George Town|Pitt Street]] vs ''Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling'', or [[Northam Road, George Town|Northam Road]] vs ''Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah''), but also reflects a strong conservatism in the local population, who see Penang's colonial history as part of their local identity. When Scott Road was renamed ''Jalan D S Ramanathan'', after the first Mayor of the City of George Town, the new street signs were repeatedly defaced and had to be replaced several times, eventually forcing the city authorities to fix a replacement street sign fifteen feet up a lamppost (instead of at waist-height, as was then usual).\n\n== Street sign design ==\n[[Image:Market Cross, George Town, Penang.jpg|thumb|Colonial-era street sign at Market Cross]]\n\n[[Image:Lebuh Armenian Penang Dec 2006 002.jpg|thumb|National-language street sign at [[Armenian Street, George Town|Armenian Street]] (''Lebuh Armenian'')]]\n\n[[Image:Victoria St, George Town, Penang.jpg|thumb|New bilingual street sign at Victoria Street (''Lebuh Victoria'')]]\n\n[[Image:China St Ghaut, George Town, Penang.jpg|thumb|New multilingual street sign at China Street Ghaut (''Gat Lebuh China'')]]\n\nThe oldest street signs in the centre of George Town are rectangular and made of painted metal plate (blue with white lettering), usually affixed to corner shop-houses at the top of the ground floor, and many can still be seen. In the suburbs, rectangular cast-iron signs with indented corners (white with black lettering and edging) in English and sometimes [[Jawi script]], fixed at head-height to a black iron pole surmounted with a finial, could also be seen. Almost all of these have been replaced by the modern road signs.\n\nBy 2007, rectangular reflective road signs (green with white lettering) in the Malay [[Latin alphabet|Rumi script]] had largely replaced the older signs. These were initially at waist-height, fixed to two black metal supports, and subsequently at head-height, fixed to a single black metal support. These signs also indicated the postal town and [[postcode]].\n\nSince 2007, new bilingual reflective street signs based on the old suburban signs have started to replace the Malay-only street signs. These are partly based on the old white signs, and are rectangular with indented corners (green with white lettering) and mounted at head-height to a black iron pole surmounted with an onion dome. The street name is given in Malay and English, together with the town and postcode.\n\nIn June 2007, while Penang was under the rule of [[Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia|Gerakan]], street signs in Chinese were illegally set up by Penang's [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) Socialist Youth division along several roads in George Town under the justification it helps attract tourists from China, only to be removed by the [[Municipal Council of Penang Island|Penang Municipal Council]].<ref name=\"DAP and Gerakan nak\">{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/22/nation/21882573 |title=Gerakan puts up road names in Chinese as reminders to state govt |accessdate=2008-07-25 |author=Tan Sin Chow |date=2008-07-22 |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star Online]] }}</ref>\n\nOn July 22, 2008, following DAP's [[Malaysian general election, 2008|electoral victory]] in Penang and George Town's entry into [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]] list, Gerakan was reported to have placed Chinese-language on existing street signs at six roads, claiming the signs were now vital with George Town's recognition by UNESCO and serve as a reminder to DAP of its earlier promises to erect such signs if voted into office.<ref name=\"DAP and Gerakan nak\"/> DAP Socialist Youth National Organizing secretary [[Koay Teng Hai]] had also proposed to include [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Jawi script|Jawi]] translations, depending on the cultural background of the area, along with Chinese street names.<ref name=\"DAP and Gerakan nak\"/>\n\nDespite opposition from Malay political parties and individuals at state and federal levels, the bilingual street signs with Chinese, Arabic and Tamil names were put up in November 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/11/22/nation/2617837&sec=nation |title=Multilingual road signs put up to boost Penang's tourism |accessdate=2008-12-31 |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)]] }}</ref> These multilingual road signs remain in use to this day.\n\n== Standard translations ==\n[[Image:Beach Street Penang Dec 2006 001.jpg|thumb|The remaining wing of the old Penang Secretariat on Beach Street]]\nIn translating the English words for street, road, lane, etc., the city authorities follow a fairly regular system to avoid confusion between many streets of similar names. There are exceptions to this rule where the historic Malay usage is different and there is no chance of confusion, e.g. Hutton Lane has always been known as ''Jalan Hutton'' (see e.g. the ''Mesjid Jalan Hatin'' (mosque) there) rather than *''Lorong Hutton''.\n\n*Avenue - ''Lebuhraya'' (e.g. Peel Avenue/''Lebuhraya Peel''; context usually prevents confusion with the normal meaning of ''lebuhraya'', viz. highway/expressway)\n*Circus - ''Lilitan'' (e.g. Hargreaves Circus/''Lilitan Hargreaves'')\n*Close - ''Solok'' (e.g. Scott Close/''Solok Scott'')\n*Court - ''Halaman'' (e.g. Cantonment Court/''Halaman Cantonment'')\n*Crescent - ''Lengkok'' (e.g. Jesselton Crescent/''Lengkok Jesselton'')\n*Cross - ''Lintang'' (e.g. Burmah Cross/''Lintang Burma'')\n*Drive - ''Persiaran'' (e.g. [[Gurney Drive, George Town|Gurney Drive]]/''Pesiaran Gurney'')\n*Gardens - ''Taman'' (e.g. Western Gardens/''Taman Western'')\n*Lane - ''Lorong'' (e.g. Prangin Lane/''Lorong Perangin'')\n*Place - ''Pesara'' (e.g. Claimant Place/''Pesara Claimant'')\n*Quay - ''Pengkalan'' (e.g. [[Weld Quay, George Town|Weld Quay]]/''Pengkalan Weld'')\n*Road - ''Jalan'' (e.g. Perak Road/''Jalan Perak'')\n*Square - ''Medan'' (e.g. College Square/''Medan Maktab''; also used for some new square-shaped roads that are not open squares, e.g. York Square/''Medan York'')\n*Street - ''Lebuh'' (e.g. Campbell Street/''Lebuh Campbell'')\n*Street Ghaut - ''Gat Lebuh'' (e.g. China Street Ghaut/''Gat Lebuh China'')\n*Terrace - ''Tingkat'' (e.g. Erskine Terrace/''Tingkat Erskine'')\n\nThe word \"Ghaut\" at the end of some street names reflects the fact that they are extensions of the original streets beyond the original waterfront at Beach St with the reclamation of the Ghauts and the construction of [[Weld Quay, George Town|Weld Quay]], ''[[ghats|ghat]]'' being a [[Hindi]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]] word meaning a flight of steps leading down to a body of water.\n\n== List of street names ==\nThis list is by no means exhaustive.

Founded by Michael Barker, [[Tom Bernard]], and Marcie Bloom, Orion Classics' original focus was on acquiring [[independent film|independent]] and [[world cinema|foreign]] [[foreign film|films]] for North American distribution, in addition to producing some arthouse films of its own. It was launched in 1982 when Barker, Bernard and [[Donna Gigliotti]] moved from [[United Artists|UA Classics]], a United Artists specialty division.\n\nAmong its most notable films were ''[[Babette's Feast]]'', [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]'s ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'', [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Mystery Train]]'' and [[Richard Linklater]]'s ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. \n\n==History==\nOrion Classics was formed by Orion Pictures in 1982 as an autonomous division for specialty films. United Artists Classics executives, [[Tom Bernard]], Michael Barker and Donna Gigliotti, having a dispute with its parent United Artists left to fill Orion Classic's executive ranks, thus mirroring Orion Pictures' formation. With the UA Classics executives, the division had built in connection with the art house film community. While the three executives had different titles and responsibilities they acted as all having the same responsibilities.<ref name=Unknown>{{cite book |last1=Tzioumakis |first1=Yannis |title=Unknown: Classics Divisions, Specialty Labels and American Independent Cinema |date=2012 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748649594 |pages=65-78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djarBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA82&dq=orion%20classics&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=orion%20classics&f=false |accessdate=April 11, 2019 |language=en |chapter=Orion Classics (1983 to 1997)}}</ref>\n\nThe division took on the early UA Classic [[Modus operandi]] of frugal marketing spending and strict staggered releasing with few prints. Thus 10 to 50 prints would be made based on its potential success with an average marketing budget of $225,000 would be first released in New York City before moving on to other metropolitan areas and given time to find its position.<ref name=Unknown/>\n\nThe team was able to get French filmmaker [[Eric Rohmer]] to switch from UA Classics to Orion. He was then the source of its first film and box office hit with ''Pauline at the Beach'' in July 1983. Thus Orion Classic released four out of five of Rohmer's 1980s films and investing in a few of them. Orion's last acquisition in 1983 was its first independent US movie, ''Strangers Kiss'' (1984).<ref name=Unknown/>\n\nIn August 1983, the company had indicated that they would be into production of its own material by late 1984 or early 1985. However, Orion Pictures was having more box office failures then successes thus those plans were put on hold.<ref name=Unknown/>\n\n\nIn late 1991, when Orion Pictures was in serious financial trouble, Barker, Bernard, and Bloom left Orion Classics, taking the rights to the highly anticipated [[Merchant Ivory Productions]] adaptation of ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'' with them; at the invite of former Orion president [[Mike Medavoy]], who was now relocated at [[TriStar Pictures]], the three set up [[Sony Pictures Classics]], with ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'' as the company's first release. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, [[Metromedia]] acquired Orion, and merged the classics division into [[the Samuel Goldwyn Company]]. Both Orion and SGC were sold to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1997, with the latter's function of producing and/or distributing independent films being assumed by MGM's [[United Artists]] division.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Orion Classics would be revived as a multiplatform distribution label, with 8 to 10 films being released per year. Orion Classics will be MGM's method of getting into the day-and-date theatrical-VOD business. The label's first film is Mike P. Nelson's ''[[The Domestics]]'', which was released in theaters on June 28, 2018 and on VOD and digital the next day.<ref name=thr>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgm-relaunches-orion-classics-as-multiplatform-distribution-label-1113714|title=MGM Relaunches Orion Classics as Multiplatform Distribution Label|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first= Pamela |last=McClintock |date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

[[Orion Pictures]]. Founded by Michael Barker, [[Tom Bernard]], and Marcie Bloom, Orion Classics' original focus was on acquiring [[independent film|independent]] and [[world cinema|foreign]] [[foreign film|films]] for North American distribution, in addition to producing some arthouse films of its own. It was launched in 1982 when Barker, Bernard and [[Donna Gigliotti]] moved from [[United Artists|UA Classics]], a United Artists specialty division.\n\nAmong its most notable films were ''[[Babette's Feast]]'', [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]]'s ''[[Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown]]'', [[Jim Jarmusch]]'s ''[[Mystery Train]]'' and [[Richard Linklater]]'s ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''. \n\n==History==\nOrion Classics was formed by Orion Pictures in 1982 as an autonomous division for specialty films. United Artists Classics executives, [[Tom Bernard]], Michael Barker and Donna Gigliotti, having a dispute with its parent United Artists left to fill Orion Classic's executive ranks, thus mirroring Orion Pictures' formation. With the UA Classics executives, the division had built in connection with the art house film community. While the three executives had different titles and responsibilities they acted as all having the same responsibilities.<ref name=Unknown>{{cite book |last1=Tzioumakis |first1=Yannis |title=Unknown: Classics Divisions, Specialty Labels and American Independent Cinema |date=2012 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=9780748649594 |pages=65-78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=djarBgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA82&dq=orion%20classics&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=orion%20classics&f=false |accessdate=April 11, 2019 |language=en |chapter=Orion Classics (1983 to 1997)}}</ref>\n\nThe division took on the early UA Classic [[Modus operandi]] of frugal marketing spending and strict staggered releasing with few prints. Thus 10 to 50 prints would be made based on its potential success with an average marketing budget of $225,000 would be first released in New York City before moving on to other metropolitan areas and given time to find its position.<ref name=Unknown/>\n\nThe team was able to get French filmmaker [[Eric Rohmer]] to switch from UA Classics to Orion. He was then the source of its first film and box office hit with ''Pauline at the Beach'' in July 1983. Thus Orion Classic released four out of five of Rohmer's 1980s films and investing in a few of them. Orion's last acquisition in 1983 was its first independent US movie, ''Strangers Kiss'' (1984).<ref name=Unknown/>\n\nIn August 1983, the company had indicated that they would be into production of its own material by late 1984 or early 1985. However, Orion Pictures was having more box office failures then successes thus those plans were put on hold.<ref name=Unknown/>\n\n\nIn late 1991, when Orion Pictures was in serious financial trouble, Barker, Bernard, and Bloom left Orion Classics, taking the rights to the highly anticipated [[Merchant Ivory Productions]] adaptation of ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'' with them; at the invite of former Orion president [[Mike Medavoy]], who was now relocated at [[TriStar Pictures]], the three set up [[Sony Pictures Classics]], with ''[[Howards End (film)|Howards End]]'' as the company's first release. \n\nIn the mid-1990s, [[Metromedia]] acquired Orion, and merged the classics division into [[the Samuel Goldwyn Company]]. Both Orion and SGC were sold to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1997, with the latter's function of producing and/or distributing independent films being assumed by MGM's [[United Artists]] division.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Orion Classics would be revived as a multiplatform distribution label, with 8 to 10 films being released per year. Orion Classics will be MGM's method of getting into the day-and-date theatrical-VOD business. The label's first film is Mike P. Nelson's ''[[The Domestics]]'', which was released in theaters on June 28, 2018 and on VOD and digital the next day.<ref name=thr>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mgm-relaunches-orion-classics-as-multiplatform-distribution-label-1113714|title=MGM Relaunches Orion Classics as Multiplatform Distribution Label|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |first= Pamela |last=McClintock |date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted.

Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} He further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Pegg notes that Bowie reflects on his inability to achieve success up to that point, being taken down \"a million dead-end streets\" and every time he thought he'd made it \"it seemed the taste was not so sweet.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg identifies the line \"I turned myself to face me\" as mirroring Bowie's encounter with himself in ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} His identification of himself as the 'faker' gives him anxiety, believing that he is \"much too fast\" to be affected by how others' opinion of him. Pegg summarises the lyrics as Bowie \"holding a mirror to his face\" just as he's about to achieve stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"Oh!

and as a single on 7 January 1972. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s. This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in the US two years prior. \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. It is one of four of Bowie's songs to be included in [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll]]. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 2016.\n\nIt charted for the first time on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 15 January 2016 at number 49 following Bowie's death.\n\n==Composition and recording==\n\"Changes\" was written by Bowie in the summer of 1971 and recorded around the same time at [[Trident Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=223\u2013225}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], he recorded it with pianist [[Rick Wakeman]] and the musicians who would later become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]].{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=232}}{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Wakeman was asked to play during the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' sessions and accepted. He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]], where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} This unreleased demo,{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} featuring Bowie solely on piano, exhibits more \"enthusiasm\" than \"accuracy\" from the artist, along with containing \"breathy 'huh's'\" to a slightly different lyric: \"now I place myself to face me...the weeks still seem the same\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie plays a [[saxophone]] solo on the final recording \u2013 one of his earliest \u2013 which he recollected was recorded \"when I was still going through ideas of using melodic saxophone.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie has said that the track \"started out as a parody of a [[nightclub]] song, a kind of throwaway\".<ref name=\"Raggett AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |title=\"Changes\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=11 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704103816/https://www.allmusic.com/song/changes-mt0052219284 |archive-date=4 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Sound + Vision\">Loder, Kurt Loder; Bowie, David (1989).

You Pretty Things]]\", going up and down a C to D scale. Doggett writes: \"It was as if the piano was scared to rest in one place for more than a couple of beats, in case it would be hemmed in or halted. By restlessly moving, it kept its options open and its spirit alive.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=140}} The song's famous chorus, Bowie stuttering the 'ch' at the beginning of the word 'changes',{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} has been compared to the English rock band [[the Who]],<ref>Blake, Mark (ed.) (2007). \"Future Legend\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.74\u201375</ref> specifically their 1965 song \"[[My Generation]]\" (\"hope I die before I get old\" reads \"pretty soon now you're gonna get older\").{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg also believes there's a sense of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]\" in the lyrics \"time may change me, but I can't trace time\", in that Bowie is speaking up for his own generation against his elders.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Bowie had previously spoken about this in an interview with ''The Times'' in 1968: \"We feel our parents' generation has lost control, given up, they\u2019re scared of the future. \"I feel it's basically their fault that things are so bad.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} While biographer Andy Buckley calls album track \"Life on Mars?\" a parody of [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"[[My Way]]\", he calls \"Changes\" an inversion of it, stating, \"[it's] not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\" in the line \"turn and face the strange\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}}\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=David_Bowie_-_Changes.ogg\n|title=David Bowie \"Changes\" (1971)\n|description=21 second sample from David Bowie's \"Changes\".\n|pos=left}}\n\nThe lyrics focus on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me / Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\").{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=98\u201399}} Buckley writes that 'strange fascination' is a phrase that \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre, but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to afloat artistically.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} He also identifies the line \"look out you rock 'n' rollers' as Bowie \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=99}} He further analysed the lyrics: \"So I turn myself to face me / But I've never caught a glimpse / Of how the others must see the faker / I'm much too fast to take that test\". He writes that these lines elucidate the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} They highlight the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Bowie's future persona Ziggy Stardust. Buckley states: \"Bowie plays up the self-made myth of his butterfly nature, his innate ambivalence, and his endless musical, sexual and political vacillation.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} Pegg notes that Bowie reflects on his inability to achieve success up to that point, being taken down \"a million dead-end streets\" and every time he thought he'd made it \"it seemed the taste was not so sweet.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Pegg identifies the line \"I turned myself to face me\" as mirroring Bowie's encounter with himself in ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' track \"[[The Width of a Circle]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}} Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=98}} His identification of himself as the 'faker' gives him anxiety, believing that he is \"much too fast\" to be affected by how others' opinion of him. Pegg summarises the lyrics as Bowie \"holding a mirror to his face\" just as he's about to achieve stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=101}}\n\nThe song has also been interpreted as touting \"Modern Kids as a New Race\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} a theme echoed on the following album track, \"Oh! You Pretty Things\". ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki/>'s contemporary review of ''Hunky Dory'' considered that \"Changes\" could be \"construed as a young man's attempt to reckon how he'll react when it's his time to be on the maligned side of the generation schism\".<ref name=\"Rolling Stone review\">{{cite web |first=John |last=Mendelsohn |title=Hunky Dory |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=6 January 1972 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |access-date=2 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110180003/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/hunky-dory-19720106 |archive-date=10 November 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Changes\" was released on 17 December 1971 as the opening track on Bowie's fourth studio album ''[[Hunky Dory]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Hunky Dory|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1971|publisher=[[RCA Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8244}}</ref> It was subsequently released as the first single of the album on 7 January 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2160) with fellow album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\" as the B-side;<ref name=\"Single liner notes\" /> it was Bowie's first single released by RCA.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} In France, the B-side was \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", despite the label stating that it was \"Andy Warhol\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=238}} This single has been cited as David Bowie's official US chart debut.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=238}} Upon release, like the album, it flopped commercially, peaking at number 66 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts and failing to chart in the UK.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=40\u201344}} Despite this, it became English disc jockey [[Tony Blackburn]]'s record of the week.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} It wasn't until the success of Bowie's following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972) that recognition was brought upon ''Hunky Dory'' and \"Changes\", which according to Pegg quickly became a \"turntable favorite\" and \"embedded\" itself into the \"pop-culture psyche\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=100}} Commentators have later argued that \"[[Oh!

Musicians during this period believed that the [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], and [[modal jazz]] that had been played before them was too limiting. They became preoccupied with creating something new. Free jazz has often been combined with or substituted for the term \"[[avant-garde jazz]]\". Europeans tend to favor the term \"[[free improvisation]]\". Others have used \"modern jazz\", \"creative music\", and \"art music\".\n\nThe ambiguity of free jazz presents problems of definition. Although it is usually played by small groups or individuals, free jazz big bands have existed. Although musicians and critics claim it is innovative and forward looking, it draws on early styles of jazz and has been described as an attempt to return to primitive, often religious, roots. Although jazz is an American invention, free jazz musicians drew heavily from [[world music]] and ethnic music traditions from around the world. Sometimes they played foreign instruments, unusual instruments, or invented their own. They emphasized emotional intensity and sound for its own sake.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:Ornette Coleman.jpg|thumb|right|Ornette Coleman]]\n[[File:Pharoah Sanders photo.jpg|thumb|right|Pharoah Sanders]]\n\nSome jazz musicians resist any attempt at classification. One difficulty is that most jazz has an element of improvisation. Many musicians draw on free jazz concepts and idioms, and free jazz was never entirely distinct from other genres. But free jazz does have its own characteristics. [[Pharoah Sanders]] and [[John Coltrane]] used harsh overblowing or other extended techniques to elicit unconventional sounds from their instruments. Like other forms of jazz it places an aesthetic premium on expressing the \"voice\" or \"sound\" of the musician, as opposed to the classical tradition in which the performer is seen more as expressing the thoughts of the composer.\n\nEarlier jazz styles typically were built on a framework of song forms, such as [[twelve-bar blues]] or the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar AABA popular song form]] with chord changes. In free jazz, the dependence on a fixed and pre-established form is eliminated, and the role of [[improvisation]] is correspondingly increased.\n\nOther forms of jazz use regular [[metre (music)|meter]]s and pulsed rhythms, usually in 4/4 or (less often) 3/4. Free jazz retains pulsation and sometimes [[Swing music|swing]]s but without regular meter. Frequent [[wikt:accelerando|Accelerando]] and [[ritardando]] give an impression of rhythm that moves like a wave.<ref name=\"Litweiler\">{{cite book |last1=Litweiler |first1=John |title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 |date=1984 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-80377-1 |page=158}}</ref>\n\nPrevious jazz forms used [[harmonic]] structures, usually cycles of [[diatonic]] chords. When improvisation occurred, it was founded on the notes in the chords. Free jazz almost by definition is free of such structures, but also by definition (it is, after all, \"jazz\" as much as it is \"free\") it retains much of the language of earlier jazz playing. It is therefore very common to hear diatonic, [[altered dominant]] and [[blues]] phrases in this music.\n\nGuitarist [[Marc Ribot]] commented that [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Albert Ayler]] \"although they were freeing up certain strictures of bebop, were in fact each developing new structures of composition.\" <ref name=\"Ribot\">{{cite web |title=A Fireside Chat with Marc Ribot |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/a-fireside-chat-with-marc-ribot-marc-ribot-by-aaj-staff.php?page=1 |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=18 December 2018 |date=21 February 2004}}</ref> Some forms use composed melodies as the basis for group performance and improvisation. Free jazz practitioners sometimes use such material. Other compositional structures are employed, some detailed and complex.<ref name=\"Litweiler\" />{{rp|276}}\n\nThe breakdown of form and rhythmic structure has been seen by some critics to coincide with jazz musicians' exposure to and use of elements from non-Western music, especially African, Arabic, and Indian. The atonality of free jazz is often credited by historians and jazz performers to a return to non-tonal music of the nineteenth century, including [[field holler]]s, street cries, and jubilees (part of the \"return to the roots\" element of free jazz). This suggests that perhaps the movement away from tonality was not a conscious effort to devise a formal atonal system, but rather a reflection of the concepts surrounding free jazz. Jazz became \"free\" by removing dependence on chord progressions and instead using [[polytempic]] and [[polyrhythmic]] structures.<ref name=\"Southern\">{{cite book |last1=Southern |first1=Ellen |title=The Music of Black Americans |date=1997 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-97141-4 |pages=494\u2013497 |edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\nRejection of the bop aesthetic was combined with a fascination with earlier styles of jazz, such as [[dixieland]] with its collective improvisation, as well as African music. Interest in ethnic music resulted in the use of instruments from around the world, such as [[Ed Blackwell]]'s West African [[talking drum]], and [[Leon Thomas]]'s interpretation of pygmy yodeling.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=J.

Many argue those recent phenomena such as the landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision in 1954, the emergence of the \"[[Freedom Riders]]\" in 1961, the 1963 [[Freedom Summer]] of activist-supported black voter registration, and the free alternative black [[Freedom Schools]] demonstrate the political implications of the word \"free\" in context of free jazz. Thus many consider free jazz to be not only a rejection of certain musical credos and ideas, but a musical reaction to the oppression and experience of [[black Americans]].<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{cite book |last1=Gioia |first1=Ted |title=The History of Jazz |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia |url-access=registration |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/309 309\u2013311]}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough free jazz is widely considered to begin in the late 1950s, there are compositions that precede this era that have notable connections to the free jazz aesthetic. Some of the works of [[Lennie Tristano]] in the late 1940s, particularly \"[[Intuition (free improvisation)|Intuition]]\", \"Digression\", and \"Descent into the Maelstrom\" exhibit the use of techniques associated with free jazz, such as [[atonal]] collective improvisation and lack of discrete chord changes. Other notable examples of proto-free jazz include ''City of Glass'' written in 1948 by [[Bob Graettinger]] for the [[Stan Kenton]] band and [[Jimmy Giuffre]]'s 1953 \"Fugue\". It can be argued, however, that these works are more representative of [[third stream]] jazz with its references to [[contemporary classical music]] techniques such as [[serialism]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\nKeith Johnson of [[AllMusic]] describes a \"Modern Creative\" genre, in which \"musicians may incorporate free playing into structured modes\u2014or play just about anything.\"<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Keith |title=Modern Creative Music Genre Overview |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/modern-creative-ma0000011987 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=18 December 2018 }}</ref> He includes [[John Zorn]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], [[Tim Berne]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and [[Ray Anderson (musician)|Ray Anderson]] in this genre, which continues \"the tradition of the '50s to '60s free-jazz mode\".<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n[[Ornette Coleman]] rejected pre-written chord changes, believing that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression.

Albums such as ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' and ''[[Change of the Century]]'' marked a radical step beyond his more conventional early work. On these albums, he strayed from the tonal basis that formed the lines of his earlier albums and began truly examining the possibilities of atonal improvisation. The most important recording to the free jazz movement from Coleman during this era, however, came with ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'', recorded in A&R Studios in New York in 1960. It marked an abrupt departure from the highly structured compositions of his past. Recorded with a double quartet separated into left and right channels, ''Free Jazz'' brought a more aggressive, cacophonous texture to Coleman's work, and the record's title would provide the name for the nascent free jazz movement.<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|314}}\n\nPianist [[Cecil Taylor]] was also exploring the possibilities of avant-garde free jazz. A classically trained pianist, Taylor's main influences included [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Horace Silver]], who prove key to Taylor's later unconventional uses of the piano.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|792}} ''Jazz Advance'', his album released in 1956 for Transition showed ties to traditional jazz, albeit with an expanded harmonic vocabulary. But the harmonic freedom of these early releases would lead to his transition into free jazz during the early 1960s. Key to this transformation was the introduction of saxophonist [[Jimmy Lyons]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]] in 1962 because they encouraged more progressive musical language, such as tone clusters and abstracted rhythmic figures. \nOn ''Unit Structures'' (Blue Note, 1966)<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Jim |title=Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians |url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |work=Taylor, Cecil |publisher=Jazz.com |access-date=2014-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701141201/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |archive-date=2014-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Taylor marked his transition to free jazz, as his compositions were composed almost without notated scores, devoid of conventional jazz meter, and harmonic progression. This direction influenced by drummer Andrew Cyrille, who provided rhythmic dynamism outside the conventions of bebop and swing<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|319\u2013320}} Taylor also began exploring classical avant-garde, as in his use of prepared pianos developed by composer John Cage.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|794}}\n\n[[Albert Ayler]] was one of the essential composers and performers during the beginning period of free jazz. He began his career as a bebop tenor saxophonist in Scandinavia, and had already begun pushing the boundaries of tonal jazz and blues to their harmonic limits. He soon began collaborating with notable free jazz musicians, including Cecil Taylor in 1962. He pushed the jazz idiom to its absolute limits, and many of his compositions bear little resemblance to jazz of the past. Ayler's musical language focused on the possibilities of [[microtonal]] improvisation and extended saxophone technique, creating squawks and honks with his instrument to achieve [[multiphonic]] effects. Yet amidst Ayler's progressive techniques, he shows an attachment for simple, rounded melodies reminiscent of [[folk music]], which he explores via his more avant-garde style.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|795\u2013796}} \n\nOne of Ayler's key free jazz recordings is ''[[Spiritual Unity]]'', including his often recorded and most famous composition, ''Ghosts'', in which a simple spiritual-like melody is gradually shifted and distorted through Ayler's unique improvisatory interpretation. Ultimately, Ayler serves as an important example of many ways which free jazz could be interpreted, as he often strays into more tonal areas and melodies while exploring the timbral and textural possibilities within his melodies. In this way, his free jazz is built upon both a progressive attitude towards melody and timbre as well as a desire to examine and recontextualize the music of the past.<ref name=\"Kernfeld\">{{cite book |last1=Kernfeld |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Kernfeld |editor1-first=Barry |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz |date=2002 |publisher=Grove's Dictionaries |location=New York |isbn=1-56159-284-6 |pages=96\u201397 |volume=1 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \n\nIn a 1963 interview with ''Jazz'' Magazine, Coltrane said he felt indebted to Coleman.<ref name=\"Quersin\">{{cite book |last1=Quersin |first1=Benoit |editor1-last=Woideck |editor1-first=Carl |title=The John Coltrane companion : five decades of commentary |date=1998 |publisher=Schirmer Books |isbn=978-0028647906 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 123] |chapter=La Passe Dangereuse (1963) |url=https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 }}</ref> While Coltrane's desire to explore the limits of solo improvisation and the possibilities of innovative form and structure was evident in records like ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', his work owed more to the tradition of [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]].

As evidenced by his compositions on the 1956 record ''[[Sounds of Joy]]'', Sun Ra's early work employed a typical bop style. But he soon foreshadowed the free jazz movements with compositions like \"A Call for All Demons\" off of the 1955-57 record ''[[Angels and Demons at Play]]'', which combines atonal improvisation with Latin-inspired mambo percussion. His period of fully realized free jazz experimentation began in 1965, with the release of ''[[The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra]]'' and ''[[The Magic City (Sun Ra album)|The Magic City]].'' These records placed a musical emphasis on [[timbre]] and texture over meter and harmony, employing a wide variety of [[electronic instrument]]s and innovative [[percussion instrument]]s, including the electric [[Celesta|celeste]], [[Hammond B-3]], bass [[marimba]], harp, and [[timpani]]. As result, Sun Ra proved to be one of the first free jazz musicians to explore electronic instrumentation, as well as displaying an interest in timbral possibilities through his use of progressive and unconventional instrumentation in his compositions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kernfield |first=Barry |title=Sun Ra |url=http://0-www.oxfordmusiconline.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J434800 |work=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe title song of Charles Mingus' ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus (album)|Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'' contained one improvised section in a style unrelated to the song's melody or chord structure.

Arrivals included [[Arthur Blythe]], [[James Newton]], and [[Mark Dresser]], beginning the period of New York loft jazz. As the name may imply, musicians during this time would perform in private homes and other unconventional spaces. The status of free jazz became more complex, as many musicians sought to bring in  different genres into their works. Free jazz no longer necessarily indicated the rejection of tonal melody, overarching harmonic structure, or metrical divide, as laid out by Coleman, Coltrane, and Taylor. Instead, the free jazz that developed in the 1960s became one of many influences, including pop music and world music.<ref name=\"DeVeaux\">{{cite book |last1=DeVeaux |first1=Scott |title=Jazz |date=2009 |publisher=W.W.

Most successful recording artists today construct their works in this way: beginning with a strain with which listeners can relate, following with an entirely free portion, and then returning to the recognizable strain. The pattern may occur several times in a long selection, giving listeners pivotal points to cling to. At this time, listeners accept this \u2013 they can recognize the selection while also appreciating the freedom of the player in other portions.

Musicians during this period believed that the [[bebop]], [[hard bop]], and [[modal jazz]] that had been played before them was too limiting. They became preoccupied with creating something new. Free jazz has often been combined with or substituted for the term \"[[avant-garde jazz]]\". Europeans tend to favor the term \"[[free improvisation]]\". Others have used \"modern jazz\", \"creative music\", and \"art music\".\n\nThe ambiguity of free jazz presents problems of definition. Although it is usually played by small groups or individuals, free jazz big bands have existed. Although musicians and critics claim it is innovative and forward looking, it draws on early styles of jazz and has been described as an attempt to return to primitive, often religious, roots. Although jazz is an American invention, free jazz musicians drew heavily from [[world music]] and ethnic music traditions from around the world. Sometimes they played foreign instruments, unusual instruments, or invented their own. They emphasized emotional intensity and sound for its own sake.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:Ornette Coleman.jpg|thumb|right|Ornette Coleman]]\n[[File:Pharoah Sanders photo.jpg|thumb|right|Pharoah Sanders]]\n\nSome jazz musicians resist any attempt at classification. One difficulty is that most jazz has an element of improvisation. Many musicians draw on free jazz concepts and idioms, and free jazz was never entirely distinct from other genres. But free jazz does have its own characteristics. [[Pharoah Sanders]] and [[John Coltrane]] used harsh overblowing or other extended techniques to elicit unconventional sounds from their instruments. Like other forms of jazz it places an aesthetic premium on expressing the \"voice\" or \"sound\" of the musician, as opposed to the classical tradition in which the performer is seen more as expressing the thoughts of the composer.\n\nEarlier jazz styles typically were built on a framework of song forms, such as [[twelve-bar blues]] or the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar AABA popular song form]] with chord changes. In free jazz, the dependence on a fixed and pre-established form is eliminated, and the role of [[improvisation]] is correspondingly increased.\n\nOther forms of jazz use regular [[metre (music)|meter]]s and pulsed rhythms, usually in 4/4 or (less often) 3/4. Free jazz retains pulsation and sometimes [[Swing music|swing]]s but without regular meter. Frequent [[wikt:accelerando|Accelerando]] and [[ritardando]] give an impression of rhythm that moves like a wave.<ref name=\"Litweiler\">{{cite book |last1=Litweiler |first1=John |title=The Freedom Principle: Jazz After 1958 |date=1984 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=0-306-80377-1 |page=158}}</ref>\n\nPrevious jazz forms used [[harmonic]] structures, usually cycles of [[diatonic]] chords. When improvisation occurred, it was founded on the notes in the chords. Free jazz almost by definition is free of such structures, but also by definition (it is, after all, \"jazz\" as much as it is \"free\") it retains much of the language of earlier jazz playing. It is therefore very common to hear diatonic, [[altered dominant]] and [[blues]] phrases in this music.\n\nGuitarist [[Marc Ribot]] commented that [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Albert Ayler]] \"although they were freeing up certain strictures of bebop, were in fact each developing new structures of composition.\" <ref name=\"Ribot\">{{cite web |title=A Fireside Chat with Marc Ribot |url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/a-fireside-chat-with-marc-ribot-marc-ribot-by-aaj-staff.php?page=1 |website=All About Jazz |accessdate=18 December 2018 |date=21 February 2004}}</ref> Some forms use composed melodies as the basis for group performance and improvisation. Free jazz practitioners sometimes use such material. Other compositional structures are employed, some detailed and complex.<ref name=\"Litweiler\" />{{rp|276}}\n\nThe breakdown of form and rhythmic structure has been seen by some critics to coincide with jazz musicians' exposure to and use of elements from non-Western music, especially African, Arabic, and Indian. The atonality of free jazz is often credited by historians and jazz performers to a return to non-tonal music of the nineteenth century, including [[field holler]]s, street cries, and jubilees (part of the \"return to the roots\" element of free jazz). This suggests that perhaps the movement away from tonality was not a conscious effort to devise a formal atonal system, but rather a reflection of the concepts surrounding free jazz. Jazz became \"free\" by removing dependence on chord progressions and instead using [[polytempic]] and [[polyrhythmic]] structures.<ref name=\"Southern\">{{cite book |last1=Southern |first1=Ellen |title=The Music of Black Americans |date=1997 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-97141-4 |pages=494\u2013497 |edition=3rd}}</ref>\n\nRejection of the bop aesthetic was combined with a fascination with earlier styles of jazz, such as [[dixieland]] with its collective improvisation, as well as African music. Interest in ethnic music resulted in the use of instruments from around the world, such as [[Ed Blackwell]]'s West African [[talking drum]], and [[Leon Thomas]]'s interpretation of pygmy yodeling.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=J.

Many argue those recent phenomena such as the landmark [[Brown v. Board of Education]] decision in 1954, the emergence of the \"[[Freedom Riders]]\" in 1961, the 1963 [[Freedom Summer]] of activist-supported black voter registration, and the free alternative black [[Freedom Schools]] demonstrate the political implications of the word \"free\" in context of free jazz. Thus many consider free jazz to be not only a rejection of certain musical credos and ideas, but a musical reaction to the oppression and experience of [[black Americans]].<ref name=\"Gioia\">{{cite book |last1=Gioia |first1=Ted |title=The History of Jazz |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia |url-access=registration |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, England |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofjazz00gioia/page/309 309\u2013311]}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough free jazz is widely considered to begin in the late 1950s, there are compositions that precede this era that have notable connections to the free jazz aesthetic. Some of the works of [[Lennie Tristano]] in the late 1940s, particularly \"[[Intuition (free improvisation)|Intuition]]\", \"Digression\", and \"Descent into the Maelstrom\" exhibit the use of techniques associated with free jazz, such as [[atonal]] collective improvisation and lack of discrete chord changes. Other notable examples of proto-free jazz include ''City of Glass'' written in 1948 by [[Bob Graettinger]] for the [[Stan Kenton]] band and [[Jimmy Giuffre]]'s 1953 \"Fugue\". It can be argued, however, that these works are more representative of [[third stream]] jazz with its references to [[contemporary classical music]] techniques such as [[serialism]].<ref name=\"Gioia\" />\n\nKeith Johnson of [[AllMusic]] describes a \"Modern Creative\" genre, in which \"musicians may incorporate free playing into structured modes\u2014or play just about anything.\"<ref name=\"Johnson\">{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Keith |title=Modern Creative Music Genre Overview |url=https://www.allmusic.com/style/modern-creative-ma0000011987 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=18 December 2018 }}</ref> He includes [[John Zorn]], [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]], [[Eugene Chadbourne]], [[Tim Berne]], [[Bill Frisell]], [[Steve Lacy (saxophonist)|Steve Lacy]], Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, and [[Ray Anderson (musician)|Ray Anderson]] in this genre, which continues \"the tradition of the '50s to '60s free-jazz mode\".<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n\n[[Ornette Coleman]] rejected pre-written chord changes, believing that freely improvised melodic lines should serve as the basis for harmonic progression.

Albums such as ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' and ''[[Change of the Century]]'' marked a radical step beyond his more conventional early work. On these albums, he strayed from the tonal basis that formed the lines of his earlier albums and began truly examining the possibilities of atonal improvisation. The most important recording to the free jazz movement from Coleman during this era, however, came with ''[[Free Jazz: A Collective Improvisation|Free Jazz]]'', recorded in A&R Studios in New York in 1960. It marked an abrupt departure from the highly structured compositions of his past. Recorded with a double quartet separated into left and right channels, ''Free Jazz'' brought a more aggressive, cacophonous texture to Coleman's work, and the record's title would provide the name for the nascent free jazz movement.<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|314}}\n\nPianist [[Cecil Taylor]] was also exploring the possibilities of avant-garde free jazz. A classically trained pianist, Taylor's main influences included [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Horace Silver]], who prove key to Taylor's later unconventional uses of the piano.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|792}} ''Jazz Advance'', his album released in 1956 for Transition showed ties to traditional jazz, albeit with an expanded harmonic vocabulary. But the harmonic freedom of these early releases would lead to his transition into free jazz during the early 1960s. Key to this transformation was the introduction of saxophonist [[Jimmy Lyons]] and drummer [[Sunny Murray]] in 1962 because they encouraged more progressive musical language, such as tone clusters and abstracted rhythmic figures. \nOn ''Unit Structures'' (Blue Note, 1966)<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Jim |title=Encyclopedia of Jazz Musicians |url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |work=Taylor, Cecil |publisher=Jazz.com |access-date=2014-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701141201/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/taylor-cecil |archive-date=2014-07-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Taylor marked his transition to free jazz, as his compositions were composed almost without notated scores, devoid of conventional jazz meter, and harmonic progression. This direction influenced by drummer Andrew Cyrille, who provided rhythmic dynamism outside the conventions of bebop and swing<ref name=\"Gioia\" />{{rp|319\u2013320}} Taylor also began exploring classical avant-garde, as in his use of prepared pianos developed by composer John Cage.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|794}}\n\n[[Albert Ayler]] was one of the essential composers and performers during the beginning period of free jazz. He began his career as a bebop tenor saxophonist in Scandinavia, and had already begun pushing the boundaries of tonal jazz and blues to their harmonic limits. He soon began collaborating with notable free jazz musicians, including Cecil Taylor in 1962. He pushed the jazz idiom to its absolute limits, and many of his compositions bear little resemblance to jazz of the past. Ayler's musical language focused on the possibilities of [[microtonal]] improvisation and extended saxophone technique, creating squawks and honks with his instrument to achieve [[multiphonic]] effects. Yet amidst Ayler's progressive techniques, he shows an attachment for simple, rounded melodies reminiscent of [[folk music]], which he explores via his more avant-garde style.<ref name=\"Shipton\" />{{rp|795\u2013796}} \n\nOne of Ayler's key free jazz recordings is ''[[Spiritual Unity]]'', including his often recorded and most famous composition, ''Ghosts'', in which a simple spiritual-like melody is gradually shifted and distorted through Ayler's unique improvisatory interpretation. Ultimately, Ayler serves as an important example of many ways which free jazz could be interpreted, as he often strays into more tonal areas and melodies while exploring the timbral and textural possibilities within his melodies. In this way, his free jazz is built upon both a progressive attitude towards melody and timbre as well as a desire to examine and recontextualize the music of the past.<ref name=\"Kernfeld\">{{cite book |last1=Kernfeld |first1=Barry |editor1-last=Kernfeld |editor1-first=Barry |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz |date=2002 |publisher=Grove's Dictionaries |location=New York |isbn=1-56159-284-6 |pages=96\u201397 |volume=1 |edition=2nd }}</ref> \n\nIn a 1963 interview with ''Jazz'' Magazine, Coltrane said he felt indebted to Coleman.<ref name=\"Quersin\">{{cite book |last1=Quersin |first1=Benoit |editor1-last=Woideck |editor1-first=Carl |title=The John Coltrane companion : five decades of commentary |date=1998 |publisher=Schirmer Books |isbn=978-0028647906 |page=[https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 123] |chapter=La Passe Dangereuse (1963) |url=https://archive.org/details/johncoltranecomp0000unse/page/123 }}</ref> While Coltrane's desire to explore the limits of solo improvisation and the possibilities of innovative form and structure was evident in records like ''[[A Love Supreme]]'', his work owed more to the tradition of [[modal jazz]] and [[post-bop]].

As evidenced by his compositions on the 1956 record ''[[Sounds of Joy]]'', Sun Ra's early work employed a typical bop style. But he soon foreshadowed the free jazz movements with compositions like \"A Call for All Demons\" off of the 1955-57 record ''[[Angels and Demons at Play]]'', which combines atonal improvisation with Latin-inspired mambo percussion. His period of fully realized free jazz experimentation began in 1965, with the release of ''[[The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra]]'' and ''[[The Magic City (Sun Ra album)|The Magic City]].'' These records placed a musical emphasis on [[timbre]] and texture over meter and harmony, employing a wide variety of [[electronic instrument]]s and innovative [[percussion instrument]]s, including the electric [[Celesta|celeste]], [[Hammond B-3]], bass [[marimba]], harp, and [[timpani]]. As result, Sun Ra proved to be one of the first free jazz musicians to explore electronic instrumentation, as well as displaying an interest in timbral possibilities through his use of progressive and unconventional instrumentation in his compositions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kernfield |first=Barry |title=Sun Ra |url=http://0-www.oxfordmusiconline.com.dewey2.library.denison.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/J434800 |work=Grove Music Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe title song of Charles Mingus' ''[[Pithecanthropus Erectus (album)|Pithecanthropus Erectus]]'' contained one improvised section in a style unrelated to the song's melody or chord structure. His contributions were primarily in his efforts to bring back collective improvisation in a music scene that had become dominated by solo improvisation as a result of big bands.<ref name=\"Southern\" />\n\nBy the 1970s, the setting for avant-garde jazz was shifting to New York City. Arrivals included [[Arthur Blythe]], [[James Newton]], and [[Mark Dresser]], beginning the period of New York loft jazz. As the name may imply, musicians during this time would perform in private homes and other unconventional spaces. The status of free jazz became more complex, as many musicians sought to bring in  different genres into their works. Free jazz no longer necessarily indicated the rejection of tonal melody, overarching harmonic structure, or metrical divide, as laid out by Coleman, Coltrane, and Taylor. Instead, the free jazz that developed in the 1960s became one of many influences, including pop music and world music.<ref name=\"DeVeaux\">{{cite book |last1=DeVeaux |first1=Scott |title=Jazz |date=2009 |publisher=W.W.

Most successful recording artists today construct their works in this way: beginning with a strain with which listeners can relate, following with an entirely free portion, and then returning to the recognizable strain. The pattern may occur several times in a long selection, giving listeners pivotal points to cling to. At this time, listeners accept this \u2013 they can recognize the selection while also appreciating the freedom of the player in other portions. Players, meanwhile, are tending toward retaining a key center for the seemingly free parts.
