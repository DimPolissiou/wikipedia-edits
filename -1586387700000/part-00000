Around {{convert|110|e6t|e6ST|abbr=none}} of [[limestone]] rock slid down [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]].<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\" /> Witnesses reported that within 100 seconds the rock reached up the opposing hills, obliterating the eastern edge of Frank, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

Encouraged by their success, the miners cut a new shaft that broke through under an outcropping of rock that protected them from falling debris.  Thirteen hours after they were buried, all 17 men emerged from the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson86\" />\n\nThe miners found that the row of cottages that served as their homes had been devastated and some of their families killed, seemingly at random.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" /> One found his family alive and safe in a makeshift hospital, but another emerged to discover his wife and four children had died.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=88}}</ref> Fifteen-year-old Lillian Clark, working a late shift that night in the town's boarding house, had been given permission to stay overnight for the first time.<ref name=\"Anderson63\" /> She was the only member of her family to survive.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.  The crew of the freight train that arrived at Frank shortly before the disaster said it was the coldest night of the winter, with overnight temperatures falling below {{convert|\u221218|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Geologists speculated that the cold snap and rapid freezing resulted in expansion of the fissures, causing the limestone to break off and tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Anderson96\" />\n\nThough the GSC concluded that mining activities contributed to the slide, the facility's owners disagreed. Their engineers claimed that the mine bore no responsibility.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=38}}</ref>  Later studies suggested that the mountain had been at a point of \"equilibrium\"; even a small deformation such as that caused by the mine's existence would have helped trigger a slide.<ref>{{harvnb|Benko|Stead|1998|p=311}}</ref> The mine was quickly re-opened, even though rock continued to tumble down the mountain.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" /> Coal production at Frank peaked in 1910,<ref name=\"Kerr36\">{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=36}}</ref> but the mine was permanently closed in 1917 after it became unprofitable.<ref name=\"Byfield377\" />\n\nThe slide created two new peaks on the mountain; the south peak stands {{convert|2200|m|ft}} high and the north peak {{convert|2100|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"FrankSlideFacts\">{{citation |url=https://frankslide.ca/sites/frankslide/files/editor_files/Frank_Slide_Facts%20(1).pdf |title=Frank Slide facts |publisher=Government of Alberta |accessdate=2019-04-29}}</ref> Geologists believe that another slide is inevitable, though not imminent.

It was one of the largest [[landslide]]s in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the [[rubble]]. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it in a constant state of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster.\n\nThe railway was repaired within three weeks and the mine was quickly reopened.  The section of town closest to the mountain was relocated in 1911 amid fears that another slide was possible. The town's population nearly doubled its pre-slide population by 1906, but dwindled after the mine closed permanently in 1917. The community is now part of the [[Crowsnest Pass, Alberta|Municipality of Crowsnest Pass]] in the Province of [[Alberta]] and has a population around 200. The site of the disaster, which remains nearly unchanged since the slide, is now a popular tourist destination.  It has been designated a [[Provincial Historic Sites of Alberta|Provincial Historic Site of Alberta]] and is home to an [[interpretation centre|interpretive centre]] that receives over 100,000 visitors annually.\n\n==Background==\nThe town of [[Frank, Alberta|Frank]] was founded in the southwestern corner of the [[District of Alberta]], a subdivision of the [[Northwest Territories]] in 1901. A location was chosen near the base of [[Turtle Mountain (Alberta)|Turtle Mountain]] in the [[Crowsnest Pass]], where coal had been discovered one year earlier.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=55}}</ref> It was named after [[Henry Frank]] who, along with [[Samuel Gebo]], owned the Canadian-American Coal and Coke Company, which operated the mine that the town was created to support.<ref name=\"Anderson56\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=6}}</ref> The pair celebrated the founding of the town on September 10, 1901, with a gala opening that featured speeches from territorial leaders, sporting events, a dinner and tours of the mine and planned layout for the community.  The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) ran special trains that brought over 1,400 people from neighbouring communities to celebrate the event.<ref name=\"Anderson56\" /> By April 1903, the permanent population had reached 600,<ref name=\"EpochTimes109\">{{citation |last=Reichel |first=Justina |url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/frank-slide-remembered-227569.html |title=Frank Slide remembered |work=The Epoch Times |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-04-30}}</ref> and the town featured a two-storey school and four hotels.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=57}}</ref>\n\nTurtle Mountain stands immediately south of Frank.

A. G. Haultain|Frederick Haultain]] arrived at the disaster site on May 1, where he met with engineers who had investigated the top of Turtle Mountain.  Though new fissures had formed at the peak, they felt there was limited further risk to the town; nevertheless, the CPR's chief engineer felt that Frank was in imminent danger from another slide.  Siding with the latter, Haultain ordered the town evacuated,<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=91}}</ref> and the [[Geological Survey of Canada]] (GSC) sent two of its top geologists to investigate further.  They reported that the slide had created two new peaks on the mountain and that the north peak, overlooking the town, was not in imminent danger of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=33}}</ref>  As a result, the evacuation order was lifted on May 10 and Frank's citizens returned.<ref name=\"Anderson93\">{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=93}}</ref>  The [[North-West Mounted Police]], reinforced by officers who arrived from [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fort Macleod, Alberta|Macleod]] and [[Calgary]], kept tight control of the town and ensured that no cases of [[looting]] occurred during the evacuation.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2005|p=92}}</ref>\n\nClearing the Canadian Pacific Railway line was of paramount importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Kerr|1990|p=30}}</ref> Approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}} of the main line had been buried under the slide, along with part of an auxiliary line.<ref name=\"FSICFAQ\" />  The CPR had the line cleared and rebuilt within three weeks.<ref name=\"CBCArchives\" /> Intent on reopening the mine, workers opened passageways to the old mine works by May 30.

A prism connected to cables monitors the mountain for movement.]]\nAn unusually warm winter, with warm days and cold nights, was also a factor. Water in the mountain's fissures froze and thawed repeatedly, further weakening the mountain's supports.<ref name=\"vanHerk385\" /> Heavy snowfall in the region in March was followed by a warm April, causing the mountain snows to melt into the fissures.<ref name=\"CanEncy100th\" />  GSC geologists concluded that the weather conditions that night likely triggered the slide.

It is the [[sequel]] to the 1992 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' and the second game in the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series. ''Kirby's Adventure'' introduced the copy ability, which let's the main character, [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], gain new powers by eating certain enemies. The game centers around Kirby traveling across Dream Land to repair the Star Rod after [[King Dedede]] breaks it apart and gives the pieces to his minions.\n\n[[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned as director after serving the same role for ''Kirby's Dream Land''. He conceived the copy ability to add more challenge and [[replay value]] after the last game received criticism for its simplicity. Because the NES hardware had greater graphical power than the Game Boy and programmers were skilled with the now antiquated hardware, HAL Laboratory was able to create impressive visuals. ''Kirby's Adventure'' is the first game to depict Kirby in color. Sakurai had always planned him to be pink, much to the surprise of other staff.\n\n''Kirby's Adventure'' was well received and commended for its tight controls, level variety, and the new copy ability. It was [[Video game remake|remade]] in 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]] with enhanced graphics and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] support, titled '''''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'''''. The original NES version was rereleased later on Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] digital distribution services, [[Nintendo Switch Online]], and with [[stereoscopic 3D]] for the [[3D Classics]] product line for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. In retrospect, journalists have ranked it among the best NES games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:NES Kirbys Adventure.png|thumb|left|Kirby inhaling Hot Head in the first stage in Vegetable Valley]]\nLike its predecessor ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' (1992), ''Kirby's Adventure'' is a 2D [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":7\"/> In the game's scenario, an evil entity named [[Nightmare (Kirby series)|Nightmare]] corrupts the Fountain of Dreams,<ref name=\"bad\"/> which provides restful sleep to the residents of Dream Land.<ref name=\":9\"/> [[King Dedede]] steals the Star Rod that powers the fountain and gives pieces of it to his friends<ref name=\":9\"/> in an effort to stop Nightmare.<ref name=\"bad\"/> [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], the [[player character]] of the [[single-player]] game, mistakenly believes that Dedede stole the rod for evil and sets out to reunite the pieces.<ref name=\"bad\">{{cite web |title=Video game 'bad guys' who aren't really bad at all |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |date=February 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104062807/http://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |archive-date=January 4, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\":02\"/> When Kirby defeats Dedede and returns the rod to the fountain, Nightmare goes into [[outer space]] to spread [[Nightmare|bad dreams]], but Kirby follows him and uses the rod's power to defeat him.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kirby's Adventure|developer=[[HAL Laboratory]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=March 23, 1993|level=Level 8: The Fountain of Dreams}}</ref>\n\nKirby retains his abilities from ''Kirby's Dream Land'':<ref name=\":2\"/> he can walk left or right, crouch, and jump.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|13\u201314}} To attack, Kirby inhales enemies or objects and spits them out as star-shaped bullets.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|16\u201317}} He can also fly by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, but he can exhale at any time, releasing a puff of air that cancels his flight and can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|15}} New moves include the abilities to run at a fast pace and to perform a sliding kick.<ref name=\"20thbook\"/>{{rp|17}} A major aspect of the game is Kirby's copy abilities.<ref name=\":7\"/> By inhaling and swallowing certain enemies, Kirby will obtain powers based on the special ability the enemy possessed.<ref name=\":6\"/> Copy abilities allow Kirby to access new areas and experience [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s in different ways.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"shmulations\"/> Certain copy abilities can only be used a limited number of times.

It is the [[sequel]] to the 1992 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' and the second game in the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' series. ''Kirby's Adventure'' introduced the copy ability, which let's the main character [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] gain new powers by eating certain enemies. The game centers around Kirby traveling across Dream Land to repair the Star Rod after [[King Dedede]] breaks it apart and gives the pieces to his minions.\n\n[[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned as director after serving the same role for ''Kirby's Dream Land''. He conceived the copy ability to add more challenge and [[replay value]] after the last game received criticism for its simplicity. Because the NES hardware had greater graphical power than the Game Boy and programmers were skilled with the now antiquated hardware, HAL Laboratory was able to create impressive visuals. ''Kirby's Adventure'' is the first game to depict Kirby in color. Sakurai had always planned him to be pink, much to the surprise of other staff.\n\n''Kirby's Adventure'' was well received and commended for its tight controls, level variety, and the new copy ability. It was [[Video game remake|remade]] in 2002 for the [[Game Boy Advance]] with enhanced graphics and [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] support, titled '''''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'''''. The original NES version was rereleased later on Nintendo's [[Virtual Console]] digital distribution services, [[Nintendo Switch Online]], and with [[stereoscopic 3D]] for the [[3D Classics]] product line for the [[Nintendo 3DS]]. In retrospect, journalists have ranked it among the best NES games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:NES Kirbys Adventure.png|thumb|left|Kirby inhaling Hot Head in the first stage in Vegetable Valley]]\nLike its predecessor ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' (1992), ''Kirby's Adventure'' is a 2D [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game]].<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":7\"/> In the game's scenario, an evil entity named [[Nightmare (Kirby series)|Nightmare]] corrupts the Fountain of Dreams,<ref name=\"bad\"/> which provides restful sleep to the residents of Dream Land.<ref name=\":9\"/> [[King Dedede]] steals the Star Rod that powers the fountain and gives pieces of it to his friends<ref name=\":9\"/> in an effort to stop Nightmare.<ref name=\"bad\"/> [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]], the [[player character]] of the [[single-player]] game, mistakenly believes that Dedede stole the rod for evil and sets out to reunite the pieces.<ref name=\"bad\">{{cite web |title=Video game 'bad guys' who aren't really bad at all |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |accessdate=July 16, 2018 |date=February 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104062807/http://www.gamesradar.com/9-video-game-bad-guys-who-arent-really-bad-all/ |archive-date=January 4, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\":02\"/> When Kirby defeats Dedede and returns the rod to the fountain, Nightmare goes into [[outer space]] to spread [[Nightmare|bad dreams]], but Kirby follows him and uses the rod's power to defeat him.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Kirby's Adventure|developer=[[HAL Laboratory]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=March 23, 1993|level=Level 8: The Fountain of Dreams}}</ref>\n\nKirby retains his abilities from ''Kirby's Dream Land'':<ref name=\":2\"/> he can walk left or right, crouch, and jump.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|13\u201314}} To attack, Kirby inhales enemies or objects and spits them out as star-shaped bullets.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|16\u201317}} He can also fly by inflating himself; while flying, Kirby cannot attack or use his other abilities, but he can exhale at any time, releasing a puff of air that cancels his flight and can be used to damage enemies or destroy blocks.<ref name=\"manual\"/>{{rp|15}} New moves include the abilities to run at a fast pace and to perform a sliding kick.<ref name=\"20thbook\"/>{{rp|17}} A major aspect of the game is Kirby's copy abilities.<ref name=\":7\"/> By inhaling and swallowing certain enemies, Kirby will obtain powers based on the special ability the enemy possessed.<ref name=\":6\"/> Copy abilities allow Kirby to access new areas and experience [[Level (video gaming)|level]]s in different ways.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\"shmulations\"/> Certain copy abilities can only be used a limited number of times.

[1992] (1992). Rockin' the Boat: mass music and mass movements. South End Press. {{ISBN|0-89608-427-2}}</ref> The new style was triggered by two new songs, \"Xintianyou\" ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u4fe1\u5929\u6e38\u300b}}) and \"[[Nothing To My Name]]\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u300a\u4e00\u65e0\u6240\u6709\u300b}}), both of which drew heavily on the folk song traditions of [[Shanbei|northern]] [[Shaanxi]]. They combined this with a western-style fast tempo, strong beat and extremely aggressive bass lines. In contrast to the mellow [[cantopop]] style, Northwest Wind songs were sung loudly and forcefully. It represented the musical branch of the large-scale Root-Seeking ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5bfb\u6839}}, ''xungen'') cultural movement that also manifested itself in literature and in film. [[Cui Jian]]'s Northwest Wind album ''[[Rock 'N' Roll on the New Long March]]'', which included \"Nothing To My Name\", has been called \"China's first rock album\".<ref name=Steen>{{cite journal | title=Sound, Protest and Business. Modern Sky Co. and the New Ideology of Chinese Rock | last=Steen | first=Andreas | year=2000 | journal=Berliner China-Hefte | issue=19 | <!--url=http://www.alternativearchive.com/cn/archives/rock.pdf-->}}</ref>\n\nMany Northwest Wind songs were highly idealistic and heavily political, parodying or alluding to the revolutionary songs of the Communist state, such as \"[[Nanniwan]]\" and \"[[The Internationale]]\". It is, however, associated with the non-Communist [[Guoyue|national music]] side instead of the revolutionary side. The music reflected dissatisfaction among Chinese youth, as well as the influence of western ideas such as individuality and self-empowerment. Both music and lyrics articulated a sense of pride in the power of the northwest's peasantry. Songs such as \"Sister Go Boldly Forward\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u300a\u59b9\u59b9\u4f60\u5927\u80c6\u7684\u5f80\u524d\u8d70\u300b}}) came to represent an earthy, primordial masculine image of Mainland China, as opposed to the soft, sweet, polished urban [[gangtai]] style.\n\n===Birth of Chinese rock and roll (1984)===\nThe birthplace of Chinese rock was in [[Beijing]].<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones. Andrew F. [2001] (2001). Yellow Music \u2013 CL: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0-8223-2694-9}}</ref> As the nation's capital, the music was highly politicised and open to a range of foreign influences. It was marginal for most of the 1980s, consisting of live performances in small bars and hotels. The music was almost exclusively for the domain of university students and \"underground\" bohemian circles. In late 1989 and early 1990 Chinese rock partially emerged into mainstream music as a combination of the Northwest Wind and prison song fads.\n\nThe first Chinese rock song was arguably the Northwest Wind anthem \"[[Nothing To My Name]]\", first performed in 1984 by [[Cui Jian]], widely recognised as the father of Chinese rock. The song introduced into post-revolutionary China a whole new ethos that combined individualism, direct and bold expression. It soon came to symbolise the frustration harboured by a disillusioned generation of young intellectuals who grew cynical about [[Communism]] and critical of China's traditional and contemporary culture. It also expressed, even for older Chinese, a dissatisfaction with unrealized promises of the Chinese regime.\n\nIn the spring of 1989, \"Nothing To My Name\" became the ''de facto'' anthem of the student protestors at [[Tiananmen Square]]. Additionally, in May and July of that year, three of China's famous rock bands were established: Breathing (''Huxi'', {{lang|zh-hans|\u547c\u5438}}), [[Cobra (Chinese band)|Cobra]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u773c\u955c\u86c7}}), and [[Zang Tianshuo]]'s ({{lang|zh-hans|\u81e7\u5929\u6714}}) [[1989 (band)|1989]]. Earlier rock music groups include \"Infallible\" (''Budaoweng'' {{lang|zh-hans|\u4e0d\u5012\u7fc1}}), formed by Zang Tianshuo and [[Tang Dynasty (band)]] (''Tang Chao'', {{lang|zh-hans|\u5510\u671d}}) lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Ding Wu ({{lang|zh|\u4e01\u6b66}}), and probably the most famous of all Chinese rock bands: \"[[Black Panther (band)|Black Panther]]\" (''Hei Bao'' {{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u8c79}}), originally fronted by China's alternative music pioneer [[Dou Wei]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7aa6\u552f}}).\n\n===Prison songs (1988\u20131989)===\n\"[[Prison Song (genre)|Prison Songs]]\" ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u56da\u6b4c\u300b}}) became popular in 1988 and early 1989, parallel to the Northwest Wind style. The fad was initiated by Chi Zhiqiang ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8fdf\u5fd7\u5f3a}}), who wrote lyrics about his time in jail and set them to folk melodies from northeast China. In contrast to Northwest Wind songs, prison songs were slow, \"weepy\" and invoked negative role models, often using vulgar language and expressing despair and cynicism. Their non-conformist values are apparent in such songs as \"Mother Is Very Muddle-Headed\" and \"There Is Not a Drop of Oil in the Dish\". The popularity of these songs reflected the fact that many Chinese during the 1980s became tired of official artistic representations and discourse. The patrons of prison songs were the urban youth, and private entrepreneurs, who at that time were mostly from marginal backgrounds.\n\n===Popular Chinese rock (1990\u20131993)===\n[[File:Tang Dynasty playing in Xian.JPG|thumb|right|230px|[[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]] performing in 2004.]]\nAfter the Tiananmen Square protests, rock became part of general urban youth Chinese culture. Its rise from the margins was celebrated on 17 and 18 February 1990, when Beijing's largest ever all-rock concert was held in the Capital Gymnasium, one of the city's largest halls. The concert featured six rock bands, among them are Cui Jian's [[ADO (band)|ADO]] and [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]]. The criterion that the organizers set as qualification to participate was \"originality\".\n\nChinese rock reached a peak of creativity and popularity between 1990 and 1993.  In 1991, the glam metal band Black Panther released their self-titled debut album. With glossy production and hard rock melodies backing the sincere voice of lead singer [[Dou Wei]], it featured hit singles such as \"Don't Break My Heart and \"Ashamed\". A year later, the album went on to sell more than 1,000,000 copies nationwide, a standard never before achieved in Chinese rock history. Another band, [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]], whose style was comparable to British heavy metal, successfully broke another barrier. Their singles \"9/4 (a reference to the song's time signature)\", \"The Sun\", and \"Choice\" climbed the charts. Once again, it was not until 1992, that their debut ''[[A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty]]'' sold over 2,000,000 copies throughout Asia, including Japan, Korea, and the Southeast.  From there, other previously formed rock bands, such as the first all female band, [[Cobra (Chinese band)|Cobra]], and hard rockers [[The Face (band)|The Face]] (each established in 1989), achieved greater success than ever. In addition, dozens of newer bands formed during the peak of their success, and rock music was performed on a regular basis. Big name artists and bands were featured in media such as [[China Central Television|CCTV]] and MTV, while other lesser known acts made a presence in small-scale, underground rock parties such as band leader Fa Zi who was perhaps the most well-known musician at art colony Yuan Ming Yuan near Bei Da in Beijing before it was closed down. The core participants in rock subculture adopted characteristic nonconformist appearance and behaviour. These included glam rock styles: pretty face, long hair, jeans, silver metal ornaments, black leather coats, as well as emerging [[grunge]] styles: Flannel shirts, and [[DIY ethic|do it yourself ethics]], coupled with a carefree, hippie-style behaviour. The decline of Northwest Wind and simultaneous rise of rock music represented a shift in the attitude of many of China's intellectuals. Nostalgia changed into an unequivocally fierce negation, a sense of alienation from China's traditional and rural culture.\n\n===Rock goes underground, earns newfound respect (1994/1997)===\nBy 1994, mainstream popularity of Chinese rock slowly began to decline. This can only be attributed to strict [[censorship]] by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]], such as the banning of rock from television and restrictions on performances.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> More importantly, the decline of rock reflected the general lack of interest in politicised cultural products, thoughts, or behaviour. People became more interested in engaging with the market economy, making money and improving their living standard.  Cross-border cultural exchange facilitated by increased economic openness, and the radical commercialisation of the music industry in the mid-1990s both lead to the import of overseas music, particularly from Taiwan and Hong Kong. [[Cantopop]] singers such as [[Andy Lau]] were backed up by well-resourced record companies and could raise revenues from film-making and advertising, two sources usually rejected by Chinese rock musicians. Moreover, the level of censorship imposed on [[c-pop]] was less damaging, since [[gangtai]] culture is more independent from mainland culture. With the tragedy of Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death, a whole new scene had emerged in the underground.\n\nDuring 1994, former Black Panther frontman Dou Wei released \"Dark Dreams\" with his new band \"The Dreaming\". This album marked a complete departure from his \"glam metal\" days. Instead, this album put more emphasis on thicker and more jangly guitars. Dou started singing in a thin, almost apathetic drone-like voice. He also began experimenting with gothic and electronic sounds, and earned a whole new kind of respect, as well as credibility in the alternative nation. Another unlikely figure in the scene was the father of Chinese rock himself, [[Cui Jian]].   A rare compilation album, titled \"Rock Pioneers\" was also released. The album showcased raw, rather unorthodox playing styles, as well as a rejection (even sometimes a mockery) of mainstream rock music. With the exception of Dream, the only band on the compilation to achieve mainstream success was [[Thin Man (band)]], who went on to revitalize rock back into the masses. Self-styled punk [[He Yong (rock musician)|He Yong]] fiercely resisted mainstream culture and their [[cantopop]] imitators on the mainland. His only album, \"Garbage Dump\", was embraced by troubled Chinese youth, and earned him an enormous cult following. In 1995, a handful of younger punk bands ([[Brain Failure]], Reflector, A Jerks, and 69) produced an album called \"Wuliao Contingent,\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u65e0\u804a\u519b\u961f}}, better translated as \"Battalion of Boredom\") representing the boredom and frustration collectively felt within the urban landscape. At the forefront was Brain Failure, the most successful of these bands, who continue to tour the world with their ska/punk sound. English is used to both express what Chinese lyrics cannot, and also to crossover to the western music market. One of the significant turning points for rock was [[Cui Jian]]'s performance with [[The Rolling Stones]] in 2003 at the age of 42. It opened the genre to the rest of the world for the first time.\n\n===Rock Revival (2000\u2013present)===\n{{Original research section|date=September 2007}}\nFrom 2000 to 2004 [[post punk]] and [[extreme metal]] entered the underground scene and ascended among the fans. In 2004\u20132005, Beijing's Joyside went on their first tour of China. [[United States|American]] [[filmmaker]] Kevin Fritz followed them to make the film Wasted Orient. It was released on DVD in 2007 by [[Plexifilm]].<ref>WastedOrient. \"[http://www.wastedorient.com/4.html WastedOrient] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718022824/http://www.wastedorient.com/4.html |date=2007-07-18 }}.\" ''Wasted Orient: The Official Rock n' Roll Film of Joyside.'' Retrieved on 2007-04-10.</ref> The film is China's version of [[Decline Of Western Civilization]]. It depicts comically the pitfalls associated with trying to tour a country that has little taste for [[Rock n' Roll]] music. In this film the original line-up of Joyside including Bian Yuan, Liu Hao, Fan Bo, Yang Yang, & Xin Shuang shows these colorful characters drowning away in [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is both hilarious and depressing at the same time. The film also includes some of Joyside's early music, which brought them some recognition. The film Wasted Orient is non-political, and strays away from making any superficial social commentary. While Joyside is not particularly known for the talent, the film present Chinese rock music in the new 2000 millennium in the most authentic, raw, and genuine form{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.\n\n:'''Director Kevin Fritz:'''\n:{{cquote|''The film Wasted Orient is what it is pure and simple. It's honest. It is the true way of Chinese rock n' roll. It's not glamorous. It's filthy. It's filled with despair.

The show is sponsored by Pepsi, and produced by Ato Ato Integrated Media.\n\n===The Beijing Midi Modern School of Music and Music Festival===\nAnother important step in the development of Chinese rock music had been the [[Beijing Midi School of Music]] in [[Beijing]]. Established 1993 by Zhang Fan, it was the first school nationally to offer classes for jazz music and rock music. Started as a school festival in 1999, the [[Midi Modern Music Festival]] advanced to the largest rock music festival nationally with up to 80000 visitors and over 100 bands. Both the school and the festival supported the underground scene across the country and opened the door for over 18 foreign bands in 2006 to perform at the festival and elsewhere in the country. (i.e. Alev, Monokino, Yokohama Music Association, The Wombats, etc.).

Especially in the metal and gothic genre these tours are considered milestones in China.\n\n===The 2008 Olympics and the Sichuan earthquake===\nA major drawback for the music scene in general was the cancellation of several events leading up to the [[2008 Olympic Games]], as well as the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]{{clarify|date=December 2011}}. The 2008 Midi Modern Music Festival was cancelled ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080628052436/http://wiki.rockinchina.com/index.php?title=Midi_Music_Festival_2008 cancellation note]) and delayed to October 2008, the Soilwork gig ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080428184515/http://wiki.rockinchina.com/index.php?title=Soilwork_in_Beijing preannouncement]) had to be cancelled, as the band did not receive their visas and the German Esplanade in Chongqing was stopped by the organizers ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015059/http://wiki.rockinchina.com/index.php?title=German_Esplanade_Chongqing_2008 change note]).\n\nThe Sichuan earthquake in general shook the music scene and spawned dozens of \"We are together\" and \"Think of Sichuan\" gigs and charity events throughout Beijing and other cities. London Chinese Radio made a [https://web.archive.org/web/20111007030348/http://www.londonhuayu.co.uk/?p=107 Special Earthquake Edition] on their New Sounds of China podcast to cover this.\n\n===The Shanghai Scene===\nHistorically more open to the outside, Shanghai is home to musicians from around the world. The unofficial home of the local jazz scene is JZ club while DJs and Electronic Producers frequently play The Shelter. Underground rock bands converge at Yuyintang. The 2010 World Expo and auxiliary events brought legal limitations to live performances and dried up venues temporarily, even censoring Shanghainese indie rock heroes Top Floor Circus.<ref>Shanghaiist. \"[http://shanghaiist.com/2009/12/15/shanghai_doesnt_welcome_you_video_h.php].\" ''Shanghaiist: Shanghai doesn't welcome you video harmonized off Youku.''

In the first Panther period, the masterpiece \"take care\", \"don't break my heart\", \"no land\". During this period, Dou Wei is singing. How to evaluate Dou Wei's singing? The Panther has changed several vocals, and has never surpassed Dou Wei. The success of the Panthers, Dou Wei, can at least get more than half of the weight. The second single-person period, the masterpiece \"Black Dream\", \"Sad Dream\", \"Hey! be good\". During this period, the main style of Dou Wei's music was changed to post-punk. The hands were not unreasonable, and the emotions were thick. A unique relaxation in Hou Peng's temperament was well grasped by Dou Wei. Moreover, in \"Black Dream\", Dou Wei took an important step, that is, the contempt for the melody and lyrics, and the emphasis on the arrangement and sound effects, which made his creative mode begin to break away from pop music and move toward experimental music. The third translation band is not necessarily a period, and the masterpieces are \"Yu Yu\", \"Wang Tianxia\", \"Winter Spring and Autumn Color\". During this period, Dou Wei met Bark Psychosis, a British post-shake band that had a huge impact on his music. BP's influence on Dou Wei is very obvious. The translated band once sang their album \"Hex\", and the cover of Dou Wei's album \"Mountain and Water\" also imitated \"HEX\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} And the song \"Love is loved\" in the album \"Music Audition\" is also a copy of the \"Fingerspit\". Dou Wei' s imitation is a true inheritance, and it is by no means an imitation of the situation. Dou Wei' s stealing from BP is a technique, and with his own spiritual core, a \"Hex\" full of Chinese landscape is born. During this period, Dou Wei' s ability to arrange music evolved to the top level in the world, and the lyrics ability evolved into the height of the singularity of the singer. Every time I say that Dou Wei arranges world-class people to question the world's popularity, is there a certain relationship between talent and popularity? Keith Jarret, Scott Walker, Xenakis are first-class in the music field, which one have you heard? During this period, we can see that Dou Wei's excellent musical appreciation and learning ability. The fourth is a good man. During the period, the masterpiece \"Over the Mountain\", \"4'22\" in the album \"Jiusheng\", \"Xiao Le Dong Furnace\". This period is the ultimate evolutionary period of Dou Wei, congratulations to Dou Wei to get rid of all forms of restraint and explore music in depth. In itself and using music to dig into the heart. The three songs selected are very representative. It can be seen that Dou Wei's transformation of the emotional control of music during this period, Dou Wei successfully reached the highest state of art \u2013 no me. In fact, this period to Dou Wei The discussion on music rumors is no longer necessary. This is the kind of music that is \"no height\". The spiritual realm is the main one.\n# [[File:CuiJian2 2007 Hohaiyan.jpg|thumb]]Cui Jian's enlightenment is the rock of the 80s. As a guide for the rock in the 1980s, he is a rocker who can deserve to go down in history. Compared with the meaning of rock art, Cui Jian's meaning is more historical and political. In the 21st century, many people are not so difficult to get in touch with rock, so Cui Jian's meaning has become more and more distant. He is more and more like a symbol, such as the Pangu giant in mythology. Pangu is great, but no one sacrifices. Cui Jian's voice sounded, the trumpet blew, and the feeling of that era came. He always gave me a sense of coldness in black and white.Out of the background of the times, Cui Jian may become weak, just like taking the poems of Du Fu to the Song Dynasty. - Of course, because in this era background, Cui Jiancai is as great as a mountain. Cui Jian led the tide of the times, and the tide of the times also made the name of Cui Jian's godfather. Cui Jian said a very interesting sentence: Say it, you and us live in an era. As long as Tiananmen Square hangs the image of Chairman Mao, we are all the same. Don't think that you are 20 or 30 years younger than me, we are not a generation. We are all refugees in good times. In a sense, Cui Jian and Jiang Wen, Wang Wei, and Feng Xiaogang are the same type of people. They belong to the second generation in the courtyard. With the second generation of rebellious psychology, they are pioneering and have more masters than ordinary people.

This era is the decline of the Three Rocks of Magic Rock, the rise of Shucun Village and the glorious era of Happy Paradise. Shucun is an urban-rural junction near Shangdi in Beijing. Because the rent is cheap and close to the venue, it quickly gathered a large number of poor and hard-pressed bands. In almost all ages, all the bands you have heard of are in Shucun, and Shucun became a rock-and-roll place at that time. You said that you didn't live in the tree village, just told you that you can't play the guitar. It was because the rock band gathered in the tree village that led to the Wudaokou performance venues; or because the glory of the happy paradise caused the band to enter the tree village, it was impossible to test, but no matter how Haidian-Wudaokou-Shucun was the indelible impression of that era. It is also the spiritual symbol of that generation of rockers. The \"post-revolutionary era\" recorded the sadness and happiness of that period in time, and you will have a little sadness after seeing it.\n* 2000\u20132003. Since 2000, a great name will be on the stage of Chinese rock music history and began to dominate Chinese rock for nearly 10 years. Nowadays, many people only know the Midi Music Festival, but they do not know a small building near the Ruiwang Tomb at the foot of Xiangshan Mountain - Midi Music School. Midi Music School was founded earlier than 2000, but the reason why it was only mentioned in 2000 was that the president of Zhang Fan made a great decision. Perhaps he did not realize the significance of this decision. However, it is undeniable that he will rely on this decision to become the Chinese rock godfather with Cui Jian. That is, he decided to run a graduation report in the school, and after 10 years of development, this report has finally become the first brand of the Chinese rock festival: Midi Music Festival. Yes, you may not imagine that today's fascinating Midi Music Festival was a small report show with only a few bands and hundreds of spectators. This performance is only three years, all free of charge, 10 boxes of lunch. After 2003, as you know, Midi Music Festival began to walk out of the campus, facing the society, went to Xidan, Sculpture Park, Haidian Park, etc., began to collect tickets, the number of bands and audiences rose, and the box lunch could not be bought, 10 You can only buy a bunch of lamb skewers. This pure, non-leisure music festival.\n* 2004\u20132009. In the past few years, various performance venues have begun to take off, such as luck, happiness, starlight, mao, Yugong Yishan, etc., to Fuhaosi through Changan, the city is singing rock; the style of the band is also The more diverse it is. In the past, Cui Jian, He Yong, this group of people really can't tell what style it is. We can only call socialist rock with Chinese characteristics. At this time, the band began to have obvious style tendency: punk represented by the boring army. The new gold represented by Twisting Machine Yaksha is represented by Pangu. The street is represented by cmcb. The folk song represented by Wan Xiaoli, the rapids represented by suffocation, the death represented by frost, represented by Xie Tianxiao. The grunge, with the dragon Shinto as the reggae, in short, the style you want to listen to can find a representative band in the country, as well as the Western rock style like Suyang, second-hand, Nancheng second brother, China original (we are called folklore) style. This stage is summed up in eight words: a hundred flowers bloom, and hundreds of schools contend.\n* 2009 to present. In 2009, there was a strong fruit debut, which disrupted the rock performance and directly challenged the dominance of Midi, the Strawberry Music Festival. The Strawberry Music Festival is part of the Modern Sky. In fact, the two music festivals, Modern and Midi, have always been in the water: the whistle is held every year on May 1, and the modern year is held in the eleventh year. However, in 2009, Modern suddenly made a force to hold the Strawberry Music Festival during the 51st, and sang against the whistle of the whistle, and it was not the usual way for Metersbonwe to come. Before the Strawberry Music Festival, all the music festivals are on the rock, the band must rock, pure rock, and die. Starting from the strawberry, I started a new style of music festival and started to take the leisure route. Since 2009, many fans who have never been to the music festival gathered under the banner of cute and colorful, shouting that the revolutionary slogan has always been The music festival held by underground dark forces. From this moment on, the festival reduced the atmosphere of sadness. We began to enjoy the sun lawn and food, no longer thinking about putting blood and stool on the flag, but where there was oppression and kneeling there.\n\n<small>'''Nowadays:'''</small>\n\nThere is a disconnect between Chinese pop music and society. This disconnection has caused the general public to listen to music and listen to songs mainly to listen to a fun. Not to mention the general public, and even the earphone enthusiasts who are pursuing the sound quality are positioned to listen to music as a pure entertainment. Then Chinese music and social movements are out of touch. The relationship between Chinese pop music history and Chinese modern history is not as close as that of Europe and the United States. To know the history of Western pop music, it is possible to directly reflect the social life of people in different periods and the social movements of the corresponding period (bruces, jazz, hippies, folk songs, which is not closely connected with the social environment?)\n\nChinese pop songs, contain too much emphasis on lyrics and too much emphasis on the singer itself. It is means everything is expressed by the lyrics. In this kind of environment, it is a strange thing to want to create a music that really touches people's hearts. Say something ugly: You like the lyrics so much, you can't read poems~\nChina keeps up with the music of the historical process. I personally think that one is the jazz of old Shanghai. One is Cui Jian who actively promotes Western music at the beginning of reform and opening up. (I personally feel that it is not appropriate to simply define him as rock.)\n\nThe current Chinese style is prevalent, but it can be regarded as the result of the rise of nationalism. Although nationalism itself is not a good thing, this style is a good or unintentional follow-up of the social process, just the quality of singing and singing, or too low. Fortunately, now the audience has begun to pay attention to the arrangement, and more and more powerful musicians have joined the writing of ancient songs. I think there is still a possibility that this style will make a difference in the \"World Music\" category, and it is also a good opportunity for Chinese music.\nAs for the overall catching up with the level of the West, China has gone too far. It has been off the line for too many years. This thing requires all Chinese people to work hard together to catch up. It is not a few musicians who can get it... After all, The great Chinese have also said that personal efforts are of course important, but they must also take into account the historical process.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Midi Modern Music Festival]]\n*[[Beijing Pop Festival]]\n*[[Modern Sky Festival]]\n*[[C-pop]]\n*[[Cantopop]]\n*[[Chinese heavy metal]]\n*[[Mandopop]]\n*[[Taiwanese rock]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Campbell, Jonathan (2011).

[1992] (1992). Rockin' the Boat: mass music and mass movements. South End Press. {{ISBN|0-89608-427-2}}</ref> The new style was triggered by two new songs, \"Xintianyou\" ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u4fe1\u5929\u6e38\u300b}}) and \"[[Nothing To My Name]]\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u300a\u4e00\u65e0\u6240\u6709\u300b}}), both of which drew heavily on the folk song traditions of [[Shanbei|northern]] [[Shaanxi]]. They combined this with a western-style fast tempo, strong beat and extremely aggressive bass lines. In contrast to the mellow [[cantopop]] style, Northwest Wind songs were sung loudly and forcefully. It represented the musical branch of the large-scale Root-Seeking ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5bfb\u6839}}, ''xungen'') cultural movement that also manifested itself in literature and in film. [[Cui Jian]]'s Northwest Wind album ''[[Rock 'N' Roll on the New Long March]]'', which included \"Nothing To My Name\", has been called \"China's first rock album\".<ref name=Steen>{{cite journal | title=Sound, Protest and Business.

It is, however, associated with the non-Communist [[Guoyue|national music]] side instead of the revolutionary side. The music reflected dissatisfaction among Chinese youth, as well as the influence of western ideas such as individuality and self-empowerment. Both music and lyrics articulated a sense of pride in the power of the northwest's peasantry. Songs such as \"Sister Go Boldly Forward\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u300a\u59b9\u59b9\u4f60\u5927\u80c6\u7684\u5f80\u524d\u8d70\u300b}}) came to represent an earthy, primordial masculine image of Mainland China, as opposed to the soft, sweet, polished urban [[gangtai]] style.\n\n===Birth of Chinese rock and roll (1984)===\nThe birthplace of Chinese rock was in [[Beijing]].<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones. Andrew F. [2001] (2001). Yellow Music \u2013 CL: Media Culture and Colonial Modernity in the Chinese Jazz Age. Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0-8223-2694-9}}</ref> As the nation's capital, the music was highly politicised and open to a range of foreign influences. It was marginal for most of the 1980s, consisting of live performances in small bars and hotels. The music was almost exclusively for the domain of university students and \"underground\" bohemian circles. In late 1989 and early 1990 Chinese rock partially emerged into mainstream music as a combination of the Northwest Wind and prison song fads.\n\nThe first Chinese rock song was arguably the Northwest Wind anthem \"[[Nothing To My Name]]\", first performed in 1984 by [[Cui Jian]], widely recognised as the father of Chinese rock. The song introduced into post-revolutionary China a whole new ethos that combined individualism, direct and bold expression. It soon came to symbolise the frustration harboured by a disillusioned generation of young intellectuals who grew cynical about [[Communism]] and critical of China's traditional and contemporary culture. It also expressed, even for older Chinese, a dissatisfaction with unrealized promises of the Chinese regime.\n\nIn the spring of 1989, \"Nothing To My Name\" became the ''de facto'' anthem of the student protestors at [[Tiananmen Square]]. Additionally, in May and July of that year, three of China's famous rock bands were established: Breathing (''Huxi'', {{lang|zh-hans|\u547c\u5438}}), [[Cobra (Chinese band)|Cobra]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u773c\u955c\u86c7}}), and [[Zang Tianshuo]]'s ({{lang|zh-hans|\u81e7\u5929\u6714}}) [[1989 (band)|1989]]. Earlier rock music groups include \"Infallible\" (''Budaoweng'' {{lang|zh-hans|\u4e0d\u5012\u7fc1}}), formed by Zang Tianshuo and [[Tang Dynasty (band)]] (''Tang Chao'', {{lang|zh-hans|\u5510\u671d}}) lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Ding Wu ({{lang|zh|\u4e01\u6b66}}), and probably the most famous of all Chinese rock bands: \"[[Black Panther (band)|Black Panther]]\" (''Hei Bao'' {{lang|zh|\u9ed1\u8c79}}), originally fronted by China's alternative music pioneer [[Dou Wei]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7aa6\u552f}}).\n\n===Prison songs (1988\u20131989)===\n\"[[Prison Song (genre)|Prison Songs]]\" ({{lang|zh|\u300a\u56da\u6b4c\u300b}}) became popular in 1988 and early 1989, parallel to the Northwest Wind style. The fad was initiated by Chi Zhiqiang ({{lang|zh-hans|\u8fdf\u5fd7\u5f3a}}), who wrote lyrics about his time in jail and set them to folk melodies from northeast China. In contrast to Northwest Wind songs, prison songs were slow, \"weepy\" and invoked negative role models, often using vulgar language and expressing despair and cynicism. Their non-conformist values are apparent in such songs as \"Mother Is Very Muddle-Headed\" and \"There Is Not a Drop of Oil in the Dish\". The popularity of these songs reflected the fact that many Chinese during the 1980s became tired of official artistic representations and discourse. The patrons of prison songs were the urban youth, and private entrepreneurs, who at that time were mostly from marginal backgrounds.\n\n===Popular Chinese rock (1990\u20131993)===\n[[File:Tang Dynasty playing in Xian.JPG|thumb|right|230px|[[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]] performing in 2004.]]\nAfter the TianAnMen Square protests, rock became part of general urban youth Chinese culture. Its rise from the margins was celebrated on 17 and 18 February 1990, when Beijing's largest ever all-rock concert was held in the Capital Gymnasium, one of the city's largest halls. The concert featured six rock bands, among them are Cui Jian's [[ADO (band)|ADO]] and [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]]. The criterion that the organizers set as qualification to participate was \"originality\".\n\nChinese rock reached a peak of creativity and popularity between 1990 and 1993.  In 1991, the glam metal band Black Panther released their self-titled debut album. With glossy production and hard rock melodies backing the sincere voice of lead singer [[Dou Wei]], it featured hit singles such as \"Don't Break My Heart and \"Ashamed\". A year later, the album went on to sell more than 1,000,000 copies nationwide, a standard never before achieved in Chinese rock history. Another band, [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]], whose style was comparable to British heavy metal, successfully broke another barrier. Their singles \"9/4 (a reference to the song's time signature)\", \"The Sun\", and \"Choice\" climbed the charts. Once again, it was not until 1992, that their debut ''[[A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty]]'' sold over 2,000,000 copies throughout Asia, including Japan, Korea, and the Southeast.  From there, other previously formed rock bands, such as the first all female band, [[Cobra (Chinese band)|Cobra]], and hard rockers [[The Face (band)|The Face]] (each established in 1989), achieved greater success than ever. In addition, dozens of newer bands formed during the peak of their success, and rock music was performed on a regular basis. Big name artists and bands were featured in media such as [[China Central Television|CCTV]] and MTV, while other lesser known acts made a presence in small-scale, underground rock parties such as band leader Fa Zi who was perhaps the most well-known musician at art colony Yuan Ming Yuan near Bei Da in Beijing before it was closed down. The core participants in rock subculture adopted characteristic nonconformist appearance and behaviour. These included glam rock styles: pretty face, long hair, jeans, silver metal ornaments, black leather coats, as well as emerging [[grunge]] styles: Flannel shirts, and [[DIY ethic|do it yourself ethics]], coupled with a carefree, hippie-style behaviour. The decline of Northwest Wind and simultaneous rise of rock music represented a shift in the attitude of many of China's intellectuals. Nostalgia changed into an unequivocally fierce negation, a sense of alienation from China's traditional and rural culture.\n\n===Rock goes underground, earns newfound respect (1994/1997)===\nBy 1994, mainstream popularity of Chinese rock slowly began to decline. This can only be attributed to strict [[censorship]] by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]], such as the banning of rock from television and restrictions on performances.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> More importantly, the decline of rock reflected the general lack of interest in politicised cultural products, thoughts, or behaviour. People became more interested in engaging with the market economy, making money and improving their living standard.  Cross-border cultural exchange facilitated by increased economic openness, and the radical commercialisation of the music industry in the mid-1990s both lead to the import of overseas music, particularly from Taiwan and Hong Kong. [[Cantopop]] singers such as [[Andy Lau]] were backed up by well-resourced record companies and could raise revenues from film-making and advertising, two sources usually rejected by Chinese rock musicians. Moreover, the level of censorship imposed on [[c-pop]] was less damaging, since [[gangtai]] culture is more independent from mainland culture. With the tragedy of Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death, a whole new scene had emerged in the underground.\n\nDuring 1994, former Black Panther frontman Dou Wei released \"Dark Dreams\" with his new band \"The Dreaming\". This album marked a complete departure from his \"glam metal\" days. Instead, this album put more emphasis on thicker and more jangly guitars. Dou started singing in a thin, almost apathetic drone-like voice. He also began experimenting with gothic and electronic sounds, and earned a whole new kind of respect, as well as credibility in the alternative nation. Another unlikely figure in the scene was the father of Chinese rock himself, [[Cui Jian]].   A rare compilation album, titled \"Rock Pioneers\" was also released. The album showcased raw, rather unorthodox playing styles, as well as a rejection (even sometimes a mockery) of mainstream rock music. With the exception of Dream, the only band on the compilation to achieve mainstream success was [[Thin Man (band)]], who went on to revitalize rock back into the masses. Self-styled punk [[He Yong (rock musician)|He Yong]] fiercely resisted mainstream culture and their [[cantopop]] imitators on the mainland. His only album, \"Garbage Dump\", was embraced by troubled Chinese youth, and earned him an enormous cult following. In 1995, a handful of younger punk bands ([[Brain Failure]], Reflector, A Jerks, and 69) produced an album called \"Wuliao Contingent,\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u65e0\u804a\u519b\u961f}}, better translated as \"Battalion of Boredom\") representing the boredom and frustration collectively felt within the urban landscape. At the forefront was Brain Failure, the most successful of these bands, who continue to tour the world with their ska/punk sound. English is used to both express what Chinese lyrics cannot, and also to crossover to the western music market. One of the significant turning points for rock was [[Cui Jian]]'s performance with [[The Rolling Stones]] in 2003 at the age of 42. It opened the genre to the rest of the world for the first time.\n\n===Rock Revival (2000\u2013present)===\n{{Original research section|date=September 2007}}\nFrom 2000 to 2004 [[post punk]] and [[extreme metal]] entered the underground scene and ascended among the fans. In 2004\u20132005, Beijing's Joyside went on their first tour of China. [[United States|American]] [[filmmaker]] Kevin Fritz followed them to make the film Wasted Orient. It was released on DVD in 2007 by [[Plexifilm]].<ref>WastedOrient. \"[http://www.wastedorient.com/4.html WastedOrient] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718022824/http://www.wastedorient.com/4.html |date=2007-07-18 }}.\" ''Wasted Orient: The Official Rock n' Roll Film of Joyside.''

In this film the original line-up of Joyside including Bian Yuan, Liu Hao, Fan Bo, Yang Yang, & Xin Shuang shows these colorful characters drowning away in [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] is both hilarious and depressing at the same time. The film also includes some of Joyside's early music, which brought them some recognition. The film Wasted Orient is non-political, and strays away from making any superficial social commentary. While Joyside is not particularly known for the talent, the film present Chinese rock music in the new 2000 millennium in the most authentic, raw, and genuine form{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.\n\n:'''Director Kevin Fritz:'''\n:{{cquote|''The film Wasted Orient is what it is pure and simple. It's honest. It is the true way of Chinese rock n' roll. It's not glamorous. It's filthy. It's filled with despair.

The show is sponsored by Pepsi, and produced by Ato Ato Integrated Media.\n\n===The Beijing Midi Modern School of Music and Music Festival===\nAnother important step in the development of Chinese rock music had been the [[Beijing Midi School of Music]] in [[Beijing]]. Established 1993 by Zhang Fan, it was the first school nationally to offer classes for jazz music and rock music. Started as a school festival in 1999, the [[Midi Modern Music Festival]] advanced to the largest rock music festival nationally with up to 80000 visitors and over 100 bands. Both the school and the festival supported the underground scene across the country and opened the door for over 18 foreign bands in 2006 to perform at the festival and elsewhere in the country. (i.e. Alev, Monokino, Yokohama Music Association, The Wombats, etc.).

Especially in the metal and gothic genre these tours are considered milestones in China.\n\n===The 2008 Olympics and the Sichuan earthquake===\nA major drawback for the music scene in general was the cancellation of several events leading up to the [[2008 Olympic Games]], as well as the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]{{clarify|date=December 2011}}. The 2008 Midi Modern Music Festival was cancelled ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080628052436/http://wiki.rockinchina.com/index.php?title=Midi_Music_Festival_2008 cancellation note]) and delayed to October 2008, the Soilwork gig ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080428184515/http://wiki.rockinchina.com/index.php?title=Soilwork_in_Beijing preannouncement]) had to be cancelled, as the band did not receive their visas and the German Esplanade in Chongqing was stopped by the organizers ([https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015059/http://wiki.rockinchina.com/index.php?title=German_Esplanade_Chongqing_2008 change note]).\n\nThe Sichuan earthquake in general shook the music scene and spawned dozens of \"We are together\" and \"Think of Sichuan\" gigs and charity events throughout Beijing and other cities. London Chinese Radio made a [https://web.archive.org/web/20111007030348/http://www.londonhuayu.co.uk/?p=107 Special Earthquake Edition] on their New Sounds of China podcast to cover this.\n\n===The Shanghai Scene===\nHistorically more open to the outside, Shanghai is home to musicians from around the world. The unofficial home of the local jazz scene is JZ club while DJs and Electronic Producers frequently play The Shelter. Underground rock bands converge at Yuyintang. The 2010 World Expo and auxiliary events brought legal limitations to live performances and dried up venues temporarily, even censoring Shanghainese indie rock heroes Top Floor Circus.<ref>Shanghaiist. \"[http://shanghaiist.com/2009/12/15/shanghai_doesnt_welcome_you_video_h.php].\" ''Shanghaiist: Shanghai doesn't welcome you video harmonized off Youku.''

In the first Panther period, the masterpiece \"take care\", \"don't break my heart\", \"no land\". During this period, Dou Wei is singing. How to evaluate Dou Wei's singing? The Panther has changed several vocals, and has never surpassed Dou Wei. The success of the Panthers, Dou Wei, can at least get more than half of the weight. The second single-person period, the masterpiece \"Black Dream\", \"Sad Dream\", \"Hey! be good\". During this period, the main style of Dou Wei's music was changed to post-punk. The hands were not unreasonable, and the emotions were thick. A unique relaxation in Hou Peng's temperament was well grasped by Dou Wei. Moreover, in \"Black Dream\", Dou Wei took an important step, that is, the contempt for the melody and lyrics, and the emphasis on the arrangement and sound effects, which made his creative mode begin to break away from pop music and move toward experimental music. The third translation band is not necessarily a period, and the masterpieces are \"Yu Yu\", \"Wang Tianxia\", \"Winter Spring and Autumn Color\". During this period, Dou Wei met Bark Psychosis, a British post-shake band that had a huge impact on his music. BP's influence on Dou Wei is very obvious. The translated band once sang their album \"Hex\", and the cover of Dou Wei's album \"Mountain and Water\" also imitated \"HEX\"{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} And the song \"Love is loved\" in the album \"Music Audition\" is also a copy of the \"Fingerspit\". Dou Wei' s imitation is a true inheritance, and it is by no means an imitation of the situation. Dou Wei' s stealing from BP is a technique, and with his own spiritual core, a \"Hex\" full of Chinese landscape is born. During this period, Dou Wei' s ability to arrange music evolved to the top level in the world, and the lyrics ability evolved into the height of the singularity of the singer. Every time I say that Dou Wei arranges world-class people to question the world's popularity, is there a certain relationship between talent and popularity? Keith Jarret, Scott Walker, Xenakis are first-class in the music field, which one have you heard? During this period, we can see that Dou Wei's excellent musical appreciation and learning ability. The fourth is a good man. During the period, the masterpiece \"Over the Mountain\", \"4'22\" in the album \"Jiusheng\", \"Xiao Le Dong Furnace\". This period is the ultimate evolutionary period of Dou Wei, congratulations to Dou Wei to get rid of all forms of restraint and explore music in depth. In itself and using music to dig into the heart. The three songs selected are very representative. It can be seen that Dou Wei's transformation of the emotional control of music during this period, Dou Wei successfully reached the highest state of art \u2013 no me. In fact, this period to Dou Wei The discussion on music rumors is no longer necessary. This is the kind of music that is \"no height\". The spiritual realm is the main one.\n# [[File:CuiJian2 2007 Hohaiyan.jpg|thumb]]Cui Jian's enlightenment is the rock of the 80s. As a guide for the rock in the 1980s, he is a rocker who can deserve to go down in history. Compared with the meaning of rock art, Cui Jian's meaning is more historical and political. In the 21st century, many people are not so difficult to get in touch with rock, so Cui Jian's meaning has become more and more distant. He is more and more like a symbol, such as the Pangu giant in mythology. Pangu is great, but no one sacrifices. Cui Jian's voice sounded, the trumpet blew, and the feeling of that era came. He always gave me a sense of coldness in black and white.Out of the background of the times, Cui Jian may become weak, just like taking the poems of Du Fu to the Song Dynasty. - Of course, because in this era background, Cui Jiancai is as great as a mountain. Cui Jian led the tide of the times, and the tide of the times also made the name of Cui Jian's godfather. Cui Jian said a very interesting sentence: Say it, you and us live in an era. As long as Tiananmen Square hangs the image of Chairman Mao, we are all the same. Don't think that you are 20 or 30 years younger than me, we are not a generation. We are all refugees in good times. In a sense, Cui Jian and Jiang Wen, Wang Wei, and Feng Xiaogang are the same type of people. They belong to the second generation in the courtyard. With the second generation of rebellious psychology, they are pioneering and have more masters than ordinary people. The resources are deeper and farther, so rebellious (or revolutionary) is also faster than ordinary people. After all, many of them are children of the courtyard, and they are descendants of the dynasty{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n{{listen\n | filename     = Cui Jian - Village Attacks City.ogg\n | title        = \"Village Attacks City (2005)\"\n | description  = An aggressive rock and western-influenced [[drum and bass]] song by [[Cui Jian]] that is quite different compared to gangtai style music\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2    = Tien Zhen -

This era is the decline of the Three Rocks of Magic Rock, the rise of Shucun Village and the glorious era of Happy Paradise. Shucun is an urban-rural junction near Shangdi in Beijing. Because the rent is cheap and close to the venue, it quickly gathered a large number of poor and hard-pressed bands. In almost all ages, all the bands you have heard of are in Shucun, and Shucun became a rock-and-roll place at that time. You said that you didn't live in the tree village, just told you that you can't play the guitar. It was because the rock band gathered in the tree village that led to the Wudaokou performance venues; or because the glory of the happy paradise caused the band to enter the tree village, it was impossible to test, but no matter how Haidian-Wudaokou-Shucun was the indelible impression of that era. It is also the spiritual symbol of that generation of rockers. The \"post-revolutionary era\" recorded the sadness and happiness of that period in time, and you will have a little sadness after seeing it.\n* 2000\u20132003. Since 2000, a great name will be on the stage of Chinese rock music history and began to dominate Chinese rock for nearly 10 years. Nowadays, many people only know the Midi Music Festival, but they do not know a small building near the Ruiwang Tomb at the foot of Xiangshan Mountain - Midi Music School. Midi Music School was founded earlier than 2000, but the reason why it was only mentioned in 2000 was that the president of Zhang Fan made a great decision. Perhaps he did not realize the significance of this decision. However, it is undeniable that he will rely on this decision to become the Chinese rock godfather with Cui Jian. That is, he decided to run a graduation report in the school, and after 10 years of development, this report has finally become the first brand of the Chinese rock festival: Midi Music Festival. Yes, you may not imagine that today's fascinating Midi Music Festival was a small report show with only a few bands and hundreds of spectators. This performance is only three years, all free of charge, 10 boxes of lunch. After 2003, as you know, Midi Music Festival began to walk out of the campus, facing the society, went to Xidan, Sculpture Park, Haidian Park, etc., began to collect tickets, the number of bands and audiences rose, and the box lunch could not be bought, 10 You can only buy a bunch of lamb skewers. This pure, non-leisure music festival.\n* 2004\u20132009. In the past few years, various performance venues have begun to take off, such as luck, happiness, starlight, mao, Yugong Yishan, etc., to Fuhaosi through Changan, the city is singing rock; the style of the band is also The more diverse it is. In the past, Cui Jian, He Yong, this group of people really can't tell what style it is. We can only call socialist rock with Chinese characteristics. At this time, the band began to have obvious style tendency: punk represented by the boring army. The new gold represented by Twisting Machine Yaksha is represented by Pangu. The street is represented by cmcb. The folk song represented by Wan Xiaoli, the rapids represented by suffocation, the death represented by frost, represented by Xie Tianxiao. The grunge, with the dragon Shinto as the reggae, in short, the style you want to listen to can find a representative band in the country, as well as the Western rock style like Suyang, second-hand, Nancheng second brother, China original (we are called folklore) style. This stage is summed up in eight words: a hundred flowers bloom, and hundreds of schools contend.\n* 2009 to present. In 2009, there was a strong fruit debut, which disrupted the rock performance and directly challenged the dominance of Midi, the Strawberry Music Festival. The Strawberry Music Festival is part of the Modern Sky. In fact, the two music festivals, Modern and Midi, have always been in the water: the whistle is held every year on May 1, and the modern year is held in the eleventh year. However, in 2009, Modern suddenly made a force to hold the Strawberry Music Festival during the 51st, and sang against the whistle of the whistle, and it was not the usual way for Metersbonwe to come. Before the Strawberry Music Festival, all the music festivals are on the rock, the band must rock, pure rock, and die. Starting from the strawberry, I started a new style of music festival and started to take the leisure route. Since 2009, many fans who have never been to the music festival gathered under the banner of cute and colorful, shouting that the revolutionary slogan has always been The music festival held by underground dark forces. From this moment on, the festival reduced the atmosphere of sadness. We began to enjoy the sun lawn and food, no longer thinking about putting blood and stool on the flag, but where there was oppression and kneeling there.\n\n<small>'''Nowadays:'''</small>\n\nThere is a disconnect between Chinese pop music and society. This disconnection has caused the general public to listen to music and listen to songs mainly to listen to a fun. Not to mention the general public, and even the earphone enthusiasts who are pursuing the sound quality are positioned to listen to music as a pure entertainment. Then Chinese music and social movements are out of touch. The relationship between Chinese pop music history and Chinese modern history is not as close as that of Europe and the United States. To know the history of Western pop music, it is possible to directly reflect the social life of people in different periods and the social movements of the corresponding period (bruces, jazz, hippies, folk songs, which is not closely connected with the social environment?)\n\nChinese pop songs, contain too much emphasis on lyrics and too much emphasis on the singer itself. It is means everything is expressed by the lyrics. In this kind of environment, it is a strange thing to want to create a music that really touches people's hearts. Say something ugly: You like the lyrics so much, you can't read poems~\nChina keeps up with the music of the historical process. I personally think that one is the jazz of old Shanghai. One is Cui Jian who actively promotes Western music at the beginning of reform and opening up. (I personally feel that it is not appropriate to simply define him as rock.)\n\nThe current Chinese style is prevalent, but it can be regarded as the result of the rise of nationalism. Although nationalism itself is not a good thing, this style is a good or unintentional follow-up of the social process, just the quality of singing and singing, or too low. Fortunately, now the audience has begun to pay attention to the arrangement, and more and more powerful musicians have joined the writing of ancient songs. I think there is still a possibility that this style will make a difference in the \"World Music\" category, and it is also a good opportunity for Chinese music.\nAs for the overall catching up with the level of the West, China has gone too far. It has been off the line for too many years. This thing requires all Chinese people to work hard together to catch up. It is not a few musicians who can get it... After all, The great Chinese have also said that personal efforts are of course important, but they must also take into account the historical process.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Midi Modern Music Festival]]\n*[[Beijing Pop Festival]]\n*[[Modern Sky Festival]]\n*[[C-pop]]\n*[[Cantopop]]\n*[[Chinese heavy metal]]\n*[[Mandopop]]\n*[[Taiwanese rock]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Campbell, Jonathan (2011).
