{"title_page": "The Birth of Venus", "text_new": "{{other uses}}\n{{italic title}}\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|400px|Sandro Botticelli, ''The Birth of Venus'' (c. 1484\u20131486). [[Tempera]] on canvas. 172.5 cm \u00d7 278.9 cm (67.9 in \u00d7 109.6 in). [[Uffizi]], Florence]]\n[[File:Venus botticelli detail.jpg|thumb|Detail: the face of Venus]]\n\n'''''The Birth of Venus ''''' ({{lang-it|Nascita di Venere}} {{IPA-it|\u02c8na\u0283\u0283ita di \u02c8v\u025b\u02d0nere|}}) is a [[painting]] by the Italian artist [[Sandro Botticelli]], probably made in the mid 1480s. It depicts the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called [[Venus Anadyomene]] and often depicted in art). The painting is in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], Italy.\n\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', also in the Uffizi.  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; of the two, the ''Birth'' is better known than the ''Primavera''.<ref>Ettlingers, 134; Legouix, 118</ref>  As depictions of subjects from [[classical mythology]] on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the ''Birth''. It used to be thought that they were both commissioned by the same member of the Medici family, but this is now uncertain. \n\nThey have been endlessly analysed by [[art historian]]s, with the main themes being: the emulation of ancient painters and the context of wedding celebrations (generally agreed), the influence of [[Renaissance Neo-Platonism]] (somewhat controversial), and the identity of the commissioners (not agreed).  Most art historians agree, however, that the ''Birth'' does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the ''Primavera'' probably does.  While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from [[Greek mythology]], and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.<ref>Ettlingers, 135\u2013136; Lightbown, 160\u2013162</ref>\n\n==Description and subject==\n[[File:The Birth of Venus detail - Hora.jpg|thumb|The [[Horae|Hora of Spring]]]]\npoopoopoopoopoo\nhe subject.<ref>For classical examples, see below. Scallops were familiar Italian seafood, but their shells are never more than a few inches wide.  The main European species eaten are ''[[Pecten maximus]]'' and ''[[Pecten jacobaeus]]'' in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. No Mediterranean shell is anything like this large, although various tropical [[giant clam]] species may reach half this width or more, with a rather different shape.</ref> At the left the [[Anemoi|wind god]] Zephyr blows at her, with the wind shown by lines radiating from his mouth. He is in the air, and carries a young female, who is also blowing, but less forcefully. Both have wings. [[Vasari]] was probably correct in identifying her as \"Aura\", personification of a lighter breeze.<ref>Lightbown, 153\u2013156; 159; Wind, 131</ref>  Their joint efforts are blowing Venus towards the shore, and blowing the hair and clothes of the other figures to the right.<ref>Lightbown, 156</ref> \n\nAt the right a female figure who may be floating slightly above the ground holds out a rich cloak or dress to cover Venus when she reaches the shore, as she is about to do. She is one of the three [[Horae]] or Hours, Greek minor goddesses of the seasons and of other divisions of time, and attendants of Venus. The floral decoration of her dress suggests she is the Hora of Spring.<ref>Lightbown, 156\u2013159; Wind, 131</ref>  \n\nAlternative identifications for the two secondary female figures involve those also found in the ''Primavera''; the nymph held by Zephyr may be [[Chloris]], a flower nymph he married in some versions of her story, and the figure on land may be [[Flora (deity)|Flora]].<ref>Dempsey uses these identifications. Legouix, 21 argues for the traditional one for the female held by Zephyr.</ref> Flora is generally the Roman equivalent of the Greek Chloris; in the ''Primavera'' Chloris is transformed into the figure of Flora next to her, following [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'',<ref>Wind, 115\u2013117</ref> but it is hard to see that such a transformation is envisaged here. However, the roses blown along with the two flying figures would be appropriate for Chloris.\n\nThe subject is not strictly the \"Birth of Venus\", a title given to the painting only in the nineteenth century (though given as the subject by Vasari), but the next scene in her story, where she arrives on land, blown by the wind. The land probably represents either [[Kythira|Cythera]] or [[Cyprus]], both Mediterranean islands regarded by the Greeks as territories of Venus.<ref>Lightbown, 159\u2013160</ref>\n\n==Technical==\nThe painting is large, but slightly smaller than the ''Primavera'', and where that is a [[panel painting]], this is on the cheaper support of canvas.  Canvas was increasing in popularity, perhaps especially for secular paintings for country villas, which were decorated more simply, cheaply and cheerfully than those for city ''palazzi'', being designed for pleasure more than ostentatious entertainment.<ref>Lightbown, 153</ref>\n\nThe painting is on two pieces of canvas, sewn together before starting, with a [[gesso]] ground tinted blue.  There are differences to Botticelli's usual technique, working on panel supports, such as the lack of a green first layer under the flesh areas.  There are a number of ''[[pentimenti]]'' revealed by modern scientific testing.  The Hora originally had \"low classical sandals\", and the collar on the mantle she holds out is an afterthought.  The hair of Venus and the flying couple was changed.  There is heavy use of gold as a pigment for highlights, on hair, wings, textiles, the shell and the landscape.  This was all apparently applied after the painting was framed.

Her pose is impossible: although she stands in a classical ''[[contrapposto]]'' stance, her weight is shifted too far over the left leg for the pose to be held.

Their bodies, by an endless intricacy of embrace, sustain the current of movement, which finally flickers down their legs and is dispersed like an electric charge.<ref>Clerk, 281\u2013282</ref></blockquote> \n\nBotticelli's art was never fully committed to naturalism; in comparison to his contemporary [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], Botticelli seldom gave weight and volume to his figures and rarely used a deep perspectival space.<ref name=\"smarth\"/>  Botticelli never painted landscape backgrounds with great detail or realism, but this is especially the case here. The laurel trees and the grass below them are green with gold highlights, most of the waves regular patterns, and the landscape seems out of scale with the figures.<ref>Ettlingers, 134</ref>  The clumps of [[typha|bulrushes]] in the left foreground are out of place here, as they come from a freshwater species.<ref>Lightbown, 323, note 11</ref>\n\n==Dating and history==\nIt has long been suggested that Botticelli was commissioned to paint the work by the [[Medici]] family of Florence, perhaps by [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] (1463\u20131503) a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], \"il Magnifico\".  This was first suggested by [[Herbert Horne]] in his monograph of 1908, the first major modern work on Botticelli, and long followed by most writers, but more recently has been widely doubted, though it is still accepted by some. Various interpretations of the painting rely on this origin for its meaning.  Although relations were perhaps always rather tense between the ''Magnifico'' and his young cousins and wards, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother [[Giovanni il Popolano|Giovanni di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], it may have been politic to commission a work that glorified the older Lorenzo, as some interpretations have it.  There may be a deliberate ambiguity as to which Lorenzo was intended to be evoked.  In later years hostility between the two branches of the family became overt.\n\nHorne believed that the painting was commissioned soon after the purchase in 1477 of the [[Villa di Castello]], a country house outside Florence, by Lorenzo and Giovanni, to decorate their new house, which they were rebuilding.  This was the year after their father died at the age of 46, leaving the young boys wards of their cousin Lorenzo il Magnifico, of the senior branch of the [[Medici family]] and ''de facto'' ruler of Florence.<ref>Lightbown, 120\u2013122</ref>  There is no record of the original commission, and the painting is first mentioned by [[Vasari]], who saw it, together with the ''Primavera'', at Castello, some time before the first edition of his ''Lives'' in 1550, probably by 1530\u201340.  In 1550 Vasari was himself painting in the villa, but he very possibly visited it before that.  But in 1975 it emerged that, unlike the ''Primavera'', the ''Birth'' is not in the inventory, apparently complete, made in 1499 of the works of art belonging to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's branch of the family.  Ronald Lightbown concludes that it only came to be owned by the Medici after that.  The inventory was only published in 1975, and made many previous assumptions invalid.<ref>Lightbown, 122 (''Primavera'' in the 1499 inventory), 152.  In addition, the writer on art known as the \"[[Anonimo Gaddiano]]\", from around 1540, speaks of \"several\" very fine Botticellis at Castello, which may confirm the ''Birth'' was there.</ref>    \n\nHorne dated the work at some point after the purchase of the villa in 1477 and before Botticelli's departure for Rome to join the painting of the [[Sistine Chapel]] in 1481. Recent scholars prefer a date of around 1484\u201386 on grounds of the work's place in the development of Botticelli's style.  The ''Primavera'' is now usually dated earlier, after Botticelli's return from Rome in 1482 and perhaps around the time of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's wedding in July 1482,<ref>Lightbown, 122, 153; Hartt, 333</ref> but by some still before Botticelli's departure.<ref>Dempsey, Legouix, 115, 118</ref>\n\nWhenever the two paintings were united at Castello, they have remained together ever since. They stayed in Castello until 1815, when they were transferred to the Uffizi.  For some years until 1919 they were kept in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], another government museum in Florence.<ref>Legouix, 115\u2013118</ref>\n\n== Interpretations ==\n{{external media | width = 270px | align = right | headerimage =[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Birth of Venus (detail) - WGA2772.jpg|210px]] | video1 =[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Botticelli.html Smarthistory \u2013 Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'']<ref name=\"smarth\">{{cite web | title =Botticelli's Birth of Venus | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Botticelli.html | accessdate =December 19, 2012 }}</ref> }}\nAlthough there are ancient and modern texts that are relevant, no single text provides the precise imagery of the painting, which has led scholars to propose many sources and interpretations.<ref>Among many interpretations start with: [[Aby Warburg]], ''The Renewal of Pagan Antiquity,'' trans. David Britt, Los Angeles, 1999, 405\u2013431; [[Ernst Gombrich|Ernst H. Gombrich]], \"Botticelli's Mythologies:  A Study in the Neoplatonic Symbolism of his circle,\" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes,'' 8 (1945) 7\u201360; Wind, Chapter VIII; Lightbown, 152\u2013163; Frank Zollner, ''Botticelli: Images of Love and Spring,'' Munich, 1998, 82\u201391.</ref>   Many art historians who specialize in the Italian Renaissance have found [[Neoplatonic]] interpretations, of which two different versions have been articulated by [[Edgar Wind]] and [[Ernst Gombrich]],<ref>Dempsey, saying Wind is \"the most important and complete Neo-Platonic interpretation of Botticelli\u2019s mythological paintings\".</ref> to be the key to understanding the painting. Botticelli represented the Neoplatonic idea of [[divine love]] in the form of a nude Venus.<ref>Wind, Chapter VIII (Chapter VII on the ''Primavera''); [[Marilyn Stokstad|Stokstad, Marilyn]] ''Art History'', Pearson</ref>\n\nFor [[Plato]] \u2013 and so for the members of the Florentine [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]] \u2013 Venus had two aspects:  she was an earthly goddess who \naroused humans to physical love or she was a heavenly goddess who inspired intellectual love in them.  Plato further argued that contemplation of physical beauty allowed the mind to better understand spiritual beauty.  So, looking at Venus, the most beautiful of goddesses, might at first raise a physical response in viewers which then lifted their minds towards the godly.<ref>Plato, ''Symposium,'' 180\u2013181, 210.</ref>  A Neoplatonic reading of Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'' suggests that 15th-century viewers would have looked at the painting and felt their minds lifted to the realm of divine love.  \n\nThe composition, with a central nude figure, and one to the side with an arm raised above the head of the first, and winged beings in attendance, would have reminded its Renaissance viewers of the traditional [[iconography]] of the [[Baptism of Christ]], marking the start of his ministry on earth.  In a similar way, the scene shows here marks the start of Venus's ministry of love, whether in a simple sense, or the expanded meaning of Renaissance Neoplatonism.<ref>Hemsoll, 12:00; Hartt, 333</ref>  \n\nMore recently, questions have arisen about Neoplatonism as the dominant intellectual system of late 15th-century Florence,<ref>James Hankins, \"The Myth of the Platonic Academy of Florence,\" ''Renaissance Quarterly,'' 44 (1991) 429\u2013475.</ref> and scholars have indicated that there might be other ways to interpret Botticelli's mythological paintings.  In particular, both ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' and ''Birth of Venus'' have been seen as wedding paintings that suggest appropriate behaviors for brides and grooms.<ref>Lilian Zirpolo, \"Botticelli's ''Primavera:'' a Lesson for the Bride,\" ''Woman's Art Journal,'' 12/2 1991; Jane C. Long, \"Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'' as Wedding Painting,\" ''Aurora,'' 9 (2008) 1\u201326.</ref>\n\nThe [[Laurus nobilis|laurel trees]] at right and laurel wreath worn by the Hora are punning references to the name \"Lorenzo\", though it is uncertain whether [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], the effective ruler of Florence, or his young cousin [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco]] is meant.  In the same way the flowers in the air around Zephyr and on the textiles worn and carried by the Hora evoke the name of Florence.<ref>More clearly in the Latin Florentia (\"flowering\") than in the Italian Firenze.  This was a Roman imperial rename, the city having originally been Fluentia, for its two rivers.

The [[iconography]] of ''The Birth of Venus'' is similar to a description of a [[relief]] of the event in Poliziano's poem the ''Stanze per la giostra'', commemorating a Medici [[joust]] in 1475, which may also have influenced Botticelli, although there are many differences.  For example Poliziano talks of multiple Horae and zephyrs.<ref>Lightbown, 159\u2013160; ''Stanze de Messer Angelo Poliziano cominciate per la giostra del magnifico Giuliano di Pietro de Medici,'' I 99, 101, trans.

Another poem by Politian speaks of Zephyr causing flowers to bloom, and spreading their scent over the land, which probably explains the roses he blows along with him in the painting.<ref>Hemsoll, 7:40</ref>\n\n===Ancient art===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Capitoline Venus - Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016.jpg\n| width1 = 186\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = ''[[Capitoline Venus]]'', derived from ''[[Aphrodite of Cnidus]]''\n| image2 = Venus de Medici.png\n| width2 = 158\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ''[[Venus de' Medici]]''\n| footer = \n}}\nHaving a large standing female nude as the central focus was unprecedented in post-classical Western painting, and certainly drew on the classical sculptures which were coming to light in this period, especially in Rome, where Botticelli had spent 1481\u201382 working on the walls of the [[Sistine Chapel]].<ref>Clark, 92, 96\u201397; Lightbown, 160, \"the first surviving celebration of the beauty of the female nude represented for its own perfection rather than with erotic or moral or religious overtones.\"</ref>   The pose of Botticelli's ''Venus'' follows the [[Venus Pudica]] (\"Venus of Modesty\") type from [[classical antiquity]], where the hands are held to cover the breasts and groin; in classical art this is not associated with the new-born ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]''.  What became a famous example of this type is the ''[[Venus de' Medici]]'', a marble sculpture that was in a Medici collection in Rome by 1559, which Botticelli may have had opportunity to study (the date it was found is unclear).<ref>Clark, 76\u201381; Dempsey</ref>  \n\nThe painter and the humanist scholars who probably advised him would have recalled that [[Pliny the Elder]] had mentioned a lost masterpiece of the celebrated ancient Greek painter, [[Apelles]], representing ''Venus Anadyomene'' (''Venus Rising from the Sea''). According to Pliny, [[Alexander the Great]] offered his mistress, Pankaspe, as the model for the nude Venus and later, realizing that Apelles had fallen in love with the girl, gave her to the artist in a gesture of extreme magnanimity. Pliny went on to note that Apelles' painting of Pankaspe as Venus was later \"dedicated by [[Augustus]] in the shrine of his father [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]].\" Pliny also stated that \"the lower part of the painting was damaged, and it was impossible to find anyone who could restore it. . . . This picture decayed from age and rottenness, and [[Nero]]... substituted for it another painting by the hand of Dorotheus\".\n\nPliny also noted a second painting by Apelles of Venus \"superior even to his earlier one,\" that had been begun by the artist but left unfinished.  The Roman images in various media showing the new-born Venus in a giant shell may well be crude derivative versions of these paintings.  Botticelli could not have seen the frescos unearthed later in [[Pompeii]], but may well have seen small versions of the motif in [[terracotta]] or [[engraved gem]]s.  The \"House of Venus\" in Pompeii has a life-size fresco of Venus lying in the shell, also seen in other works; in most other images she stands with her hands on her hair, wringing the water from it, with or without a shell.\n\nThe two-dimensionality of this painting may be a deliberate attempt to evoke the style of [[Ancient_Greek_art#Pottery|ancient Greek vase painting]] or [[fresco]]s on the [[Etruscan_art#Wall-painting|walls of Etruscan tombs]],<ref>Mack, 2005, 86\u201387</ref> the only types of ancient painting known to Botticelli.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\n\nFile:Anadyomenes pushkin.jpg|Greco-Roman ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]''\nFile:Wiki Loves Art - Morlanwelz - Mus\u00e9e Royal de Mariemont - Statuette de V\u00e9nus sortant de l'onde (4).JPG|Greco-Roman bronze statuette\nFile:Et\u00e0 imperiale, cammeo con afrodite anadyomene, in pasta vitrea trasparente - Copia.jpg|Roman glass cameo ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]''\nFile:Aphrodite Anadyomene Louvre CA2288.jpg|Greek terracotta, from [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Mack===\n[[File:The Birth of Venus detail - Zephyr and Chloris.jpg|thumb|left|Zephyr and his companion]]\nAnother interpretation of the ''Birth of Venus'' is provided here by its author, Charles R. Mack. This interpretation takes much that is generally agreed, but Mack goes on to explain the painting as an [[allegory]] extolling the virtues of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].<ref>Mack (2005), 85\u201387 and also Mack (2002)</ref>  This has not been adopted by Renaissance art historians in general,<ref>See, for example, Frank Z\u00f6llner, ''Sandro Botticelli,'' Munich, 2005; David Wilkins, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art,'' Upper Saddle River, 2011, neither of whom follow Mack's interpretation.</ref> and it remains problematic, since it depends on the painting being commissioned by the Medici, yet the work is not documented in Medici hands until well into the following century. \n\nMack sees the scene as inspired by both the Homeric Hymn and the ancient paintings.  But something more than a rediscovered Homeric hymn was likely in the mind of the Medici family member who commissioned this painting from Botticelli. Once again, Botticelli, in his version of the Birth of Venus, might be seen as completing the task begun by his ancient predecessor Apelles, even surpassing him. Giving added support to this interpretation of Botticelli as a born-again Apelles is the fact that that very claim was voiced in 1488 by Ugolino Verino in a poem entitled \"On Giving Praise to the History of Florence.\"<ref>Mack, 2005, 86</ref>  <!-- Such a deliberately re-creative act as Botticelli may have performed with his ''Birth of Venus'' would go a long way towards explaining the curious flatness and linearity of the painting, which seem so very out of keeping with the direction of Renaissance art and with Botticelli's own approach to painting. ?? Not untypical, surely --> \n\nWhile Botticelli might well have been celebrated as a revivified Apelles, his ''Birth of Venus'' also testified to the special nature of Florence's chief citizen, [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. Although it now seems that the painting was executed for another member of the Medici family, it likely was intended to celebrate and flatter its head, Lorenzo de' Medici. Tradition associates the image of Venus in Botticelli's painting with the famous beauty [[Simonetta Cattaneo Vespucci]], of whom popular legend claims both Lorenzo and his younger brother, [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]], were great admirers. Simonetta was possibly born in the [[Liguria]]n seaside town of [[Porto Venere|Portovenere]] ('the port of Venus').  Thus, in Botticelli's interpretation, Pankaspe (the ancient living prototype of Simonetta), the mistress of [[Alexander the Great]] (the Laurentian predecessor), becomes the lovely model for the lost ''Venus'' executed by the famous Greek painter [[Apelles]] (reborn through the recreative talents of Botticelli), which ended up in Rome, installed by Emperor Augustus in the temple dedicated to Florence's supposed founder [[Julius Caesar]].  \n\nIn the case of Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', the suggested references to Lorenzo, supported by other internal indicators such as the stand of laurel bushes at the right, would have been just the sort of thing erudite Florentine humanists would have appreciated.  Accordingly, by overt implication, Lorenzo becomes the new Alexander the Great with an implied link to both Augustus, the first Roman emperor, and even to Florence's legendary founder, Caesar himself.  Lorenzo, furthermore, is not only magnificent but, as was Alexander in Pliny's story, also magnanimous, as well. Ultimately, these readings of the ''Birth of Venus'' flatter not only the Medici and Botticelli but all of Florence, home to the worthy successors to some of the greatest figures of antiquity, both in governance and in the arts.<ref>Mack, 2005, 87</ref>\n\nThese essentially pagan readings of Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'' should not exclude a more purely Christian one, which may be derived from the Neoplatonic reading of the painting indicated above.  Viewed from a religious standpoint, the nudity of Venus suggests that of Eve before the Fall as well as the pure love of Paradise. Once landed, the goddess of love will don the earthly garb of mortal sin, an act that will lead to the New Eve \u2013 the Madonna whose purity is represented by the nude Venus. Once draped in earthly garments she becomes a personification of the Christian Church which offers a spiritual transport back to the pure love of eternal salvation.  In this case the scallop shell upon which this image of Venus/Eve/Madonna/Church stands may be seen in its traditionally symbolic pilgrimage context. Furthermore, the broad expanse of sea serves as a reminder of the Virgin Mary's title ''stella maris'', alluding both to the Madonna's name (Maria/maris) and to the heavenly body (Venus/stella).  The sea brings forth Venus just as the Virgin gives birth to the ultimate symbol of love, Christ.<ref>Mack (2002), 225\u201326</ref>\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 021.jpg|thumb| [[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|''Calumny of Apelles'']], 1494\u201395, with \"Truth\" at left.

It depicts the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] arriving at the shore after her birth, when she had emerged from the sea fully-grown (called [[Venus Anadyomene]] and often depicted in art). The painting is in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], Italy.\n\nAlthough the two are not a pair, the painting is inevitably discussed with Botticelli's other very large mythological painting, the ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'', also in the Uffizi.  They are among the most famous paintings in the world, and icons of the [[Italian Renaissance]]; of the two, the ''Birth'' is better known than the ''Primavera''.<ref>Ettlingers, 134; Legouix, 118</ref>  As depictions of subjects from [[classical mythology]] on a very large scale they were virtually unprecedented in Western art since classical antiquity, as was the size and prominence of a nude female figure in the ''Birth''.

Most art historians agree, however, that the ''Birth'' does not require complex analysis to decode its meaning, in the way that the ''Primavera'' probably does.  While there are subtleties in the painting, its main meaning is a straightforward, if individual, treatment of a traditional scene from [[Greek mythology]], and its appeal is sensory and very accessible, hence its enormous popularity.<ref>Ettlingers, 135\u2013136; Lightbown, 160\u2013162</ref>\n\n==Description and subject==\n[[File:The Birth of Venus detail - Hora.jpg|thumb|The [[Horae|Hora of Spring]]]]\nIn the centre the newly-born goddess Venus stands nude in a giant [[scallop]] shell.

No Mediterranean shell is anything like this large, although various tropical [[giant clam]] species may reach half this width or more, with a rather different shape.</ref> At the left the [[Anemoi|wind god]] Zephyr blows at her, with the wind shown by lines radiating from his mouth. He is in the air, and carries a young female, who is also blowing, but less forcefully. Both have wings. [[Vasari]] was probably correct in identifying her as \"Aura\", personification of a lighter breeze.<ref>Lightbown, 153\u2013156; 159; Wind, 131</ref>  Their joint efforts are blowing Venus towards the shore, and blowing the hair and clothes of the other figures to the right.<ref>Lightbown, 156</ref> \n\nAt the right a female figure who may be floating slightly above the ground holds out a rich cloak or dress to cover Venus when she reaches the shore, as she is about to do. She is one of the three [[Horae]] or Hours, Greek minor goddesses of the seasons and of other divisions of time, and attendants of Venus. The floral decoration of her dress suggests she is the Hora of Spring.<ref>Lightbown, 156\u2013159; Wind, 131</ref>  \n\nAlternative identifications for the two secondary female figures involve those also found in the ''Primavera''; the nymph held by Zephyr may be [[Chloris]], a flower nymph he married in some versions of her story, and the figure on land may be [[Flora (deity)|Flora]].<ref>Dempsey uses these identifications. Legouix, 21 argues for the traditional one for the female held by Zephyr.</ref> Flora is generally the Roman equivalent of the Greek Chloris; in the ''Primavera'' Chloris is transformed into the figure of Flora next to her, following [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'',<ref>Wind, 115\u2013117</ref> but it is hard to see that such a transformation is envisaged here. However, the roses blown along with the two flying figures would be appropriate for Chloris.\n\nThe subject is not strictly the \"Birth of Venus\", a title given to the painting only in the nineteenth century (though given as the subject by Vasari), but the next scene in her story, where she arrives on land, blown by the wind. The land probably represents either [[Kythira|Cythera]] or [[Cyprus]], both Mediterranean islands regarded by the Greeks as territories of Venus.<ref>Lightbown, 159\u2013160</ref>\n\n==Technical==\nThe painting is large, but slightly smaller than the ''Primavera'', and where that is a [[panel painting]], this is on the cheaper support of canvas.  Canvas was increasing in popularity, perhaps especially for secular paintings for country villas, which were decorated more simply, cheaply and cheerfully than those for city ''palazzi'', being designed for pleasure more than ostentatious entertainment.<ref>Lightbown, 153</ref>\n\nThe painting is on two pieces of canvas, sewn together before starting, with a [[gesso]] ground tinted blue.  There are differences to Botticelli's usual technique, working on panel supports, such as the lack of a green first layer under the flesh areas.  There are a number of ''[[pentimenti]]'' revealed by modern scientific testing.  The Hora originally had \"low classical sandals\", and the collar on the mantle she holds out is an afterthought.  The hair of Venus and the flying couple was changed.  There is heavy use of gold as a pigment for highlights, on hair, wings, textiles, the shell and the landscape.  This was all apparently applied after the painting was framed.  It was finished with a \"cool gray varnish\", probably using egg yolk.<ref>Lightbown, 153, 162\u2013163, 163 quoted</ref><ref name=\"StClair\">{{Cite book|title=The Secret Lives of Colour|last=St. Clair|first=Kassia|publisher=John Murray|year=2016|isbn=9781473630819|location=London|pages=88|oclc=936144129}}</ref>\n\nAs in the ''Primavera'', the green pigment -- used for the wings of Zephyr, Zephyr's companion, and the leaves of the orange trees on the land -- has darkened considerably with exposure to light over time, somewhat distorting the intended balance of colours.  Parts of some leaves at the top right corner, normally covered by the frame, have been less affected.<ref>Lightbown, 162</ref>  The blues of the sea and sky have also lost their brightness.<ref>Hemsoll, 2:50</ref>\n\n==Style==\n[[File:The Birth of Venus detail - Venus.jpg|thumb|Venus]] \nAlthough the pose of Venus is classical in some respects, and borrows the position of the hands from the [[Venus Pudica]] type in Greco-Roman sculptures (see section below), the overall treatment of the figure, standing off-centre with a curved body of long flowing lines, is in many respects from [[Gothic art]].  [[Kenneth Clark]] wrote: \"Her differences from antique form are not physiological, but rhythmic and structural. Her whole body follows the curve of a Gothic ivory.  It is entirely without that quality so much prized in classical art, known as aplomb; that is to say, the weight of the body is not distributed evenly either side of a central plumb line. .... She is not standing but floating. ... Her shoulders, for example, instead of forming a sort of [[architrave]] to her torso, as in the antique nude, run down into her arms in the same unbroken stream of movement as her floating hair.\"<ref>Clark, 97\u201398, 98 quoted; Ettlingers, 134</ref> \n\nVenus' body is anatomically improbable, with elongated neck and torso. Her pose is impossible: although she stands in a classical ''[[contrapposto]]'' stance, her weight is shifted too far over the left leg for the pose to be held.  The proportions and poses of the winds to the left do not quite make sense, and none of the figures cast shadows.<ref name=\"smarth\"/>  The painting depicts the world of the imagination rather than being very concerned with realistic depiction.<ref>Hemsoll, 18:15</ref>\n\nIgnoring the size and positioning of the wings and limbs of the flying pair on the left, which bother some other critics, Kenneth Clark calls them:\n\n<blockquote>...perhaps the most beautiful example of ecstatic movement in the whole of painting. ... the suspension of our reason is achieved by the intricate rhythms of the drapery which sweep and flow irresistibly around the nude figures.  Their bodies, by an endless intricacy of embrace, sustain the current of movement, which finally flickers down their legs and is dispersed like an electric charge.<ref>Clerk, 281\u2013282</ref></blockquote> \n\nBotticelli's art was never fully committed to naturalism; in comparison to his contemporary [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], Botticelli seldom gave weight and volume to his figures and rarely used a deep perspectival space.<ref name=\"smarth\"/>  Botticelli never painted landscape backgrounds with great detail or realism, but this is especially the case here. The laurel trees and the grass below them are green with gold highlights, most of the waves regular patterns, and the landscape seems out of scale with the figures.<ref>Ettlingers, 134</ref>  The clumps of [[typha|bulrushes]] in the left foreground are out of place here, as they come from a freshwater species.<ref>Lightbown, 323, note 11</ref>\n\n==Dating and history==\nIt has long been suggested that Botticelli was commissioned to paint the work by the [[Medici]] family of Florence, perhaps by [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]] (1463\u20131503) a major patron of Botticelli, under the influence of his cousin [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], \"il Magnifico\".  This was first suggested by [[Herbert Horne]] in his monograph of 1908, the first major modern work on Botticelli, and long followed by most writers, but more recently has been widely doubted, though it is still accepted by some. Various interpretations of the painting rely on this origin for its meaning.  Although relations were perhaps always rather tense between the ''Magnifico'' and his young cousins and wards, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother [[Giovanni il Popolano|Giovanni di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], it may have been politic to commission a work that glorified the older Lorenzo, as some interpretations have it.  There may be a deliberate ambiguity as to which Lorenzo was intended to be evoked.  In later years hostility between the two branches of the family became overt.\n\nHorne believed that the painting was commissioned soon after the purchase in 1477 of the [[Villa di Castello]], a country house outside Florence, by Lorenzo and Giovanni, to decorate their new house, which they were rebuilding.  This was the year after their father died at the age of 46, leaving the young boys wards of their cousin Lorenzo il Magnifico, of the senior branch of the [[Medici family]] and ''de facto'' ruler of Florence.<ref>Lightbown, 120\u2013122</ref>  There is no record of the original commission, and the painting is first mentioned by [[Vasari]], who saw it, together with the ''Primavera'', at Castello, some time before the first edition of his ''Lives'' in 1550, probably by 1530\u201340.  In 1550 Vasari was himself painting in the villa, but he very possibly visited it before that.  But in 1975 it emerged that, unlike the ''Primavera'', the ''Birth'' is not in the inventory, apparently complete, made in 1499 of the works of art belonging to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's branch of the family.  Ronald Lightbown concludes that it only came to be owned by the Medici after that.  The inventory was only published in 1975, and made many previous assumptions invalid.<ref>Lightbown, 122 (''Primavera'' in the 1499 inventory), 152.  In addition, the writer on art known as the \"[[Anonimo Gaddiano]]\", from around 1540, speaks of \"several\" very fine Botticellis at Castello, which may confirm the ''Birth'' was there.</ref>    \n\nHorne dated the work at some point after the purchase of the villa in 1477 and before Botticelli's departure for Rome to join the painting of the [[Sistine Chapel]] in 1481. Recent scholars prefer a date of around 1484\u201386 on grounds of the work's place in the development of Botticelli's style.  The ''Primavera'' is now usually dated earlier, after Botticelli's return from Rome in 1482 and perhaps around the time of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's wedding in July 1482,<ref>Lightbown, 122, 153; Hartt, 333</ref> but by some still before Botticelli's departure.<ref>Dempsey, Legouix, 115, 118</ref>\n\nWhenever the two paintings were united at Castello, they have remained together ever since. They stayed in Castello until 1815, when they were transferred to the Uffizi.  For some years until 1919 they were kept in the [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], another government museum in Florence.<ref>Legouix, 115\u2013118</ref>\n\n== Interpretations ==\n{{external media | width = 270px | align = right | headerimage =[[File:Sandro Botticelli - The Birth of Venus (detail) - WGA2772.jpg|210px]] | video1 =[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Botticelli.html Smarthistory \u2013 Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'']<ref name=\"smarth\">{{cite web | title =Botticelli's Birth of Venus | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/Botticelli.html | accessdate =December 19, 2012 }}</ref> }}\nAlthough there are ancient and modern texts that are relevant, no single text provides the precise imagery of the painting, which has led scholars to propose many sources and interpretations.<ref>Among many interpretations start with: [[Aby Warburg]], ''The Renewal of Pagan Antiquity,'' trans. David Britt, Los Angeles, 1999, 405\u2013431; [[Ernst Gombrich|Ernst H. Gombrich]], \"Botticelli's Mythologies:  A Study in the Neoplatonic Symbolism of his circle,\" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes,'' 8 (1945) 7\u201360; Wind, Chapter VIII; Lightbown, 152\u2013163; Frank Zollner, ''Botticelli: Images of Love and Spring,'' Munich, 1998, 82\u201391.</ref>   Many art historians who specialize in the Italian Renaissance have found [[Neoplatonic]] interpretations, of which two different versions have been articulated by [[Edgar Wind]] and [[Ernst Gombrich]],<ref>Dempsey, saying Wind is \"the most important and complete Neo-Platonic interpretation of Botticelli\u2019s mythological paintings\".</ref> to be the key to understanding the painting. Botticelli represented the Neoplatonic idea of [[divine love]] in the form of a nude Venus.<ref>Wind, Chapter VIII (Chapter VII on the ''Primavera''); [[Marilyn Stokstad|Stokstad, Marilyn]] ''Art History'', Pearson</ref>\n\nFor [[Plato]] \u2013 and so for the members of the Florentine [[Platonic Academy (Florence)|Platonic Academy]] \u2013 Venus had two aspects:  she was an earthly goddess who \naroused humans to physical love or she was a heavenly goddess who inspired intellectual love in them.  Plato further argued that contemplation of physical beauty allowed the mind to better understand spiritual beauty.  So, looking at Venus, the most beautiful of goddesses, might at first raise a physical response in viewers which then lifted their minds towards the godly.<ref>Plato, ''Symposium,'' 180\u2013181, 210.</ref>  A Neoplatonic reading of Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'' suggests that 15th-century viewers would have looked at the painting and felt their minds lifted to the realm of divine love.  \n\nThe composition, with a central nude figure, and one to the side with an arm raised above the head of the first, and winged beings in attendance, would have reminded its Renaissance viewers of the traditional [[iconography]] of the [[Baptism of Christ]], marking the start of his ministry on earth.  In a similar way, the scene shows here marks the start of Venus's ministry of love, whether in a simple sense, or the expanded meaning of Renaissance Neoplatonism.<ref>Hemsoll, 12:00; Hartt, 333</ref>  \n\nMore recently, questions have arisen about Neoplatonism as the dominant intellectual system of late 15th-century Florence,<ref>James Hankins, \"The Myth of the Platonic Academy of Florence,\" ''Renaissance Quarterly,'' 44 (1991) 429\u2013475.</ref> and scholars have indicated that there might be other ways to interpret Botticelli's mythological paintings.  In particular, both ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]'' and ''Birth of Venus'' have been seen as wedding paintings that suggest appropriate behaviors for brides and grooms.<ref>Lilian Zirpolo, \"Botticelli's ''Primavera:'' a Lesson for the Bride,\" ''Woman's Art Journal,'' 12/2 1991; Jane C. Long, \"Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'' as Wedding Painting,\" ''Aurora,'' 9 (2008) 1\u201326.</ref>\n\nThe [[Laurus nobilis|laurel trees]] at right and laurel wreath worn by the Hora are punning references to the name \"Lorenzo\", though it is uncertain whether [[Lorenzo il Magnifico]], the effective ruler of Florence, or his young cousin [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici|Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco]] is meant.  In the same way the flowers in the air around Zephyr and on the textiles worn and carried by the Hora evoke the name of Florence.<ref>More clearly in the Latin Florentia (\"flowering\") than in the Italian Firenze.  This was a Roman imperial rename, the city having originally been Fluentia, for its two rivers.

The [[iconography]] of ''The Birth of Venus'' is similar to a description of a [[relief]] of the event in Poliziano's poem the ''Stanze per la giostra'', commemorating a Medici [[joust]] in 1475, which may also have influenced Botticelli, although there are many differences.  For example Poliziano talks of multiple Horae and zephyrs.<ref>Lightbown, 159\u2013160; ''Stanze de Messer Angelo Poliziano cominciate per la giostra del magnifico Giuliano di Pietro de Medici,'' I 99, 101, trans. David L. Quint, University Park, Pennsylvania, 1979.</ref>  Older writers, following Horne, posited that \"his patron Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco asked him to paint a subject illustrating the lines\",<ref>Clark, 97 quoted; see also Ettlingers, 134</ref> and that remains a possibility, though one difficult to maintain so confidently today.  Another poem by Politian speaks of Zephyr causing flowers to bloom, and spreading their scent over the land, which probably explains the roses he blows along with him in the painting.<ref>Hemsoll, 7:40</ref>\n\n===Ancient art===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Capitoline Venus - Palazzo Nuovo - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016.jpg\n| width1 = 186\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = ''[[Capitoline Venus]]'', derived from ''[[Aphrodite of Cnidus]]''\n| image2 = Venus de Medici.png\n| width2 = 158\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = ''[[Venus de' Medici]]''\n| footer = \n}}\nHaving a large standing female nude as the central focus was unprecedented in post-classical Western painting, and certainly drew on the classical sculptures which were coming to light in this period, especially in Rome, where Botticelli had spent 1481\u201382 working on the walls of the [[Sistine Chapel]].<ref>Clark, 92, 96\u201397; Lightbown, 160, \"the first surviving celebration of the beauty of the female nude represented for its own perfection rather than with erotic or moral or religious overtones.\"</ref>   The pose of Botticelli's ''Venus'' follows the [[Venus Pudica]] (\"Venus of Modesty\") type from [[classical antiquity]], where the hands are held to cover the breasts and groin; in classical art this is not associated with the new-born ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]''.  What became a famous example of this type is the ''[[Venus de' Medici]]'', a marble sculpture that was in a Medici collection in Rome by 1559, which Botticelli may have had opportunity to study (the date it was found is unclear).<ref>Clark, 76\u201381; Dempsey</ref>  \n\nThe painter and the humanist scholars who probably advised him would have recalled that [[Pliny the Elder]] had mentioned a lost masterpiece of the celebrated ancient Greek painter, [[Apelles]], representing ''Venus Anadyomene'' (''Venus Rising from the Sea''). According to Pliny, [[Alexander the Great]] offered his mistress, Pankaspe, as the model for the nude Venus and later, realizing that Apelles had fallen in love with the girl, gave her to the artist in a gesture of extreme magnanimity. Pliny went on to note that Apelles' painting of Pankaspe as Venus was later \"dedicated by [[Augustus]] in the shrine of his father [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]].\" Pliny also stated that \"the lower part of the painting was damaged, and it was impossible to find anyone who could restore it. . . . This picture decayed from age and rottenness, and [[Nero]]... substituted for it another painting by the hand of Dorotheus\".\n\nPliny also noted a second painting by Apelles of Venus \"superior even to his earlier one,\" that had been begun by the artist but left unfinished.  The Roman images in various media showing the new-born Venus in a giant shell may well be crude derivative versions of these paintings.  Botticelli could not have seen the frescos unearthed later in [[Pompeii]], but may well have seen small versions of the motif in [[terracotta]] or [[engraved gem]]s.  The \"House of Venus\" in Pompeii has a life-size fresco of Venus lying in the shell, also seen in other works; in most other images she stands with her hands on her hair, wringing the water from it, with or without a shell.\n\nThe two-dimensionality of this painting may be a deliberate attempt to evoke the style of [[Ancient_Greek_art#Pottery|ancient Greek vase painting]] or [[fresco]]s on the [[Etruscan_art#Wall-painting|walls of Etruscan tombs]],<ref>Mack, 2005, 86\u201387</ref> the only types of ancient painting known to Botticelli.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\n\nFile:Anadyomenes pushkin.jpg|Greco-Roman ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]''\nFile:Wiki Loves Art - Morlanwelz - Mus\u00e9e Royal de Mariemont - Statuette de V\u00e9nus sortant de l'onde (4).JPG|Greco-Roman bronze statuette\nFile:Et\u00e0 imperiale, cammeo con afrodite anadyomene, in pasta vitrea trasparente - Copia.jpg|Roman glass cameo ''[[Venus Anadyomene]]''\nFile:Aphrodite Anadyomene Louvre CA2288.jpg|Greek terracotta, from [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Mack===\n[[File:The Birth of Venus detail - Zephyr and Chloris.jpg|thumb|left|Zephyr and his companion]]\nAnother interpretation of the ''Birth of Venus'' is provided here by its author, Charles R. Mack. This interpretation takes much that is generally agreed, but Mack goes on to explain the painting as an [[allegory]] extolling the virtues of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]].<ref>Mack (2005), 85\u201387 and also Mack (2002)</ref>  This has not been adopted by Renaissance art historians in general,<ref>See, for example, Frank Z\u00f6llner, ''Sandro Botticelli,'' Munich, 2005; David Wilkins, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art,'' Upper Saddle River, 2011, neither of whom follow Mack's interpretation.</ref> and it remains problematic, since it depends on the painting being commissioned by the Medici, yet the work is not documented in Medici hands until well into the following century. \n\nMack sees the scene as inspired by both the Homeric Hymn and the ancient paintings.  But something more than a rediscovered Homeric hymn was likely in the mind of the Medici family member who commissioned this painting from Botticelli. Once again, Botticelli, in his version of the Birth of Venus, might be seen as completing the task begun by his ancient predecessor Apelles, even surpassing him. Giving added support to this interpretation of Botticelli as a born-again Apelles is the fact that that very claim was voiced in 1488 by Ugolino Verino in a poem entitled \"On Giving Praise to the History of Florence.\"<ref>Mack, 2005, 86</ref>  <!-- Such a deliberately re-creative act as Botticelli may have performed with his ''Birth of Venus'' would go a long way towards explaining the curious flatness and linearity of the painting, which seem so very out of keeping with the direction of Renaissance art and with Botticelli's own approach to painting. ?? Not untypical, surely --> \n\nWhile Botticelli might well have been celebrated as a revivified Apelles, his ''Birth of Venus'' also testified to the special nature of Florence's chief citizen, [[Lorenzo de' Medici]]. Although it now seems that the painting was executed for another member of the Medici family, it likely was intended to celebrate and flatter its head, Lorenzo de' Medici. Tradition associates the image of Venus in Botticelli's painting with the famous beauty [[Simonetta Cattaneo Vespucci]], of whom popular legend claims both Lorenzo and his younger brother, [[Giuliano de' Medici|Giuliano]], were great admirers. Simonetta was possibly born in the [[Liguria]]n seaside town of [[Porto Venere|Portovenere]] ('the port of Venus').  Thus, in Botticelli's interpretation, Pankaspe (the ancient living prototype of Simonetta), the mistress of [[Alexander the Great]] (the Laurentian predecessor), becomes the lovely model for the lost ''Venus'' executed by the famous Greek painter [[Apelles]] (reborn through the recreative talents of Botticelli), which ended up in Rome, installed by Emperor Augustus in the temple dedicated to Florence's supposed founder [[Julius Caesar]].  \n\nIn the case of Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'', the suggested references to Lorenzo, supported by other internal indicators such as the stand of laurel bushes at the right, would have been just the sort of thing erudite Florentine humanists would have appreciated.  Accordingly, by overt implication, Lorenzo becomes the new Alexander the Great with an implied link to both Augustus, the first Roman emperor, and even to Florence's legendary founder, Caesar himself.  Lorenzo, furthermore, is not only magnificent but, as was Alexander in Pliny's story, also magnanimous, as well. Ultimately, these readings of the ''Birth of Venus'' flatter not only the Medici and Botticelli but all of Florence, home to the worthy successors to some of the greatest figures of antiquity, both in governance and in the arts.<ref>Mack, 2005, 87</ref>\n\nThese essentially pagan readings of Botticelli's ''Birth of Venus'' should not exclude a more purely Christian one, which may be derived from the Neoplatonic reading of the painting indicated above.  Viewed from a religious standpoint, the nudity of Venus suggests that of Eve before the Fall as well as the pure love of Paradise. Once landed, the goddess of love will don the earthly garb of mortal sin, an act that will lead to the New Eve \u2013 the Madonna whose purity is represented by the nude Venus. Once draped in earthly garments she becomes a personification of the Christian Church which offers a spiritual transport back to the pure love of eternal salvation.  In this case the scallop shell upon which this image of Venus/Eve/Madonna/Church stands may be seen in its traditionally symbolic pilgrimage context. Furthermore, the broad expanse of sea serves as a reminder of the Virgin Mary's title ''stella maris'', alluding both to the Madonna's name (Maria/maris) and to the heavenly body (Venus/stella).  The sea brings forth Venus just as the Virgin gives birth to the ultimate symbol of love, Christ.<ref>Mack (2002), 225\u201326</ref>\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli 021.jpg|thumb| [[Calumny of Apelles (Botticelli)|''Calumny of Apelles'']], 1494\u201395, with \"Truth\" at left.

His first documented mention was on 21 October 1258, when he appears together with his father and two younger brothers in the consent of the foundation of a [[Cistercian]] abbey in [[Rudy, Silesian Voivodeship|Rudy]].\n\n===Duke of Racib\u00f3rz===\nAfter his father's death in 1282, and according to the custom during the [[History of Poland (966\u20131385)#Fragmentation and Invasion.2C .281138-1295.29|fragmentation of Poland]], Mieszko and his brothers divided the Duchy of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz between them: Mieszko and his youngest brother [[Przemys\u0142aw of Racib\u00f3rz|Przemys\u0142aw]] received together the district of [[Racib\u00f3rz]] as co-rulers. The other two brothers, [[Casimir of Bytom|Casimir]] and [[Bolko I of Opole|Bolko I]], received [[Opole]]. Because Przemys\u0142aw was still a minor at that time, Mieszko ruled alone until he attained his majority, in 1284.\n\nIn 1285 Mieszko politically supported the [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]], [[Thomas II Zaremba]] against [[Henry IV Probus]], providing shelter to the Bishop in Raciborz. His politics against Henry IV were reinforced when the Duke of Wroc\u0142aw repudiated his wife Constance \u2014sister of Mieszko\u2014 and sent her back to her homeland. Another consequence of Mieszko's politics was an armed expedition of Henry IV in 1287 against Racib\u00f3rz, who was sieged. Then Mieszko was forced to refuse his help to the Bishop.\n\n===Duke of Cieszyn===\nIn 1290 the division was made of the Duchy of Racib\u00f3rz: Przemys\u0142aw retained [[Racib\u00f3rz]] and Mieszko obtained the rule over the districts of [[Cieszyn]], [[O\u015bwi\u0119cim]] and [[Zator]]. The first time that he signed himself as Duke of Cieszyn was on 1 January 1290.\n\nIn internal politics he pursued vigorous policies. Mieszko carried out intensive colonizing policies and founded many settlements. He also gave city rights to several towns: Cieszyn, O\u015bwi\u0119cim  (in 1291), [[Bielsko]], [[Skocz\u00f3w]] and [[Fry\u0161t\u00e1t]]. On 10 November 1292 he granted the city rights to [[Zator]].\n\n===Struggles for the Throne of Krak\u00f3w===\n[[File:Cieszyn 7245.jpg|thumb|190px|Mieszko I monument in Cieszyn. Sculpted by Jan Raszka.]]\n\nMieszko refused to support any of the Piast pretenders to the [[Poland|Polish]] throne (Henry IV Probus, [[Przemys\u0142 II]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high]]). Instead he stood alongside King [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]. On 17 January 1291 the formal agreement was signed in [[Olomouc]] which formed the alliance between the Bohemian Kingdom, Mieszko and his two brothers Casimir and Przemys\u0142aw. Mieszko eventually swore [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] to King Wenceslaus II, although the exact date was still debatable; the most accepted date by historians was 11 August 1292.\n\nDespite his alliance, Mieszko didn't take an active part in Wenceslaus II's campaign against W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high in 1292; however, he put his army at the King's disposal and later took part in the Battle of [[Siewierz]]. Mieszko was present at the coronation of Wenceslaus II as King of Poland in [[Gniezno]] in 1300. After the death of Wenceslaus II in 1305, Mieszko continued to support the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]] in the person of [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]], son and successor of Wenceslaus II.\n\nOn 5 October 1305, Mieszko obtained his major victory when his daughter Viola Elisabeth married King Wenceslaus III. This union was a chance for Mieszko to make himself one of the most powerful figures in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], and he even began some attempts to obtain the Polish crown.\n\nHowever, Mieszko's promising career ended suddenly with the murder of Wenceslaus III (Olomouc, 4 August 1306). Viola Elisabeth never bore Wenceslaus III any children and the P\u0159emyslid dynasty became extinct.\n\nAfter 1306 the political activity of Mieszko almost disappeared. Is unknown why this happened, because at that time he was only around fifty-years-old and was still considered young enough. The government of the Duchy was increasingly absorbed by his sons Wladyslaw and Kazimierz. The only sign of his political activities during this time was the lease of the Czech city of [[K\u0119ty]] to the Bishop of Krak\u00f3w, [[Jan Muskata]], a strong opposer to the rule of W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high in [[Greater Poland]]. However, in contrast to his brother Bolko I, Mieszko didn't support the [[Rebellion of w\u00f3jt Albert]] in 1311.\n\n===Donations to the Church===\nMieszko was known for his generosity to the church. Thanks to him, the construction was completed of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] convent at O\u015bwi\u0119cim (shortly after 1283). Also, he financially assisted the monastery of [[Czarnow\u0105sy]] near Opole and in the Dominican of Cieszyn.\n\n===Death===\nMieszko's exact date of death is unknown. Diplomatic sources suggest that he died in 1314 or in the first half of 1315, before 27 June. He was probably buried in the Dominican church in Cieszyn. In 1931 the Polish painter and sculptor [[Jan Raszka]] made a sculpture of Mieszko I in Cieszyn.\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nAccording to some sources,<ref>{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast8.html |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}</ref> Mieszko's wife died around 1303, but her name is unknown.

It was developed and published by [[Czech Republic]] independent developer [[Keen Software House]]. In 2013, the initial developmental release of the game joined the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] [[early access]] program. During the following years of active development, ''Space Engineers'' sold over one million units. In total as of 2019 the game has sold over 3.5 million copies<ref name=\"indiedb.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiedb.com/events/2013-indie-of-the-year-awards/features/indie-of-the-year-2013|title=Indie of The Year 2013 feature|work=Indie DB}}</ref><ref name=\"Space Engineers Game News\"/>\nIn May of 2015, for approximately a year and a half, the game's [[source code]] was officially available and maintained by KSH to assist the [[Mod (video games)|modding]] community.<ref name=\"rpssourcecode\"/><ref name=\"mrsourcecode\"/>\nOn December 15, 2016, the game entered [[Software release life cycle#Beta|Beta]] and was later officially released on February 28, 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Space Engineers 10.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Screenshot of the game demonstrating the addition of new components to an existing structure.]]\n[[File:Space Engineers 13.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An astronaut mining an [[asteroid]] for resources using a hand drill]]\n[[File:Space Engineers 8.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First-person view from the cockpit of a small ship.]]\n\nGameplay of ''Space Engineers'' begins with the player selecting or joining a world with specific settings, such as the number of [[asteroid]]s and the available starting equipment. When creating or editing a world, several advanced options are available to change how the player will interact with the world, and how the worlds will appear. This includes changing the speed with which several tools and machines will work, the size of the player's inventory, and whether [[procedural generation]] will be used (effectively making the world infinite). Upon confirming the world settings, a [[loading screen]] appears while the world is generated. This screen consists of a random in-game screenshot as a backdrop, the game's logo, an animated loading icon, and a randomly selected message at the center. The message may be either a helpful gameplay hint, or one of many quotations concerning space, science, and/or engineering. Many of these quotes are from notable scientists such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Albert Einstein]], as well as authors such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. \n\nOnce in-game, the player is given control of a single astronaut (referred to as a \"Space Engineer\") and a set of tools comprising a drill, a welder, and a grinder (if spawn with tools is on). Construction begins by choosing any block from the Engineer's inventory, and placing it anywhere in open space to create a new [[voxel|voxel grid]]. Additional blocks can then be added to this grid to create a structure. \n\nEach block takes up a different amount of space, and can serve a structural, functional, interactive, and/or \naesthetic purpose. Armor blocks, the most basic and common of all blocks, can be realistically damaged and deformed through collisions or the use of weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/09/09/space-engineers-is-a-physics-sandbox-about-creation-and-destruction/|title=Space Engineers is a physics sandbox about creation and destruction |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/10/25/impressions-space-engineers/|title=Hands On With Space Engineers - Rock, Paper, Shotgun|publisher=rockpapershotgun.com}}</ref> Some blocks have attached [[keypads]], which can be used to view and manipulate the status of other specific blocks attached to the structure. To be functionally connected however, and to transport materials, blocks called \"conveyors\" must be used to connect the desired machines. \"Functional\" blocks require power, which can be provided by [[solar panels]] or [[nuclear reactors]] attached to the same structure. While reactors must be supplied with [[uranium]], and produce large amounts of power while active, solar panels will continually produce a low output of power when there is line-of-sight to the sun. Once being produced, power is automatically distributed throughout the entire structure and can also be stored in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].\n\nThree types of structures are available: small ships, large ships, and stations. The player can toggle between placing small and large block sizes; placing a small variant of a block will create a small ship, while placing a large variant will create a large ship. If a large block is placed in such a way that it intersects terrain [[voxels]] (such as an asteroid or planetary surface), a station is created instead. Stations use the same blocks as large ships, and can be converted into large ships by disconnecting them from the terrain (though a world setting can be changed to permit unanchored stations).\n\nThe size, resource requirements, and availability of blocks depends on the type of structure they are attached to. Small ships do not allow \"large\" blocks such as assemblers or refineries, whereas large ships and stations cannot use gatling guns, instead using AI-controlled gatling or missile turrets. Blocks attached to a small ship are considerably smaller and require fewer resources than those attached to large ships or stations (for example, light armor requires 25 steel plates on a station, but only one on a small ship).\n\nShips can be deliberately moved and rotated by a player as long as they are powered and have at least one [[gyroscope]], [[rocket engine|thruster]], and [[cockpit]]. To be able to move in any direction and then be able to stop effectively via inertia dampeners, thrusters must be placed on the structure facing up, down, forward, backward, left, and right. More gyroscopes on a ship will increase the ships ability to rotate in space, but in order for the inertial dampeners to be more effective, more thrusters must be added in each direction in which dampening is required.\n\nAstronauts floating in space are able to move forward, backward, upwards, downwards, left, or right without restriction by using a [[jetpack]]. They are also able to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. Astronauts and structures can also enable or disable [[inertia negation|inertial dampeners]], which automatically attempt to reduce speed to zero when force is not being applied, and the required thrusters are installed.\n\nIf the player disables their jetpack within a gravitational field (either on the surface of a planet or a structure/asteroid with a gravity generator), movement is restricted to a plane perpendicular to the direction of the net gravity field(s). Vertical viewing angle is also restricted between \u221290 and 90 degrees, as in most [[first-person shooter]]s. Ships and structures are unaffected by gravity generators unless equipped with at least one Artificial Mass block. If the player falls off a structure while within a gravity field, they will fall into space until out of range of the gravity generator, at which point the player's jetpack will automatically enable itself. However, if the player touches their feet to an asteroid or structure with no gravity present, their \"mag-boots\" will enable them to walk across its surface and even around edges; though jumping will disconnect the player from the surface, and they cannot traverse the 90-degree angle between a floor and wall.\n\nSeveral types of cargo ships can spawn randomly and fly through the world, which can be hijacked by the player or harvested for components. Some of these cargo ships are [[booby trap|booby trapped]] to explode when the player attempts to commandeer them, and are sometimes armed with hostile gatling or missile turrets.\n\nAll place-able objects can be colored prior to placement using a slider-based GUI. The player can manipulate the hue, saturation, and value of the color to produce a very large spectrum of colors. There are 14 slots where new colors can be saved for later use within the same world. Colors can also be changed after blocks have been placed by clicking the middle mouse button while hovering over a block on the \"Color Picker\" GUI.\n\nAsteroids and planets are currently fixed in space and cannot move, however rocks/minerals that have been mined are subject to gravity and will react accordingly. Asteroids also do not currently have gravity associated with them, and can come in several basic forms including spherical, torus, and rod-shapes, as well other variations or combinations of these.\n\n===Creative mode===\nI kreativ tilstand er spillere i stand til at spawn ubegr\u00e6nsede ressourcer, kan \u00f8jeblikkeligt opbygge v\u00e6rkt\u00f8jer og blokke og er uovervindelige. <Ref name = \"Features\"> {{cite web | url = http: //www.spaceengineersgame.com/features. html | title = Funktioner | arbejde = Space Engineers}} </ref> Nogle bygningsv\u00e6rkt\u00f8jer, s\u00e5som symmetri-tilstand og kopiering og inds\u00e6ttelse af skibe, er kun tilg\u00e6ngelige i denne tilstand. Spillere er ogs\u00e5 i stand til at opbygge og manipulere asteroider eller planeter ved hj\u00e6lp af et v\u00e6rkt\u00f8j kendt som \"Voxel Hands\". Selvom ressourcer er tilg\u00e6ngelige til indsamling og forfining, er de ikke p\u00e5kr\u00e6vet at oprette nye skibe eller stationer. Kreativ tilstand var oprindeligt den eneste tilg\u00e6ngelige tilstand i spillet. Denne tilstand eliminerer overlevelsesaspektet af spillet, s\u00e5 spillerne kan implementere ideer hurtigere og lettere.\n\n===Survival mode===\nIn survival mode, players need to mine, collect, and refine various [[chemical elements]] from asteroids and planets in order to craft tools, weapons, and blocks as well as produce electricity. Resources can be mined manually using a hand drill, or by using ships with the necessary equipment. Components are produced by assembling them from raw materials; however, they can also be harvested by [[Marine salvage|salvaging]] cargo ships. To avoid death, players must monitor their health, energy and oxygen levels. Damage can be inflicted on the player by collisions, weapons, contact with thrusters, meteor showers, or by running out of [[space suit]] energy. Collisions at higher speeds result in more damage. As the acceleration value of gravity generators stacks, damage from falling can be much more dangerous when multiple gravity generators are active. A player's health and energy can be restored using a Medical Room block, and energy can also be replenished by sitting in the cockpit of any powered structure. The development of survival mode began at the end of summer of 2013.<ref name=\"Dev Update 13\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.marekrosa.org/2014/03/space-engineers-survival-mode-update_13.html|title=Marek Rosa - dev blog|author=Marek Rosa|publisher=marekrosa.org}}</ref>\n\n===Materials and items===\nIn the survival mode of the game, all actions, including survival itself due to the power requirements of the space-suit's life-support system, depend on the gathering and refining of certain minerals. These minerals can be found on asteroids or planets, plundered from randomly spawned ships, or recovered from [[#Unknown signals|unknown signals]]. Raw materials are mined from deposits of ore on asteroids, and are then placed (or sent using a conveyor system) into a refinery or an arc furnace in order to refine them to be used in assemblers.

Inventories of refineries and arc furnaces will automatically request items to refine from connected inventories when they get low, and will send items into an available inventory when it fills up.

It was developed and published by [[Czech Republic]] independent developer [[Keen Software House]]. In 2013, the initial developmental release of the game joined the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] [[early access]] program. During the following years of active development, ''Space Engineers'' sold over one million units. In total as of 2019 the game has sold over 3.5 million copies<ref name=\"indiedb.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiedb.com/events/2013-indie-of-the-year-awards/features/indie-of-the-year-2013|title=Indie of The Year 2013 feature|work=Indie DB}}</ref><ref name=\"Space Engineers Game News\"/>\nIn May of 2015, for approximately a year and a half, the game's [[source code]] was officially available and maintained by KSH to assist the [[Mod (video games)|modding]] community.<ref name=\"rpssourcecode\"/><ref name=\"mrsourcecode\"/>\nOn December 15, 2016, the game entered [[Software release life cycle#Beta|Beta]] and was later officially released on February 28, 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Space Engineers 10.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Screenshot of the game demonstrating the addition of new components to an existing structure.]]\n[[File:Space Engineers 13.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An astronaut mining an [[asteroid]] for resources using a hand drill]]\n[[File:Space Engineers 8.jpg|thumb|right|300px|First-person view from the cockpit of a small ship.]]\n\nGameplay of ''Space Engineers'' begins with the player selecting or joining a world with specific settings, such as the number of [[asteroid]]s and the available starting equipment. When creating or editing a world, several advanced options are available to change how the player will interact with the world, and how the worlds will appear. This includes changing the speed with which several tools and machines will work, the size of the player's inventory, and whether [[procedural generation]] will be used (effectively making the world infinite). Upon confirming the world settings, a [[loading screen]] appears while the world is generated. This screen consists of a random in-game screenshot as a backdrop, the game's logo, an animated loading icon, and a randomly selected message at the center. The message may be either a helpful gameplay hint, or one of many quotations concerning space, science, and/or engineering. Many of these quotes are from notable scientists such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Albert Einstein]], as well as authors such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. \n\nOnce in-game, the player is given control of a single astronaut (referred to as a \"Space Engineer\") and a set of tools comprising a drill, a welder, and a grinder (if spawn with tools is on). Construction begins by choosing any block from the Engineer's inventory, and placing it anywhere in open space to create a new [[voxel|voxel grid]]. Additional blocks can then be added to this grid to create a structure. \n\nEach block takes up a different amount of space, and can serve a structural, functional, interactive, and/or \naesthetic purpose. Armor blocks, the most basic and common of all blocks, can be realistically damaged and deformed through collisions or the use of weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/09/09/space-engineers-is-a-physics-sandbox-about-creation-and-destruction/|title=Space Engineers is a physics sandbox about creation and destruction |work=[[PC Gamer]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2013/10/25/impressions-space-engineers/|title=Hands On With Space Engineers - Rock, Paper, Shotgun|publisher=rockpapershotgun.com}}</ref> Some blocks have attached [[keypads]], which can be used to view and manipulate the status of other specific blocks attached to the structure. To be functionally connected however, and to transport materials, blocks called \"conveyors\" must be used to connect the desired machines. \"Functional\" blocks require power, which can be provided by [[solar panels]] or [[nuclear reactors]] attached to the same structure. While reactors must be supplied with [[uranium]], and produce large amounts of power while active, solar panels will continually produce a low output of power when there is line-of-sight to the sun. Once being produced, power is automatically distributed throughout the entire structure and can also be stored in [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]].\n\nThree types of structures are available: small ships, large ships, and stations. The player can toggle between placing small and large block sizes; placing a small variant of a block will create a small ship, while placing a large variant will create a large ship. If a large block is placed in such a way that it intersects terrain [[voxels]] (such as an asteroid or planetary surface), a station is created instead. Stations use the same blocks as large ships, and can be converted into large ships by disconnecting them from the terrain (though a world setting can be changed to permit unanchored stations).\n\nThe size, resource requirements, and availability of blocks depends on the type of structure they are attached to. Small ships do not allow \"large\" blocks such as assemblers or refineries, whereas large ships and stations cannot use gatling guns, instead using AI-controlled gatling or missile turrets. Blocks attached to a small ship are considerably smaller and require fewer resources than those attached to large ships or stations (for example, light armor requires 25 steel plates on a station, but only one on a small ship).\n\nShips can be deliberately moved and rotated by a player as long as they are powered and have at least one [[gyroscope]], [[rocket engine|thruster]], and [[cockpit]]. To be able to move in any direction and then be able to stop effectively via inertia dampeners, thrusters must be placed on the structure facing up, down, forward, backward, left, and right. More gyroscopes on a ship will increase the ships ability to rotate in space, but in order for the inertial dampeners to be more effective, more thrusters must be added in each direction in which dampening is required.\n\nAstronauts floating in space are able to move forward, backward, upwards, downwards, left, or right without restriction by using a [[jetpack]]. They are also able to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. Astronauts and structures can also enable or disable [[inertia negation|inertial dampeners]], which automatically attempt to reduce speed to zero when force is not being applied, and the required thrusters are installed.\n\nIf the player disables their jetpack within a gravitational field (either on the surface of a planet or a structure/asteroid with a gravity generator), movement is restricted to a plane perpendicular to the direction of the net gravity field(s). Vertical viewing angle is also restricted between \u221290 and 90 degrees, as in most [[first-person shooter]]s. Ships and structures are unaffected by gravity generators unless equipped with at least one Artificial Mass block. If the player falls off a structure while within a gravity field, they will fall into space until out of range of the gravity generator, at which point the player's jetpack will automatically enable itself. However, if the player touches their feet to an asteroid or structure with no gravity present, their \"mag-boots\" will enable them to walk across its surface and even around edges; though jumping will disconnect the player from the surface, and they cannot traverse the 90-degree angle between a floor and wall.\n\nSeveral types of cargo ships can spawn randomly and fly through the world, which can be hijacked by the player or harvested for components. Some of these cargo ships are [[booby trap|booby trapped]] to explode when the player attempts to commandeer them, and are sometimes armed with hostile gatling or missile turrets.\n\nAll place-able objects can be colored prior to placement using a slider-based GUI. The player can manipulate the hue, saturation, and value of the color to produce a very large spectrum of colors. There are 14 slots where new colors can be saved for later use within the same world. Colors can also be changed after blocks have been placed by clicking the middle mouse button while hovering over a block on the \"Color Picker\" GUI.\n\nAsteroids and planets are currently fixed in space and cannot move, however rocks/minerals that have been mined are subject to gravity and will react accordingly. Asteroids also do not currently have gravity associated with them, and can come in several basic forms including spherical, torus, and rod-shapes, as well other variations or combinations of these.\n\n===Creative mode===\nIn creative mode, players are able to spawn unlimited resources, can instantly build tools and blocks, and are invincible.<ref name=\"Features\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/features.html|title=Features|work=Space Engineers}}</ref> Some building tools, such as symmetry mode and copying and pasting of ships, are only available in this mode. Players are also able to build and manipulate asteroids or planets using a tool known as \"Voxel Hands\". Although resources are available for collection and refinement, they are not required to create new ships or stations. Creative mode was initially the only mode available in the game. This mode eliminates the survival aspect of the game, allowing players to implement ideas quicker and easier.\n\n===Survival mode===\nIn survival mode, players need to mine, collect, and refine various [[chemical elements]] from asteroids and planets in order to craft tools, weapons, and blocks as well as produce electricity. Resources can be mined manually using a hand drill, or by using ships with the necessary equipment. Components are produced by assembling them from raw materials; however, they can also be harvested by [[Marine salvage|salvaging]] cargo ships. To avoid death, players must monitor their health, energy and oxygen levels. Damage can be inflicted on the player by collisions, weapons, contact with thrusters, meteor showers, or by running out of [[space suit]] energy. Collisions at higher speeds result in more damage. As the acceleration value of gravity generators stacks, damage from falling can be much more dangerous when multiple gravity generators are active. A player's health and energy can be restored using a Medical Room block, and energy can also be replenished by sitting in the cockpit of any powered structure. The development of survival mode began at the end of summer of 2013.<ref name=\"Dev Update 13\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.marekrosa.org/2014/03/space-engineers-survival-mode-update_13.html|title=Marek Rosa - dev blog|author=Marek Rosa|publisher=marekrosa.org}}</ref>\n\n===Materials and items===\nIn the survival mode of the game, all actions, including survival itself due to the power requirements of the space-suit's life-support system, depend on the gathering and refining of certain minerals. These minerals can be found on asteroids or planets, plundered from randomly spawned ships, or recovered from [[#Unknown signals|unknown signals]]. Raw materials are mined from deposits of ore on asteroids, and are then placed (or sent using a conveyor system) into a refinery or an arc furnace in order to refine them to be used in assemblers. The refined materials are formed into various components in the assembler which can then be used in the construction of ships or stations.\n\n===Inventories and storage===\nInventories in ''Space Engineers'' are very flexible and work in a whole-ship manner rather than in an individual one. All inventories connected to a ship can be viewed from any access panel on the same ship, however inventories must be connected via conveyors and conveyor tubes in order for items to be transferred among them. Inventories of refineries and arc furnaces will automatically request items to refine from connected inventories when they get low, and will send items into an available inventory when it fills up. The conveyor sorter allows inventories to be automatically removed and sorted from and into certain inventories. Instead of a common slot system, ''Space Engineers'' uses a volumetric system, measured in [[litres]], with every item having a certain amount of volume and every inventory a certain capacity that it cannot exceed.\n\n===Planets===\nPlanets in ''Space Engineers'' were released on November 12, 2015, after being in development since February 2015. There are several types of planets, themed after [[Earth]], [[the Moon]], [[Mars]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and an \"alien\" planet.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/features.html|title = Space Engineers|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Keen Software House|last = |first = }}</ref> All of these feature procedurally generated pirate bases, which spawn hostile spacecraft.

Resources are spread out, and due to planetary gravity and the inefficiency of ion engines within the atmosphere, the player must build ground-based alternatives.\n\nAtmospheric flight is possible even on worlds with oxygen-deprived atmospheres. In order to leave a planet, the player will need to use hydrogen engines with sufficient fuel or build a hybrid spacecraft with atmospheric engines (for liftoff) and ion engines (upper atmosphere to space).\n\nHybrid surface-to-orbit craft are considerably heavier than their space-only counterparts, but can be built compact enough to fit inside a standard hangar.\n\n===Unknown signals===\nOn August 17, 2017, \"unknown signals\" were added to survival mode. These signals spawn randomly within a certain range of the player, and indicate the position of a small probe via a GPS coordinate and a repeating tone. Each probe contains components and can be disassembled, effectively preventing the player from encountering a [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]]. {{Explain|date=October 2019}}\n\nEach probe also possesses a button, which when pressed has a chance to reward the player with a collectible skin, similar to a [[Loot box| loot box]]. The skin can be for the player character's helmet, suit, boots, or tools, and can be traded or sold on the [[Steam (software)|Steam Market]].
