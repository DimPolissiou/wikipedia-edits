The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link]. Specifically the Order of Battle after the 1986 reform was used, which was then corrected and expanded with the Italian Army's website information.\n\n== Graphic of the Italian Army in 1989 ==\n\n[[File:Italy Army - 1989.png|thumb|center|1200px|Structure of the Italian Army in 1989 (click image to enlarge)]]\n\n== Army General Staff ==\nThe Army General Staff in Rome oversaw all Italian Army units.

publication of the Italian Army's order of battle by the Institute for Disarmament, Development and Peace (Istituto di ricerche per il disarmo, lo sviluppo e la pace (IRDISP) in [[Rome]] (a think thank of the [[Radical Party (Italy)|Radical Party]]). The published order of battle, down to company level, can be found at the Radical's Radio's website ([https://web.archive.org/web/20171201031533/http://www.radioradicale.it/exagora/lesercito-italiano-3-quello-che-i-russi-gia-sanno-e-gli-italiani-non-devono-sapere Link]). The structure was then adapted with information from the Italian Army's website and its units' histories listed there. Additionally the following website was used, which lists every Order of Battle for Italy's armies from 1553 to 1997, [http://xoomer.virgilio.it/ramius//Militaria/L'ESERCITO_DAL_1553_AL_1996.html Link].

The prominent event in his life was [[Austria-Hungary]]'s entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its [[Austria-Hungary|real union]] with Austria. Tisza supported the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and was representative of the then ''liberal-conservative consent''.\n[[File:Istvan Tisza. Oxford, United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in Oxford, England]]\n[[File:Tisza Istv\u00e1n 1904.jpg|thumb|right|The 33-year-old Tisza as a member of the parliament in 1894]]\n[[File:Tisza with his family.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza and his family. [[Geszt]], Hungary around 1895]]\n[[File:Anti-semitic mockery about Istvan Tisza.jpg|thumb|anti-semitic mockery about Istv\u00e1n Tisza]]\nHe had been a Member of Parliament since 1887 and had had abundant opportunities to see how the unyielding temper of the Emperor on the one hand, and the revolutionary spirit of the extremists on the other, were leading to a complete impasse. He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nIn the diplomacy, Tisza's role model was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\nHe was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (eg the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies, but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as Prime minister.\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically:  the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv\u00e9d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30\u201333)</ref>) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the House of Parliament, staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). Tisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants  - manipulated by primitive demagogues - would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and and called for universal suffrage. Socialist organised a rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage. On the next day, the protesters and workers marched toward the Parliament building, who were arrested by the police, six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested. This event became known as \"Blood Red Thursday\" in the contemporary press and later in the history books.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

The prominent event in his life was [[Austria-Hungary]]'s entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its [[Austria-Hungary|real union]] with Austria. Tisza supported the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and was representative of the then ''liberal-conservative consent''.\n[[File:Istvan Tisza.

He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nIn the diplomacy, Tisza's role model was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\nHe was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (eg the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies, but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as Prime minister.\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically:  the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv\u00e9d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30\u201333)</ref>) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the House of Parliament, staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and organised a rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage.\n\nTisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants  - manipulated by primitive demagogues - would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The answer was a demonstration organized by socialists on Thursday, May 23, 1912. Workers marched toward the Parliament, who were arrested by the police, against the appointment of Tisza and demanding universal suffrage. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

He graduated from [[Lowell High School (Massachusetts)|Lowell High School]] in 1961, and earned a bachelor's degree in English from [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]], in 1965. Following a year of graduate study at [[Pennsylvania State University]], he did research for his master's thesis in [[Washington, D.C.]], then entered U. S. Navy [[Officer Candidate School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. He attended the [[Defense Information School]] in the spring of 1968 and received his master's degree in journalism in 1969 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34}} during the first of two combat deployments he made to [[Yankee Station]] in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], off the coast of Vietnam.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\">Chauncey Mabe, \"The Book On Books: Nicholas Basbanes Brings a Journalist's Training and Sensibility to Writing About, well, Writing, and Books,\" ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'' (Fort Lauderdale, FL), March 14, 2004.\n[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-03-14/entertainment/0403101234_1_stephen-blumberg-nicholas-basbanes-books]</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\n\nDischarged from active duty in 1971, Basbanes went to work as a general assignment reporter for ''The Evening Gazette'' in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], specializing in investigative journalism. In 1978, he was appointed books editor of a sister publication, the Worcester ''Sunday Telegram'', a full-time position that included writing a weekly column for which he would interview more than a thousand authors over the next twenty-one years.\n\nWhen Basbanes left the newspaper (by then known as the ''[[Telegram & Gazette]]'') in 1991 to complete his first book, he continued writing the column and distributed it through Literary Features Syndicate, an agency that he formed that placed it in more than thirty publications nationwide. Two selections of his literary journalism were collected in ''Editions & Impressions'' (2007) and ''About the Author'' (2010).<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\"/>\n\n== Writing ==\n\nBasbanes' first book, ''[[A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books]]'', was published in 1995. It has since appeared in eight hardcover editions and more than twenty paperback printings, surprising figures for a work of nonfiction whose topic was dismissed as too arcane for a general readership by many New York editors who had passed on the opportunity to publish it.<ref>William A. Davis, \"Bible for Bibliophiles: Basbanes' 'A Gentle Madness' Confounds the Naysayers, \" ''Boston Globe'', June 26, 1996, reprinted ''Bates Magazine'', Spring 1997.

Of the many people profiled in ''A Gentle Madness'', none has created more interest than [[Stephen Blumberg]], arguably the most accomplished book thief of the twentieth century, and to this day a subject of fascination for the bizarre methods he used to steal volumes from more than three hundred libraries in North America.<ref name=\"MichaelDirda\" />\n\n''A Gentle Madness'' was named a ''New York Times'' notable book of the year,<ref>\"Notable Books of the year 1995,\"''New York Times,''December 3, 1995.</ref> and was a finalist for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in nonfiction for1995.<ref>[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/#1995%20Awards NBCC Finalists]</ref> In 2010, the ''Wall Street Journal'' named it one of the most influential works about book collecting published in the twentieth century.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703843804575533971996423764 ''Wall Street Journal'', October 9, 2010]</ref> In 2012, an updated paperback edition and a new electronic version of the book were published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.finebooksmagazine.com/a-gentle-madness---a-new-edition.aspx |title=A Gentle Madness - A New Edition! |publisher=Store.finebooksmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n\nBy 2003, with the publication of ''A Splendor of Letters'', Basbanes was already acknowledged as a leading authority on books and book culture.

He graduated from [[Lowell High School (Massachusetts)|Lowell High School]] in 1961, and earned a bachelor's degree in English from [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]], in 1965. Following a year of graduate study at [[Pennsylvania State University]], he did research for his master's thesis in [[Washington, D.C.]], then entered U. S. Navy [[Officer Candidate School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. He attended the [[Defense Information School]] in the spring of 1968 and received his master's degree in journalism in 1969 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34}} during the first of two combat deployments he made to [[Yankee Station]] in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], off the coast of Vietnam.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\">Chauncey Mabe, \"The Book On Books: Nicholas Basbanes Brings a Journalist's Training and Sensibility to Writing About, well, Writing, and Books,\" ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'' (Fort Lauderdale, FL), March 14, 2004.\n[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-03-14/entertainment/0403101234_1_stephen-blumberg-nicholas-basbanes-books]</ref>\n\n== Early career ==\n\nDischarged from active duty in 1971, Basbanes went to work as a general assignment reporter for ''The Evening Gazette'' in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], specializing in investigative journalism. In 1978, he was appointed books editor of a sister publication, the Worcester ''Sunday Telegram'', a full-time position that included writing a weekly column for which he would interview more than a thousand authors over the next twenty-one years.\n\nWhen Basbanes left the newspaper (by then known as the ''[[Telegram & Gazette]]'') in 1991 to complete his first book, he continued writing the column and distributed it through Literary Features Syndicate, an agency that he formed that placed it in more than thirty publications nationwide. Two selections of his literary journalism were collected in ''Editions & Impressions'' (2007) and ''About the Author'' (2010).<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\"/>\n\n== Writing ==\n\nBasbanes' first book, ''[[A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books]]'', was published in 1995. It has since appeared in eight hardcover editions and more than twenty paperback printings, surprising figures for a work of nonfiction whose topic was dismissed as too arcane for a general readership by many New York editors who had passed on the opportunity to publish it.<ref>William A.

Of the many people profiled in ''A Gentle Madness'', none has created more interest than [[Stephen Blumberg]], arguably the most accomplished book thief of the twentieth century, and to this day a subject of fascination for the bizarre methods he used to steal volumes from more than three hundred libraries in North America.<ref name=\"MichaelDirda\" />\n\n''A Gentle Madness'' was named a ''New York Times'' notable book of the year,<ref>\"Notable Books of the year 1995,\"''New York Times,''December 3, 1995.</ref> and was a finalist for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in nonfiction for1995.<ref>[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/#1995%20Awards NBCC Finalists]</ref> In 2010, the ''Wall Street Journal'' named it one of the most influential works about book collecting published in the twentieth century.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703843804575533971996423764 ''Wall Street Journal'', October 9, 2010]</ref> In 2012, an updated paperback edition and a new electronic version of the book were published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://store.finebooksmagazine.com/a-gentle-madness---a-new-edition.aspx |title=A Gentle Madness - A New Edition! |publisher=Store.finebooksmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n\nBy 2003, with the publication of ''A Splendor of Letters'', Basbanes was already acknowledged as a leading authority on books and book culture.

It was named in honor of [[Zebulon Pike]], leader of the [[Pike expedition]] in 1806 to map out the south and west portions of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Pike served at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], and was killed in 1813 in the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPrior to the coming of the first European settler to the future Pike County, French traders, hunters, and travelers passed through the native forests and prairies. Originally Pike County began on the south junction of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. The east boundary was the [[Illinois River]] north to the [[Kankakee River]] to the Indiana State line on north to Wisconsin territorial line and then west to the [[Mississippi River]] to the original point at the south end. The first county seat was Cole's Grove, a post town, in what later became [[Calhoun County, Illinois|Calhoun County]]. ''The Gazetteer of Illinois and Missouri'', published in 1822, mentioned [[Chicago]] as \"a village of Pike County\" containing 12 or 15 houses and about 60 or 70 inhabitants.\n\nThe [[New Philadelphia Town Site]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2009.  Founded by [[Free Frank McWorter|Frank McWorter]], an early [[free Negro|free black]] settler in Pike County, it was the first town founded by a black man in the United States.  McWorter had invested in land there sight unseen after purchasing the first few members of his family out of slavery.  In 1836 he founded the town of [[New Philadelphia, Illinois|New Philadelphia]], near [[Barry, Illinois|Barry]]. He was elected mayor and lived there the rest of his life. With the sale of land, he made enough money to purchase the freedom of his children. After the [[railroad]] bypassed the town, its growth slowed and it was eventually abandoned in the 20th century. The town site is now an [[archaeological site]].\n\nIn the early 21st century, Pike County acquired notability as a [[whitetail deer]] hunting center, especially for [[bowhunting]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Pike County Illinois 1821.png|Pike County from the time of its creation to 1823\nFile:Pike County Illinois 1823.png|Pike County between 1823 and 1825, including unorganized territory temporarily attached to it<ref>White, Jesse.

It was named in honor of [[Zebulon Pike]], leader of the [[Pike expedition]] in 1806 to map out the south and west portions of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. Pike served at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]], and was killed in 1813 in the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPrior to the coming of the first European settler to the future Pike County, French traders, hunters, and travelers passed through the native forests and prairies. Originally Pike County began on the south junction of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers. The east boundary was the [[Illinois River]] north to the [[Kankakee River]] to the Indiana State line on north to Wisconsin territorial line and then west to the [[Mississippi River]] to the original point at the south end. The first county seat was Cole's Grove, a post town, in what later became [[Calhoun County, Illinois|Calhoun County]]. ''The Gazetteer of Illinois and Missouri'', published in 1822, mentioned [[Chicago]] as \"a village of Pike County\" containing 12 or 15 houses and about 60 or 70 inhabitants.\n\nThe [[New Philadelphia Town Site]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2005 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2009.  Founded by [[Free Frank McWorter|Frank McWorter]], an early [[free Negro|free black]] settler in Pike County, it was the first town founded by a black man in the United States.  McWorter had invested in land there sight unseen after purchasing the first few members of his family out of slavery.  In 1836 he founded the town of [[New Philadelphia, Illinois|New Philadelphia]], near [[Barry, Illinois|Barry]]. He was elected mayor and lived there the rest of his life. With the sale of land, he made enough money to purchase the freedom of his children. After the [[railroad]] bypassed the town, its growth slowed and it was eventually abandoned in the 20th century. The town site is now an [[archaeological site]].\n\nIn the early 21st century, Pike County acquired notability as a [[whitetail deer]] hunting center, especially for [[bowhunting]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Pike County Illinois 1821.png|Pike County from the time of its creation to 1823\nFile:Pike County Illinois 1823.png|Pike County between 1823 and 1825, including unorganized territory temporarily attached to it<ref>White, Jesse.

In [[English language|English]], its first recorded use (in the sense of the entirety of the phenomena of the world) was in 1266. \"Natura\" and the personification of Mother Nature were widely popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. As a concept, seated between the properly divine and the human, it can be traced to [[Ancient Greece]], though [[Earth]] (or \"''Eorthe''\" in the Old English period) may have been personified as a goddess. The Norse also had a goddess called [[Jord]] (or ''Erth'').\n\nThe earliest written usage is in [[Mycenaean Greek]]: ''Ma-ka'' (transliterated as ''ma-ga''), \"Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script (13th or 12th century BC).<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=346416 ''Palaeolexicon;  Word Study Tool of Ancient Languages''];</ref> In Greece, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophers had \"invented\" nature when they abstracted the entirety of phenomena of the world as singular: ''physis'', and this was inherited by [[Aristotle]]. Later medieval Christian thinkers did not see nature as inclusive of everything, but thought that she had been created by [[God]]; her place lay on earth, below the unchanging [[heaven]]s and [[moon]].  Nature lay somewhere in the center, with agents above her ([[angel]]s), and below her ([[demons]] and [[hell]]). For the medieval mind she was only a personification, not a goddess.\n\n===Greek myth===\n[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Aion (deity)|Aion]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and four children]]\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], [[Persephone]], daughter of [[Demeter]] (goddess of the harvest), was abducted by [[Hades]] (god of the dead), and taken to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] as his queen. Demeter was so distraught that no crops would grow and the \"entire human race [would] have perished of cruel, biting hunger if [[Zeus]] had not been concerned\" (Larousse 152). Zeus forced Hades to return Persephone to her mother, but while in the underworld, Persephone had eaten [[pomegranate]] seeds, the food of the dead and thus, she must spend part of each year with Hades in the underworld. Demeter's grief for her daughter in the realm of the dead, is reflected in the barren winter months and her joy when Persephone returns is reflected in the bountiful summer months.\n\n{{quotation|Demeter would take the place of her grandmother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], and her mother, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], as goddess of the earth in a time when humans and gods thought the activities of the heavens more sacred than those of earth.<ref>{{cite book | first=David Adams |last=Leeming |year=2010 |title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia |volume=1 |edition=2 (revised, illustrated) |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-174-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&lpg=PA118&pg=PA118 |page=118}}</ref>|Leeming|Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia}}\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n\nRoman [[Epicurean]] poet [[Lucretius]] opens his didactic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' by addressing [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] as a veritable mother of nature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leonard|first1=William Ellery|title=Proem {{endash}} Lucr. 1.1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0131|website=[[Perseus Project]]|publisher=[[Tufts University]]|date=1916}}</ref> Lucretius uses Venus as \"a personified symbol for the generative aspect of nature\".<ref name=venusjournal/> This largely has to do with the nature of Lucretius' work, which presents a nontheistic understanding of the world that eschews superstition.<ref name=venusjournal>{{Cite journal| issn = 0009-8353| volume = 84| issue = 2| pages = 97\u2013104| last = Catto| first = Bonnie A.| title = Venus and Natura in Lucretius: \"De Rerum Natura\" 1.1-23 and 2.167-74| journal = The Classical Journal| date = 1988| jstor = 3297566}}</ref>\n\n==Indigenous peoples of America==\n[[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] legend says that \"beneath the clouds lives the Earth-Mother from whom is derived the Water of Life, who at her bosom feeds plants, animals and human\" (Larousse 428).

In [[English language|English]], its first recorded use (in the sense of the entirety of the phenomena of the world) was in 1266. \"Natura\" and the personification of Mother Nature were widely popular in the [[Middle Ages]]. As a concept, seated between the properly divine and the human, it can be traced to [[Ancient Greece]], though [[Earth]] (or \"''Eorthe''\" in the Old English period) may have been personified as a goddess. The Norse also had a goddess called [[Jord]] (or ''Erth'').\n\nThe earliest written usage is in [[Mycenaean Greek]]: ''Ma-ka'' (transliterated as ''ma-ga''), \"Mother [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]\", written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script (13th or 12th century BC).<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=346416 ''Palaeolexicon;  Word Study Tool of Ancient Languages''];</ref> In Greece, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophers had \"invented\" nature when they abstracted the entirety of phenomena of the world as singular: ''physis'', and this was inherited by [[Aristotle]]. Later medieval Christian thinkers did not see nature as inclusive of everything, but thought that she had been created by [[God]]; her place lay on earth, below the unchanging [[heaven]]s and [[moon]].  Nature lay somewhere in the center, with agents above her ([[angel]]s), and below her ([[demons]] and [[hell]]). For the medieval mind she was only a personification, not a goddess.\n\n===Greek myth===\n[[File:Aion mosaic Glyptothek Munich W504.jpg|thumb|200 px|[[Aion (deity)|Aion]], [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and four children]]\n\nIn [[Greek mythology]], [[Persephone]], daughter of [[Demeter]] (goddess of the harvest), was abducted by [[Hades]] (god of the dead), and taken to the [[Greek underworld|underworld]] as his queen. Demeter was so distraught that no crops would grow and the \"entire human race [would] have perished of cruel, biting hunger if [[Zeus]] had not been concerned\" (Larousse 152). Zeus forced Hades to return Persephone to her mother, but while in the underworld, Persephone had eaten [[pomegranate]] seeds, the food of the dead and thus, she must spend part of each year with Hades in the underworld. Demeter's grief for her daughter in the realm of the dead, is reflected in the barren winter months and her joy when Persephone returns is reflected in the bountiful summer months.\n\n{{quotation|Demeter would take the place of her grandmother, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], and her mother, [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], as goddess of the earth in a time when humans and gods thought the activities of the heavens more sacred than those of earth.<ref>{{cite book | first=David Adams |last=Leeming |year=2010 |title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia |volume=1 |edition=2 (revised, illustrated) |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-174-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&lpg=PA118&pg=PA118 |page=118}}</ref>|Leeming|Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia}}\n\n===Ancient Rome===\n\nRoman [[Epicurean]] poet [[Lucretius]] opens his didactic poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' by addressing [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] as a veritable mother of nature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leonard|first1=William Ellery|title=Proem {{endash}} Lucr. 1.1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0131|website=[[Perseus Project]]|publisher=[[Tufts University]]|date=1916}}</ref> Lucretius uses Venus as \"a personified symbol for the generative aspect of nature\".<ref name=venusjournal/> This largely has to do with the nature of Lucretius' work, which presents a nontheistic understanding of the world that eschews superstition.<ref name=venusjournal>{{Cite journal| issn = 0009-8353| volume = 84| issue = 2| pages = 97\u2013104| last = Catto| first = Bonnie A.| title = Venus and Natura in Lucretius: \"De Rerum Natura\" 1.1-23 and 2.167-74| journal = The Classical Journal| date = 1988| jstor = 3297566}}</ref>\n\n==Indigenous peoples of America==\n[[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] legend says that \"beneath the clouds lives the Earth-Mother from whom is derived the Water of Life, who at her bosom feeds plants, animals and human\" (Larousse 428).
