With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most significant American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant impact on popular music.  \n\nHe is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he wrote several musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'' and ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused around characters and drama rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the genre was known for beforehand. \n\nRodgers was the first person to win what is considered the top American entertainment awards in television, recording, movies, and Broadway \u2013 an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award]] \u2014 now known collectively as an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]. In addition, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]], making him one of only two people to receive all five awards ([[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the other). \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBorn into a prosperous German Jewish family in [[Arverne, Queens]], New York City, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky. Richard began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam ([[Waterford, Maine]]) where he composed some of his first songs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Hyland, William G: ''Richard Rodgers''] ''The New York Times'', Chapter 1. Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}</ref>\n\nRodgers, [[Lorenz Hart]], and later collaborator [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] all attended [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the [[Juilliard School]]).<ref>Richard Rodgers, ''Musical Stages: An Autobiography'' (2002 Reissue),  pp. 12,20\u201321,44, DaCapo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81134-0}}</ref> Rodgers was influenced by composers such as [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as by the [[operetta]]s his parents took him to see on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he was a child.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Rodgers and Hart====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hart}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rodgers (seated) with [[Lorenz Hart]] in 1936.]]\nIn 1919, Richard met [[Lorenz Hart]], thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. [[Rodgers and Hart]] struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song \"Any Old Place With You\", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy ''A Lonely Romeo''. Their first professional production was the 1920 ''[[Poor Little Ritz Girl]]'', which also had music by [[Sigmund Romberg]]. Their next professional show, ''The Melody Man'', did not premiere until 1924.\n\nWhen he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for [[Lew Fields]]. Among the stars he accompanied were [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Fred Allen]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VVpeiKxbHk Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?], Feb 19, 1956, video on YouTube</ref> Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]], called ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit \u2014 the song that Rodgers believed \"made\" Rodgers and Hart \u2014 was \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]\". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including ''[[Dearest Enemy]]'' (1925), ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' (1926), ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' (1926), ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'' (1927), and ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]'' (1928).  Their 1920s shows produced standards such as \"[[Here in My Arms]]\", \"[[Mountain Greenery]]\", \"[[Blue Room (1926 song)|Blue Room]]\", \"[[My Heart Stood Still]]\" and \"[[You Took Advantage of Me]]\".\n\nWith the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932) (directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who would later direct Rodgers's ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' on Broadway), which introduced three standards: \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which either were cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, \"[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]\". Other film work includes the scores to ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), starring [[George M. Cohan]], ''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum'' (1933), starring [[Al Jolson]], and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, ''Mississippi'' (1935), starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[W. C. Fields]].\n\nIn 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended only with Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'' (1935), ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, which included the ballet \"[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]\", choreographed by George Balanchine), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940), and their last original work, ''[[By Jupiter]]'' (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.\n\nMany of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1935 song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\", \"[[My Romance (song)|My Romance]]\", \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", \"[[I'll Tell the Man in the Street]]\", \"[[There's a Small Hotel]]\", \"[[Where or When]]\", \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\", \"[[Falling in Love with Love]]\", \"[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\", and \"[[Wait till You See Her]]\".\n\nIn 1939, he wrote the ballet ''Ghost Town'' for the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], with choreography by [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platoff]].<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D9173CF930A15753C1A9649C8B63 \"DANCE REVIEW; Rodgers As Ideal Dance Partner\"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 2002.</ref>\n\n====Rodgers and Hammerstein====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hammerstein}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein at piano-original.jpg|thumb|Rodgers (seated) with Hammerstein, 1945]]\nRodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health. Rodgers began working with [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), marked the beginning of the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their work revolutionized the musical form. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated piece.\n\nThe team went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history. Each was made into a successful film: ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949, winner of the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Other shows include the minor hit ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' (1958), as well as relative failures ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' (1947), ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953), and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'' (1955). They also wrote the score to the film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'' (1945) (which was remade in 1962 with [[Pat Boone]]) and a special TV musical of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957).\n\nTheir collaboration produced many well-known songs, including \"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]\", \"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\", \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" (which also became the state song of Oklahoma), \"It's A Grand Night For Singing\", \"[[If I Loved You]]\", \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\", \"[[It Might as Well Be Spring]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", \"[[Bali Hai]]\", \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\", \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\", \"[[The Sound of Music (song)|The Sound of Music]]\", \"[[Sixteen Going on Seventeen]]\", \"[[Climb Ev'ry Mountain]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]\", Hammerstein's last song.\n[[File:Richard Rodgers Ed Sullivan 1952.JPG|thumb|Rodgers was the subject of a two-part special on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''Toast of the Town'' television show in 1952.]]\nMuch of Rodgers' work with both Hart and Hammerstein was orchestrated by [[Robert Russell Bennett]]. Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode [[World War II]] television documentary ''[[Victory at Sea]]'' (1952\u201353). This [[NBC]] production pioneered the \"compilation documentary\"\u2014programming based on pre-existing footage \u2014 and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song \"[[No Other Love (1953 song)|No Other Love]]\"was later taken from the ''Victory at Sea'' theme entitled \"Beneath the Southern Cross\".  Rodgers won an [[Emmy]] for the music for the ABC documentary ''[[The Valiant Years|Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years]]'', scored by [[Eddie Sauter]], [[Hershy Kay]], and [[Robert Emmett Dolan]]. Rodgers composed the theme music, \"[[March of the Clowns]]\", for the 1963\u201364 television series ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main-title theme for the 1963\u201364 historical anthology television series [[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|''The Great Adventure'']].\n\nIn 1950, [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" Rodgers, Hammerstein, and [[Joshua Logan]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''South Pacific''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama \"Drama\"].

The show was a minor hit and featured the song, \"[[The Sweetest Sounds (song)|The Sweetest Sounds]]\".\n\nRodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]. (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)\n\nRodgers went on to work with lyricists: [[Stephen Sondheim]] (''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'') who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hammerstein, [[Martin Charnin]] (''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]],'' ''[[I Remember Mama (musical)|I Remember Mama]]'') and [[Sheldon Harnick]] (''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'').\n\nAt its 1978 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].\n\nRodgers was an honoree at the first [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978.\n\nAt the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony\u2014six months before his death\u2014Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.\n\n====Death and legacy====\nRodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a [[laryngectomy]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nIn 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!''. The [[BBC Proms]] that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of ''Oklahoma!'' The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] released a new CD that year in tribute to Rodgers, entitled ''My Favorite Things: A Richard Rodgers Celebration''.\n\n[[Alec Wilder]] wrote the following about Rodgers:\n\n{{quote|Of all the writers whose songs are considered and examined in this book, those of Rodgers show the highest degree of consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication ...

With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most significant American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant impact on popular music.  \n\nHe is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he wrote several musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'' and ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused around characters and drama rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the genre was known for beforehand. \n\nRodgers was the first person to win what is considered the top American entertainment awards in television, recording, movies, and Broadway \u2013 an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award]] \u2014 now known collectively as an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]. In addition, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]], making him one of only two people to receive all five awards ([[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the other). \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBorn into a prosperous German Jewish family in [[Arverne, Queens]], New York City, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky. Richard began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam ([[Waterford, Maine]]) where he composed some of his first songs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Hyland, William G: ''Richard Rodgers''] ''The New York Times'', Chapter 1. Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}</ref>\n\nRodgers, [[Lorenz Hart]], and later collaborator [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] all attended [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the [[Juilliard School]]).<ref>Richard Rodgers, ''Musical Stages: An Autobiography'' (2002 Reissue),  pp. 12,20\u201321,44, DaCapo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81134-0}}</ref> Rodgers was influenced by composers such as [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as by the [[operetta]]s his parents took him to see on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he was a child.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Rodgers and Hart====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hart}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rodgers (seated) with [[Lorenz Hart]] in 1936.]]\nIn 1919, Richard met [[Lorenz Hart]], thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. [[Rodgers and Hart]] struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song \"Any Old Place With You\", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy ''A Lonely Romeo''. Their first professional production was the 1920 ''[[Poor Little Ritz Girl]]'', which also had music by [[Sigmund Romberg]]. Their next professional show, ''The Melody Man'', did not premiere until 1924.\n\nWhen he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for [[Lew Fields]]. Among the stars he accompanied were [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Fred Allen]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VVpeiKxbHk Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?], Feb 19, 1956, video on YouTube</ref> Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]], called ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit \u2014 the song that Rodgers believed \"made\" Rodgers and Hart \u2014 was \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]\". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including ''[[Dearest Enemy]]'' (1925), ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' (1926), ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' (1926), ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'' (1927), and ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]'' (1928).  Their 1920s shows produced standards such as \"[[Here in My Arms]]\", \"[[Mountain Greenery]]\", \"[[Blue Room (1926 song)|Blue Room]]\", \"[[My Heart Stood Still]]\" and \"[[You Took Advantage of Me]]\".\n\nWith the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932) (directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who would later direct Rodgers's ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' on Broadway), which introduced three standards: \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which either were cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, \"[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]\". Other film work includes the scores to ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), starring [[George M. Cohan]], ''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum'' (1933), starring [[Al Jolson]], and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, ''Mississippi'' (1935), starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[W. C. Fields]].\n\nIn 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended only with Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'' (1935), ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, which included the ballet \"[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]\", choreographed by George Balanchine), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940), and their last original work, ''[[By Jupiter]]'' (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.\n\nMany of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1935 song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\", \"[[My Romance (song)|My Romance]]\", \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", \"[[I'll Tell the Man in the Street]]\", \"[[There's a Small Hotel]]\", \"[[Where or When]]\", \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\", \"[[Falling in Love with Love]]\", \"[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\", and \"[[Wait till You See Her]]\".\n\nIn 1939, he wrote the ballet ''Ghost Town'' for the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], with choreography by [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platoff]].<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D9173CF930A15753C1A9649C8B63 \"DANCE REVIEW; Rodgers As Ideal Dance Partner\"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 2002.</ref>\n\n====Rodgers and Hammerstein====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hammerstein}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein at piano-original.jpg|thumb|Rodgers (seated) with Hammerstein, 1945]]\nRodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health. Rodgers began working with [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), marked the beginning of the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their work revolutionized the musical form. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated piece.\n\nThe team went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history. Each was made into a successful film: ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949, winner of the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Other shows include the minor hit ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' (1958), as well as relative failures ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' (1947), ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953), and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'' (1955). They also wrote the score to the film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'' (1945) (which was remade in 1962 with [[Pat Boone]]) and a special TV musical of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957).\n\nTheir collaboration produced many well-known songs, including \"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]\", \"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\", \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" (which also became the state song of Oklahoma), \"It's A Grand Night For Singing\", \"[[If I Loved You]]\", \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\", \"[[It Might as Well Be Spring]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", \"[[Bali Hai]]\", \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\", \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\", \"[[The Sound of Music (song)|The Sound of Music]]\", \"[[Sixteen Going on Seventeen]]\", \"[[Climb Ev'ry Mountain]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]\", Hammerstein's last song.\n[[File:Richard Rodgers Ed Sullivan 1952.JPG|thumb|Rodgers was the subject of a two-part special on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''Toast of the Town'' television show in 1952.]]\nMuch of Rodgers' work with both Hart and Hammerstein was orchestrated by [[Robert Russell Bennett]]. Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode [[World War II]] television documentary ''[[Victory at Sea]]'' (1952\u201353). This [[NBC]] production pioneered the \"compilation documentary\"\u2014programming based on pre-existing footage \u2014 and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song \"[[No Other Love (1953 song)|No Other Love]]\"was later taken from the ''Victory at Sea'' theme entitled \"Beneath the Southern Cross\".  Rodgers won an [[Emmy]] for the music for the ABC documentary ''[[The Valiant Years|Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years]]'', scored by [[Eddie Sauter]], [[Hershy Kay]], and [[Robert Emmett Dolan]]. Rodgers composed the theme music, \"[[March of the Clowns]]\", for the 1963\u201364 television series ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main-title theme for the 1963\u201364 historical anthology television series [[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|''The Great Adventure'']].\n\nIn 1950, [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" Rodgers, Hammerstein, and [[Joshua Logan]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''South Pacific''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama \"Drama\"].

Retrieved December 3, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Rodgers conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] in excerpts from ''Victory at Sea'', ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' and the ''[[Carousel Waltz]]'' for a special LP released by [[Columbia Records]].\n\n[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musicals earned a total of 37 [[Tony Award]]s, 15 [[Academy Awards]], two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n====After Hammerstein====\nAfter Hammerstein's death in 1960, Rodgers wrote both words and music for his first new Broadway project ''[[No Strings]]'' (1962, which earned two Tony Awards). The show was a minor hit and featured the song, \"[[The Sweetest Sounds (song)|The Sweetest Sounds]]\".\n\nRodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]. (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)\n\nRodgers went on to work with lyricists: [[Stephen Sondheim]] (''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'') who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hammerstein, [[Martin Charnin]] (''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]],'' ''[[I Remember Mama (musical)|I Remember Mama]]'') and [[Sheldon Harnick]] (''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'').\n\nAt its 1978 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].\n\nRodgers was an honoree at the first [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978.\n\nAt the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony\u2014six months before his death\u2014Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.\n\n====Death and legacy====\nRodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a [[laryngectomy]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nIn 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!''. The [[BBC Proms]] that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of ''Oklahoma!'' The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] released a new CD that year in tribute to Rodgers, entitled ''My Favorite Things: A Richard Rodgers Celebration''.\n\n[[Alec Wilder]] wrote the following about Rodgers:\n\n{{quote|Of all the writers whose songs are considered and examined in this book, those of Rodgers show the highest degree of consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication ...

The expedition's objective was to search for rock shelters and caves containing stratified archaeological infills capable of documenting the period when production economy appeared in this part of Somaliland (circa [[5th millennium BCE|5th]] and 2nd millennium BCE). During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel [[rock art]], encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves). In an excellent state of preservation, the paintings show human figures with their hands raised and facing long-horned, humpless [[cattle]].<ref name=\"African Archeology Volume 1 2003\">The Journal of African Archeology Volume 1.2 (2003) Chapter 3</ref>\n\nThe rock art had been known to the area's inhabitants for centuries before the French discovery.

In November 2003, a mission returned to Laas Geel and a team of experts undertook a detailed study of the paintings and their prehistoric context.\n\nSomaliland in general is home to numerous such [[archaeological site]]s, with similar rock art and/or ancient edifices such as the [[Dhambalin]] rock art.

Round the place is a patch of jowari [Sorghum] cultivation, two and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile broad. Quantities of livestock of all kinds graze on the low undulating hills for half a mile from the Aleyadera nala on either bank. Hargeisa is situated on two important caravan routes, one from Ogaden and the other from Harar. There are good direct camel-roads to Berbera and Bulhar. Supplies of rice, tobacco, and dates can sometimes be bought here in the trading season. Some four hundred people are employed looking after the jowari fields, and may be seen sitting on platforms, shouting and throwing stones to scare birds from the crops. There is abundance of good water in the bed of the river, and a masonry well has been built, and is kept in order by an Arab from Aden.

Near Hargeisa are the fertile Sheikh and [[Daallo Mountain|Daallo]] mountains, which receive large amounts of [[rain]]. South of the city is the [[Haud]] savannah ([[Baligubadle]]), which attracts many different species of wildlife to graze in the area.\n\nHargeisa is situated near the town of [[Gabiley]], which serves as an agricultural centre in Somaliland. That town's Allay-Baday area produces tons of tomatoes and onions each month during the rainy season. The town of [[Arabsiyo]] is also located nearby, and is noted for its lemon production.\n\nDue to its relative fertility and greenery, wild animals come to the Hargeisa area to either breed or graze on the grassland savannah.

During the course of the survey, the French archaeological team discovered the Laas Geel [[rock art]], encompassing an area of ten rock alcoves (caves).

The renovations have been largely financed by local entrepreneurs, as well as Somali expatriates sending [[remittance]] funds to relatives in the region through some of the various Somali-owned money transfer operators.<ref name=\"Usrs\">{{cite web|url=http://www.diaspora-centre.org/DOCS/UK_Somali_Remittan.pdf|title=UK Somali Remittances Survey|website=diaspora-centre.org|accessdate=30 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617224947/http://www.diaspora-centre.org/DOCS/UK_Somali_Remittan.pdf|archivedate=17 June 2017}}</ref> Most of the destroyed residential and commercial buildings have since been reconstructed, with many newer structures erected. Single-story buildings downtown are also progressively giving way to multi-story [[Tower block|high-rises]].\n\n==Geography==\n===Location and habitat===\n\nHargeisa is located in a mountainous area, in an enclosed valley of the northwestern [[Ogo Mountains|Galgodon]] (Ogo) [[highland]]s. It sits at an elevation of {{convert|1,334|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above [[sea level]].\n[[File:Calaamadaha area o galleryfull.jpg|thumb|right|Hargeisa city]]\nThe city used to be surrounded by forest when it was smaller in size, but the countryside around it still has small [[juniper]]s. Near Hargeisa are the fertile Sheikh and [[Daallo Mountain|Daallo]] mountains, which receive large amounts of [[rain]]. South of the city is the [[Haud]] savannah ([[Baligubadle]]), which attracts many different species of wildlife to graze in the area.\n\nHargeisa is situated near the town of [[Gabiley]], which serves as an agricultural centre in Somaliland. That town's Allay-Baday area produces tons of tomatoes and onions each month during the rainy season. The town of [[Arabsiyo]] is also located nearby, and is noted for its lemon production.\n\nDue to its relative fertility and greenery, wild animals come to the Hargeisa area to either breed or graze on the grassland savannah. Fauna that can be found in rural sections of the city include the [[kudu]], [[wild boar]]s, [[Somali wild ass]], [[warthog]]s, [[antelope]]s, [[Somali sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[camel]]s, and many different types of [[bird]]s. There are also a number of both public and private menageries. South of Hargeisa is a grassland savannah, which attracts many types of wildlife to the area, including [[lion]]s and [[leopard]]s.\n\n== Climate ==\nHargeisa has a [[Desert climate|semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''BSh''). The city generally features warm winters and hot summers. However, despite its location in the tropics, due to the high altitude Hargeisa seldom experiences either very hot or very cold weather. This is a trait rarely seen in regions with a semi-arid climates. The city receives the bulk of its precipitation between the months of April and September, averaging just under {{convert|400|mm|in}} of rainfall annually. Average monthly temperatures in Hargeisa range from {{convert|18|C|0}} in the months of December and January to {{convert|24|C|0}} in the month of June.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Hargeisa\n|

These [[Orda (organization)|Horde]]s are known as the \"White\", \"Blue\" and \"[[Shaybanids|Grey]]\" (Shaybanid) Hordes in Slavic and Persian historiography. The two main divisions are also known as Batu's Ulus (district) and Orda's Ulus.\n\nDifferent authors use 'Blue Horde' and 'White Horde' with opposite definitions, which can lead to confusion and has created the need for checking the convention that individual authors use.<ref>Vasary, who seems to know the most, prefers east=blue. East=blue is Russian or Turkic and east=white is Persian or Uzbek. Some authors have the Mongol usage of east=left, west=right.  Golden Horde is a Russian usage which was probably not used by the Tatars. All authors place the division near the Volga-Ural area. The halves are also called Aq Orda (white) and K\u00f6k Orda (blue). \n\n*East=Blue:\n*May, 2017 has east=blue, no explanation (Timothy May, Mongol Empire, v1, p 70\n*Vasary, 2009 says that the Tatars used east=blue and west=white. He says east=white comes from Persian historians such as Mu'in al-Din Natanzi (fl 1410s) and many standard western sources have followed this. Research in the last 40 years (before 2009) reverses this, so east should be blue. (Istvan Vasary in Cambridge History of Inner Asia, page 81\n*Bregel, 2003:  In Turkic usage west=white, east=blue. The reverse comes from an unnamed fifteenth century Persian source. He says that  west=right, east=left is a Mongol usage.(Yuri Bregel, Historical Atlas of Central Asia, Map 38.)\n*East=White\n*Baumer, 2016 uses east=white. He says that in Timurid and Uzbek sources of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries west=blue and east=white. West=white is used by Russian writers. The Mongols did not use color terms. (Cristoph Baumer, History of Central Asia, vol 3, page 262)\n*Ashrafyan,1997 has east=white, west=golden, no explanation.

By 1245, [[Sarai (city)|Sarai]], the capital of the Horde had been founded on the lower [[Volga]]. At the same time, the eastern lands of the Golden Horde were administered by Batu's older brother [[Orda Khan|Orda]], and these came to be known as the left wing. Batu asserted his control over the Russian principalities after sacking the cities of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1238 and [[Kiev]] in 1240, forcing them to pay annual tribute and accept his nominees as princes.\n\nBatu's ulus stretched from the [[Ural River]] to the mouths of the [[Danube]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. It exacted tribute from most of the Russian principalities and carried raids as far west as Poland and as far south as Iran and Bulgaria.\n\nStarting with the conversion of Berke to Islam, the White Horde (or Blue Horde) made a traditional alliance with the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]] against their common rival, the [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khans]].\n\nFrom the 1280s until 1299, the White Horde (or Blue Horde) was effectively under the control of two khans, the legitimate khans and [[Nogai Khan]], a warlord and kingmaker, who made an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and invaded countries bordering the Blue Horde, particularly in the [[Balkans]].  Nogai's pre-eminence was ended by the assertion of the legitimate Khan [[Toqta]], and the Blue Horde reached the apex of its power and prosperity during the reigns of [[Uzbeg Khan]] (\u00d6z Beg) and his son [[Jani Beg]] in the middle of the 14th century, when it intervened in the affairs of the disintegrating Ilkhanate.\n\nThe White Horde (or Blue Horde) remained strong from its foundation (around 1240) until the 1350s. Problems in the west of the horde led to the eventual losses of Wallachia, Dobruja, Moldavia and the western Ukraine and the vassal principalities west of Kiev, losing those lands to [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] after being defeated by its army in the [[Battle of Blue Waters]] in 1362, and Poland. The death of Jani Beg led to the Blue Horde entering into a prolonged civil war, with concurrent khans fighting each other and holding no real power. At the same time [[Mamai]] turned kingmaker in the Blue Horde. In this time, [[Muscovy]] seceded from [[Mongol]] overlordship (at least until the early 15th century). It was not until the coming of [[Tokhtamysh]] that the concurrent khans were removed. He briefly united the Blue Horde with the White Horde in 1380.\n\n===Left wing===\n'''Orda's Ulus''' or more appropriately, the '''Left wing of the Golden Horde''' was one of the uluses within the [[Mongol Empire]] formed around 1225, after the death of [[Jochi]] when his son, [[Orda Khan|Orda-Ichen]] (\u041e\u0440\u0434 \u044d\u0437\u044d\u043d, Lord Orda), inherited his father's [[appanage]] by the [[Jaxartes]]. It was the eastern constituent part of the Golden Horde.<ref>Edward L. Keenan, ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' article</ref><ref>B.D. Grekov and A.Y. Yakubovski ''The Golden Horde and its Downfall''</ref>\n\nBecause Orda and his descendants ruled the left division of the Golden Horde, they were called ''Princes of the left wing (also left hand)''.<ref>Leo de Hartog ''Russia and the Mongol yoke'', p.98</ref> Initially it covered the western part of the territory ruled by the [[List of Khans of the Golden Horde|Jochids]] and included western Central Asia and south-western [[Siberia]]. The capital of the White Horde was originally at [[Lake Balkhash]], but later moved to [[Sighnaq|Sygnaq]], [[Kazakhstan]] on the [[Syr-Darya]] River.<ref>[http://www.ozturkler.com/data_english/0006/0006_05_03.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412213730/http://www.ozturkler.com/data_english/0006/0006_05_03.htm |date=April 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Batu Khan]] sent a large Jochid delegation to Hulagu's campaign in the Middle East, it included a strong contingent under Kuli, a son of Orda. However, suspicious deaths of the latter and other Jochid princes (c.1259) angered the rulers of the Golden Horde. During the [[Toluid Civil War]] over succession between Kublai and [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]] from 1260 to 1264, the White Horde elites supported the latter. They also began to support the \u00d6gedeid prince [[Kaidu]] because he was supported by the khans such as [[Berke]] and [[Mengu-Timur|M\u00f6ngke-Tem\u00fcr]].\n\nSince 1280, Orda's successor, [[K\u00f6ch\u00fc|Konchi or K\u00f6ch\u00fc]], had allied with the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and the [[Ilkhanate]], in return, they rewarded him. According to [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]'s account or H. H. Howorth's analysis, Kunchi possessed the territory of [[Ghazna]] and [[Bamiyan]] under the suzerainty of either the [[Chagatai Khanate]] or the Ilkhanate.<ref>Stanley Lane-Poole ''The Mohammedan Dynasties'', p.227</ref> Kunchi warned the Ilkhan [[Abagha]] of the upcoming invasion of [[Baraq (Chagatai Khan)]] in 1268. However, when the [[Borjigin]] princes, who operated on the [[Kublai Khan]]'s behalf in [[Central Asia]] and later rebelled, fought against each other, they appealed to Kunchi whose response is not clear.\n\n[[Marco Polo]] describes the Horde as extremely cold area, saying:\n\n\"''This king (K\u00f6ch\u00fc) has neither city nor castle; he and his people live always either in the wide plains or among great mountains and valleys. They subsist on the milk and flesh of their cattle, and have no grain. The king has a vast number of people, but he carries on no war with anybody, and his people live in great tranquility. They have enormous numbers of cattle, camels, horses, oxen, sheep, and so forth.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Polo.html |title=Travels of Marco Polo |publisher=Shsu.edu |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1299, the Left wing Khan, [[Bayan (khan)|Bayan]], was deposed by his cousin, Kobelek, who took assistance from Kaidu and [[Duwa]].<ref>Sir Henry Hoyle Howorth ''History of the Mongols: from the 9th to the 19th century'', Volume 2, p.220</ref> By 1304, Bayan had reoccupied most of his ancestors' lands. His horde began to herd around Syr-Darya, replacing the [[Shaybanids]]. Bayan's troops included the Russian and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] soldiers.\n\nTheir khan, Chimtai, sent his brothers to take the Golden Horde throne during the [[Blue Horde]]'s period of anarchy, (1359\u20131380).

Whenever we see these terms we must always check which convention the author is using.<ref>Vasary, who seems to know the most, prefers east=blue. East=blue is Russian or Turkic and east=white is Persian or Uzbek. Some authors have the Mongol usage of east=left, west=right.  Golden Horde is a Russian usage which was probably not used by the Tatars. All authors place the division near the Volga-Ural area.

He says east=white comes from Persian historians such as Mu'in al-Din Natanzi (fl 1410s) and many standard western sources have followed this. Research in the last 40 years (before 2009) reverses this, so east should be blue. (Istvan Vasary in Cambridge History of Inner Asia, page 81\n*Bregel, 2003:  In Turkic usage west=white, east=blue.

Batu asserted his control over the Russian principalities after sacking the cities of [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] in 1238 and [[Kiev]] in 1240, forcing them to pay annual tribute and accept his nominees as princes.\n\nBatu's ulus stretched from the [[Ural River]] to the mouths of the [[Danube]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. It exacted tribute from most of the Russian principalities and carried raids as far west as Poland and as far south as Iran and Bulgaria.\n\nStarting with the conversion of Berke to Islam, the White Horde (or Blue Horde) made a traditional alliance with the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]] against their common rival, the [[Ilkhanate|Il-Khans]].\n\nFrom the 1280s until 1299, the White Horde (or Blue Horde) was effectively under the control of two khans, the legitimate khans and [[Nogai Khan]], a warlord and kingmaker, who made an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and invaded countries bordering the Blue Horde, particularly in the [[Balkans]].  Nogai's pre-eminence was ended by the assertion of the legitimate Khan [[Toqta]], and the Blue Horde reached the apex of its power and prosperity during the reigns of [[Uzbeg Khan]] (\u00d6z Beg) and his son [[Jani Beg]] in the middle of the 14th century, when it intervened in the affairs of the disintegrating Ilkhanate.\n\nThe White Horde (or Blue Horde) remained strong from its foundation (around 1240) until the 1350s. Problems in the west of the horde led to the eventual losses of Wallachia, Dobruja, Moldavia and the western Ukraine and the vassal principalities west of Kiev, losing those lands to [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]] after being defeated by its army in the [[Battle of Blue Waters]] in 1362, and Poland. The death of Jani Beg led to the Blue Horde entering into a prolonged civil war, with concurrent khans fighting each other and holding no real power. At the same time [[Mamai]] turned kingmaker in the Blue Horde. In this time, [[Muscovy]] seceded from [[Mongol]] overlordship (at least until the early 15th century). It was not until the coming of [[Tokhtamysh]] that the concurrent khans were removed. He briefly united the Blue Horde with the White Horde in 1380.\n\n===Left wing===\n'''Orda's Ulus''' or more appropriately, the '''Left wing of the Golden Horde''' was one of the uluses within the [[Mongol Empire]] formed around 1225, after the death of [[Jochi]] when his son, [[Orda Khan|Orda-Ichen]] (\u041e\u0440\u0434 \u044d\u0437\u044d\u043d, Lord Orda), inherited his father's [[appanage]] by the [[Jaxartes]]. It was the eastern constituent part of the Golden Horde.<ref>Edward L. Keenan, ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'' article</ref><ref>B.D. Grekov and A.Y. Yakubovski ''The Golden Horde and its Downfall''</ref>\n\nBecause Orda and his descendants ruled the left division of the Golden Horde, they were called ''Princes of the left wing (also left hand)''.<ref>Leo de Hartog ''Russia and the Mongol yoke'', p.98</ref> Initially it covered the western part of the territory ruled by the [[List of Khans of the Golden Horde|Jochids]] and included western Central Asia and south-western [[Siberia]]. The capital of the White Horde was originally at [[Lake Balkhash]], but later moved to [[Sighnaq|Sygnaq]], [[Kazakhstan]] on the [[Syr-Darya]] River.<ref>[http://www.ozturkler.com/data_english/0006/0006_05_03.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412213730/http://www.ozturkler.com/data_english/0006/0006_05_03.htm |date=April 12, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Batu Khan]] sent a large Jochid delegation to Hulagu's campaign in the Middle East, it included a strong contingent under Kuli, a son of Orda. However, suspicious deaths of the latter and other Jochid princes (c.1259) angered the rulers of the Golden Horde. During the [[Toluid Civil War]] over succession between Kublai and [[Ariq B\u00f6ke]] from 1260 to 1264, the White Horde elites supported the latter. They also began to support the \u00d6gedeid prince [[Kaidu]] because he was supported by the khans such as [[Berke]] and [[Mengu-Timur|M\u00f6ngke-Tem\u00fcr]].\n\nSince 1280, Orda's successor, [[K\u00f6ch\u00fc|Konchi or K\u00f6ch\u00fc]], had allied with the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and the [[Ilkhanate]], in return, they rewarded him. According to [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani]]'s account or H. H. Howorth's analysis, Kunchi possessed the territory of [[Ghazna]] and [[Bamiyan]] under the suzerainty of either the [[Chagatai Khanate]] or the Ilkhanate.<ref>Stanley Lane-Poole ''The Mohammedan Dynasties'', p.227</ref> Kunchi warned the Ilkhan [[Abagha]] of the upcoming invasion of [[Baraq (Chagatai Khan)]] in 1268. However, when the [[Borjigin]] princes, who operated on the [[Kublai Khan]]'s behalf in [[Central Asia]] and later rebelled, fought against each other, they appealed to Kunchi whose response is not clear.\n\n[[Marco Polo]] describes the Horde as extremely cold area, saying:\n\n\"''This king (K\u00f6ch\u00fc) has neither city nor castle; he and his people live always either in the wide plains or among great mountains and valleys. They subsist on the milk and flesh of their cattle, and have no grain. The king has a vast number of people, but he carries on no war with anybody, and his people live in great tranquility. They have enormous numbers of cattle, camels, horses, oxen, sheep, and so forth.''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Polo.html |title=Travels of Marco Polo |publisher=Shsu.edu |accessdate=2014-03-07}}</ref>\n\nIn 1299, the Left wing Khan, [[Bayan (khan)|Bayan]], was deposed by his cousin, Kobelek, who took assistance from Kaidu and [[Duwa]].<ref>Sir Henry Hoyle Howorth ''History of the Mongols: from the 9th to the 19th century'', Volume 2, p.220</ref> By 1304, Bayan had reoccupied most of his ancestors' lands. His horde began to herd around Syr-Darya, replacing the [[Shaybanids]]. Bayan's troops included the Russian and [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] soldiers.\n\nTheir khan, Chimtai, sent his brothers to take the Golden Horde throne during the [[Blue Horde]]'s period of anarchy, (1359\u20131380). But they were all murdered before reaching any success. Members from White Horde (sometimes it is confused with the Blue Horde), Khizr, and his son or relative, Arab Shaykh, briefly took the throne of the Golden Horde, using their army.<ref>It is unclear that Arab was his son. Some claimed that they were relatives.</ref>\n\nIn 1375, [[Urus Khan]], the eighth khan of the Left wing, became a contested khan of both the Blue Horde and the White Horde.<ref>Peter Quennell ''History Today'', Volume 9, p.154</ref> He extruded the members from the House of Khizr.<ref>Slovensk\u00e1 akad\u00e9mia vied.

Thus, Toqtamish consolidated the two hordes, becoming the Khan of the Golden Horde.\n\nAfter the defeat of Toqtamish in 1395-96, Kuruichik was appointed head of the White Horde by [[Tamerlane]].<ref>H. H. Howorth ''History of the Mongols'', v.II, p.287</ref> Since then families of Jochi's sons, [[Tuqa-Timur]], [[Shiban]] and Orda, began to merge with each other, establishing [[Uzbeks|Uzbeg]] and [[Kazakh Khanate|Kazakh]] hordes. Among them, Kuruichik's descendant, [[Baraq (Khan of Golden Horde)|Borog]], briefly asserted the throne of the Golden Horde in 1421.\n\nAfter Baraq's murder, the Horde divided into two parts with 2 khans - Mohammed and Mustafa. Mustafa reconquered the Horde, though, in Siberia appeared another threat of [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]]. In 1446 the latter gained the victory over Mustafa, ending the existence of Orda's Ulus (the left wing of the Golden Horde).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]\n* [[Political divisions and vassals of the Mongol Empire]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Boris Grekov]] and [[Alexander Yakubovski]], ''The Golden Horde and its Downfall''\n*[[George Vernadsky]], ''The Mongols and Russia''\n\n{{Mongol Empire}}\n\n[[Category:Golden Horde]]\n[[Category:Mongol dynasties]]\n[[Category:History of the Turkic peoples]]\n[[Category:Nomadic groups in Eurasia]]\n[[Category:Sunni dynasties]]\n", "name_user": "Edigodiuss", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_the_Golden_Horde"}

They can be far-reaching or quite limited and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority. Typically, responsibilities include being a decision maker on strategy and other key policy issues, [[leadership|leader]], manager, and executor. The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and the rest of the outside world, as well as to the organization's management and employees; the decision-making role involves high-level decisions about policy and strategy.

The CEO of a political party is often entrusted with fundraising, particularly for election campaigns.\n\n==International use==\nIn some countries, there is a [[dual board]] system with two separate boards, one [[Board of directors|executive board]] for the day-to-day business and one [[supervisory board]] for control purposes (selected by the shareholders). In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the [[chairman]] presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board. This allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.\n\nIn the United States, the [[board of directors]] (elected by the [[shareholder]]s) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the [[executive committee]] (the division/subsidiary heads and [[Corporate title|C-level]] officers that report directly to the CEO).\n\nIn the United States, and in business, the executive officers are usually the top officers of a corporation, the chief executive officer (CEO) being the best-known type. The definition varies; for instance, the California Corporate Disclosure Act defines \"executive officers\" as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the board of directors. In the case of a sole proprietorship, an executive officer is the sole proprietor. In the case of a partnership, an executive officer is a managing partner, senior partner, or administrative partner. In the case of a limited liability company, executive officer is any member, manager, or officer.\n\n==Related positions==\n{{Main|Corporate title}}\nTypically, a CEO has several subordinate executives, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives,<ref>{{cite web|author=Markus Menz |url=http://jom.sagepub.com/content/38/1/45.abstract |title=Menz, M. 2012.

Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the [[vice-president]] (VP). An organization may have more than one vice-president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of [[finance]], VP of [[human resources]], VP of [[research and development]]). Some organizations have subordinate executive officers who also have the word ''chief'' in their job title, such as [[chief operating officer]] (COO), [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) and [[chief technology officer]] (CTO). The [[public relations]]-focused position of [[chief reputation officer]] is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer, but, as suggested by Anthony Johndrow, CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors, it can also be seen as \"simply another way to add emphasis to the role of a modern-day CEO \u2013 where they are both the external face of, and the driving force behind, an organisation culture\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.financierworldwide.com/rise-of-the-chief-reputation-officer/|title=Rise of the Chief Reputation Officer|website=Financier Worldwide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===US===\nIn the US, the term ''chief executive officer'' is used primarily in business, whereas the term ''executive director'' is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector. These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities. Implicit in the use of these titles, is that the public not be misled and the general standard regarding their use be consistently applied.\n\n===UK===\nIn the UK, ''chief executive'' and ''chief executive officer'' are used in both business and the [[philanthropy|charitable sector]].<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.acevo.org.uk/ |title=Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations |publisher=Acevo.org.uk |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}\n</ref> {{As of | 2013}}, the use of the term ''[[Director (business)|director]]'' for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles. In the United Kingdom, the term ''Managing Director'' is often used in lieu of ''Chief Executive Officer''.\n\n==Famous CEOs==\nBusiness publicists since the days of [[Edward Bernays]] and his client [[John D. Rockefeller]] and even more successfully the corporate publicists for [[Henry Ford]], promoted the concept of the \"[[celebrity]] CEO\". Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, were produced by unique talented individuals, especially the \"heroic CEO\". In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions. The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics. Guthey et al. argue that \"...these individuals are not self-made, but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions, personalities, and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere.\"<ref>Eric Guthey and Timothy Clark, ''Demystifying Business Celebrity'' (2009).</ref> Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect the harder-to-describe broader corporate factors. There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work. Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions. Indeed, there may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists.<ref>Mathew L.A. Hayward, Violina P. Rindova, and Timothy G.

The CEO of a political party is often entrusted with fundraising, particularly for election campaigns.\n\n==International use==\nIn some countries, there is a [[dual board]] system with two separate boards, one [[Board of directors|executive board]] for the day-to-day business and one [[supervisory board]] for control purposes (selected by the shareholders). In these countries, the CEO presides over the executive board and the [[chairman]] presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board. This allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person.\n\nIn the United States, the [[board of directors]] (elected by the [[shareholder]]s) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the [[executive committee]] (the division/subsidiary heads and [[Corporate title|C-level]] officers that report directly to the CEO).\n\nIn the United States, and in business, the executive officers are usually the top officers of a corporation, the chief executive officer (CEO) being the best-known type. The definition varies; for instance, the California Corporate Disclosure Act defines \"executive officers\" as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the board of directors. In the case of a sole proprietorship, an executive officer is the sole proprietor. In the case of a partnership, an executive officer is a managing partner, senior partner, or administrative partner. In the case of a limited liability company, executive officer is any member, manager, or officer.\n\n==Related positions==\n{{Main|Corporate title}}\nTypically, a CEO has several subordinate executives, each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives,<ref>{{cite web|author=Markus Menz |url=http://jom.sagepub.com/content/38/1/45.abstract |title=Menz, M. 2012.

Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations, but one common category of subordinate executive, if the CEO is also the president, is the [[vice-president]] (VP). An organization may have more than one vice-president, each tasked with a different area of responsibility (e.g., VP of [[finance]], VP of [[human resources]], VP of [[research and development]]). Some organizations have subordinate executive officers who also have the word ''chief'' in their job title, such as [[chief operating officer]] (COO), [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) and [[chief technology officer]] (CTO). The [[public relations]]-focused position of [[chief reputation officer]] is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer, but, as suggested by Anthony Johndrow, CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors, it can also be seen as \"simply another way to add emphasis to the role of a modern-day CEO \u2013 where they are both the external face of, and the driving force behind, an organisation culture\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.financierworldwide.com/rise-of-the-chief-reputation-officer/|title=Rise of the Chief Reputation Officer|website=Financier Worldwide|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===US===\nIn the US, the term ''chief executive officer'' is used primarily in business, whereas the term ''executive director'' is used primarily in the not-for-profit sector. These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities. Implicit in the use of these titles, is that the public not be misled and the general standard regarding their use be consistently applied.\n\n===UK===\nIn the UK, ''chief executive'' and ''chief executive officer'' are used in both business and the [[philanthropy|charitable sector]].<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.acevo.org.uk/ |title=Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations |publisher=Acevo.org.uk |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}\n</ref> {{As of | 2013}}, the use of the term ''[[Director (business)|director]]'' for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee, which are normally non-executive (unpaid) roles. In the United Kingdom, the term ''Managing Director'' is more commonly used than ''Chief Executive Officer''.\n\n==Famous CEOs==\nBusiness publicists since the days of [[Edward Bernays]] and his client [[John D. Rockefeller]] and even more successfully the corporate publicists for [[Henry Ford]], promoted the concept of the \"[[celebrity]] CEO\". Business journalists have often adopted this approach, which assumes that the corporate achievements, especially in the arena of manufacturing, were produced by unique talented individuals, especially the \"heroic CEO\". In effect, journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions. The model is the celebrity in entertainment, sports, and politics. Guthey et al. argue that \"...these individuals are not self-made, but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions, personalities, and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere.\"<ref>Eric Guthey and Timothy Clark, ''Demystifying Business Celebrity'' (2009).</ref> Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect the harder-to-describe broader corporate factors. There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work. Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self-confident in making complex decisions. Indeed, there may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists.<ref>Mathew L.A. Hayward, Violina P. Rindova, and Timothy G.

{"title_page": "Photoemission electron microscopy", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=December 2012}}\n'''Photoemission electron microscopy''' ('''PEEM''', also called '''photoelectron microscopy''', '''PEM''') is a type of [[electron microscopy]] that utilizes local variations in [[electron]] emission to generate image contrast.{{cn|date=February 2019}} The excitation is usually produced by [[ultraviolet light]], [[synchrotron radiation]] or [[X-ray]] sources. PEEM measures the coefficient indirectly by collecting the emitted [[secondary electron]]s generated in the electron cascade that follows the creation of the primary core hole in the absorption process. PEEM is a surface sensitive technique because the emitted electrons originate from a shallow layer. In physics, this technique is referred to as PEEM, which goes together naturally with [[low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED), and [[low-energy electron microscopy]] ([[LEEM]]). In biology, it is called photoelectron microscopy (PEM), which fits with [[photoelectron spectroscopy]] (PES), [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buseck|first1=Peter|last2=Cowley|first2=John|last3=Eyring|first3=Leroy|title=High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and Associated Techniques|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> and [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:PEEM figure3.jpg|thumb|Early photoelectron emission microscope of E. Br\u00fcche at AEG, Berlin, reproduced from his 1933 paper]]\n\n===Initial development===\n\nIn 1933, [[Ernst Br\u00fcche]] reported images of cathodes illuminated by UV light. This work was extended by two of his colleagues, H. Mahl and J. Pohl. Br\u00fcche made a sketch of his photoelectron emission microscope in his 1933 paper (Figure 1). This is evidently the first photoelectron emission microscope (PEEM).\n\n===Improved techniques===\nIn 1963, G. F. Rempfer designed the electron optics for an early ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) PEEM. In 1965, G. Burroughs at the Night Vision Laboratory, Fort Belvoir, Virginia built the bakeable electrostatic lenses and metal-sealed valves for PEEM. During the 1960s, in the PEEM, as well as [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]], the specimens were grounded and could be transferred in the UHV environment to several positions for photocathode formation, processing and observation. These electron microscopes were used for only a brief period of time, but the components live on. The first commercially available PEEM was designed and tested by Engel during the 1960s for his thesis work under [[Ernst Ruska|E. Ruska]] and developed it into a marketable product, called the \"Metioskop KE3\", by Balzers in 1971. The electron lenses and voltage divider of the PEEM were incorporated into one version of a PEEM for biological studies in Eugene, Oregon around 1970.\n\n===Further research===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the second generation (PEEM-2) and third generation (PEEM-3) microscopes were constructed. PEEM-2 is a conventional not aberration-corrected instrument employing electrostatic lenses. It uses a cooled [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) fiber-coupled to a phosphor to detect the electron-optical image. The aberration corrected microscope PEEM-3 employs a curved electron mirror to counter the lowest order aberrations of the electron lenses and the accelerating field.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Photoelectric effect===\n{{main|Photoelectric effect}}\n\nThe photoemission or [[photoelectric effect]] is a quantum electronic phenomenon in which electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from matter after the absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation such as UV light or X-ray.\n\nWhen UV light or X-ray is absorbed by matter, electrons are excited from core levels into unoccupied states, leaving empty core states. Secondary electrons are generated by the decay of the core hole. Auger processes and inelastic electron scattering create a cascade of low-energy electrons. Some electrons penetrate the sample surface and escape into vacuum. A wide spectrum of electrons is emitted with energies between the energy of the illumination and the [[work function]] of the sample. This wide electron distribution is the principal source of image aberration in the microscope.\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\n[[Image:PEEM figure4.jpg|thumb|right|Photoelectric effect]]\n[[Image:PEEM figure5.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic illustration of the photoemission process]]\nUsing Einstein's method, the following equations are used:\nEnergy of photon=Energy needed to remove an electron + Kinetic energy of the emitted electron\n\n:<math>hf=\\phi + E_{k_{max}} \\,</math>\n\n''h'' is Planck's constant;\n\n''f'' is the frequency of the incident photon;\n\n:<math>\\phi=h f_0 \\ </math> is the [[work function]];\n\n:<math>E_{k_{max}}=\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 </math> is the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons;\n\n''f''<sub>0</sub> is the threshold frequency for the photoelectric effect to occur;\n\n''m'' is the rest mass of the ejected electron;\n\n''v''<sub>m</sub> is the speed of the ejected electron.\n\n===Electron emission microscopy===\nElectron emission microscopy is a type of electron microscopy in which the information carrying beam of electrons originates from the specimen. The source of energy causing the electron emission can be heat (thermionic emission), light (photoelectron emission), ions, or neutral particles, but normally excludes field emission and other methods involving a point source or tip microscopy.\n\n===Photoelectron imaging===\nPhotoelectron imaging includes any form of imaging in which the source of information is the distribution of points from which electrons are ejected from the specimen by the action of photons. The technique with the highest resolution photoelectron imaging is presently photoelectron emission microscopy using UV light.\n\n==Photoemission electron microscope==\nA photoemission electron microscope is a parallel imaging instrument. It creates at any given moment a complete picture of the photoelectron distribution emitted from the imaged surface region.\n\n===Light sources===\nThe viewed area of the specimen must be illuminated homogeneously with appropriate radiation (ranging from UV to hard x-rays). [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] is the most common radiation used in PEEM because very bright sources are available, like [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] lamps. However, other wavelengths (like soft x-rays) are preferred where analytical information is required.\n\n===Electron optical column and resolution===\n[[Image:PEEM figure6.jpg|thumb|right|Scheme of the photoemission electron microscope]]\nThe electron optical column contains two or more electrostatic or magnetic electron lenses, corrector elements such as a [[stigmator]] and deflector, an angle-limiting aperture in the backfocal{{not a typo}} plane of one of the lenses.\n\nAs in any emission electron microscope, the objective or cathode lens determines the resolution. The latter is dependent on the electron-optical qualities, such as spherical aberrations, and the energy spread of the photoemitted electrons. The electrons are emitted into the vacuum with an angular distribution close to a cosine square function. A significant velocity component parallel to the surface will decrease the lateral resolution. The faster electrons, leaving the surface exactly along the center line of the PEEM, will also negatively influence the resolution due to the chromatic aberration of the cathode lens. The resolution is inversely proportional to the accelerating field strength at the surface but proportional to the energy spread of the electrons. So resolution r is approximately:\n\n:<math>r\\approx \\frac{d\\,\\Delta\\,E}{e\\,U}</math>\n[[Image:PEEM figure7.jpg|thumb|right|Typical photoemission electron microscope]]\nIn the equation, d is the distance between the specimen and the objective, \u0394E is the distribution width of the initial electron energies and U is the accelerating voltage.\n\nBesides the cathode or objective lens, situated on the left hand side of Figure 4, two more lenses are utilized to create an image of the specimen: an intermediate three-electrode lens is used to vary the total magnification between 100\u00d7 if the lens is deactivated, and up to 1000\u00d7 when needed. On the right-hand side of Figure 4 is the projector, a three electrode lens combined with a two-element deceleration lens. The main task of this lens combination is the deceleration of the fast 20 keV electrons to energies for which the channelplate{{not a typo}} has its highest sensitivity. Such an image intensifier has its best performance for impinging electrons with kinetic energies roughly about 1 keV.\n\n===Energy filter===\nAn energy filter can be added to the instrument in order to select the electrons that will contribute to the image. This option is particularly used for analytical applications of the PEEM. By using an energy filter, a PEEM microscope can be seen as imaging [[Ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) or [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS). By using this method, spatially resolved photoemission spectra can be acquired with spatial resolutions on the 100&nbsp;nm scale and with sub-eV resolution. Using such instrument, one can acquire elemental images with chemical state sensibility or work function maps. Also, since the photoelectron are emitted only at the very surface of the material, surface termination maps can be acquired.\n\n===Detector===\nA detector is placed at the end of electron optical column. Usually, a phosphor screen is used to convert the electron image to a photon image. The choice of phosphor type is governed by resolution considerations. A multichannel plate detector that is imaged by a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera can substitute phosphor screen.\n\n==Time-resolved PEEM==\nCompared to many other electron microscopy techniques, time-resolved PEEM offers a very high temporal resolution of only a few femtoseconds with prospects of advancing it to the attosecond regime. The reason is that temporal electron pulse broadening does not deteriorate the temporal resolution because electrons are only used to achieve a high spatial resolution. The temporal resolution is reached by using very short light pulses in a pump-probe setup. A first pulse optically excites dynamics like surface plasmons on a sample surface and a second pulse probes the dynamics after a certain waiting time by photoemitting electrons. The photoemission rate is influenced by the local excitation level of the sample. Hence, spatial information about the dynamics on the sample can be gained. By repeating this experiment with a series of waiting times between pump and probe pulse, a movie of the dynamics on a sample can be recorded.\n\nLaser pulses in the visible spectral range are typically used in combination with a PEEM. They offer a temporal resolution of a few to 100 fs. In recent years, pulses with shorter wavelengths have been used to achieve a more direct access to the instantaneous electron excitation in the material. Here, a first pulse in the visible excites dynamics near the sample surface and a second pulse with a photon energy significantly above the work function of the material emits the electrons. By employing additional time-of-flight or high-pass energy recording in the PEEM, information about the instantaneous electronic distribution in a nanostructure can be extracted with high spatial and temporal resolution.\n\nEfforts to achieve attosecond temporal resolution and with that directly record optical fields around nanostructures with so far unreached spatio-temporal resolution, are still ongoing.\n\n\n==Limitations==\nThe general limitation of PEEM, which is common with most surface science methods, is that the PEEM operates only under fairly restricted vacuum conditions. Whenever electrons are used to excite a specimen or carry information from its surface there has to be a vacuum with an appropriate mean free path for the electrons. With ''In-situ'' PEEM techniques, water and aqueous solution can be observed by PEEM.\n\nThe resolution of PEEM is limited to about 10&nbsp;nm, which results from a spread of the photoelectron emission angle. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ([[ARPES]]) is a powerful tool for structure analysis. However, it may be difficult to make angle-resolved and energy-selective PEEM measurements because of a lack of intensity. The availability of synchrotron-radiation light sources can offer exciting possibilities in this regard.\n\n==Comparison from other techniques==\nTransmission electron microscopy ([[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) and scanning electron microscopy ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]): PEEM differs from these two microscopies by using an electric accelerating field at the surface of specimen. The specimen is part of the electron-optical system.\n\nLow-energy electron microscopy ([[LEEM]]) and mirror electron microscopy (MEM): these two electron emission microscopy use electron gun supply beams which are directed toward the specimen, decelerated and backscattered from the specimen or reflected just before reaching the specimen. In photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) the same specimen geometry and immersion lens are used, but the electron guns are omitted.\n\n==New PEEM technologies==\nTime resolved photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM) is well suited for real-time observation of fast processes on surfaces equipped with pulsed synchrotron radiation for illumination.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=O.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=Wiemann|first3=C.|last4=Porath|first4=R.|last5=Scharte|first5=M.|last6=Andreyev|first6=O.|last7=Sch\u00f6nhense|first7=G.|last8=Aeschlimann|first8=M.|title=Time-resolved two photon photoemission electron microscopy|journal=Applied Physics B|date=11 February 2014|volume=74|issue=3|pages=223\u2013227|doi=10.1007/s003400200803}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Krasyuk|first1=A.|last2=Oelsner|first2=A.|last3=Nepijko|first3=S.A.|last4=Kuksov|first4=A.|last5=Schneider|first5=C.M.|last6=Sch\u00f6nhense|first6=G.|title=Time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy of magnetic field and magnetisation changes|journal=Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing|date=1 April 2003|volume=76|issue=6|pages=863\u2013868|doi=10.1007/s00339-002-1965-8|bibcode=2003ApPhA..76..863K}}</ref>\n*Time-of-flight Photoemission electron microscopy ([[Time-of-flight|TOF]]-PEEM): TOF-PEEM is PEEM using an ultrafast gated CCD camera or a time-and space-resolving counting detector for observing fast processes on surfaces.\n*Multiphoton Photoemission electron microscopy: Multiphoton PEEM can be employed for the study of localized surface plasmon excitations in nanoclusters or for direct spatial observation of the hot-electron lifetime in structured films using femtosecond lasers.\n*PEEM in liquids and dense gases: The development of microfabricated thin liquid cells in late 1990s enabled wide field-of-view transmission X-ray microscopy of liquid and gaseous samples confined between two SiN membranes.

PEEM measures the coefficient indirectly by collecting the emitted [[secondary electron]]s generated in the electron cascade that follows the creation of the primary core hole in the absorption process. PEEM is a surface sensitive technique because the emitted electrons originate from a shallow layer. In physics, this technique is referred to as PEEM, which goes together naturally with [[low-energy electron diffraction]] (LEED), and [[low-energy electron microscopy]] ([[LEEM]]). In biology, it is called photoelectron microscopy (PEM), which fits with [[photoelectron spectroscopy]] (PES), [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buseck|first1=Peter|last2=Cowley|first2=John|last3=Eyring|first3=Leroy|title=High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy and Associated Techniques|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> and [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM).\n\n==History==\n[[Image:PEEM figure3.jpg|thumb|Early photoelectron emission microscope of E. Br\u00fcche at AEG, Berlin, reproduced from his 1933 paper]]\n\n===Initial development===\n\nIn 1933, [[Ernst Br\u00fcche]] reported images of cathodes illuminated by UV light. This work was extended by two of his colleagues, H. Mahl and J. Pohl. Br\u00fcche made a sketch of his photoelectron emission microscope in his 1933 paper (Figure 1). This is evidently the first photoelectron emission microscope (PEEM).\n\n===Improved techniques===\nIn 1963, G. F. Rempfer designed the electron optics for an early ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) PEEM. In 1965, G. Burroughs at the Night Vision Laboratory, Fort Belvoir, Virginia built the bakeable electrostatic lenses and metal-sealed valves for PEEM. During the 1960s, in the PEEM, as well as [[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]], the specimens were grounded and could be transferred in the UHV environment to several positions for photocathode formation, processing and observation. These electron microscopes were used for only a brief period of time, but the components live on. The first commercially available PEEM was designed and tested by Engel during the 1960s for his thesis work under [[Ernst Ruska|E. Ruska]] and developed it into a marketable product, called the \"Metioskop KE3\", by Balzers in 1971. The electron lenses and voltage divider of the PEEM were incorporated into one version of a PEEM for biological studies in Eugene, Oregon around 1970.\n\n===Further research===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s the second generation (PEEM-2) and third generation (PEEM-3) microscopes were constructed. PEEM-2 is a conventional not aberration-corrected instrument employing electrostatic lenses. It uses a cooled [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) fiber-coupled to a phosphor to detect the electron-optical image. The aberration corrected microscope PEEM-3 employs a curved electron mirror to counter the lowest order aberrations of the electron lenses and the accelerating field.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Photoelectric effect===\n{{main|Photoelectric effect}}\n\nThe photoemission or [[photoelectric effect]] is a quantum electronic phenomenon in which electrons (photoelectrons) are emitted from matter after the absorption of energy from electromagnetic radiation such as UV light or X-ray.\n\nWhen UV light or X-ray is absorbed by matter, electrons are excited from core levels into unoccupied states, leaving empty core states. Secondary electrons are generated by the decay of the core hole. Auger processes and inelastic electron scattering create a cascade of low-energy electrons. Some electrons penetrate the sample surface and escape into vacuum. A wide spectrum of electrons is emitted with energies between the energy of the illumination and the [[work function]] of the sample. This wide electron distribution is the principal source of image aberration in the microscope.\n\n===Quantitative analysis===\n[[Image:PEEM figure4.jpg|thumb|right|Photoelectric effect]]\n[[Image:PEEM figure5.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic illustration of the photoemission process]]\nUsing Einstein's method, the following equations are used:\nEnergy of photon=Energy needed to remove an electron + Kinetic energy of the emitted electron\n\n:<math>hf=\\phi + E_{k_{max}} \\,</math>\n\n''h'' is Planck's constant;\n\n''f'' is the frequency of the incident photon;\n\n:<math>\\phi=h f_0 \\ </math> is the [[work function]];\n\n:<math>E_{k_{max}}=\\frac{1}{2} m v_m^2 </math> is the maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons;\n\n''f''<sub>0</sub> is the threshold frequency for the photoelectric effect to occur;\n\n''m'' is the rest mass of the ejected electron;\n\n''v''<sub>m</sub> is the speed of the ejected electron.\n\n===Electron emission microscopy===\nElectron emission microscopy is a type of electron microscopy in which the information carrying beam of electrons originates from the specimen. The source of energy causing the electron emission can be heat (thermionic emission), light (photoelectron emission), ions, or neutral particles, but normally excludes field emission and other methods involving a point source or tip microscopy.\n\n===Photoelectron imaging===\nPhotoelectron imaging includes any form of imaging in which the source of information is the distribution of points from which electrons are ejected from the specimen by the action of photons. The technique with the highest resolution photoelectron imaging is presently photoelectron emission microscopy using UV light.\n\n==Photoemission electron microscope==\nA photoemission electron microscope is a parallel imaging instrument. It creates at any given moment a complete picture of the photoelectron distribution emitted from the imaged surface region.\n\n===Light sources===\nThe viewed area of the specimen must be illuminated homogeneously with appropriate radiation (ranging from UV to hard x-rays). [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] is the most common radiation used in PEEM because very bright sources are available, like [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] lamps. However, other wavelengths (like soft x-rays) are preferred where analytical information is required.\n\n===Electron optical column and resolution===\n[[Image:PEEM figure6.jpg|thumb|right|Scheme of the photoemission electron microscope]]\nThe electron optical column contains two or more electrostatic or magnetic electron lenses, corrector elements such as a [[stigmator]] and deflector, an angle-limiting aperture in the backfocal{{not a typo}} plane of one of the lenses.\n\nAs in any emission electron microscope, the objective or cathode lens determines the resolution. The latter is dependent on the electron-optical qualities, such as spherical aberrations, and the energy spread of the photoemitted electrons. The electrons are emitted into the vacuum with an angular distribution close to a cosine square function. A significant velocity component parallel to the surface will decrease the lateral resolution. The faster electrons, leaving the surface exactly along the center line of the PEEM, will also negatively influence the resolution due to the chromatic aberration of the cathode lens. The resolution is inversely proportional to the accelerating field strength at the surface but proportional to the energy spread of the electrons. So resolution r is approximately:\n\n:<math>r\\approx \\frac{d\\,\\Delta\\,E}{e\\,U}</math>\n[[Image:PEEM figure7.jpg|thumb|right|Typical photoemission electron microscope]]\nIn the equation, d is the distance between the specimen and the objective, \u0394E is the distribution width of the initial electron energies and U is the accelerating voltage.\n\nBesides the cathode or objective lens, situated on the left hand side of Figure 4, two more lenses are utilized to create an image of the specimen: an intermediate three-electrode lens is used to vary the total magnification between 100\u00d7 if the lens is deactivated, and up to 1000\u00d7 when needed. On the right-hand side of Figure 4 is the projector, a three electrode lens combined with a two-element deceleration lens. The main task of this lens combination is the deceleration of the fast 20 keV electrons to energies for which the channelplate{{not a typo}} has its highest sensitivity. Such an image intensifier has its best performance for impinging electrons with kinetic energies roughly about 1 keV.\n\n===Energy filter===\nAn energy filter can be added to the instrument in order to select the electrons that will contribute to the image. This option is particularly used for analytical applications of the PEEM. By using an energy filter, a PEEM microscope can be seen as imaging [[Ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) or [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS). By using this method, spatially resolved photoemission spectra can be acquired with spatial resolutions on the 100&nbsp;nm scale and with sub-eV resolution. Using such instrument, one can acquire elemental images with chemical state sensibility or work function maps. Also, since the photoelectron are emitted only at the very surface of the material, surface termination maps can be acquired.\n\n===Detector===\nA detector is placed at the end of electron optical column. Usually, a phosphor screen is used to convert the electron image to a photon image. The choice of phosphor type is governed by resolution considerations. A multichannel plate detector that is imaged by a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] camera can substitute phosphor screen.\n\n==Time-resolved PEEM==\nCompared to many other electron microscopy techniques, time-resolved PEEM offers a very high temporal resolution of only a few femtoseconds with prospects of advancing it to the attosecond regime. The reason is that temporal electron pulse broadening does not deteriorate the temporal resolution because electrons are only used to achieve a high spatial resolution. The temporal resolution is reached by using very short light pulses in a pump-probe setup. A first pulse optically excites dynamics like surface plasmons on a sample surface and a second pulse probes the dynamics after a certain waiting time by photoemitting electrons. The photoemission rate is influenced by the local excitation level of the sample. Hence, spatial information about the dynamics on the sample can be gained. By repeating this experiment with a series of waiting times between pump and probe pulse, a movie of the dynamics on a sample can be recorded.\n\nLaser pulses in the visible spectral range are typically used in combination with a PEEM. They offer a temporal resolution of a few to 100 fs. In recent years, pulses with shorter wavelengths have been used to achieve a more direct access to the instantaneous electron excitation in the material. Here, a first pulse in the visible excites dynamics near the sample surface and a second pulse with a photon energy significantly above the work function of the material emits the electrons. By employing additional time-of-flight or high-pass energy recording in the PEEM, information about the instantaneous electronic distribution in a nanostructure can be extracted with high spatial and temporal resolution.\n\nEfforts to achieve attosecond temporal resolution and with that directly record optical fields around nanostructures with so far unreached spatio-temporal resolution, are still ongoing.\n\n\n==Limitations==\nThe general limitation of PEEM, which is common with most surface science methods, is that the PEEM operates only under fairly restricted vacuum conditions. Whenever electrons are used to excite a specimen or carry information from its surface there has to be a vacuum with an appropriate mean free path for the electrons. With ''In-situ'' PEEM techniques, water and aqueous solution can be observed by PEEM.\n\nThe resolution of PEEM is limited to about 10&nbsp;nm, which results from a spread of the photoelectron emission angle. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ([[ARPES]]) is a powerful tool for structure analysis. However, it may be difficult to make angle-resolved and energy-selective PEEM measurements because of a lack of intensity. The availability of synchrotron-radiation light sources can offer exciting possibilities in this regard.\n\n==Comparison from other techniques==\nTransmission electron microscopy ([[Transmission electron microscopy|TEM]]) and scanning electron microscopy ([[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]]): PEEM differs from these two microscopies by using an electric accelerating field at the surface of specimen. The specimen is part of the electron-optical system.\n\nLow-energy electron microscopy ([[LEEM]]) and mirror electron microscopy (MEM): these two electron emission microscopy use electron gun supply beams which are directed toward the specimen, decelerated and backscattered from the specimen or reflected just before reaching the specimen. In photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) the same specimen geometry and immersion lens are used, but the electron guns are omitted.\n\n==New PEEM technologies==\nTime resolved photoemission electron microscopy (TR-PEEM) is well suited for real-time observation of fast processes on surfaces equipped with pulsed synchrotron radiation for illumination.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=O.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=Wiemann|first3=C.|last4=Porath|first4=R.|last5=Scharte|first5=M.|last6=Andreyev|first6=O.|last7=Sch\u00f6nhense|first7=G.|last8=Aeschlimann|first8=M.|title=Time-resolved two photon photoemission electron microscopy|journal=Applied Physics B|date=11 February 2014|volume=74|issue=3|pages=223\u2013227|doi=10.1007/s003400200803}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Krasyuk|first1=A.|last2=Oelsner|first2=A.|last3=Nepijko|first3=S.A.|last4=Kuksov|first4=A.|last5=Schneider|first5=C.M.|last6=Sch\u00f6nhense|first6=G.|title=Time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy of magnetic field and magnetisation changes|journal=Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing|date=1 April 2003|volume=76|issue=6|pages=863\u2013868|doi=10.1007/s00339-002-1965-8|bibcode=2003ApPhA..76..863K}}</ref>\n*Time-of-flight Photoemission electron microscopy ([[Time-of-flight|TOF]]-PEEM): TOF-PEEM is PEEM using an ultrafast gated CCD camera or a time-and space-resolving counting detector for observing fast processes on surfaces.\n*Multiphoton Photoemission electron microscopy: Multiphoton PEEM can be employed for the study of localized surface plasmon excitations in nanoclusters or for direct spatial observation of the hot-electron lifetime in structured films using femtosecond lasers.\n*PEEM in liquids and dense gases: The development of microfabricated thin liquid cells in late 90-s enabled wide field-of-view transmission X-ray microscopy of liquid and gaseous samples confined between two SiN membranes.

''The Oxford History of Mexico'' (2000) p. 322</ref>  His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing half its territory, beginning with the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836 and culminating with the [[Mexican Cession]] of 1848 following its loss to the United States in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. But his leadership in the Mexican-American War and his willingness to fight to the bitter end prolonged the war. \"More than any other single person it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of a short war.\"<ref>Guardino, Peter.

He was overthrown by the liberal [[Revolution of Ayutla]] in 1855 and lived most of his later years in exile.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAntonio de Padua Mar\u00eda Severino L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna y P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n was born in [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]], [[New Spain|Nueva Espa\u00f1a]] (New Spain), on 21 February 1794. He was from a respected Spanish colonial family; he and his parents, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Manuela P\u00e9rez de Lebr\u00f3n, belonged to the elite ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]'' racial group of American-born Spaniards. His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing. According to Mexican historian [[Enrique Krauze]], \"It annoyed him and bored him, and perhaps frightened him.\"<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 137.</ref> A biographer of Santa Anna described him in this period as the \"absentee president.\"<ref>Fowler, Will.

Santa Anna retired to his Veracruz hacienda, [[Manga de Clavo]]. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas was a moderate, but he had a radical liberal congress with which to contend, perhaps a reason that Santa Anna left executive power to his vice president.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 143.</ref>  The nation was faced with an empty treasury and the 11 million peso debt incurred by the Bustamante government. He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed. All this caused concern among Mexican conservatives.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 980380|title = Santa Anna and the G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas Administration in Mexico, 1833-1834|journal = The Americas|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 18\u201350|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1974|doi = 10.2307/980380}}</ref> G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas also sought to extend these reforms to the frontier province of [[Alta California]], promoting legislation to [[Spanish missions in California#secularization|secularize]] the [[Franciscan]] missions there.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget. On Santa Anna's suggestion, the number of battalions was to be reduced as well as the number of generals and brigadiers.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 145.</ref>  \n\nA law was issued, the ''Ley del Caso'' that called for the arrest of 51 politicians, including former president Bustamante for holding \"unpatriotic\" beliefs and ordered them expelled from the republic. G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas claimed that Santa Anna was the driving force for the law, which evidence seems to support.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 420</ref> With increasing resistance from the church as well as the army, the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]] was issued, likely orchestrated by former general and governor of the [[Federal District]], [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Tornel]]. The plan called for repeal the ''Ley del Caso'' and urged lack of tolerance for the influence of [[Masonic lodges]], where politics was pursued in secrecy; declared void the laws passed by Congress and the local legislatures in favor of the reforms; requested the protection of President Santa Anna to fulfill the plan, and recognize him as the only authority; removal from office the deputies and officials who carried out enforcement of the reform laws and decrees; and provide military force to support the president in implementing the plan.<ref>{{cite book |ref=harv |language=Spanish |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wq5LbA_fwugC&pg=PA379\n |last=Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero |first=Enrique\n |authorlink=Enrique Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero\n |title=Pa\u00eds de un solo hombre: el M\u00e9xico de Santa Anna.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress. \n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30-40,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released. The treaty was a major turning point in Santa Anna's career, as it meant the end of Mexican sovereignty in Texas.<ref>animatedatlas.com/mexwar/santaanna.html\" 'Treaty' Between Santa Anna and Texas\"</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nSanta Anna rode double into Sam Houston's camp on the horse of [[Joel Walter Robison]], a soldier in most of the battles and later a member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Fayette County, Texas|Fayette County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fro42\n|title=Robison, Joel Walter|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nActing Texas president [[David G. Burnet]] and Santa Anna signed the [[Treaties of Velasco]], the latter under duress, stating that \"in his official character as chief of the Mexican nation, he acknowledged the full, entire, and perfect Independence of the Republic of Texas.\" In exchange, Burnet and the Texas government guaranteed Santa Anna's safety and transport to Veracruz. During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty. They do not know what it is, unenlightened as they are, and under the influence of Catholic clergy, a despotism is a proper government for them, but there is no reason why it should not be a wise and virtuous one.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |title=Captivity of Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna |accessdate=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Tfvw5bs?url=http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/santaanna4.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Redemption, dictatorship, and exile===\n[[File: \u00c9pisode de l'exp\u00e9dition du Mexique en 1838.jpg|thumb|French bombardment of the fort of San Juan de Ul\u00faa in the [[Pastry War]]]]\n\nAfter some time in exile in the U.S., and after meeting U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]] in 1837, Santa Anna was allowed to return to Mexico. He was transported aboard the [[USS Pioneer (1836)|USS ''Pioneer'']] to retire to his [[hacienda]] in [[Veracruz]], called [[Manga de Clavo]].\n\nIn 1837, Santa Anna also wrote a manifesto in which he reflected on his Texas experiences as well as his surrender. His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842. The new Congress was composed of men of principles who vigorously opposed the autocratic leader.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3338755|title = Generals versus Politicians: Santa Anna and the 1842 Congressional Elections in Mexico|journal = Bulletin of Latin American Research|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 257\u2013274|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1989|doi = 10.2307/3338755}}</ref>\n\nTrying to restore the treasury, Santa Anna raised taxes, but this aroused resistance. Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844.

Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end.

Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853.

He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" His full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsen thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>   \n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba. As the extent of his corruption became known, he was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for treason; all his estates were confiscated by the government.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Juan Cordero - Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|'' Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna'' by [[Juan Cordero]], 1855.

He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires.

Beezley, eds. ''The Oxford History of Mexico'' (2000) p. 322</ref>  His centralist rhetoric and military failures resulted in Mexico losing half its territory, beginning with the [[Texas Revolution]] of 1836 and culminating with the [[Mexican Cession]] of 1848 following its loss to the United States in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].

His father was a royal army officer perpetually in debt,<ref>Krauze, ''Mexico: Biography of Power'', p. 127.</ref> and served for a time as a sub-delegate for the Gulf Coast Spanish province of [[Veracruz]]. However, his parents were wealthy enough to send him to school.\n\n==Career==\n===War of Independence, 1810\u20131821===\nIn June 1810, the 16-year-old Santa Anna joined the Fijo de Veracruz infantry regiment<ref>Pani, Erika. \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico''. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1334.</ref> as a cadet against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to pursue a career in commerce.{{sfn|Fowler|2000|p=20}} In September 1810, secular cleric [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] rebelled against Spanish rule, sparking a spontaneous mass movement in Mexico's rich agricultural area, the Baj\u00edo. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] was to last until 1821, and Santa Anna, like most creole military men, fought for the crown against the mixed-raced insurgents for independence. Santa Anna's commanding officer was [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arredondo]], who taught him much about dealing with Mexican rebels. In 1811, Santa Anna was wounded in the left hand by an arrow{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=27}} during the campaign under Col. Arredondo in the town of Amoladeras, in the intendancy (administrative district) of [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]. In 1813, Santa Anna served in [[Texas]] against the [[Guti\u00e9rrez\u2013Magee Expedition]], and at the [[Battle of Medina]], in which he was cited for bravery. He was promoted quickly; he became a second lieutenant in February 1812 and first lieutenant before the end of that year. In the aftermath of the rebellion, the young officer witnessed Arredondo's fierce counter-insurgency policy of mass executions.\n\nDuring the next few years, in which the war for independence reached a stalemate, Santa Anna erected villages for displaced citizens near the city of [[Veracruz City|Veracruz]]. He also pursued gambling, a habit that would follow him all through his life. In 1816, Santa Anna was promoted to captain. He conducted occasional campaigns to suppress [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Native Americans]] or to restore order after a tumult had begun.\n\nWhen royalist officer [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]] changed sides in 1821 and allied with insurgent [[Vicente Guerrero]], fighting for independence under the [[Plan of Iguala]], Santa Anna also joined the fight for independence.<ref>Pani, \"Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna\", p. 1334.</ref> The changed circumstances in Spain, where liberals had ousted Ferdinand VII and began implementing the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, made many elites in Mexico reconsider their options.\n\n===Rebellion against the Mexican Empire of Iturbide, 1822\u20131823===\n{{Further|Casa Mata Plan Revolution}}\nIturbide rewarded Santa Anna with the command of the vital port of Veracruz, the gateway from the Gulf of Mexico to the rest of the nation and site of the customs house. However, Iturbide subsequently removed Santa Anna from the post, prompting Santa Anna to rise in rebellion in December 1822 against Iturbide. Santa Anna already had significant power in his home region of Veracruz, and \"he was well along the path to becoming the regional [[caudillo]].\"<ref>Anna, Timothy E. ''Forging Mexico, 1821\u20131835''. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1998, p. 103.</ref> Santa Anna claimed in his [[Plan of Veracruz (1822)|Plan of Veracruz]] that he rebelled because Iturbide had dissolved the [[First Constituent Congress of Mexico|Constituent Congress]]. He also promised to support free trade with Spain, an important principle for his home region of Veracruz.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 104.</ref><ref>Benson, Nettie Lee. \"The Plan of Casa Mata\", ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 25, no. 1, (February 1945): 45\u201356.</ref>\n\nAlthough Santa Anna's initial rebellion was important, Iturbide had loyal military men who were able to hold their own against the rebels in Veracruz. However, former insurgent leaders [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicol\u00e1s Bravo]], who had supported Iturbide's Plan de Iguala, now returned to their southern Mexico base and raised a rebellion against Iturbide. Then the commander of imperial forces in Veracruz, who had fought against the rebels, changed sides and joined the rebels. The new coalition proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], which called for the end of the monarchy, restoration of the Constituent Congress, and creation of a republic and a federal system.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 107.</ref>\n\nSanta Anna was no longer the main player in the movement against Iturbide and the creation of new political arrangements. He sought to regain his position as a leader and marched forces from Veracruz to Tampico, then to San Luis Potos\u00ed, proclaiming his role as the \"protector of the federation.\" San Luis Potos\u00ed, and other north-central regions, Michoac\u00e1n, Quer\u00e9taro, and Guanajuato met to decide their own position about the federation. Santa Anna pledged his military forces to the protection of these key areas. \"He attempted, in other words, to co-opt the movement, the first of many examples in his long career where he placed himself as the head of a generalized movement so it would become an instrument of his advancement.\"<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', p. 133.</ref>\n\n===Santa Anna and the early Mexican Republic===\nIn May 1823, following Iturbide's March abdication as emperor, Santa Anna was sent to command in Yucat\u00e1n. At the time, Yucat\u00e1n's capital of M\u00e9rida and the port city of Campeche were in conflict. Yucat\u00e1n's closest trade partner was Cuba, still a Spanish colony. Santa Anna took it upon himself to plan a landing force from Yucat\u00e1n in Cuba, which he envisioned would result in Cuban colonists welcoming their liberators and most especially Santa Anna. A thousand Mexicans were already on ships to sail to Cuba when word came that the Spanish were reinforcing their colony, so the invasion was called off.<ref>Green, Stanley C. ''The Mexican Republic: The First Decade 1823\u20131832''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press 1987, pp. 44\u201345.</ref>\n\nFormer insurgent general [[Guadalupe Victoria]], a liberal federalist, became the first president of the Mexican [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] in 1824, following the creation of the Federalist [[Mexican Constitution of 1824]]. He came to the presidency with little factional conflict and he served out his entire four-year term.  However, the election of 1828 was quite different, with considerable political conflict in which Santa Anna became involved. Even before the election, there was unrest in Mexico, with some conservatives affiliated with the [[Scottish Rite]] Masons plotting rebellion. The so-called Monta\u00f1o rebellion in December 1827 called for the prohibition of secret societies, implicitly meaning liberal [[York Rite]] Masons, and the expulsion of the U.S. minister in Mexico, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]], a promoter of federal republicanism in Mexico.  Although Santa Anna was believed to be a supporter of the Scottish Rite conservatives, in the Monta\u00f1o rebellion eventually he threw his support to the liberals.  In his home state of Veracruz, the governor had thrown his support to the rebels, and in the aftermath of the rebellion's failure, Santa Anna as vice-governor stepped into the governorship.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Santa Anna supported the hero of the insurgency, [[Vicente Guerrero]], who was a candidate for the presidency. Another important liberal, [[Lorenzo de Zavala]], also supported Guerrero. [[Manuel G\u00f3mez Pedraza]] won the indirect elections for the presidency, with Guerrero coming in second. Even before all the votes had been counted in September 1828, Santa Anna rebelled against the election results in support of Guerrero. Santa Anna issued a plan at Perote that called for the nullification of the election results, as well for a new law expelling Spanish nationals from Mexico, believed to be in league with Mexican conservatives. Santa Anna's rebellion initially had few supporters, southern Mexican leader [[Juan \u00c1lvarez]] joined Santa Anna's rebellion, and Lorenzo de Zavala, governor of the state of Mexico, under threat of arrest by the conservative Senate, fled to the mountains and organized his own rebellion against the federal government. Zavala brought the fighting into the capital, with his supporters seizing an armory, the ''Acordada''. In these circumstances, president-elect G\u00f3mez Pedraza resigned and soon after left the country. This cleared the way for Guerrero to become president of Mexico. Santa Anna gained prominence as a national leader in his role to oust G\u00f3mez Pedraza and as a defender of federalism and democracy.<ref>Anna, ''Forging Mexico'', pp. 218\u2013219, 224.</ref> An explanation for Santa Anna's support of Guerrero is that G\u00f3mez Pedraza had been in favor of Santa Anna's proposed invasion of Cuba, if successful, and if not, \"Mexico might rid himself of an undesirable pest, namely Santa Anna.\"<ref>Green, ''The Mexican Republic'', p. 158.</ref>\n\n[[File:PuebloViejoChurubuscoDF.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Military action in Pueblo Viejo during the Battle of Tampico, September 1829]]\n\nIn 1829, Santa Anna made his mark in the early republic by leading forces that defeated a Spanish invasion to reconquer Mexico. Spain made a final attempt to retake Mexico, invading [[Tampico]] with a force of 2,600 soldiers. Santa Anna marched against the [[Isidro Barradas|Barradas Expedition]] with a much smaller force and defeated the Spaniards, many of whom were suffering from [[yellow fever]]. The defeat of the Spanish army not only increased Santa Anna's popularity but also consolidated the independence of the new Mexican republic. Santa Anna was declared a [[hero]]. From then on, he styled himself \"The Victor of Tampico\" and \"The Savior of the Patria.\" His main act of [[self-promotion]] was to call himself \"The Napoleon of the West.\"\n\nIn a December 1829 coup, Vice-President [[Anastasio Bustamante]], a conservative, rebelled against President Guerrero, who left the capital to lead a rebellion in southern Mexico. The capture of Guerrero and his summary trial and execution in 1831 was a shocking event to the nation.  The conservatives in power were tainted by the execution of a hero of independence and former president. On 1 January 1830, Bustamante took over the presidency. Bustamante had promised an effective administration, and customs revenues (import and export taxes) increased spectacularly, but the revenues were spent on administrative expenses, but most of it went to the military, to win its support with preferential payments, new equipment, increased recruitment. The policy aimed at buying the army's loyalty, a force that could suppress Mexico's, and collect revenue.  On top of customs revenues, Bustamante's government borrowed funds from moneylenders. His government jailed dissenters. In 1832, Santa Anna seized the customs revenues from Veracruz and declared himself in rebellion against Bustamante. The bloody conflict ended with Santa Anna forcing the resignation of Bustamante's cabinet and an agreement was brokered for new elections in 1833. Santa Anna won handily.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 37</ref>\n\n===\"Absentee President,\" 1833\u20131835===\n{{See also|Plan of Cuernavaca}}\n[[File:Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas, portrait.JPG|thumb|Dr. [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]], Santa Anna's vice president 1833\u201334, who enacted liberal reforms]]\nSanta Anna was elected president on 1 April 1833, but while he desired the title, he was not interested in governing.

G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas was a moderate, but he had a radical liberal congress with which to contend, perhaps a reason that Santa Anna left executive power to his vice president.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 143.</ref>  The nation was faced with an empty treasury and the 11 million peso debt incurred by the Bustamante government. He could not cut back on the bloated expenditures on the army and sought other revenues. Taking a chapter out of the late colonial Spanish [[Bourbon reforms|reforms]], the government targeted the Roman Catholic Church. Anticlericalism was a tenet of [[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberalism]], and the church had supported Bustamante's government, so targeting that institution was a logical move.  [[Tithing]] (a 10% tax on agricultural production) was abolished as a legal obligation, and seized church property and finances. The church's role in education was reduced and the Pontifical University closed. All this caused concern among Mexican conservatives.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 980380|title = Santa Anna and the G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas Administration in Mexico, 1833-1834|journal = The Americas|volume = 31|issue = 1|pages = 18\u201350|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1974|doi = 10.2307/980380}}</ref> G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas also sought to extend these reforms to the frontier province of [[Alta California]], promoting legislation to [[Spanish missions in California#secularization|secularize]] the [[Franciscan]] missions there.

The army was also targeted for reform, since it was the largest-single expenditure in the national budget. On Santa Anna's suggestion, the number of battalions was to be reduced as well as the number of generals and brigadiers.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 145.</ref>  \n\nA law was issued, the ''Ley del Caso'' that called for the arrest of 51 politicians, including former president Bustamante for holding \"unpatriotic\" beliefs and ordered them expelled from the republic.

Santa Anna's actions in allowing this first reform (followed by a more sweeping one in 1855) might have been a test case for liberalism. At this point, Santa Anna was a liberal. By giving the moderate liberal G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas responsibility for the reforms, Santa Anna could have plausible deniability.  He could be watchful and wait to see the reaction to a comprehensive attack on the special privileges of the army and the Roman Catholic Church (''[[fueros]]''), as well as confiscation of church wealth, enacted by the radical liberal congress. \n\nSanta Anna was pushed into action. Since he was president and had placed his vice president in charge while he returned to his hacienda, he re-entered the public sphere as the legitimate president. In May 1834, Santa Anna ordered the disarmament of the civic militia. He urged Congress to abolish the controversial ''Ley del Caso'', under which the liberals' opponents had been sent into exile.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|p=468}} The [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], published on 25 May 1834, called for repeal of the liberal reforms.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Pedrero|2004|pp=471\u2013472}} On 12 June, Santa Anna dissolved Congress and announced his decision to adopt the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]].{{sfn|Olavarr\u00eda y Ferrari|1880|p=344}} Santa Anna formed a new Catholic, centralist, conservative government. During this period, Santa Anna brokered an agreement with the Catholic Church, which had signed on to the Plan of Cuernavaca. In exchange for preserving the Church's and the army's privileges, and the church promised a monthly donation to the government of 30-40,000 pesos.<ref>Tenenbaum, Barbara.

In 1835, it replaced the 1824 constitution with the new constitutional document known as the \"[[Siete Leyes]]\" (\"The Seven Laws\"). Santa Anna did not involve himself with the conservative centralists as they moved to replace the federal constitution that dispersed power to the states with a unitary power in the hands of the central government, seemingly uneasy with their political path. \"Although he has been blamed for the change to centralism, he was not actually present during any of the deliberations that led to the abolition of the federalist charter or the elaboration of the 1836 Constitution.\"<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', p. 158</ref><ref>Costeloe, ''The Central Republic, 1835-1846'', pp. 46-65.</ref>\n\nSeveral states openly rebelled against the changes: [[Coahuila y Tejas]] (the northern part of which would become the [[Republic of Texas]]), [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]], [[Quer\u00e9taro]], [[Durango]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], [[Yucat\u00e1n]], [[Jalisco]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Zacatecas]]. Several of these states formed their own governments: the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]], the [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n]], and the [[Republic of Texas]]. Only the Texans defeated Santa Anna and retained their independence. Their fierce resistance was possibly fueled by reprisals Santa Anna committed against his defeated enemies.<ref>Edmondson, J.R. ''The Alamo Story: From Early History to Current Conflicts'' (2000) p. 378.</ref> The ''[[New York Post]]'' editorialized that \"had [Santa Anna] treated the vanquished with moderation and generosity, it would have been difficult if not impossible to awaken that general sympathy for the people of Texas which now impels so many adventurous and ardent spirits to throng to the aid of their brethren.\"<ref name=lord169>Lord (1961), p. 169.</ref>\n\nThe Zacatecas militia, the largest and best supplied of the Mexican states, led by [[Francisco Garc\u00eda Salinas]], was well armed with .753 caliber British '[[Brown Bess]]' muskets and Baker .61 rifles. But, after two hours of combat on [[Battle of Zacatecas (1835)|12 May 1835]], Santa Anna's \"Army of Operations\" defeated the Zacatecan militia and took almost 3,000 prisoners. Santa Anna allowed his army to loot [[Zacatecas City|Zacatecas]] for forty-eight hours. After defeating Zacatecas, he planned to move on to Coahuila y Tejas to quell the rebellion there, which was being supported by settlers from the United States (aka ''Texians'').\n\n===Texas Revolution 1835\u20131836===\n{{Further|Texas Revolution}}\n[[File:FalloftheAlamo.jpg|thumb|Fall of the Alamo to Santa Anna's forces, 6 March 1836]]\nIn 1835, Santa Anna repealed the Mexican Constitution, which ultimately led to the beginning of the Texas Revolution. Santa Anna's reasoning for the repeal was that American settlers in Texas were not paying taxes or tariffs, claiming they were not recipients of any services provided by the Mexican Government. As a result, new settlers were not allowed there. The new policy was a response to the U.S. attempts to purchase Texas from Mexico.<ref name=\"Wright\">{{cite web |url=https://www.andrews.edu/~rwright/Oldwww/Alamo/revolution.html |title=Santa Anna and the Texas Revolution |last=Wright |first=R. |date= |website= |publisher=Andrews University |accessdate=2 October 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSanta Anna's treatment of the people of Texas also led to the revolution. In 1834, Santa Anna abolished the state legislature and gave himself absolute power, and as a result, the people in Texas were considered by Santa Anna to be a part of an illegitimate government. The first altercation occurred in September 1835, when General Cos of the Mexican Army ordered men to confiscate a cannon from Gonzales. The people of Texas resisted, gaining control of the Alamo.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\nLike other states discontented with the central Mexican government, the Texas Department of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas rebelled in late 1835 and declared itself independent on 2 March 1836. The northeastern part of the state had been settled by numerous Anglo-American immigrants. [[Stephen Austin]] and his party had been welcomed by earlier Mexican governments.\n\nSanta Anna marched north to bring Texas back under Mexican control by a show of brute merciless force. His expedition posed challenges of manpower, logistics, supply, and strategy far beyond what he was prepared for, and it ended in disaster. To fund, organize, and equip his army he relied, as he often did, on forcing wealthy men to provide loans. He recruited hastily, sweeping up many derelicts and ex-convicts, as well as Indians who could not understand Spanish commands.\n\nHis army expected tropical weather and suffered from the cold as well as shortages of traditional foods. Stretching a supply line far longer than ever before, he lacked horses, mules, cattle, and wagons, and thus had too little food and feed. The medical facilities were minimal. Morale sank as soldiers realized there were not enough chaplains to properly bury their bodies. Regional Indians attacked military stragglers; water sources were polluted and many men were sick. Because of his weak staff system, Santa Anna was oblivious to the challenges, and was totally confident that a show of force and a few massacres (as at the Alamo and Goliad) would have the rebels begging for mercy.<ref>Presley, James. \"Santa Anna's Invasion of Texas: A Lesson in Command\", ''Arizona & the West,'' (1968) 10#3 pp. 241\u2013252</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 1836, at the [[Battle of the Alamo]], Santa Anna's forces killed 189 Texan insurgents and later executed more than 342 Texan prisoners, including [[James Fannin]] at the [[Goliad Massacre]] (27 March 1836). These executions were conducted in a manner similar to the executions he witnessed of Mexican rebels in the 1810s as a young soldier.  However, Santa Anna's forces suffered unexpectedly heavy casualties in the battle.\n\nIn 1874, Santa Anna asserted in a letter that killing the Alamo insurgents was his only option. The letter stressed that Alamo garrison commander [[William B. Travis]] was to blame for the degree of violence at the Alamo. Santa Anna believed that Travis was rude and disrespectful towards him, and had that not happened, he would have allowed Sam Houston to establish a dominant presence there. In his letter, he stated that the disrespect of Travis led to the demise of all of his followers, which he claimed only took a couple of hours.<ref>{{cite web|website = Texas State Library and Archives Commission|title = Santa Anna to McArdle, March 16, 1874: Letter Explaining Why the Alamo Insurgents Had to Be Killed|url =https://www.tsl.texas.gov/treasures/republic/alamo/santa-anna-letter-01.html|publisher = the State of Texas}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|left|''\"Surrender of Santa Anna\"'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, [[battle of San Jacinto]]]]\n\nThe Mexican army victory at the Alamo bought time for General [[Sam Houston]] and his Texas forces. During the siege of the Alamo, the Texas Navy had more time to plunder ports along the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Texian Army]] gained more weapons and ammunition. Despite Houston's lack of ability to maintain strict control of the Texian Army, they completely routed Santa Anna's much larger army at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]] on 21 April 1836. The Texans shouted, \"Remember Goliad, Remember the Alamo!\" The day after the battle, a small Texan force led by [[James Austin Sylvester]] captured Santa Anna. They found the general dressed in a dragoon private's uniform and hiding in a marsh.\n\nOn 14 May 1836, a treaty was drawn up between Santa Anna and Texas, committing Santa Anna to cease operations against the rebels. Santa Anna also agreed that his troops would leave Texas. Both armies were prohibited from contact with each other. Finally, the treaty demanded that all Texan prisoners under Santa Anna be released.

During this week-long journey, Santa Anna passed through Washington D.C. where he met briefly with the president [[Andrew Jackson]]. Meanwhile, in Mexico City a new government declared that Santa Anna was no longer president and that the treaty he had made with Texas was null and void. The Mexican Congress also rejected the treaty.  While Santa Anna was captive in Texas, [[Joel Roberts Poinsett]]&nbsp;\u2013 U.S. minister to Mexico in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 offered a harsh assessment of General Santa Anna's situation: \"Say to General Santa Anna that when I remember how ardent an advocate he was of liberty ten years ago, I have no sympathy for him now, that he has gotten what he deserves.\"  Santa Anna replied: \"Say to Mr. Poinsett that it is very true that I threw up my cap for liberty with great ardor, and perfect sincerity, but very soon found the folly of it. A hundred years to come my people will not be fit for liberty.

His great impact on Mexico was that by the age of thirty-five, he had built such a strong reputation as a military leader that he obtained high ranking. He acknowledged that by 1835, he considered Texas to be the biggest threat to Mexico, and he acted upon those threats.<ref>tamu.edu, \"Manifesto which General Antonio Lopez De Santa Anna Addresses to His Fellow Citizens\",</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn 1838, Santa Anna had a chance for redemption from the loss of Texas. After Mexico rejected French demands for financial compensation for losses suffered by French citizens, France sent forces that landed in Veracruz in the [[Pastry War]]. The Mexican government gave Santa Anna control of the army and ordered him to defend the nation by any means necessary. He engaged the French at Veracruz. During the Mexican retreat after a failed assault, Santa Anna was hit in the left leg and hand by cannon fire. His shattered ankle required amputation of much of his leg, which he ordered buried with full military honors. Despite Mexico's final capitulation to French demands, Santa Anna used his war service to re-enter Mexican politics.\n\n[[File:Combat de Vera Cruz 1838 Prince de Joinville attaque la maison du general Arista.jpg|thumb|left|Santa Anna was severely wounded and narrowly escaped capture in the French attack on Veracruz in 1838.]]\n[[File:Santaannain1847.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.]]\n\nSanta Anna used a [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] cork leg; during the later [[Mexican\u2013American War]], it was captured and kept by American troops from the 4th Illinois Infantry. The cork leg is displayed at the Illinois State Military Museum in [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]].<ref>[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/public-displays-santa-annas-life-and-limb/Content?oid=902666 \"Public Displays: Santa Anna's life and limb\", by S.L.

Santa Anna was made president for the fifth time, taking over a nation with an empty treasury. The war with France had weakened Mexico, and the people were discontented. Also, a rebel army led by Generals [[Jos\u00e9 Urrea]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Mex\u00eda]] was marching towards the capital in opposition to Santa Anna. Commanding the army, Santa Anna crushed the rebellion in Puebla.\n\nSanta Anna ruled in a more dictatorial way than during his first administration. His government banned anti-Santanista newspapers and jailed dissidents to suppress opposition. In 1842, he directed a [[Dawson massacre|military expedition into Texas]]. It inflicted numerous casualties with no political gain, but Texans began to be persuaded of the potential benefits of [[Texas annexation|annexation]] by the more powerful U.S. Santa Anna was unable to control the Mexican congressional elections of 1842. The new Congress was composed of men of principles who vigorously opposed the autocratic leader.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3338755|title = Generals versus Politicians: Santa Anna and the 1842 Congressional Elections in Mexico|journal = Bulletin of Latin American Research|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 257\u2013274|last1 = Costeloe|first1 = Michael P.|year = 1989|doi = 10.2307/3338755}}</ref>\n\nTrying to restore the treasury, Santa Anna raised taxes, but this aroused resistance. Several Mexican states stopped dealing with the central government, and [[Republic of Yucat\u00e1n|Yucat\u00e1n]] and [[Republic of the Rio Grande|Laredo]] declared themselves independent republics. With resentment growing, Santa Anna stepped down from power and fled in December 1844. The buried leg he left behind in the capital was dug up by a mob and dragged through the streets until nothing was left of it.{{sfn|Camnitzer|2009}}{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=239}} Fearing for his life, he tried to elude capture, but in January 1845 he was apprehended by a group of Native Americans near [[Xico, Veracruz]]. They turned him over to authorities, and Santa Anna was imprisoned. His life was spared, but he was exiled to [[Cuba]], still a Spanish colony.\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War, 1846\u20131848                                                           ===\n{{Main|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n[[File:Antonio_Lopez_de_Santa_Anna_c1870.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna circa 1870.]]\n[[File:Nebel Mexican War 07 Battle of Churubusco.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Battle of Churubusco]], during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], 20 August 1847]]\n\nIn 1846, Mexican and American troops moved towards the Rio Grande into the disputed [[Nueces Strip]]. Following early skirmishes, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|United States then declared war on Mexico]].  A coalition including [[Juan Alvarez]] forced out President [[Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga|Mariano Paredes]], and sought a return to a federal republic with Santa Anna as president. Paredes was overthrown on 4 August 1846 and Santa Anna returned to Mexico from exile two days later.  Mexico returned to the Constitution of 1824 as its governing document.  Santa Anna wrote to Mexico City saying he had no aspirations to the presidency, but would eagerly use his military experience to reclaim Texas. Santa Anna had secretly been dealing with representatives of the U.S., pledging that if he were allowed back in Mexico through the U.S. naval blockades, he would work to sell all contested territory to the U.S. at a reasonable price. Once back in Mexico at the head of an army, Santa Anna reneged on both of these agreements, which had been a ruse to return to Mexico and lead the fight against the U.S. invasion. It had only been a year since he was forced out of the republic, but Santa Anna was still popular among the Mexican people.  Although he had a history of double-dealing and corruption, many Mexicans acknowledged that Santa Anna was the most reliable person to help Mexico get through the many obstacles and threats that the country would often face. His return was different from past events because Santa Anna had no intention of getting involved in politics again, intending to solely focus on aiding the military in its war against the United States.<ref>Fowler, ''Santa Anna of Mexico'', pp. 256\u2013257</ref>  \"Despite his many faults as a tactician and his overbearing political ambition, Santa Anna was committed to fighting to the bitter end. His actions would prolong the war for at least a year, and more than any other single person it was Santa Anna who denied Polk's dream of a short war.\"<ref>Guardino ''The Dead March'', p. 88.</ref>\n\n===President for the last time, 1853-55===\n{{See also|Second Mexican Republic|Plan of Ayutla}}\n[[File:Gadsden Purchase Cities ZP.svg|thumb|Gadsden Purchase of 1854, territory purchased by the U.S. for a better transcontinental railway route]]\nFollowing defeat in the Mexican\u2013American War in 1848, Santa Anna went into exile in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Two years later, he moved to [[Turbaco]], [[Colombia]]. In April 1853, he was invited back by conservatives who had overthrown a weak liberal government, initiated under the Plan de Hospicio in 1852, drawn up by the clerics in the cathedral chapter of Guadalajara. Usually, revolts were fomented by military officers; this one was created by churchmen.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Church and State in Latin America, revised edition|last=Lloyd|publisher=Chapel Hill: the University of North Carolina Press|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=358}}</ref> Santa Anna was elected president on 17 March 1853; [[Lucas Alam\u00e1n]] became his Minister of Foreign Relations, although he died a short time later in June 1853. Santa Anna honored his promises to the Church, revoking a decree denying protection for the fulfillment of monastic vows, promulgated twenty years early during the era of [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]] reform of 1833. President Santa Anna had left running the government in 1833 to his liberal vice president.<ref name=mecham-358-59>Mecham, ''Church and State'', pp. 358\u2013359.</ref> The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], which had been expelled from Spanish realms by the crown in 1767, were allowed to return to Mexico ostensibly to educate poorer classes, and much of their property, which the crown had confiscated and sold, was restored to them.<ref name=mecham-358-59/>\n\nAlthough he gave himself exalted titles, his situation was quite vulnerable. He declared himself dictator-for-life with the title \"Most Serene Highness.\" Santa Anna's full title in this final period of power was \"Hero [''benem\u00e9rito''] of the nation, General of Division, Grand Master of the National and Distinguished Order of Guadalupe, Grand Cross of the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Carlos III, and President of the Mexican Republic.\"<ref>Mecham, ''Church and State'', p. 359.</ref> The reality was that this administration was no more successful than his earlier ones, dependent on loans from moneylenders and support from conservative elites, the church, and the army.  A major miscalculation was his sale of territory to the U.S., the [[Gadsden Purchase]].  La Mesilla, the  land in northwest Mexico that the U.S. wanted, was much easier terrain for the building of a transcontinental railway line in the U.S. The purchase money for the land was supposedly to go to Mexico's empty treasury. Santa Anna was unwilling to wait until the final transaction went through and the boundary line established, wanting access to the $3M immediately. He bargained with American bankers to get immediate cash, while they gained the right to the revenue when the sale closed.  His short-sighted deal netted the Mexican government only $250,000 against credit of $650,000 going to the bankers. Gadsen thought the amount was likely much higher.<ref>Tenenbaum, ''The Politics of Penury'', p. 138</ref>   \n\nLiberals created the [[Plan of Ayutla]], calling for the removal of Santa Anna from office. He was exiled yet again.\n\nDespite his generous payoffs to the military for loyalty, by 1855 even conservative allies had seen enough of Santa Anna. That year a group of liberals led by [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ignacio Comonfort]] overthrew Santa Anna, and he fled back to Cuba. As the extent of his corruption became known, he was tried ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for treason; all his estates were confiscated by the government.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File: Juan Cordero - Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|'' Portrait of Do\u00f1a Dolores Tosta de Santa Anna'' by [[Juan Cordero]], 1855.

At neither wedding ceremony did he appear, legally empowering his future father-in-law to serve as a proxy at his first wedding and a friend at his second.<ref>Fowler, Will. \"All the President's Women: The Wives of General Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna in 19th century Mexico\", ''Feminist Review'', No. 79, Latin America: History, war, and independence (2005), pp. 57\u201358.</ref> One assessment of the two marriages is that they were arranged marriages of convenience, bringing considerable wealth to Santa Anna and that his lack of attendance at the wedding ceremonies \"appears to confirm that he was purely interested in the financial aspect on the alliance.\"<ref name=fowler58>Fowler, \"All the President's Women\", p. 58.</ref>\n\n[[File: Johhan Moritz Rugendas, Manga de Clavo.

When Iturbide as Mexican emperor lost support, Santa Anna had been in the forefront of leaders seeking to oust him. Although Santa Anna's family was of modest means, he was of good creole lineage; the Garc\u00eda family may well have seen a match between their young daughter and the up-and-coming Santa Anna as advantageous. Mar\u00eda In\u00e9s's dowry allowed Santa Anna to purchase the first of his haciendas, Manga de Clavo, in Veracruz state.<ref name=fowler58/><ref>Potash, Robert. \"Testaments de Santa Anna.\" ''Historia Mexicana'', Vol. 13, No. 3, 430\u2013440.</ref>\n\nThe wife of the first Spanish Ambassador to Mexico, [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Fanny Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and her husband visited with Santa Anna's first wife In\u00e9s at Manga de Clavo, where they were well-received with a breakfast banquet.  Mme. Calder\u00f3n de la Barca observed that \"After breakfast, the Se\u00f1ora having dispatched an officer for her cigar-case, which was gold with a diamond latch, offered me a cigar, which I having declined, she lighted her own, a little paper 'cigarette', and the gentlemen followed her good example.\"<ref>Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, F.

The couple rarely lived together; de Tosta resided primarily in Mexico City and Santa Anna's political and military activities took him around the country.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}} They had no children, leading biographer Will Fowler to speculate that the marriage was either primarily platonic or that de Tosta was infertile.{{sfn|Fowler|2009|p=229}}\n\nSeveral women claimed to have borne Santa Anna [[Legitimacy (family law)|natural]] children. In his will, Santa Anna acknowledged and made provisions for four: Paula, Mar\u00eda de la Merced, Petra, and Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.

He had left Mexico due to his unpopularity with the Mexican people after his defeat in 1848 and traveled to and from Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He participated in gambling and businesses with the hopes that he would become rich. In the 1850s, he traveled to New York with the first shipment of ''[[chicle]]''. This is the base of what we know today as chewing gum, however, Santa Anna intended chicle to be used in buggy tires. He attempted but was unsuccessful in convincing U.S. wheel manufacturers that this substance could be more useful in tires than the materials they were originally using. Although he introduced chewing gum to the United States, he did not make any money from the product.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1865, he attempted to return and offer his services during the French invasion by posing once again as the country's defender and savior, only to be refused by Ju\u00e1rez who was well aware of Santa Anna's character. Later that year a schooner owned by Gilbert Thompson, son-in-law of [[Daniel Tompkins]], brought Santa Anna to his home in [[Staten Island, New York]],<ref>[https://nypost.com/2011/11/13/mex-generals-staten-ex-isle/ Mex general\u2019s Staten ex-isle] Retrieved 22 November 2018</ref> where he tried to raise money for an army to return and take over Mexico City.\n\n[[File: Casa de Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna.JPG|thumb|The house in [[Mexico City]] where Santa Anna spent the last years of his life and wrote most of his memoirs.]]\n\n[[Thomas Adams (chewing gum maker)|Thomas Adams]], the American assigned to aid Santa Anna while he was in the U.S., experimented with chicle in an attempt to use it as a substitute for rubber. He bought one ton of the substance from Santa Anna, but his experiments proved unsuccessful. Instead, Adams helped to found the chewing gum industry with a product that he called \"[[chiclets]].\"<ref name=\"Staten\">[http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 Staten Island on the Web: Famous Staten Islanders] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727084919/http://legacy.www.nypl.org/branch/staten/index2.cfm?Trg=1&d1=1391 |date=27 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his many years in exile, Santa Anna was a passionate fan of the sport of [[cockfighting]].

He played college lacrosse for [[Colorado State University]] from 1993 to 1995. In 2006, he was named to the [[US Lacrosse|United States indoor Lacrosse Team]] to compete in the [[World Indoor Lacrosse Championship]] in 2007 but did not see any action in the Bronze Medal campaign. A year later in the 2008/2009 [[National Lacrosse League]] season he was signed by the [[Colorado Mammoth]] as a goalie. As a member of the Mammoth, he saw minimal action in one game in his home town of Philadelphia. During an exhibition season in 2009, the Colorado Sabertooths lacrosse team competed in the Freedom Cup sponsored by USA Indoor Lacrosse in Philadelphia, PA. After defeating all of the other regional and state teams they lost to Team USA's entry to the tournament, finishing as National Runners-Up in their inaugural year.\n\n==Career==\nDue to a statistical anomaly, Jeremy is credited with the lowest GAA in the entire NLL for the [[2009 NLL season|2009 season]] with an average of 0.0 goals allowed. He faced zero shots during this appearance. He set several more notable records at [[Colorado State University]] as a starting freshman and sophomore, (Most saves in a Game with 33, Most starts by a freshman with 14, Most shots faced in a game at 59), but those records were later wiped off the books when the coaching regime changed at CSU in the late 1990s. After being named a MILA/CILL All-Star in August 2012, he faced the newest incarnation of Team USA in an exhibition game at the [[Sears Centre]] outside Chicago. Playing in Tandem with another goalie, the pair carried their squad to a 14-8 victory. Ogden started the second half, stopping 28 shots and allowing only 3 goals. Ogden never lost a game as the starting goalie for the Sabertooths, and was named a Star of the Championship Game in 2012, defeating the previous years champions, the Grand Rapids Dragonfish 13-6. Ogden allowed 4 goals and tallied more than 30 saves, before stepping aside for his backup with under five minutes to go in the match.\n\nIn his adopted home state of Colorado, Jeremy won more than a dozen championships with 7 teams.\n==Coaching==\nHe coached for the [[Alexander Dawson School (Lafayette, Colorado)|Alexander Dawson School]] boys' lacrosse teams from 2006 until 2011.\n==Retirement==\nOn September 19, 2013 Ogden sustained a serious concussion in an exhibition game mid-season and was forced to retire from elite lacrosse. As he recovered from the concussion, Ogden tried his hand in the announcing booth. He commentated the 2013 Continental Indoor Lacrosse League's National Championship Game between his [[Colorado Sabertooths]] and the [[Chicago Outlaws]] for the National broadcast of the game on In Lax We Trust Radio.\n\nIn retirement, Ogden is coaching youth box lacrosse goalies locally and across the country in clinics and camps, as well as private lessons for some students.\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" |\n|}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.pointstreak.com/prostats/playerpage.html?playerid=2442718&seasonid=3260 Stats Page from NLL Stats Page]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100308103545/http://www.dawsonschool.org/summer-camps/lacrosse-boys-girls/index.aspx Dawson School Lacrosse]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081121021622/http://www.usindoorlacrosse.org/articles/publish/news/page3.shtml Roster for 2007 USA Indoor Lacrosse Team]\n* [http://coloradosabers.com/index.php Colorado Sabortooths State Lacrosse Team]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ogden, Jeremy}}\n[[Category:1975 births]]\n[[Category:American lacrosse players]]\n[[Category:Colorado Mammoth players]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n", "text_old": "{{Orphan|date=May 2011}}\n{{Infobox lacrosse player\n| name = Jeremy Ogden\n| image = Jeremy Ogden.jpg\n| caption = Ogden in his Team USA Jersey from 2007\n| position = Goaltender\n| shoots = Right\n| height_ft = 6\n| height_in = 0\n| weight_lb = 220\n| nll_team = [[Colorado Mammoth]]\n| nationality = USA\n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1975|9|30|mf=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Downingtown, PA]], [[United States|US]]\n| career_start = 2006\n| nickname = Wookie, Chewy\n}}\n\n'''Jeremy Ogden, AKA Chewy, Tank, Wolfman, Congo, Pillsbury,''' and '''Dough Boy''' (born in 1975 in the Philly suburbs) was a goaltender for the [[Colorado Mammoth]] in the [[National Lacrosse League]] and started for the Colorado Sabertooths National Championship teams in 2012 and 2013.

The group includes the [[Beijing dialect]], the basis of [[Standard Chinese]]. Because Mandarin originated in [[North China]] and most Mandarin languages and dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as '''Northern Chinese''' ({{zh|s=\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd|labels=no}} ''b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such those of the [[Southwest Mandarin|Southwest]] (including Sichuanese) and the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze]] (including the old capital Nanjing), are not [[mutually intelligible]] or are only partially intelligible with the standard language. Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in [[lists of languages by number of native speakers]] (with nearly a billion).\n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area, stretching from [[Yunnan]] in the southwest to [[Xinjiang]] in the northwest and [[Heilongjiang]] in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the [[North China Plain]] compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. The final stops of [[Middle Chinese]] have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final [[glottal stop]]. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain [[retroflex]] initial consonants, which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese.\n\nThe [[Historical capitals of China|capital]] has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a national [[lingua franca]] since the 14th century.

When [[Jesuit]] missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b98\u8bdd/\u5b98\u8a71}}) or \"language of the officials\".{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=537}}\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to [[Standard Chinese]], which is often called simply \"Chinese\". Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect|particular Mandarin dialect]] spoken in [[Beijing]], with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), the ''de facto'' official language of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan) and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. It also functions as the language of instruction in Mainland China and in Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]], under the name \"Chinese\". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as\n* ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u666e\u901a\u8bdd/\u666e\u901a\u8a71}}, literally 'common speech') in Mainland China,\n* ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u56fd\u8bed/\u570b\u8a9e}}, literally 'national language') in Taiwan or\n* ''Hu\u00e1y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|\u534e\u8bed/\u83ef\u8a9e}}, literally '[[Huaxia|Hua]] (Chinese) language') in southeast Asia,\nbut not as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nLinguists use the term \"Mandarin\" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. The alternative term ''B\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd/\u5317\u65b9\u8a71}}) or \"Northern dialects\", is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\nNative speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of \"Mandarin\" (or so-called \"Northern dialects\") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name\u2014for example [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuan dialect]], Hebei dialect or [[Northeastern Mandarin|Northeastern dialect]], all being regarded as distinct from the standard language.\n\n==History==\nThe hundreds of modern local [[varieties of Chinese]] developed from regional variants of [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] in central China and [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] on the southeast coast.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}} The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) distinguishes three further groups: [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] (split from Mandarin), [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] in the [[Huizhou region]] of [[Anhui]] and [[Zhejiang]] and [[Pinghua]] in [[Guangxi]] and [[Yunnan]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n=== Old Mandarin ===\n{{main|Old Mandarin}}\n[[File:Mengu Ziyun xia 24b.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A page of the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', covering the syllables ''tsim'' to ''lim'']]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Song dynasty#Northern Song, 959\u20131126|Northern Song]] (959\u20131126) and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] (1115\u20131234) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the ''[[Qu (poetry)|qu]]'' and ''[[sanqu]]'' poetry.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a [[rime dictionary]] called the ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324). A radical departure from the [[rime table]] tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the [['Phags-pa script]] based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese and the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nIn Middle Chinese, initial [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] showed a three-way contrast between [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]], with the fourth or \"entering tone\", a [[checked tone]] comprising syllables ending in plosives (''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k''). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch and by the late [[Tang dynasty]], each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34\u201336, 52\u201354}}\n\nThe ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final ''-m'', which has merged with ''-n'' in modern dialects and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered ''j-'', ''q-'' and ''x-'' in [[pinyin]]).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun ''t\u0101'' (\u4ed6), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=111\u2013132}}\n\n=== Vernacular literature ===\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in [[Literary Chinese]], which was modeled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] of the [[Warring States period]] and the [[Han dynasty]]. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, {{lang|zh|\u7ffc}} (''y\u00ec'', \"wing\") is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 [[homophone]]s in [[Standard Chinese]].\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for recording materials that were meant to be reproduced in oral presentations, materials such as plays and grist for the professional story-teller's mill. From at least the Yuan dynasty, plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', on down to the Qing dynasty novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' and beyond, there developed a literature in [[written vernacular Chinese]] (\u767d\u8bdd/\u767d\u8a71, ''b\u00e1ihu\u00e0''). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=10}}\n\n[[Hu Shih]], a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled ''B\u00e1ihu\u00e0 W\u00e9nxu\u00e9sh\u01d0'' (\"A History of Vernacular Literature\").\n\n=== Koin\u00e9 of the Late Empire ===\n{{main|Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)}}\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|upright|right|''Zhongguo Guanhua'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71), or ''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'' (\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\"), used on the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] (with [[Arcadio Huang]]) in 1742<ref>Fourmont, Etienne (1742).

As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], unable to understand the accents of officials from [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u6b63\u97f3\u66f8\u9662|p=Zh\u00e8ngy\u012bn Sh\u016byu\u00e0n}}) were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n* loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for ''v-''\n* merger of ''-m'' finals with ''-n''\n* the characteristic Mandarin four-tone system in open syllables, but retaining a final glottal stop in \"entering tone\" syllables\n* retention of the distinction between [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] velars and dental affricates, the source of the spellings \"Peking\" and \"Tientsin\" for modern \"Beijing\" and \"Tianjin\".{{sfnp|Kaske|2008|pp=48\u201352}}\n\nAs the last two of these features indicate, this language was a [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2003|p=353}} This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to [[Beijing]] in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard.

A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language ({{zh|t=\u570b\u8a9e|w=Kuo\u00b2-y\u00fc\u00b3|s=\u56fd\u8bed|p=Gu\u00f3y\u01d4|given=t}}). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at [[Old National Pronunciation|an artificial pronunciation]], the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it ''p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{zh|s=\u666e\u901a\u8bdd|t=\u666e\u901a\u8a71|l=common speech}}).{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3\u201315}}\nSome 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984.  Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nThe national language is now used in education, the media and formal occasions in both [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] but not in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. This standard can now be spoken intelligibly by most younger people in [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] with various regional accents. In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the sole language of education, the media, formal speech and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]]. Mandarin is now common and taught in many schools{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}} but still has yet to gain traction with the local population. In Mandarin-speaking areas such as [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]], the local dialect is the native tongue of most of the population.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The era of mass education in Standard Chinese has not erased these regional differences, and people may be either [[diglossia|diglossic]] or speak the standard language with a notable accent.\n\nFrom an official point of view, the mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. Technically, both ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' base their [[phonology]] on the Beijing accent, though ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' also takes some elements from other sources. Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the [[Beijing dialect]]. ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' also have some differences from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and [[pragmatics]].\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]] are used in mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia, while people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan generally use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]].\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\n[[File:Mandarin subgroups and Jin group.png|thumb|right|upright=1.65|Distribution of the eight subgroups of Mandarin plus [[Jin Chinese]], which many linguists include as part of Mandarin, according to the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987){{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map A2}}]]\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The [[North China Plain]] provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in [[Fujian]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183\u2013190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=22}}\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people.

In [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze dialects]] and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final [[glottal stop]]. In other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} As a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin.

For example, the dialects of [[Jinan]], [[Chengdu]], [[Xi'an]] and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the [[Beijing dialect]] tones of {{IPA|[\u02e5]}} (55), {{IPA|[\u02e7\u02e5]}} (35), {{IPA|[\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6]}} (214), and {{IPA|[\u02e5\u02e9]}} (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013196}}\n\n[[Middle Chinese]] stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.\nIn Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}\nOf the [[four tones]] of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013195}}\nThe following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin ''d'' denotes a non-aspirate {{IPA|/t/}}, while ''t'' denotes an aspirate {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Reflexes of Middle Chinese initials and tones in modern Mandarin\n|-\n!

Baxter's transcription]]), are now pronounced ''j\u012b'', ''j\u01d0'' and ''j\u00ec'' respectively.  Older dictionaries such as ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. [[Minjiang dialect|Minjiang]]) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}} (This includes the dialect of [[Nanjing]] on which the [[Postal Romanization]] was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing ''h''.) This development is shared with [[Wu Chinese]] and is thought to represent the pronunciation of [[Old Mandarin]]. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four.

These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except [[Shanghainese]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more [[homophone]]s. New words have been formed by adding [[affix]]es such as ''lao-'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}), ''-zi'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b50}}), ''-(e)r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u513f}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5152}}), and ''-tou'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5934}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u982d}}), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in ''c\u014dngm\u00e1ng'' ({{lang|zh|\u5306\u5fd9}}), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun [[reduplication]], which is hardly used in Beijing. In [[Sichuan]], one hears ''b\u0101ob\u0101o'' ({{lang|zh|\u5305\u5305}}) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses ''b\u0101o'r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5305\u513f}}).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|h\u00fadi\u00e9}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8774\u8776}}}}) \"butterfly\".\n\nThe singular [[pronoun]]s in Mandarin are {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6211}}}}) \"I\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u01d0}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f60}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59b3}}}}) \"you\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u00edn}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u60a8}}}}) \"you (formal)\", and {{lang|zh-Latn|t\u0101}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ed6}}}}, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5979}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b83}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u7260}}}}) \"he/she/it\", with -{{lang|zh-Latn|men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5011}}) added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun {{lang|zh-Latn|z\u00e1nmen}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u54b1\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u54b1\u5011}}), which is inclusive of the listener, and {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u6211\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-hant|\u6211\u5011}}), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns.  While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., [[Shanghainese]] has ''non'' {{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4fac}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5102}} \"you\" and ''yi'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f0a}}}} \"he/she\").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182, 195\u2013196}}\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|[[hutong|h\u00fat\u00f2ng]]}} ({{lang|zh|\u80e1\u540c}}) \"alley\".

The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary\u2014terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{see also|Chinese grammar}}\n\nChinese varieties of all periods have traditionally been considered prime examples of [[analytic language]]s, relying on word order and particles instead of [[inflection]] or [[affix]]es to provide grammatical information such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], or [[Grammatical case|case]].\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}}\n\nThe basic word order of [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of [[ditransitive]] sentences.\nIn northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:\n<blockquote>\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n| \u6211 || \u7ed9 || \u4f60 || \u4e00\u672c || \u4e66 \u3002\n|-\n| ''w\u01d2'' || ''g\u011bi'' || ''n\u01d0'' || ''y\u00ecb\u011bn'' || ''sh\u016b''.\n|-\n| I || give || you || a (one) || book.\n|}\n</blockquote>\nIn southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=162}}{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], but the particles used vary.\nMost Mandarin dialects use the particle ''-le'' (\u4e86) to indicate the [[perfective aspect]] and ''-zhe'' (\u7740/\u8457) for the [[progressive aspect]].\nOther Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese ''zo<sup>2</sup>'' \u5497 and ''gan<sup>2</sup>'' \u7d27/\u7dca respectively.\nThe experiential aspect particle ''-guo'' (\u8fc7/\u904e) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nThe subordinative particle ''de'' (\u7684) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=196}}\nSome southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nEspecially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final [[particle (grammar)|particles]] alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle ''ma'' (\u561b), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by ''yo'' (\u54df) in southern usage.\n\nSome characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches. In Mandarin the character \u5e2b functions the same thing, it is combined with \u6559, which means teach, to form the word teacher.\n\nList of several common Chinese prefixes and suffixes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The group includes the [[Beijing dialect]], the basis of [[Standard Chinese]]. Because Mandarin originated in [[North China]] and most Mandarin languages and dialects are found in the north, the group is sometimes referred to as '''Northern Chinese''' ({{zh|s=\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd|labels=no}} ''b\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' 'northern speech'). Many varieties of Mandarin, such those of the [[Southwest Mandarin|Southwest]] (including Sichuanese) and the [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze]] (including the old capital Nanjing), are not [[mutually intelligible]] or are only partially intelligible with the standard language. Nevertheless, Mandarin is often placed first in [[lists of languages by number of native speakers]] (with nearly a billion).\n\nMandarin is by far the largest of the seven or ten Chinese dialect groups, spoken by 70 percent of all Chinese speakers over a large geographical area, stretching from [[Yunnan]] in the southwest to [[Xinjiang]] in the northwest and [[Heilongjiang]] in the northeast. This is generally attributed to the greater ease of travel and communication in the [[North China Plain]] compared to the more mountainous south, combined with the relatively recent spread of Mandarin to frontier areas.\n\nMost Mandarin varieties have four [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. The final stops of [[Middle Chinese]] have disappeared in most of these varieties, but some have merged them as a final [[glottal stop]]. Many Mandarin varieties, including the Beijing dialect, retain [[retroflex]] initial consonants, which have been lost in southern varieties of Chinese.\n\nThe [[Historical capitals of China|capital]] has been within the Mandarin area for most of the last millennium, making these dialects very influential. Some form of Mandarin has served as a national [[lingua franca]] since the 14th century. In the early 20th century, a standard form based on the Beijing dialect, with elements from other Mandarin dialects, was adopted as the [[national language]]. Standard Chinese is the [[official language]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.cn/english/laws/2005-09/19/content_64906.htm |title=Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language (Order of the President No.37) |publisher=Chinese Government|date=31 October 2000|accessdate=28 March 2017 |quote=For purposes of this Law, the standard spoken and written Chinese language means Putonghua (a common speech with pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect) and the standardized Chinese characters.}}</ref> and [[Taiwan]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/content2.php?p=29&c=48 |title=ROC Vital Information |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Republic of China (Taiwan) |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> and one of the four official [[languages of Singapore]].

When [[Jesuit]] missionaries learned this standard language in the 16th century, they called it \"Mandarin\", from its Chinese name ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b98\u8bdd/\u5b98\u8a71}}) or \"language of the officials\".{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|p=537}}\n\nIn everyday English, \"Mandarin\" refers to [[Standard Chinese]], which is often called simply \"Chinese\". Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect|particular Mandarin dialect]] spoken in [[Beijing]], with some lexical and syntactic influence from other Mandarin dialects. It is the official spoken language of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), the ''de facto'' official language of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan) and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. It also functions as the language of instruction in Mainland China and in Taiwan. It is one of the six official languages of the [[United Nations]], under the name \"Chinese\". Chinese speakers refer to the modern standard language as\n* ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u666e\u901a\u8bdd/\u666e\u901a\u8a71}}, literally 'common speech') in Mainland China,\n* ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u56fd\u8bed/\u570b\u8a9e}}, literally 'national language') in Taiwan or\n* ''Hu\u00e1y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh|\u534e\u8bed/\u83ef\u8a9e}}, literally '[[Huaxia|Hua]] (Chinese) language') in southeast Asia,\nbut not as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nLinguists use the term \"Mandarin\" to refer to the diverse group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China, which Chinese linguists call ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. The alternative term ''B\u011bif\u0101nghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh|\u5317\u65b9\u8bdd/\u5317\u65b9\u8a71}}) or \"Northern dialects\", is used less and less among Chinese linguists. By extension, the term \"Old Mandarin\" or \"Early Mandarin\" is used by linguists to refer to the northern dialects recorded in materials from the Yuan dynasty.\n\nNative speakers who are not academic linguists may not recognize that the variants they speak are classified in linguistics as members of \"Mandarin\" (or so-called \"Northern dialects\") in a broader sense. Within Chinese social or cultural discourse, there is not a common \"Mandarin\" identity based on language; rather, there are strong regional identities centred on individual dialects because of the wide geographical distribution and cultural diversity of their speakers. Speakers of forms of Mandarin other than the standard typically refer to the variety they speak by a geographic name\u2014for example [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuan dialect]], Hebei dialect or [[Northeastern Mandarin|Northeastern dialect]], all being regarded as distinct from the standard language.\n\n==History==\nThe hundreds of modern local [[varieties of Chinese]] developed from regional variants of [[Old Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]. Traditionally, seven major groups of dialects have been recognized. Aside from Mandarin, the other six are [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] in central China and [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] on the southeast coast.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}} The ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987) distinguishes three further groups: [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] (split from Mandarin), [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] in the [[Huizhou region]] of [[Anhui]] and [[Zhejiang]] and [[Pinghua]] in [[Guangxi]] and [[Yunnan]].{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55\u201356}}\n\n=== Old Mandarin ===\n{{main|Old Mandarin}}\n[[File:Mengu Ziyun xia 24b.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A page of the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', covering the syllables ''tsim'' to ''lim'']]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Song dynasty#Northern Song, 959\u20131126|Northern Song]] (959\u20131126) and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] (1115\u20131234) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech developed based on the dialects of the North China Plain around the capital, a language referred to as Old Mandarin. New genres of vernacular literature were based on this language, including verse, drama and story forms, such as the ''[[Qu (poetry)|qu]]'' and ''[[sanqu]]'' poetry.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48\u201349}}\n\nThe rhyming conventions of the new verse were codified in a [[rime dictionary]] called the ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324). A radical departure from the [[rime table]] tradition that had evolved over the previous centuries, this dictionary contains a wealth of information on the phonology of Old Mandarin. Further sources are the [['Phags-pa script]] based on the Tibetan alphabet, which was used to write several of the languages of the Mongol empire, including Chinese and the ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', a rime dictionary based on 'Phags-pa. The rime books differ in some details, but overall show many of the features characteristic of modern Mandarin dialects, such as the reduction and disappearance of final plosives and the reorganization of the Middle Chinese tones.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nIn Middle Chinese, initial [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate consonant|affricates]] showed a three-way contrast between [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], voiceless aspirated and voiced consonants. There were [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|four tones]], with the fourth or \"entering tone\", a [[checked tone]] comprising syllables ending in plosives (''-p'', ''-t'' or ''-k''). Syllables with voiced initials tended to be pronounced with a lower pitch and by the late [[Tang dynasty]], each of the tones had split into two registers conditioned by the initials. When voicing was lost in all languages except the Wu subfamily, this distinction became phonemic and the system of initials and tones was rearranged differently in each of the major groups.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34\u201336, 52\u201354}}\n\nThe ''Zhongyuan Yinyun'' shows the typical Mandarin four-tone system resulting from a split of the \"even\" tone and loss of the entering tone, with its syllables distributed across the other tones (though their different origin is marked in the dictionary). Similarly, voiced plosives and affricates have become voiceless aspirates in the \"even\" tone and voiceless non-aspirates in others, another distinctive Mandarin development. However, the language still retained a final ''-m'', which has merged with ''-n'' in modern dialects and initial voiced fricatives. It also retained the distinction between velars and alveolar sibilants in palatal environments, which later merged in most Mandarin dialects to yield a palatal series (rendered ''j-'', ''q-'' and ''x-'' in [[pinyin]]).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201350}}\n\nThe flourishing vernacular literature of the period also shows distinctively Mandarin vocabulary and syntax, though some, such as the third-person pronoun ''t\u0101'' (\u4ed6), can be traced back to the Tang dynasty.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=111\u2013132}}\n\n=== Vernacular literature ===\nUntil the early 20th century, formal writing and even much poetry and fiction was done in [[Literary Chinese]], which was modeled on the [[Chinese classics|classics]] of the [[Warring States period]] and the [[Han dynasty]]. Over time, the various spoken varieties diverged greatly from Literary Chinese, which was learned and composed as a special language. Preserved from the sound changes that affected the various spoken varieties, its economy of expression was greatly valued. For example, {{lang|zh|\u7ffc}} (''y\u00ec'', \"wing\") is unambiguous in written Chinese, but has over 75 [[homophone]]s in [[Standard Chinese]].\n\nThe literary language was less appropriate for recording materials that were meant to be reproduced in oral presentations, materials such as plays and grist for the professional story-teller's mill. From at least the Yuan dynasty, plays that recounted the subversive tales of China's Robin Hoods to the Ming dynasty novels such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', on down to the Qing dynasty novel ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' and beyond, there developed a literature in [[written vernacular Chinese]] (\u767d\u8bdd/\u767d\u8a71, ''b\u00e1ihu\u00e0''). In many cases, this written language reflected Mandarin varieties and since pronunciation differences were not conveyed in this written form, this tradition had a unifying force across all the Mandarin-speaking regions and beyond.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=10}}\n\n[[Hu Shih]], a pivotal figure of the first half of the twentieth century, wrote an influential and perceptive study of this literary tradition, entitled ''B\u00e1ihu\u00e0 W\u00e9nxu\u00e9sh\u01d0'' (\"A History of Vernacular Literature\").\n\n=== Koin\u00e9 of the Late Empire ===\n{{main|Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)}}\n[[File:Fourmont-Zhongguo-Guanhua.png|thumb|upright|right|''Zhongguo Guanhua'' (\u4e2d\u570b\u5b98\u8a71), or ''Medii Regni Communis Loquela'' (\"Middle Kingdom's Common Speech\"), used on the frontispiece of an early Chinese grammar published by [[\u00c9tienne Fourmont]] (with [[Arcadio Huang]]) in 1742<ref>Fourmont, Etienne (1742).

As a practical measure, officials of the Ming and Qing dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0''. Knowledge of this language was thus essential for an official career, but it was never formally defined.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\n\nOfficials varied widely in their pronunciation; in 1728, the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], unable to understand the accents of officials from [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], issued a decree requiring the governors of those provinces to provide for the teaching of proper pronunciation. Although the resulting Academies for Correct Pronunciation ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u6b63\u97f3\u66f8\u9662|p=Zh\u00e8ngy\u012bn Sh\u016byu\u00e0n}}) were short-lived, the decree did spawn a number of textbooks that give some insight into the ideal pronunciation. Common features included:\n* loss of the Middle Chinese voiced initials except for ''v-''\n* merger of ''-m'' finals with ''-n''\n* the characteristic Mandarin four-tone system in open syllables, but retaining a final glottal stop in \"entering tone\" syllables\n* retention of the distinction between [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] velars and dental affricates, the source of the spellings \"Peking\" and \"Tientsin\" for modern \"Beijing\" and \"Tianjin\".{{sfnp|Kaske|2008|pp=48\u201352}}\n\nAs the last two of these features indicate, this language was a [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2003|p=353}} This form remained prestigious long after the capital moved to [[Beijing]] in 1421, though the speech of the new capital emerged as a rival standard.

A parallel priority was the definition of a standard national language ({{zh|t=\u570b\u8a9e|w=Kuo\u00b2-y\u00fc\u00b3|s=\u56fd\u8bed|p=Gu\u00f3y\u01d4|given=t}}). After much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at [[Old National Pronunciation|an artificial pronunciation]], the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932. The People's Republic, founded in 1949, retained this standard, calling it ''p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{zh|s=\u666e\u901a\u8bdd|t=\u666e\u901a\u8a71|l=common speech}}).{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3\u201315}}\nSome 54% of speakers of Mandarin varieties could understand the standard language in the early 1950s, rising to 91% in 1984.  Nationally, the proportion understanding the standard rose from 41% to 90% over the same period.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|pp=27\u201328}}\n\nThe national language is now used in education, the media and formal occasions in both [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] but not in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. This standard can now be spoken intelligibly by most younger people in [[Mainland China]] and [[Taiwan]] with various regional accents. In [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the sole language of education, the media, formal speech and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]]. Mandarin is now common and taught in many schools{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}} but still has yet to gain traction with the local population. In Mandarin-speaking areas such as [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]], the local dialect is the native tongue of most of the population.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} The era of mass education in Standard Chinese has not erased these regional differences, and people may be either [[diglossia|diglossic]] or speak the standard language with a notable accent.\n\nFrom an official point of view, the mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese governments maintain their own forms of the standard under different names. Technically, both ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' base their [[phonology]] on the Beijing accent, though ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' also takes some elements from other sources. Comparison of dictionaries produced in the two areas will show that there are few substantial differences. However, both versions of \"school-standard\" Chinese are often quite different from the Mandarin varieties that are spoken in accordance with regional habits, and neither is wholly identical to the [[Beijing dialect]]. ''P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' and ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' also have some differences from the Beijing dialect in vocabulary, grammar, and [[pragmatics]].\n\nThe written forms of Standard Chinese are also essentially equivalent, although [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]] are used in mainland China, Singapore and Malaysia, while people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan generally use [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]].\n\n== Geographic distribution ==\n\n[[File:Mandarin subgroups and Jin group.png|thumb|right|upright=1.65|Distribution of the eight subgroups of Mandarin plus [[Jin Chinese]], which many linguists include as part of Mandarin, according to the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987){{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987|loc=Map A2}}]]\n\nMost Han Chinese living in northern and southwestern China are native speakers of a dialect of Mandarin. The [[North China Plain]] provided few barriers to migration, leading to relative linguistic homogeneity over a wide area in northern China. In contrast, the mountains and rivers of southern China have spawned the other six major groups of Chinese varieties, with great internal diversity, particularly in [[Fujian]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183\u2013190}}{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=22}}\n\nHowever, the varieties of Mandarin cover a huge area containing nearly a billion people. As a result, there are pronounced regional variations in [[pronunciation]], [[vocabulary]], and [[grammar]],{{sfnp|Szeto|Ansaldo|Matthews|2018}} and many Mandarin varieties are not mutually intelligible.{{efn|For example:\n* In the early 1950s, only 54% of people in the Mandarin-speaking area could understand Standard Chinese, which was based on the Beijing dialect.{{sfnp|Chen|1999|p=27}}\n* \"Hence we see that even Mandarin includes within it an unspecified number of languages, very few of which have ever been reduced to writing, that are mutually unintelligible.\"{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=18}}\n* \"the common term assigned by linguists to this group of languages implies a certain homogeneity which is more likely to be related to the sociopolitical context than to linguistic reality, since most of those varieties are not mutually intelligible.\"{{sfnp|Escure|1997|p=144}}\n* \"A speaker of only standard Mandarin might take a week or two to comprehend even simple Kunminghua with ease\u2014and then only if willing to learn it.\"{{sfnp|Blum|2001|p=27}}\n* \"without prior exposure, speakers of different Mandarin dialects often have considerable difficulty understanding each other's local vernacular even if they come from the same province, provided that two or more distinct groups of Mandarin are spoken therein.

Common variants include {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}\n* Some dialects have initial {{IPA|/\u014b/}} corresponding to the zero initial of the standard language.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}  This initial is the result of a merger of the Middle Chinese zero initial with {{IPA|/\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/\u0294/}}.\n* Many dialects of Northwestern and Central Plains Mandarin have {{IPA|/pf pf\u02b0 f v/}} where Beijing has {{IPA|/t\u0282w t\u0282\u02b0w \u0282w \u027bw/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} Examples include {{IPA|/pfu/}} \"pig\" for standard ''zh\u016b'' {{linktext|\u8c6c}} {{IPA|/t\u0282u/}}, {{IPA|/fei/}} \"water\" for standard ''shu\u01d0'' {{linktext|\u6c34}} {{IPA|/\u0282wei/}}, {{IPA|/v\u00e3/}} \"soft\" for standard ''ru\u01cen'' {{linktext|\u8edf}} {{IPA|/\u027bwan/}}.\n\n=== Finals ===\nMost Mandarin dialects have three medial glides, {{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/\u0265/}} (spelled ''i'', ''u'' and ''\u00fc'' in pinyin), though their incidence varies.\nThe medial {{IPA|/w/}}, is lost after apical initials in several areas.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}}\nThus Southwestern Mandarin has {{IPA|/tei/}} \"correct\" where the standard language has ''dui'' {{IPA|/twei/}}.\nSouthwestern Mandarin also has {{IPA|/kai k\u02b0ai xai/}} in some words where the standard has ''jie qie xie'' {{IPA|/t\u0255j\u025b t\u0255\u02b0j\u025b \u0255j\u025b/}}. This is a stereotypical feature of southwestern Mandarin, since it is so easily noticeable. E.g. ''hai'' \"shoe\" for standard ''xie'', ''gai'' \"street\" for standard ''jie''.\n\nMandarin dialects typically have relatively few vowels. [[Syllabic fricative]]s, as in standard ''zi'' and ''zhi'', are common in Mandarin dialects, though they also occur elsewhere.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=194}}\nThe Middle Chinese off-glides {{IPA|/j/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} are generally preserved in Mandarin dialects, yielding several [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s in contrast to the larger sets of monophthongs common in other dialect groups (and some widely scattered Mandarin dialects).{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=194}}\n\nThe Middle Chinese coda {{IPA|/m/}} was still present in [[Old Mandarin]], but has merged with {{IPA|/n/}} in the modern dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} In some areas (especially the southwest) final {{IPA|/\u014b/}} has also merged with {{IPA|/n/}}. This is especially prevalent in the rhyme pairs ''-en/-eng'' {{IPA|/\u0259n \u0259\u014b/}} and ''-in/-ing'' {{IPA|/in i\u014b/}}. As a result, ''j\u012bn'' \"gold\" and ''j\u012bng'' \"capital\" merge in those dialects.\n\nThe Middle Chinese final stops have undergone a variety of developments in different Mandarin dialects (see [[#Tones|Tones]] below). In [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin|Lower Yangtze dialects]] and some north-western dialects they have merged as a final [[glottal stop]]. In other dialects they have been lost, with varying effects on the vowel.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=193}} As a result, Beijing Mandarin and Northeastern Mandarin underwent more vowel mergers than many other varieties of Mandarin.

Whereas Beijing dialect generally removes only a final {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/n/}} when adding the rhotic final ''-r'' {{IPA|/\u027b/}}, in the southwest the ''-r'' replaces nearly the entire rhyme.\n\n=== Tones ===\n{{Chinese tones}}\nIn general, no two Mandarin-speaking areas have exactly the same set of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] values, but most Mandarin-speaking areas have very similar tone ''distribution''.  For example, the dialects of [[Jinan]], [[Chengdu]], [[Xi'an]] and so on all have four tones that correspond quite well to the [[Beijing dialect]] tones of {{IPA|[\u02e5]}} (55), {{IPA|[\u02e7\u02e5]}} (35), {{IPA|[\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6]}} (214), and {{IPA|[\u02e5\u02e9]}} (51). The exception to this rule lies in the distribution of syllables formerly ending in a stop consonant, which are treated differently in different dialects of Mandarin.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013196}}\n\n[[Middle Chinese]] stops and affricates had a three-way distinction between tenuis, voiceless aspirate and voiced (or breathy voiced) consonants.\nIn Mandarin dialects the voicing is generally lost, yielding voiceless aspirates in syllables with a Middle Chinese level tone and non-aspirates in other syllables.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}\nOf the [[four tones]] of Middle Chinese, the level, rising and departing tones have also developed into four modern tones in a uniform way across Mandarin dialects; the Middle Chinese level tone has split into two registers, conditioned on voicing of the Middle Chinese initial, while rising tone syllables with voiced obstruent initials have shifted to the departing tone.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=194\u2013195}}\nThe following examples from the standard language illustrate the regular development common to Mandarin dialects (recall that pinyin ''d'' denotes a non-aspirate {{IPA|/t/}}, while ''t'' denotes an aspirate {{IPA|/t\u02b0/}}):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Reflexes of Middle Chinese initials and tones in modern Mandarin\n|-\n!

Baxter's transcription]]), are now pronounced ''j\u012b'', ''j\u01d0'' and ''j\u00ec'' respectively.  Older dictionaries such as ''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'' mark characters whose pronunciation formerly ended with a stop with a superscript 5; however, this tone number is more commonly used for syllables that always have a neutral tone (see below).\n\nIn Lower Yangtze dialects, a minority of Southwestern dialects (e.g. [[Minjiang dialect|Minjiang]]) and Jin Chinese (sometimes considered non-Mandarin), former final stops were not deleted entirely, but were reduced to a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/\u0294/}}.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}} (This includes the dialect of [[Nanjing]] on which the [[Postal Romanization]] was based; it transcribes the glottal stop as a trailing ''h''.) This development is shared with [[Wu Chinese]] and is thought to represent the pronunciation of [[Old Mandarin]]. In line with traditional Chinese phonology, dialects such as Lower Yangtze and Minjiang are thus said to have five tones instead of four.  However, modern linguistics considers these syllables as having no [[phonemic]] tone at all.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Reflexes of the Middle Chinese entering tone in Mandarin dialects<ref>Li Rong's 1985 article on Mandarin classification, quoted in {{harvp|Yan|2006|p=61}} and {{harvp|Kurpaska|2010|p=89}}.</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | subgroup\n! colspan=3 | Middle Chinese initial\n|-\n! voiceless\n! voiced [[sonorant]] \n! voiced obstruent\n|-\n| Beijing\n| rowspan=2 | 1,3,4\n| rowspan=4 | 4\n| rowspan=6 | 2\n|-\n| Northeastern\n|-\n| Jiao\u2013Liao\n| 3\n|-\n| Ji\u2013Lu\n| 1\n|-\n| Central Plains\n| colspan=2 | 1\n|-\n| Lan\u2013Yin\n| colspan=2 | 4\n|-\n| Southwestern\n| colspan=3 | 2\n|-\n| Lower Yangtze\n| colspan=3 | marked with final glottal stop (''r\u00f9'')\n|}\n\nAlthough the system of tones is common across Mandarin dialects, their realization as [[tone contour]]s varies widely:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=195\u2013196}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Phonetic realization of Mandarin tones in principal dialects\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Tone name\n| 1 (''y\u012bn p\u00edng'')\n| 2 (''y\u00e1ng p\u00edng'')\n| 3 (''sh\u01ceng'')\n| 4 (''q\u00f9'')\n| marked with<br />glottal stop (''r\u00f9'')\n|-\n| Beijing\n| [[Beijing]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6}} (214)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e9}} (51)\n|-\n| Northeastern\n| [[Harbin]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e8}} (52)\n|-\n| Jiao\u2013Liao\n| [[Yantai]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| ({{IPA|\u02e5}} (55))\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6}} (214)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Ji\u2013Lu\n| [[Tianjin]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e9\u02e9\u02e7}} (113)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n|-\n| [[Shijiazhuang]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e7}} (23)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | Central Plains\n| [[Zhengzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9\u02e8}} (312)\n|-\n| [[Luoyang]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e6}} (54)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n|-\n| [[Xi'an]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n|-\n| [[Tianshui]]\n| colspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|\u02e9\u02e7}} (13)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Lan\u2013Yin\n| [[Lanzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7}} (33)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n|-\n| [[Yinchuan]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| colspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e9\u02e7}} (13)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" | Southwestern\n| [[Chengdu]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n|-\n| [[Xichang]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7}} (33)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e8}} (52)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e5}} (45)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9\u0294}} (31)\n|-\n| [[Kunming]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8}} (212)\n|-\n| [[Wuhan]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n|-\n| [[Liuzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e6}} (44)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u02e7}} (53)\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e6}} (24)\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | Lower Yangtze\n| [[Yangzhou]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e9}} (31)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5\u0294}} (5)\n|-\n| [[Nantong]]\n| {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9}} (21)\n| {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e5}} (35)\n| {{IPA|\u02e5}} (55)\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u02e8}} (42), {{IPA|\u02e8\u02e9\u02e7}} (213)*\n| {{IPA|\u02e6\u0294}} (4), {{IPA|\u02e5\u0294}} (5)*\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Dialects in and around the Nantong area typically have many more than 4 tones, due to influence from the neighbouring [[Wu Chinese|Wu dialects]].\n\nMandarin dialects frequently employ neutral tones in the second syllables of words, creating syllables whose tone contour is so short and light that it is difficult or impossible to discriminate. These atonal syllables also occur in non-Mandarin dialects, but in many southern dialects the tones of all syllables are made clear.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=195}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThere are more polysyllabic words in Mandarin than in all other major varieties of Chinese except [[Shanghainese]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. This is partly because Mandarin has undergone many more sound changes than have southern varieties of Chinese, and has needed to deal with many more [[homophone]]s. New words have been formed by adding [[affix]]es such as ''lao-'' ({{lang|zh|\u8001}}), ''-zi'' ({{lang|zh|\u5b50}}), ''-(e)r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u513f}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5152}}), and ''-tou'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5934}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u982d}}), or by compounding, e.g. by combining two words of similar meaning as in ''c\u014dngm\u00e1ng'' ({{lang|zh|\u5306\u5fd9}}), made from elements meaning \"hurried\" and \"busy\".\nA distinctive feature of southwestern Mandarin is its frequent use of noun [[reduplication]], which is hardly used in Beijing. In [[Sichuan]], one hears ''b\u0101ob\u0101o'' ({{lang|zh|\u5305\u5305}}) \"handbag\" where Beijing uses ''b\u0101o'r'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u5305\u513f}}).\nThere are also a small number of words that have been polysyllabic since Old Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|h\u00fadi\u00e9}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u8774\u8776}}}}) \"butterfly\".\n\nThe singular [[pronoun]]s in Mandarin are {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u6211}}}}) \"I\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u01d0}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f60}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u59b3}}}}) \"you\", {{lang|zh-Latn|n\u00edn}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u60a8}}}}) \"you (formal)\", and {{lang|zh-Latn|t\u0101}} ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4ed6}}}}, {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5979}}}} or {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b83}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|{{linktext|\u7260}}}}) \"he/she/it\", with -{{lang|zh-Latn|men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5011}}) added for the plural. Further, there is a distinction between the plural first-person pronoun {{lang|zh-Latn|z\u00e1nmen}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u54b1\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u54b1\u5011}}), which is inclusive of the listener, and {{lang|zh-Latn|w\u01d2men}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u6211\u4eec}}}}/{{lang|zh-hant|\u6211\u5011}}), which may be exclusive of the listener. Dialects of Mandarin agree with each other quite consistently on these pronouns.  While the first and second person singular pronouns are cognate with forms in other varieties of Chinese, the rest of the pronominal system is a Mandarin innovation (e.g., [[Shanghainese]] has ''non'' {{lang|zh-Hans|{{linktext|\u4fac}}}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u5102}} \"you\" and ''yi'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f0a}}}} \"he/she\").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=182, 195\u2013196}}\n\nBecause of contact with Mongolian and Manchurian peoples, Mandarin (especially the Northeastern varieties) has some loanwords from these languages not present in other varieties of Chinese, such as {{lang|zh-Latn|[[hutong|h\u00fat\u00f2ng]]}} ({{lang|zh|\u80e1\u540c}}) \"alley\".

The least variation occurs in \"formal\" vocabulary\u2014terms dealing with science, law, or government.\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{see also|Chinese grammar}}\n\nChinese varieties of all periods have traditionally been considered prime examples of [[analytic language]]s, relying on word order and particles instead of [[inflection]] or [[affix]]es to provide grammatical information such as [[Grammatical person|person]], [[Grammatical number|number]], [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]], or [[Grammatical case|case]].\nAlthough modern varieties, including the Mandarin dialects, use a small number of particles in a similar fashion to suffixes, they are still strongly analytic.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}}\n\nThe basic word order of [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] is common across Chinese dialects, but there are variations in the order of the two objects of [[ditransitive]] sentences.\nIn northern dialects the indirect object precedes the direct object (as in English), for example in the Standard Chinese sentence:\n<blockquote>\n{| style=\"border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n| \u6211 || \u7ed9 || \u4f60 || \u4e00\u672c || \u4e66 \u3002\n|-\n| ''w\u01d2'' || ''g\u011bi'' || ''n\u01d0'' || ''y\u00ecb\u011bn'' || ''sh\u016b''.\n|-\n| I || give || you || a (one) || book.\n|}\n</blockquote>\nIn southern dialects, as well as many southwestern and Lower Yangtze dialects, the objects occur in the reverse order.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=162}}{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nMost varieties of Chinese use post-verbal particles to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], but the particles used vary.\nMost Mandarin dialects use the particle ''-le'' (\u4e86) to indicate the [[perfective aspect]] and ''-zhe'' (\u7740/\u8457) for the [[progressive aspect]].\nOther Chinese varieties tend to use different particles, e.g. Cantonese ''zo<sup>2</sup>'' \u5497 and ''gan<sup>2</sup>'' \u7d27/\u7dca respectively.\nThe experiential aspect particle ''-guo'' (\u8fc7/\u904e) is used more widely, except in Southern Min.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=90\u201393}}\n\nThe subordinative particle ''de'' (\u7684) is characteristic of Mandarin dialects.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=196}}\nSome southern dialects, and a few Lower Yangtze dialects, preserve an older pattern of subordination without a marking particle, while in others a [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] fulfils the role of the Mandarin particle.{{sfnp|Yue|2003|pp=113\u2013115}}\n\nEspecially in conversational Chinese, sentence-final [[particle (grammar)|particles]] alter the inherent meaning of a sentence. Like much vocabulary, particles can vary a great deal with regards to the locale. For example, the particle ''ma'' (\u561b), which is used in most northern dialects to denote obviousness or contention, is replaced by ''yo'' (\u54df) in southern usage.\n\nSome characters in Mandarin can be combined with others to indicate a particular meaning just like prefix and suffix in English. For example, the suffix -er which means the person who is doing the action, e.g. teacher, person who teaches. In Mandarin the character \u5e2b functions the same thing, it is combined with \u6559, which means teach, to form the word teacher.\n\nList of several common Chinese prefixes and suffixes:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
