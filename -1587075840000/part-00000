The uses for biomarkers of aging are ubiquitous and identifying a physical parameter of biological aging would allow humans to determine our true age, mortality, and morbidity.<ref name=\":0\" />  The change in the physical biomarker should be proportional to the change in the age of the species. Thus after establishing a biomarker of aging, humans would be able to dive into research on extending life spans and finding timelines for the arise of potential genetic diseases. \n\nOne of the applications of this finding would allow for identification of the biological age of a person. DNA methylation uses the structure of dna at different stages of life to determine an age. DNA methylation is the methylation of the cysteine in the CG or Cpg region. The hypermethylation of this region is associated with decreased transcriptional activity and the opposite for hypomethylation. In other words, the more \"tightly\" held the DNA region then the more stable and \"younger\" the species. Looking at DNA methylation's properties in tissues, it was found to be almost zero for embryonic tissues, it can be used to determine acceleration of age and the results can be reproduced in chimpanzee tissue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horvath|first=Steve|date=2013|title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015143/|journal=Genome Biology|volume=14|issue=10|pages=R115|doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115|issn=1465-6906|pmc=4015143|pmid=24138928}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Epigenetic clock]]\n*[[Biomarker (medicine)]]\n*[[Senescence]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111105213958/http://www.nia.nih.gov/NewsAndEvents/PressReleases/PR20020801Biomarkers.htm Biomarkers of Aging News Advisory] [[National Institute on Aging]]\n\n{{Longevity}}\n\n[[Category:Physiology]]\n[[Category:Senescence]]\n[[Category:Biomarkers]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Epigenetic mechanisms.png|thumb|580x580px|Chromosomes during Methylation]]\n'''Biomarkers of aging''' are [[biomarker]]s that could predict functional capacity at some later age better than chronological age.<ref  name=\"BakerGT\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Baker GT, Sprott RL | title = Biomarkers of aging | journal = Experimental Gerontology | volume = 23 | issue = 4\u20135 | pages = 223\u201339 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3058488 | doi = 10.1016/0531-5565(88)90025-3 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1258547 }}</ref> Stated another way, biomarkers of [[ageing|aging]] would give the true \"biological age\", which may be different from the chronological age.\n\nValidated biomarkers of aging would allow for testing interventions to [[life extension|extend lifespan]], because changes in the biomarkers would be observable throughout the lifespan of the organism.<ref name=\"BakerGT\" />  Although [[maximum lifespan]] would be a means of validating biomarkers of aging, it would not be a practical means for long-lived species such as humans because [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] would take far too much time.<ref>{{cite web | last = Harrison, Ph.D. | first = David E. | title = V.

The uses for biomarkers of aging are ubiquitous and identifying a physical parameter of biological aging would allow humans to determine our true age, mortality, and morbidity.<ref name=\":0\" />  The change in the physical biomarker should be proportional to the change in the age of the species. Thus after establishing a biomarker of aging, humans would be able to dive into research on extending life spans and finding timelines for the arise of potential genetic diseases. \n\nOne of the applications of this finding would allow for identification of the biological age of a person. DNA methylation uses the structure of dna at different stages of life to determine an age. DNA methylation is the methylation of the cysteine in the CG or Cpg region. The hypermethylation of this region is associated with decreased transcriptional activity and the opposite for hypomethylation. In other words, the more \"tightly\" held the DNA region then the more stable and \"younger\" the species. Looking at DNA methylation's properties in tissues, it was found to be almost zero for embryonic tissues, it can be used to determine acceleration of age and the results can be reproduced in chimpanzee tissue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horvath|first=Steve|date=2013|title=DNA methylation age of human tissues and cell types|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4015143/|journal=Genome Biology|volume=14|issue=10|pages=R115|doi=10.1186/gb-2013-14-10-r115|issn=1465-6906|pmc=4015143|pmid=24138928}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Epigenetic clock]]\n*[[Biomarker (medicine)]]\n*[[Senescence]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111105213958/http://www.nia.nih.gov/NewsAndEvents/PressReleases/PR20020801Biomarkers.htm Biomarkers of Aging News Advisory] [[National Institute on Aging]]\n\n{{Longevity}}\n\n[[Category:Physiology]]\n[[Category:Senescence]]\n[[Category:Biomarkers]]\n", "name_user": "Mikhail Ryazanov", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:MOS:CAPS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarkers_of_aging"}

He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a Be\u0161tije gig in 1969, [[\u017deljko Bebek]] invited eighteen-year-old Bregovi\u0107 to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.\n\n===Kodeksi===\n{{main|Kodeksi}}\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregovi\u0107 moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregovi\u0107, \u017deljko Bebek, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of \u017deljko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].\n\n===Jutro===\n{{main|Jutro}}\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Bregovi\u0107 enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]] left for London, so Bregovi\u0107 formed a band with Nuno Arnautali\u0107 called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Red\u017ei\u0107 soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] (\"White Button\").\n\n==Bijelo Dugme==\n[[File:Bregovic - portret - 1980.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in 1980 during Bijelo Dugme's new wave phase.]]\n{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}\nFrom 1974 until 1989, Bregovi\u0107 played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. From the get-go, he established himself as the band's undisputed leader as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media. \n\nOver the band's fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregovi\u0107, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence abroad. In late 1975, while recording their second album ''[[\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]'' in [[London]], they additionally recorded an [[English language]] track called \"Playing the Part\" (translated version of their [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] track \"\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\", itself an uncredited cover of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 track \"I Am the Dance of Ages\") that was packaged as a [[promo single]] for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion. \n\nBijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries as part of their respective [[cultural exchange]] programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the [[Polish People's Republic]] during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album ''[[Eto!

Assigned to a unit based in [[Ni\u0161]], he would spend the following year away from music, a period during which the band was on hiatus.\n\nDuring early 1982, the band played in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] as representatives of the city of [[Sarajevo]] and SFR Yugoslavia, the site of the upcoming [[Winter Olympics]], as part of an event bringing together past and future Winter Olympic hosts.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\">{{cite news|last=Vesi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277218-Tezga-u-Bugarskoj|title=Tezga u Bugarskoj|agency=''[[Ve\u010dernje novosti]]''|date=11 June 2005|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> On return to Yugoslavia from Innsbruck, the band had its equipment confiscated by the Yugoslav customs after [[customs declaration|undeclared]] musical equipment was found among their luggage.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> Some six months after that, during summer 1982, Bijelo Dugme went on a tour of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], playing 41 shows throughout the country from 15 July until 31 August 1982.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> Despite the tour in support of their latest studio album ''[[Do\u017eivjeti stotu]]'' being over for more than a year, and having no new material to promote, the band reportedly accepted the tour of Bulgaria in order to recover some of the funds lost after getting fined by the Yugoslav customs over the attempt to bring undeclared musical equipment into the country.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> \n\nIn summer 1985, following a decade of continuous rejection for tours of the [[Soviet Union]] by the cultural [[attach\u00e9]] of the Soviet embassy in Yugoslavia, Bijelo Dugme was finally scheduled to play in [[Moscow]] on 28 July 1985 at a huge open-air concert at [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] on the same bill with another Yugoslav act [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] as part of the [[12th World Festival of Youth and Students|12th]] [[World Festival of Youth and Students]].<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\">{{cite news|last=Vesi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277220-Skandal-u-Moskvi|title=Skandal u Moskvi|agency=''[[Ve\u010dernje novosti]]''|date=13 June 2005|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> Ahead of the show, Bregovi\u0107 decided to take the band to [[Budva]] for two weeks in order to practice for the Moscow appearance, an indication of the seriousness with which they approached this particular concert.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/> However, due to [[overcrowding]] and safety concerns, the event got interrupted around 10 pm after the Bajaga i Instruktori set before Bijelo Dugme even took the stage.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/> Instead at Gorky Park, Bijelo Dugme played the Dynamo Arena on the Moscow outskirts two days later at noon on 30 July 1985.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/>\n\n===Guest appearances, collaborations, and business venture===\nIn between Bijelo Dugme's studio releases and tours, in-demand Bregovi\u0107 worked on various side projects in Yugoslavia. These included releasing a [[Goran Bregovi\u0107 (album)|solo record]] in 1976 and composing two movie soundtracks \u2014 1977's ''Leptirov oblak'' and 1979's ''Li\u010dne stvari''. \n\nHe also tried his hand at music production, producing [[Idoli]]'s 1980 seven-inch single \"[[Malj\u010diki]]\" / \"[[Retko te vi\u0111am sa devojkama]]\" and co-producing, alongside [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Malo poja\u010daj radio]]'' in 1981. \n\nBregovi\u0107 furthermore made guest appearances on guitar on various studio recordings by different Yugoslav pop, folk, and rock acts: [[Neda Ukraden]]'s track \"Tri djevojke\" (together with Bijelo Dugme bandmates [[Vlado Pravdi\u0107]] and [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]]) off her 1976 album ''Ko me to od nekud doziva'', [[Hanka Paldum]]'s track \"Zbog tebe\" off her 1980 album ''[[\u010ce\u017enja (album)|\u010ce\u017enja]]'', \"Ne da/ne nego i/ili\" track by [[Kozmetika]] off their 1983 [[Kozmetika (album)|eponymous album]], Valentino's track \"Pazi na ritam\" off their 1983 debut album ''ValentiNo1'', [[Riblja \u010corba]]'s track \"Disko mi\u0161i\u0107\" off their 1985 album ''[[Istina]]'', [[Dino Merlin|Merlin]]'s 1986 album ''[[Te\u0161ko meni sa tobom (a jo\u0161 te\u017ee bez tebe)]]'', Mjese\u010dari track \"Gdje izlazi\u0161 ovih dana\" off their 1988 album ''One \u0161etaju od 1 do 2'', and [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]] track \"Tiho, tiho\" off their 1990 album ''Nek te Bog \u010duva za mene''.\n\nDuring his time leading Bijelo Dugme, Bregovi\u0107 also became involved in the financial and organizational side of the [[music industry|music business]]. In 1984, dissatisfied with their respective financial terms at the state-owned [[Jugoton]] label, Bijelo Dugme bandleader Bregovi\u0107 and one of Yugoslavia's biggest pop stars Zdravko \u010coli\u0107 got together to establish their own music label Kamarad, which, via a deal with state-owned [[Diskoton]] and later another newly-established private label [[Komuna (company)|Komuna]], would end up co-releasing all of Bijelo Dugme's subsequent studio albums including three of \u010coli\u0107's studio albums from 1984 until 1990.<ref name=\"kamarad\">{{cite news|last=Predi\u0107|first=Zoran|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2014/11/kako-su-zbog-kamarada-zdravka-colica-i.html|title=\u010coli\u0107 i Bregovi\u0107 protiv Jugotona|agency=''RTV revija''|date=November 1984|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> Considered an unusual move at the time in a socialist country with nearly across-the-board public ownership that had just recently began allowing certain modes of private entrepreneurship, starting a privately-owned record label, combined with Bregovi\u0107's and \u010coli\u0107's high public profile in Yugoslavia, got them both a lot of additional attention in the country's press.

His first project was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award went to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregovi\u0107 composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki \u2013 Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''. In the same year, Bregovi\u0107 recorded an album called ''[[Kayah i Bregovi\u0107]]'' (Kayah and Bregovi\u0107) with popular Polish singer [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]] which sold over 700,000 copies in [[Poland]] (seven times platinum record).\n\nIn 2001, he recorded another album with another Polish singer, [[Krzysztof Krawczyk (singer)|Krzysztof Krawczyk]], titled \"Daj mi drugie \u017cycie\" (\"Give Me Second Life\").\n\nIn 2005, Bregovi\u0107 took part in three large farewell concerts of Bijelo Dugme.\n\nA number of works created by Bregovi\u0107 can be heard on the soundtrack to the 2006 film ''[[Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan]], most notably \"\u0110ur\u0111evdan\". The film itself actually features more Bregovi\u0107 samples than the soundtrack. \n\nTwo musical numbers by Bregovi\u0107, \"Ne Siam Kurve Tuke Sijam Prostitutke,\" and \"Gas, Gas\" were featured in the soundtrack of the 2012 Brazilian telenovela, ''[[Salve Jorge]]'', on the television network [[Rede Globo]].<ref name=\"Salve Jorge Tracklist\">{{cite web|title=Salve Jorge (Trilha Sonora da Novela) [|url=http://musica.com.br/trilhas-sonoras/salve-jorge.html|publisher=Musica.com.br|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Wedding and Funeral Orchestra===\n[[Image:Goran Bregovic in Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in concert in [[Tbilisi]], Georgia on 3 October 2007.]]\nFor many years Bregovi\u0107 performed with a large ensemble of musicians: a brass band, bagpipes, a string ensemble, a tuxedo-clad all-male choir from [[Belgrade]], women wearing traditional Bulgarian costumes, and [[Romani people|Roma]] singers make up his 40-piece band and orchestra.\n\nSince 1998, and until about 2012, Bregovi\u0107 has been performing his music mainly in the form of concerts all over the world with his Wedding and Funeral Orchestra.

After Bijelo Dugme split up, he started composing film scores. Among his better known film scores are three of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s films (''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'', ''[[Arizona Dream]]'', and ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]''). For Time of the Gypsies, Bregovi\u0107 won a [[Golden Arena for Best Film Music|Golden Arena Award]] at the [[Pula Film Festival]] in 1990, among other awards. He had also composed for the [[Academy Award]]-nominated film ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|La Reine Margot]]'' and the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]]-entered film ''[[The Serpent's Kiss]]''.\n\nBregovi\u0107, during his five-decade long career, has composed for critically acclaimed singers, including [[Sezen Aksu]], [[Kayah (singer)|Kayah]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[\u0160aban Bajramovi\u0107]], [[George Dalaras]] and [[Ces\u00e1ria \u00c9vora]].\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Sarajevo]], [[People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|PR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]] to a [[Croats|Croat]] father Franjo Bregovi\u0107 and [[Serbs|Serb]] mother Borka Peri\u0161i\u0107,<ref>[http://www.yurope.com/nasa-borba/arhiva/Maj97/1805/1805_15.HTM Strogo kontrolisano disidentstvo];''Na\u0161a Borba'', 18 May 1997</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.goranbregovic.rs/biography/|title=Goran Bregovic|website=www.goranbregovic.rs|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Goran grew up with two younger siblings \u2014 sister Dajana and brother Predrag. Their father was from the Croatian region of [[Zagorje]], specifically [[Sveti Petar \u010cvrstec]] village near [[Kri\u017eevci, Croatia|Kri\u017eevci]], while their mother was born in [[Virovitica]] to parents that had shortly before her birth arrived in the nearby village of [[\u010cemernica, Croatia|\u010cemernica]], settling there from the village of [[Kazanci]] near [[Gacko]] in eastern [[Herzegovina]].

In later interviews, he mentioned his father's alcoholism as the reason for the breakdown of their marriage.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Soon after the split, his father moved to [[Livno]], taking Goran's younger brother Predrag with him while Goran remained living with his mother in Sarajevo, visiting his father and brother every summer in Livno.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/> Their father soon retired and eventually moved back to his home village in Zagorje while Goran's brother Predrag later moved back to Sarajevo for university studies.<ref name=\"vreme-dec-2012\"/>\n\nGoran played violin in a [[music school]]. However, deemed untalented, he was thrown out during second grade. His musical education was thus reduced to what his friend taught him until Goran's mother bought him his first guitar in his early teens. Bregovi\u0107 wanted to enroll in a fine arts high school, but his aunt told his mother that it was supposedly full of homosexuals, which precipitated his mother's decision to send him to a technical (traffic) school. As a compromise for not getting his way, she allowed him to grow his hair long.\n\n==Early career==\nUpon entering high school, teenage Bregovi\u0107 joined the school band Izohipse where he began on bass guitar. Soon, however, he was kicked out of that school too (this time for misbehavior \u2013 he crashed into a school-owned [[Mercedes-Benz]]). Bregovi\u0107 then entered grammar school and its school band Be\u0161tije (again as a bass guitar player). When he was 16, his mother left him and moved to the coast, meaning that other than having a few relatives to rely on, he mostly had to take care of himself. He did that by playing [[folk music]] in a [[kafana]] in [[Konjic]], working on construction sites, and selling newspapers.\n\nSpotting him at a Be\u0161tije gig in 1969, [[\u017deljko Bebek]] invited eighteen-year-old Bregovi\u0107 to play bass guitar in his band [[Kodeksi]], which Goran gladly accepted.\n\n===Kodeksi===\n{{main|Kodeksi}}\nEventually, Kodeksi shifted setup so Bregovi\u0107 moved from bass to lead guitar, resulting in Kodeksi having the following line-up during summer 1970: Goran Bregovi\u0107, \u017deljko Bebek, [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]] and [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]]. All of them would eventually become members of [[Bijelo Dugme]] at some point in the future. At the time, they were largely influenced by [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Black Sabbath]]. During the fall of 1970, this resulted in the departure of \u017deljko Bebek, who (both as rhythm guitar player and singer) got phased out of the band. At the end of the year, Goran's mother and Zoran's brother arrived in [[Naples]] and took them back to [[Sarajevo]].\n\n===Jutro===\n{{main|Jutro}}\nThen, in the autumn of 1971, Bregovi\u0107 enrolled at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, studying philosophy and sociology. He soon quit, however. At the same time, [[Mili\u0107 Vuka\u0161inovi\u0107]] left for London, so Bregovi\u0107 formed a band with Nuno Arnautali\u0107 called [[Jutro]] (Morning), which Red\u017ei\u0107 soon joined as well. Over the next few years, the band changed lineups frequently, and on 1 January 1974 modified its name to [[Bijelo Dugme]] (\"White Button\").\n\n==Bijelo Dugme==\n[[File:Bregovic - portret - 1980.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bregovi\u0107 in 1980 during Bijelo Dugme's new wave phase.]]\n{{main|Bijelo Dugme}}\nFrom 1974 until 1989, Bregovi\u0107 played lead guitar and was the main creative force behind [[Bijelo Dugme]] (''White Button''). For years they stood as one of the most popular bands in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. From the get-go, he established himself as the band's undisputed leader as well as its public face in the Yugoslav print and electronic media. \n\nOver the band's fifteen-year run, in addition to their enormous popularity at home, led by Bregovi\u0107, Bijelo Dugme made several attempts at expanding their prominence abroad. In late 1975, while recording their second album ''[[\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu]]'' in [[London]], they additionally recorded an [[English language]] track called \"Playing the Part\" (translated version of their [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] track \"\u0160ta bi dao da si na mom mjestu\", itself an uncredited cover of [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s 1972 track \"I Am the Dance of Ages\") that was packaged as a [[promo single]] for English music journalists. Never officially released for mass distribution, the track quickly fell into oblivion. \n\nBijelo Dugme had somewhat better luck with touring abroad, which almost entirely took place in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries as part of their respective [[cultural exchange]] programs with SFR Yugoslavia. The band briefly toured the [[Polish People's Republic]] during April 1977, a 9-concert leg as part of the tour in support of their third album ''[[Eto!

Assigned to a unit based in [[Ni\u0161]], he would spend the following year away from music, a period during which the band was on hiatus.\n\nDuring early 1982, the band played in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] as representatives of the city of [[Sarajevo]] and SFR Yugoslavia, the site of the upcoming [[Winter Olympics]], as part of an event bringing together past and future Winter Olympic hosts.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\">{{cite news|last=Vesi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277218-Tezga-u-Bugarskoj|title=Tezga u Bugarskoj|agency=''[[Ve\u010dernje novosti]]''|date=11 June 2005|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> On return to Yugoslavia from Innsbruck, the band had its equipment confiscated by the Yugoslav customs after [[customs declaration|undeclared]] musical equipment was found among their luggage.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> Some six months after that, during summer 1982, Bijelo Dugme went on a tour of the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], playing 41 shows throughout the country from 15 July until 31 August 1982.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> Despite the tour in support of their latest studio album ''[[Do\u017eivjeti stotu]]'' being over for more than a year, and having no new material to promote, the band reportedly accepted the tour of Bulgaria in order to recover some of the funds lost after getting fined by the Yugoslav customs over the attempt to bring undeclared musical equipment into the country.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-insbruk-i-bugarska-jun-2005\"/> \n\nIn summer 1985, following a decade of continuous rejection for tours of the [[Soviet Union]] by the cultural [[attach\u00e9]] of the Soviet embassy in Yugoslavia, Bijelo Dugme was finally scheduled to play in [[Moscow]] on 28 July 1985 at a huge open-air concert at [[Gorky Park (Moscow)|Gorky Park]] on the same bill with another Yugoslav act [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] as part of the [[12th World Festival of Youth and Students|12th]] [[World Festival of Youth and Students]].<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\">{{cite news|last=Vesi\u0107|first=Du\u0161an|url=https://www.novosti.rs/dodatni_sadrzaj/clanci.119.html:277220-Skandal-u-Moskvi|title=Skandal u Moskvi|agency=''[[Ve\u010dernje novosti]]''|date=13 June 2005|accessdate=26 December 2019}}</ref> Ahead of the show, Bregovi\u0107 decided to take the band to [[Budva]] for two weeks in order to practice for the Moscow appearance, an indication of the seriousness with which they approached this particular concert.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/> However, due to [[overcrowding]] and safety concerns, the event got interrupted around 10 pm after the Bajaga i Instruktori set before Bijelo Dugme even took the stage.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/> Instead at Gorky Park, Bijelo Dugme played the Dynamo Arena on the Moscow outskirts two days later at noon on 30 July 1985.<ref name=\"novosti-dugme-jun-2005\"/>\n\n===Guest appearances, collaborations, and business venture===\nIn between Bijelo Dugme's studio releases and tours, in-demand Bregovi\u0107 worked on various side projects in Yugoslavia. These included releasing a [[Goran Bregovi\u0107 (album)|solo record]] in 1976 and composing two movie soundtracks \u2014 1977's ''Leptirov oblak'' and 1979's ''Li\u010dne stvari''. \n\nHe also tried his hand at music production, producing [[Idoli]]'s 1980 seven-inch single \"[[Malj\u010diki]]\" / \"[[Retko te vi\u0111am sa devojkama]]\" and co-producing, alongside [[Kornelije Kova\u010d]], [[Zdravko \u010coli\u0107]]'s fourth studio album ''[[Malo poja\u010daj radio]]'' in 1981. \n\nBregovi\u0107 furthermore made guest appearances on guitar on various studio recordings by different Yugoslav pop, folk, and rock acts: [[Neda Ukraden]]'s track \"Tri djevojke\" (together with Bijelo Dugme bandmates [[Vlado Pravdi\u0107]] and [[Zoran Red\u017ei\u0107]]) off her 1976 album ''Ko me to od nekud doziva'', [[Hanka Paldum]]'s track \"Zbog tebe\" off her 1980 album ''[[\u010ce\u017enja (album)|\u010ce\u017enja]]'', \"Ne da/ne nego i/ili\" track by [[Kozmetika]] off their 1983 [[Kozmetika (album)|eponymous album]], Valentino's track \"Pazi na ritam\" off their 1983 debut album ''ValentiNo1'', [[Riblja \u010corba]]'s track \"Disko mi\u0161i\u0107\" off their 1985 album ''[[Istina]]'', [[Dino Merlin|Merlin]]'s 1986 album ''[[Te\u0161ko meni sa tobom (a jo\u0161 te\u017ee bez tebe)]]'', Mjese\u010dari track \"Gdje izlazi\u0161 ovih dana\" off their 1988 album ''One \u0161etaju od 1 do 2'', and [[Piloti (band)|Piloti]] track \"Tiho, tiho\" off their 1990 album ''Nek te Bog \u010duva za mene''.\n\nDuring his time leading Bijelo Dugme, Bregovi\u0107 also became involved in the financial and organizational side of the [[music industry|music business]]. In 1984, dissatisfied with their respective financial terms at the state-owned [[Jugoton]] label, Bijelo Dugme bandleader Bregovi\u0107 and one of Yugoslavia's biggest pop stars Zdravko \u010coli\u0107 got together to establish their own music label Kamarad, which, via a deal with state-owned [[Diskoton]] and later another newly-established private label [[Komuna (company)|Komuna]], would end up co-releasing all of Bijelo Dugme's subsequent studio albums including three of \u010coli\u0107's studio albums from 1984 until 1990.<ref name=\"kamarad\">{{cite news|last=Predi\u0107|first=Zoran|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2014/11/kako-su-zbog-kamarada-zdravka-colica-i.html|title=\u010coli\u0107 i Bregovi\u0107 protiv Jugotona|agency=''RTV revija''|date=November 1984|accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref> Considered an unusual move at the time in a socialist country with nearly across-the-board public ownership that had just recently began allowing certain modes of private entrepreneurship, starting a privately-owned record label, combined with Bregovi\u0107's and \u010coli\u0107's high public profile in Yugoslavia, got them both a lot of additional attention in the country's press.

The label would also co-release many of Dugme's and \u010coli\u0107's later 'best of' compilations in addition to Bregovi\u0107's movie soundtrack albums as well as [[Vesna Zmijanac]]'s 1992 album ''Ako me umiri\u0161 sad''.\n\n==Solo career==\n[[Image:Goran Bregovic 2011.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Bregovi\u0107 performing at [[Carnegie Hall]] in New York City on 19 October 2011.]]\nAt the time Bijelo Dugme was falling apart, Goran entered the world of [[Film score|film music]]. His first project was [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1989). This turned out to be a great success (both the film and the soundtrack). Goran and Emir's collaboration continued, and Goran composed music (which was performed by [[Iggy Pop]]) for Emir's next film ''[[Arizona Dream]]'' (1993). During the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Goran lived in Paris, but he also lived in Belgrade. His next major project, music for [[Patrice Ch\u00e9reau]]'s ''[[La Reine Margot (1994 film)|Queen Margot]]'' was a great success as well, and as a result, the film won two awards on the 1994 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. The next year's [[Palme d'Or|Golden Palm]] award went to ''[[Underground (1995 film)|Underground]]'', for which Goran Bregovi\u0107 composed the music.\n\nIn 1997, he worked with Turkish singer [[Sezen Aksu]] on her album ''D\u00fc\u011f\u00fcn ve Cenaze'' (''Wedding and Funeral''). After that album, he continued making composite albums with other musicians that were based on his music and singers' lyrics.\n\nHe made an album with [[George Dalaras]] in 1999 named ''[[Thessaloniki \u2013 Yannena with Two Canvas Shoes]]''.

NSS said the award was given as the Indian agency successfully executed a Mars mission in its first attempt; and the spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with a high apoapsis where, with its high resolution camera, it is taking full-disk colour imagery of Mars. Very few full disk images have ever been taken in the past, mostly on approach to the planet, as most imaging is done looking straight down in mapping mode. These images will aid planetary scientists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.nss.org/?p=4622 |title=Indian Space Research Organization Mars Orbiter Programme Team Wins National Space Society's Space
