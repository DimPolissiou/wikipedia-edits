The series ran for five seasons and 100 episodes from May 29, 2006, to November 4, 2010, on PBS, with 30 contestants in that time. Although a sixth season was planned, with auditions taking place in January 2010, [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] announced on June 14, 2010, that the series would end due to lack of funding. In June 2008, the series received its first [[Emmy]] for Best Original Song for its theme. It previously aired reruns on the 24 hour PBS Kids Channel.\n\n==Production==\n''Fetch!'' was produced at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Studios]] in Boston. Seasons were filmed about a year before they aired. Season four was the first season to be filmed in High Definition (HD) in 2009. Due to a lack of funding, WGBH announced that ''Fetch!'' would be canceled at the end of its fifth season, even though casting had been completed.\n\nThe challenges were filmed mostly in Boston (as well as other areas in the US State of [[Massachusetts]]) and various other parts of the [[United States Of America|USA]], depending on the challenges, during summertime when the children are out of school. The challenges, which were out on the field, are cut [[documentary]]-style, very similar to network reality TV shows.\n\nAfter the FETCHers finished filming the challenges, contestants acted in-studio, with the voice of Ruff. [[Jim Conroy]] traveled to [[Boston]] from [[New York City|New York]] for the two weeks they spent shooting in the studio. The fourth camera simply captured Conroy doing his lines as Ruff in the audio booth. The kids heard him in the studio and he heard their reactions in his headphones. Ruff's lines were the only lines that were scripted out, though he would sometimes ad-lib an answer to a question or comment from a FETCHer. Once the lines were recorded, the show went into editing, where the challenges were sorted into the show order.\n\nThen they were sent to Jim Conroy in New York City, to voice dialog for Ruff's animation. Once that was complete, it was sent back to WGBH where editors placed audio clips of the animated characters. Once all of this was done, the episode was sent to [[Global Mechanic]] to animate the show. One out of the four editors had an off-set four-week system in place where one of them was ready to send a cut of a new episode to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada every Friday. This process took about six months to complete one season of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |title=Ruff |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |website=Newen Gland Film Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406014224/http://newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |archivedate=April 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Studio G set==\nStudio G is the studio for ''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman''. Three segments of the show take place in the studio{{spaced ndash}}the intro, halftime quiz show, and \"Triumph Tally\". In season 1, the contestants recognized that Studio G looked like a [[Garage (residential)|garage]] and asked Ruff why, which in the episode, really annoyed Ruff and told them it was not a garage and that it was \"Studio G\". Over the course of the show's five seasons, the studio changed. For season 1 and 2, the studio was relatively unaltered, but sizable changes were made to the studio for season 3. The television through which the contestants communicate with Ruff was changed to a more current flat screen TV, and Ruff's owner parked her car, a dusty [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]], in the studio. A flamingo and trees as well as a \"Studio G\" sign and a \"wall of fame\" displaying past Fetch! contestant season winners were added to the studio in season 2. In season 4, a new remote control mailbox was placed on the TV Screen, which popped out when a challenge was in the mailbox. Season 5's major renovation occurred during the season finale{{spaced ndash}}it became the Go Get It! studio (Studio P), and was a remodeled version of the Studio G set with new carpeting and pink furniture.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman characters}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nFetch! is a reality-based game show where young contestants (ages 10-14) take on various challenges to gain points.  During these challenges, the contestants must complete a variety of tasks assigned to them ahead of time (and on the fly) by Ruff and surrogates, depending on the situation. There is also an educational component, as contestants often must learn something (i.e. [[Astronomy]], [[Carpentry]], [[Engineering]], [[Food Science]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], etc.) in order to complete the task.\n\nNot all contestants leave the studio each episode to complete tasks. \"As determined by the Fetch 3000\"(according to Ruff), the contestants who remain behind in the studio participate in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\", in which Ruff asks them up to ten questions with the limited time based on the activities of the contestants out on challenges. Out on challenges, contestants will have the potential to earn up to 100 points. The contestants in the studio will have a chance to win a maximum of 50 in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\". The show has a ''Fetch Fairness Guarantee''; that every contestant will \"compete for the same number of points\" through thirteen challenges and six \"Half-time Quiz Shows\" before the final episode. Additionally, Ruff assigns \"Bone-us\" points (usually 5 or 10, but sometimes 15 or 20) to the stand-out contestants. On rare occasions, there is the possibility to earn more than 100 points (outside of any bonuses). The record for most points earned in one episode was 125, by Brian, Noah, and Khalil in episode 5, season 1. In Season 4, contestants are able to have 1/2 points (i.e. 515{{frac|1|2}} points). At the end of the season, a final point tally is conducted, with the winner of the tally being declared winner of that season to win the \"Grand Prize\".\n\nPrizes are not always desirable, and sometimes the prize holder winds up with a \"[[booby prize]]\"; for example, in \"Good Dancing and Bad Breath\", Anna and Brian had to dance a [[waltz]] in the studio. During the first season, the contestant had the choice of keeping the prize or giving it to a fellow contestant. During the remaining four seasons, there are two unknown prizes between which the winner chooses. The chosen prize may be \"mailed\" to the mailbox in Studio G, although occasionally large prizes are hidden elsewhere on the set. In one episode of Season 2, Rosario gave his prize to Nina, and in another, he gave it to Madi. In a season 4 episode, Sterling returned his prize to the mailbox.\n\n===Cultural references and guest stars===\n''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman'' contains a considerable number of direct cultural references for a [[PBS Kids]] show, which makes up a large chunk of the series's comedic style. In the season 2 premiere, when Nina does a rather sloppy job at making chocolate candy, Ruff remarks that it is the \"[[Jackson Pollock]] candy.\" In the following episode, Ruff mentions that he likes [[REO Speedwagon]]. In Season 3, Episode 13, when Sam and Harsha throw sacks in a pail, Ruff makes a comment saying, \"I feel like Shaq in the free throw line\", making a reference to [[Shaquille O' Neal]]. In season 4, Episode 14, when Talia found a [[horseshoe crab]] while working on a shrimp boat, a horrified Ruff exclaimed, \"Looks like [[Darth Vader]]'s face with a billion legs coming out of it!\" In Episode 17 of the same season, Talia was starstruck when she discovered that she was holding [[Roger Federer]]'s [[tennis racket]]. In Episode 15 of Season 2, when the scuba instructors arrived at the beach, Ruff claimed that they were \"faster than [[Batman]]\" and that he \"hoped [Batman] was watching the show\". When Rubye and Marc in Season 5 learned skydiving signs, Ruff remarked that one of the signs looked like \"one of [[Beyonc\u00e9]]'s dance moves.\" In Season 2, Episode 4, when Rosario voiced Ruff for the first time, Ruff remarked: \"Is that Ruff Ruffman or [[Marge Simpson]]?\" In Season 4, Episode 16, when Ruff called Isaac, who was dressed as an old lady, he accidentally called him ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' and then corrects himself and says Mrs. Issacson. In Season 5, Episode 18, when Joe explained to the FETCHers, he told Michelle about the book she read. Michelle said: \"I believe that was [[Green Eggs and Ham]].\"\n\nThe show also had some guest stars. In season 1, [[Aaron Carter]] and the contestants all appeared in his new music video. In season 2, episode 2, Ruff sends Madi and Willie to meet the [[Blue Man Group]]. In Season 3, Episode 4, Sam meets Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]. In season 5, episode 4, Crush the [[sea turtle]] from the movie ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' makes an appearance via Ruff's Fetch 3000. [[Andrew Stanton]] reprises his role as Crush here. In episode 2 of season 4, the host of Design Squad [[Nathan Ball]] appeared in a pole vault challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|title = FETCH! .

On his Facebook page, he said, \"It's such an impossible task going up against [[Sesame Street]], [[Cyberchase]], and [[The Electric Company (2009 TV series)|The Electric Company]]. So you have to consider the nomination as a win. Can't complain. PBS gave us 100 episodes and 5 seasons.

The series ran for five seasons and 100 episodes from May 29, 2006, to November 4, 2010, on PBS, with 30 contestants in that time. Although a sixth season was planned, with auditions taking place in January 2010, [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] announced on June 14, 2010, that the series would end due to lack of funding. In June 2008, the series received its first [[Emmy]] for Best Original Song for its theme. It previously aired reruns on the 24 hour PBS Kids Channel.\n\n==Production==\n''Fetch!'' was produced at [[WGBH-TV|WGBH Studios]] in Boston. Seasons were filmed about a year before they aired. Season four was the first season to be filmed in High Definition (HD) in 2009. Due to a lack of funding, WGBH announced that ''Fetch!'' would be canceled at the end of its fifth season, even though casting had been completed.\n\nThe challenges were filmed mostly in Boston (as well as other areas in the US State of [[Massachusetts]]) and various other parts of the [[United States Of America|USA]], depending on the challenges, during summertime when the children are out of school. The challenges, which were out on the field, are cut [[documentary]]-style, very similar to network reality TV shows.\n\nAfter the FETCHers finished filming the challenges, contestants acted in-studio, with the voice of Ruff. [[Jim Conroy]] traveled to [[Boston]] from [[New York City|New York]] for the two weeks they spent shooting in the studio. The fourth camera simply captured Conroy doing his lines as Ruff in the audio booth. The kids heard him in the studio and he heard their reactions in his headphones. Ruff's lines were the only lines that were scripted out, though he would sometimes ad-lib an answer to a question or comment from a FETCHer. Once the lines were recorded, the show went into editing, where the challenges were sorted into the show order.\n\nThen they were sent to Jim Conroy in New York City, to voice dialog for Ruff's animation. Once that was complete, it was sent back to WGBH where editors placed audio clips of the animated characters. Once all of this was done, the episode was sent to [[Global Mechanic]] to animate the show. One out of the four editors had an off-set four-week system in place where one of them was ready to send a cut of a new episode to [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada every Friday. This process took about six months to complete one season of the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |title=Ruff |accessdate=October 24, 2015 |website=Newen Gland Film Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406014224/http://newenglandfilm.com/magazine/2009/10/ruff |archivedate=April 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Studio G set==\nStudio G is the studio for ''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman''. Three segments of the show take place in the studio{{spaced ndash}}the intro, halftime quiz show, and \"Triumph Tally\". In season 1, the contestants recognized that Studio G looked like a [[Garage (residential)|garage]] and asked Ruff why, which in the episode, really annoyed Ruff and told them it was not a garage and that it was \"Studio G\". Over the course of the show's five seasons, the studio changed. For season 1 and 2, the studio was relatively unaltered, but sizable changes were made to the studio for season 3. The television through which the contestants communicate with Ruff was changed to a more current flat screen TV, and Ruff's owner parked her car, a dusty [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia]], in the studio. A flamingo and trees as well as a \"Studio G\" sign and a \"wall of fame\" displaying past Fetch! contestant season winners were added to the studio in season 2. In season 4, a new remote control mailbox was placed on the TV Screen, which popped out when a challenge was in the mailbox. Season 5's major renovation occurred during the season finale{{spaced ndash}}it became the Go Get It! studio (Studio P), and was a remodeled version of the Studio G set with new carpeting and pink furniture.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman characters}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nFetch! is a reality-based game show where young contestants (ages 10-14) take on various challenges to gain points.  During these challenges, the contestants must complete a variety of tasks assigned to them ahead of time (and on the fly) by Ruff and surrogates, depending on the situation. There is also an educational component, as contestants often must learn something (i.e. [[Astronomy]], [[Carpentry]], [[Engineering]], [[Food Science]], [[Biology]], [[Physics]], [[Mathematics]], etc.) in order to complete the task.\n\nNot all contestants leave the studio each episode to complete tasks. \"As determined by the Fetch 3000\"(according to Ruff), the contestants who remain behind in the studio participate in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\", in which Ruff asks them up to ten questions with the limited time based on the activities of the contestants out on challenges. Out on challenges, contestants will have the potential to earn up to 100 points. The contestants in the studio will have a chance to win a maximum of 50 in the \"Half-Time Quiz Show\". The show has a ''Fetch Fairness Guarantee''; that every contestant will \"compete for the same number of points\" through thirteen challenges and six \"Half-time Quiz Shows\" before the final episode. Additionally, Ruff assigns \"Bone-us\" points (usually 5 or 10, but sometimes 15 or 20) to the stand-out contestants. On rare occasions, there is the possibility to earn more than 100 points (outside of any bonuses). The record for most points earned in one episode was 125, by Brian, Noah, and Khalil in episode 5, season 1. In Season 4, contestants are able to have 1/2 points (i.e. 515{{frac|1|2}} points). At the end of the season, a final point tally is conducted, with the winner of the tally being declared winner of that season to win the \"Grand Prize\".\n\nPrizes are not always desirable, and sometimes the prize holder winds up with a \"[[booby prize]]\"; for example, in \"Good Dancing and Bad Breath\", Anna and Brian had to dance a [[waltz]] in the studio. During the first season, the contestant had the choice of keeping the prize or giving it to a fellow contestant. During the remaining four seasons, there are two unknown prizes between which the winner chooses. The chosen prize may be \"mailed\" to the mailbox in Studio G, although occasionally large prizes are hidden elsewhere on the set. In one episode of Season 2, Rosario gave his prize to Nina, and in another, he gave it to Madi. In a season 4 episode, Sterling returned his prize to the mailbox.\n\n===Cultural references and guest stars===\n''Fetch! with Ruff Ruffman'' contains a considerable number of direct cultural references for a [[PBS Kids]] show, which makes up a large chunk of the series's comedic style. In the season 2 premiere, when Nina does a rather sloppy job at making chocolate candy, Ruff remarks that it is the \"[[Jackson Pollock]] candy.\" In the following episode, Ruff mentions that he likes [[REO Speedwagon]]. In Season 3, Episode 13, when Sam and Harsha throw sacks in a pail, Ruff makes a comment saying, \"I feel like Shaq in the free throw line\", making a reference to [[Shaquille O' Neal]]. In season 4, Episode 14, when Talia found a [[horseshoe crab]] while working on a shrimp boat, a horrified Ruff exclaimed, \"Looks like [[Darth Vader]]'s face with a billion legs coming out of it!\" In Episode 17 of the same season, Talia was starstruck when she discovered that she was holding [[Roger Federer]]'s [[tennis racket]]. In Episode 15 of Season 2, when the scuba instructors arrived at the beach, Ruff claimed that they were \"faster than [[Batman]]\" and that he \"hoped [Batman] was watching the show\". When Rubye and Marc in Season 5 learned skydiving signs, Ruff remarked that one of the signs looked like \"one of [[Beyonc\u00e9]]'s dance moves.\" In Season 2, Episode 4, when Rosario voiced Ruff for the first time, Ruff remarked: \"Is that Ruff Ruffman or [[Marge Simpson]]?\" In Season 4, Episode 16, when Ruff called Isaac, who was dressed as an old lady, he accidentally called him ''[[Mrs. Doubtfire]]'' and then corrects himself and says Mrs. Issacson. In Season 5, Episode 18, when Joe explained to the FETCHers, he told Michelle about the book she read. Michelle said: \"I believe that was [[Green Eggs and Ham]].\"\n\nThe show also had some guest stars. In season 1, [[Aaron Carter]] and the contestants all appeared in his new music video. In season 2, episode 2, Ruff sends Madi and Willie to meet the [[Blue Man Group]]. In Season 3, Episode 4, Sam meets Senator [[Edward Kennedy]]. In season 5, episode 4, Crush the [[sea turtle]] from the movie ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' makes an appearance via Ruff's Fetch 3000. [[Andrew Stanton]] reprises his role as Crush here. In episode 2 of season 4, the host of Design Squad [[Nathan Ball]] appeared in a pole vault challenge.<ref>{{Cite web|title = FETCH! .

Word 3.0 included numerous internal enhancements and new features, including the first implementation of the [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF) specification, but was plagued with bugs. Within a few months, Word 3.0 was superseded by a more stable Word 3.01, which was mailed free to all registered users of 3.0.<ref name=\"lowendmac_history\"/> After MacWrite Pro was discontinued in the mid-1990s, Word for Mac OS never had any serious rivals.

Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same code base. It was abandoned when it was determined that it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added at the same time without a rewrite. Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.<ref name=\"msdn_macword6\"/>\n\nWith the release of Word 6.0 in 1993, Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms, this time across DOS, Mac OS, and Windows (this was the last version of Word for DOS). It introduced AutoCorrect, which automatically fixed certain typing errors, and AutoFormat, which could reformat many parts of a document at once. While the Windows version received favorable reviews (e.g., from ''InfoWorld''<ref name=\"infoworld_word6\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66 | title=War of the Words | work=InfoWorld | date=February 7, 1994 | pages=66\u201379 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref>), the Mac OS version was widely derided.

There was no version 2 on the Mac, but version 3 came out on January 31, 1987, as described above. Word 4.0 came out on November 6, 1990, and added automatic linking with Excel, the ability to flow text around graphics and a WYSIWYG page view editing mode.\n\nWord 5.1 for Mac, released in 1992 ran on the original 68000 CPU and was the last to be specifically designed as a Macintosh application. The later Word 6 was a Windows port and poorly received. Word 5.1 continued to run well until the very last Classic MacOS. Many people continue to run Word 5.1 to this day under an emulated Mac classic system for some of its excellent features like document generation and renumbering or to access their old files.[[File:Microsoft Word for Mac 2011.png|thumb|Microsoft Word 2011 running on OS X]]\nIn 1997, Microsoft formed the [[Macintosh Business Unit]] as an independent group within Microsoft focused on writing software for [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS]].

The following are some aspects of its feature set.\n\n=== Templates ===\nSeveral later versions of Word include the ability for users to create their own formatting templates, allowing them to define a file in which the title, heading, paragraph, and other element designs differ from the standard Word templates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/school/microsoft-word-document-formatting-essentials/lesson5/|title=Word Formatting: Mastering Styles and Document Themes|last=Klein|first=Matt|website=How-To Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> Users can find how to do this under the Help section located near the top right corner (Word 2013 on Windows 8).\n\nFor example, '''Normal.dot''' is the master [[Template (word processing)|template]] from which all Word documents are created. It determines the [[Margin (typography)|margin]] defaults as well as the layout of the text and font defaults. Although normal.dot is already set with certain defaults, the user can change normal.dot to new defaults. This will change other documents which were created using the template, usually in unexpected ways.<ref>[http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=151 in-depth explanation of Normal.dot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050620082713/http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=151 |date=June 20, 2005 }}</ref>\n\n===Image formats===\nWord can import and display images in common bitmap formats such as [[JPEG|JPG]] and [[GIF]]. It can also be used to create and display simple line-art. Microsoft Word added support<ref>{{cite web |title=Edit SVG images in Microsoft Office 365 |url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/edit-svg-images-in-microsoft-office-365-69f29d39-194a-4072-8c35-dbe5e7ea528c |website=Office Support |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref> for the common [[SVG]] vector image format in 2017 for Office 365 ProPlus subscribers and this functionality was also included in the Office 2019 release.\n\n===WordArt===\n{{Main|WordArt}}\n[[File:WordArt.png|thumb|164x164px|An example image created with WordArt]]\nWordArt enables drawing text in a Microsoft Word document such as a title, watermark, or other text, with graphical effects such as skewing, shadowing, rotating, stretching in a variety of shapes and colors and even including three-dimensional effects. Users can apply formatting effects such as shadow, bevel, glow, and reflection to their document text as easily as applying bold or underline. Users can also spell-check text that uses visual effects, and add text effects to paragraph styles.\n\n===Macros===\nA Macro is a rule of pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined process. Frequently used or repetitive sequences of keystrokes and mouse movements can be automated.\nLike other [[Microsoft Office]] documents, Word files can include advanced [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] and even embedded programs. The language was originally [[WordBasic]], but changed to [[Visual Basic for Applications]] as of Word 97.\n\nThis extensive functionality can also be used to run and propagate [[Computer virus|viruses]] in documents. The tendency for people to exchange Word documents via email, [[USB flash drive]]s, and [[floppy disk]]s made this an especially attractive vector in 1999. A prominent example was the [[Melissa virus]], but countless others have existed.\n\nThese macro viruses were the only known cross-platform threats between Windows and Macintosh computers and they were the only infection vectors to affect any [[macOS]] system up until the advent of [[Zlob trojan|video codec trojans]] in 2007. Microsoft released patches for Word X and Word 2004 that effectively eliminated the macro problem on the Mac by 2006.\n\nWord's macro security setting, which regulates when macros may execute, can be adjusted by the user, but in the most recent versions of Word, it is set to HIGH by default, generally reducing the risk from macro-based viruses, which have become uncommon.\n\n===Layout issues===\nBefore Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, the program was unable to correctly handle [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] defined in [[OpenType]] fonts.<ref>[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/what-s-new-in-word-2010-HA010372687.aspx What's new in Word 2010].

It also features a numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and convert them to lists.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McGhie|first1=John|title=Word's numbering explained|url=http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/WordsNumberingExplained.htm|website=word.mvps.org|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref> Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterward, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one were to [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut the first item of the listed and paste it]] as another item (e.g. fifth), then the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/ListRestartMethods.htm |title=Methods for restarting list numbering |website=Word.mvps.org |date=March 26, 2011 |first=Margaret |last=Aldis}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also create tables in ''Word''. Depending on the version, ''Word'' can perform simple calculations \u2014 along with support for formulas and equations as well.\n\n===AutoSummarize===\nAvailable in certain versions of Word (e.g., Word 2007), AutoSummarize highlights passages or phrases that it considers valuable and can be a quick way of generating a crude abstract or an executive summary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.word-tips.com/auto-summarize/|title=How To Access Auto Summarize in Microsoft Word 2007|date=2011-12-14|website=Sue's Word Tips|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> The amount of text to be retained can be specified by the user as a percentage of the current amount of text.\n\nAccording to Ron Fein of the Word 97 team, AutoSummarize cuts wordy copy to the bone by counting words and ranking sentences. First, AutoSummarize identifies the most common words in the document (barring \"a\" and \"the\" and the like) and assigns a \"score\" to each word \u2013 the more frequently a word is used, the higher the score. Then, it \"averages\" each sentence by adding the scores of its words and dividing the sum by the number of words in the sentence \u2013 the higher the average, the higher the rank of the sentence. \"It's like the ratio of wheat to chaff,\" explains Fein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gore |first=Karenna |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2419 |title=Cognito Auto Sum |publisher=Slate.com |date=February 9, 1997 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAutoSummarize was removed from Microsoft Word for Mac OS X 2011, although it was present in Word for Mac 2008. AutoSummarize was removed from the Office 2010 release version (14) as well.<ref>[https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179199 Changes in Word 2010 (for IT pros)].

There is no [[encryption]] of documents that are protected by such passwords, and the Microsoft Office protection system saves a [[hash sum]] of a password in a document's header where it can be easily accessed and removed by the specialized software.\n''Password to open a document'' offers much tougher protection that had been steadily enhanced in the subsequent editions of Microsoft Office.\n\n''Word 95'' and all the preceding editions had the weakest protection that utilized a conversion of a password to a 16-bit [[Encryption key|key]].\n\n[[Key size|Key length]] in ''Word 97'' and ''2000'' was strengthened up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software allows removing such a password very quickly \u2013 a persistent cracking process takes one week at most. Use of [[rainbow tables]] reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some [[password recovery]] software can not only remove a password but also find an actual password that was used by a user to encrypt the document using [[brute-force attack]] approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the password depends on the [[password strength]].\n\nWord's 2003/XP version default protection remained the same but an option that allowed advanced users choosing a [[Cryptographic Service Provider]] was added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oraxcel.com/projects/encoffice/help/How_safe_is_Word_encryption.html |title=How safe is Word encryption. Is it really secure? |publisher=Oraxcel.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> If a strong CSP is chosen, guaranteed document decryption becomes unavailable, and therefore a password can't be removed from the document. Nonetheless, a password can be fairly quickly picked with a brute-force attack, because its speed is still high regardless of the CSP selected. Moreover, since the CSPs are not active by default, their use is limited to advanced users only.\n\nWord 2007 offers significantly more secure document protection which utilizes the modern [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) that converts a password to a 128-bit key using a [[SHA-1]] hash function 50000 times. It makes password removal impossible (as of today, no computer that can pick the key in a reasonable amount of time exists), and drastically slows the brute-force attack speed down to several hundreds of passwords per second.\n\nWord's 2010 protection algorithm was not changed apart from the increasing number of SHA-1 conversions up to 100000 times, and consequently, the brute-force attack speed decreased two times more.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}\n''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' in 1984 criticized the documentation for Word 1.1 and 2.0 for DOS, calling it \"a complete farce\".

Word 5.1 for Mac OS, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor owing to its elegance, relative ease of use and feature set.

With the release of [[Windows 3.0]] the following year, sales began to pick up and Microsoft soon became the market leader for word processors for IBM PC-compatible computers.<ref name=\"pcworld_word25\"/> In 1991, Microsoft capitalized on Word for Windows' increasing popularity by releasing a version of Word for DOS, version 5.5, that replaced its unique user interface with an interface similar to a Windows application.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA151 | title=First Look: Microsoft Updates Look of And Adds Pull-Down Menus to Character-Based Word 5.5 | last=Miller | first=Michael J. | work=InfoWorld | date=November 12, 1990 | page=151 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wFAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA108 | title=Microsoft Word 5.5: Should You Fight or Switch? | last=Needleman | first=Raphael | work=InfoWorld | date=November 19, 1990 | page=106 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref> When Microsoft became aware of the [[Year 2000 problem]], it made Microsoft Word 5.5 for DOS available for download free. {{As of|2018|July}}, it is still available for download from Microsoft's web site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/word97win/Wd55_be/97/WIN98/EN-US/Wd55_ben.exe | title=Microsoft Word 5.5 for MS-DOS (EXE format) | work=Microsoft Download Center | accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref>\nIn 1991, Microsoft embarked on a project code-named Pyramid to completely rewrite Microsoft Word from the ground up. Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same code base. It was abandoned when it was determined that it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added at the same time without a rewrite. Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.<ref name=\"msdn_macword6\"/>\n\nWith the release of Word 6.0 in 1993, Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms, this time across DOS, Mac OS, and Windows (this was the last version of Word for DOS). It introduced AutoCorrect, which automatically fixed certain typing errors, and AutoFormat, which could reformat many parts of a document at once. While the Windows version received favorable reviews (e.g., from ''InfoWorld''<ref name=\"infoworld_word6\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6DoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66 | title=War of the Words | work=InfoWorld | date=February 7, 1994 | pages=66\u201379 | accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref>), the Mac OS version was widely derided.

Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market.

The DOS, Mac, and Windows versions are quite different from each other. Only the Mac version was [[WYSIWYG]] and used a graphical user interface, far ahead of the other platforms. Each platform restarted its version numbering at \"1.0\" (https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-word/1x-mac). There was no version 2 on the Mac, but version 3 came out on January 31, 1987, as described above. Word 4.0 came out on November 6, 1990, and added automatic linking with Excel, the ability to flow text around graphics and a WYSIWYG page view editing mode.\n\nWord 5.1 for Mac, released in 1992 ran on the original 68000 CPU and was the last to be specifically designed as a Macintosh application. The later Word 6 was a Windows port and poorly received. Word 5.1 continued to run well until the very last Classic MacOS. Many people continue to run Word 5.1 to this day under an emulated Mac classic system for some of its excellent features like document generation and renumbering or to access their old files.[[File:Microsoft Word for Mac 2011.png|thumb|Microsoft Word 2011 running on OS X]]\nIn 1997, Microsoft formed the [[Macintosh Business Unit]] as an independent group within Microsoft focused on writing software for [[Mac OS 9|Mac OS]]. Its first version of Word, Word 98, was released with Office 98 Macintosh Edition.

The following are some aspects of its feature set.\n\n=== Templates ===\nSeveral later versions of Word include the ability for users to create their own formatting templates, allowing them to define a file in which the title, heading, paragraph, and other element designs differ from the standard Word templates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.howtogeek.com/school/microsoft-word-document-formatting-essentials/lesson5/|title=Word Formatting: Mastering Styles and Document Themes|last=Klein|first=Matt|website=How-To Geek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> Users can find how to do this under the Help section located near the top right corner (Word 2013 on Windows 8).\n\nFor example, '''Normal.dot''' is the master [[Template (word processing)|template]] from which all Word documents are created. It determines the [[Margin (typography)|margin]] defaults as well as the layout of the text and font defaults. Although normal.dot is already set with certain defaults, the user can change normal.dot to new defaults.

It can also be used to create and display simple line-art. Microsoft Word added support<ref>{{cite web |title=Edit SVG images in Microsoft Office 365 |url=https://support.office.com/en-us/article/edit-svg-images-in-microsoft-office-365-69f29d39-194a-4072-8c35-dbe5e7ea528c |website=Office Support |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref> for the common [[SVG]] vector image format in 2017 for Office 365 ProPlus subscribers and this functionality was also included in the Office 2019 release.\n\n===WordArt===\n{{Main|WordArt}}\n[[File:WordArt.png|thumb|164x164px|An example image created with WordArt]]\nWordArt enables drawing text in a Microsoft Word document such as a title, watermark, or other text, with graphical effects such as skewing, shadowing, rotating, stretching in a variety of shapes and colors and even including three-dimensional effects. Users can apply formatting effects such as shadow, bevel, glow, and reflection to their document text as easily as applying bold or underline. Users can also spell-check text that uses visual effects, and add text effects to paragraph styles.\n\n===Macros===\nA Macro is a rule of pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to an output sequence according to a defined process. Frequently used or repetitive sequences of keystrokes and mouse movements can be automated.\nLike other [[Microsoft Office]] documents, Word files can include advanced [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] and even embedded programs. The language was originally [[WordBasic]], but changed to [[Visual Basic for Applications]] as of Word 97.\n\nThis extensive functionality can also be used to run and propagate [[Computer virus|viruses]] in documents. The tendency for people to exchange Word documents via email, [[USB flash drive]]s, and [[floppy disk]]s made this an especially attractive vector in 1999. A prominent example was the [[Melissa virus]], but countless others have existed.\n\nThese macro viruses were the only known cross-platform threats between Windows and Macintosh computers and they were the only infection vectors to affect any [[macOS]] system up until the advent of [[Zlob trojan|video codec trojans]] in 2007. Microsoft released patches for Word X and Word 2004 that effectively eliminated the macro problem on the Mac by 2006.\n\nWord's macro security setting, which regulates when macros may execute, can be adjusted by the user, but in the most recent versions of Word, it is set to HIGH by default, generally reducing the risk from macro-based viruses, which have become uncommon.\n\n===Layout issues===\nBefore Word 2010 (Word 14) for Windows, the program was unable to correctly handle [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] defined in [[OpenType]] fonts.<ref>[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/what-s-new-in-word-2010-HA010372687.aspx What's new in Word 2010].

It also features a numbering system that helps add correct numbers to pages, chapters, headers, footnotes, and entries of tables of content; these numbers automatically change to correct ones as new items are added or existing items are deleted. Bullets and numbering can be applied directly to paragraphs and convert them to lists.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McGhie|first1=John|title=Word's numbering explained|url=http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/WordsNumberingExplained.htm|website=word.mvps.org|date=March 26, 2011}}</ref> Word 97 through 2003, however, had problems adding correct numbers to numbered lists. In particular, a second irrelevant numbered list might have not started with number one but instead resumed numbering after the last numbered list. Although Word 97 supported a hidden marker that said the list numbering must restart afterward, the command to insert this marker (Restart Numbering command) was only added in Word 2003. However, if one were to [[Cut, copy, and paste|cut the first item of the listed and paste it]] as another item (e.g. fifth), then the restart marker would have moved with it and the list would have restarted in the middle instead of at the top.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://word.mvps.org/FAQs/Numbering/ListRestartMethods.htm |title=Methods for restarting list numbering |website=Word.mvps.org |date=March 26, 2011 |first=Margaret |last=Aldis}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also create tables in ''Word''. Depending on the version, ''Word'' can perform simple calculations \u2014 along with support for formulas and equations as well.\n\n===AutoSummarize===\nAvailable in certain versions of Word (e.g., Word 2007), AutoSummarize highlights passages or phrases that it considers valuable and can be a quick way of generating a crude abstract or an executive summary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.word-tips.com/auto-summarize/|title=How To Access Auto Summarize in Microsoft Word 2007|date=2011-12-14|website=Sue's Word Tips|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref> The amount of text to be retained can be specified by the user as a percentage of the current amount of text.\n\nAccording to Ron Fein of the Word 97 team, AutoSummarize cuts wordy copy to the bone by counting words and ranking sentences. First, AutoSummarize identifies the most common words in the document (barring \"a\" and \"the\" and the like) and assigns a \"score\" to each word \u2013 the more frequently a word is used, the higher the score. Then, it \"averages\" each sentence by adding the scores of its words and dividing the sum by the number of words in the sentence \u2013 the higher the average, the higher the rank of the sentence. \"It's like the ratio of wheat to chaff,\" explains Fein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gore |first=Karenna |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2419 |title=Cognito Auto Sum |publisher=Slate.com |date=February 9, 1997 |accessdate=June 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAutoSummarize was removed from Microsoft Word for Mac OS X 2011, although it was present in Word for Mac 2008.

There is no [[encryption]] of documents that are protected by such passwords, and the Microsoft Office protection system saves a [[hash sum]] of a password in a document's header where it can be easily accessed and removed by the specialized software.\n''Password to open a document'' offers much tougher protection that had been steadily enhanced in the subsequent editions of Microsoft Office.\n\n''Word 95'' and all the preceding editions had the weakest protection that utilized a conversion of a password to a 16-bit [[Encryption key|key]].\n\n[[Key size|Key length]] in ''Word 97'' and ''2000'' was strengthened up to 40 bit. However, modern cracking software allows removing such a password very quickly \u2013 a persistent cracking process takes one week at most. Use of [[rainbow tables]] reduces password removal time to several seconds. Some [[password recovery]] software can not only remove a password but also find an actual password that was used by a user to encrypt the document using [[brute-force attack]] approach. Statistically, the possibility of recovering the password depends on the [[password strength]].\n\nWord's 2003/XP version default protection remained the same but an option that allowed advanced users choosing a [[Cryptographic Service Provider]] was added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oraxcel.com/projects/encoffice/help/How_safe_is_Word_encryption.html |title=How safe is Word encryption. Is it really secure? |publisher=Oraxcel.com |date= |accessdate=April 24, 2013}}</ref> If a strong CSP is chosen, guaranteed document decryption becomes unavailable, and therefore a password can't be removed from the document. Nonetheless, a password can be fairly quickly picked with a brute-force attack, because its speed is still high regardless of the CSP selected. Moreover, since the CSPs are not active by default, their use is limited to advanced users only.\n\nWord 2007 offers significantly more secure document protection which utilizes the modern [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) that converts a password to a 128-bit key using a [[SHA-1]] hash function 50000 times. It makes password removal impossible (as of today, no computer that can pick the key in a reasonable amount of time exists), and drastically slows the brute-force attack speed down to several hundreds of passwords per second.\n\nWord's 2010 protection algorithm was not changed apart from the increasing number of SHA-1 conversions up to 100000 times, and consequently, the brute-force attack speed decreased two times more.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2016}}\n''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' in 1984 criticized the documentation for Word 1.1 and 2.0 for DOS, calling it \"a complete farce\".

By May 1918, the German [[Baltic Sea Division]] had aided the Whites to gain control over most of the country. [[Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse]] was elected to the throne of Finland on 9 October 1918 by the [[Parliament of Finland]], but he never took the position and renounced the throne in December 1918 after Germany's defeat in the First World War.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|History of Finland}}\n\nFinland had declared independence from what was the [[Russian Empire]], at that time embroiled in the [[Russian Civil War]], on 6 December 1917. At the time of the declaration of independence, monarchists were a minority in the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]], and Finland was declared a republic. A [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] followed, and afterwards, while the pro-republican [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] was excluded from the Parliament and before a new constitution was adopted, Frederick was elected to the throne of Finland on 9 October 1918.\n\n[[File:Friedrich Karl HK 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, the king-elect of Finland]]\n[[File:King of Finland's crown2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Replica of the Crown designed for the Finnish monarch.

In [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], a \"General Provincial Assembly\" consisting of [[Baltic-German]] aristocrats had called upon the German Emperor, [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], to recognize the Baltic provinces as a joint monarchy and a German [[protectorate]]. [[Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], was nominated Duke of \"the [[United Baltic Duchy]]\" by the Germans.\n\nAt independence, Finland had, like the Baltic provinces, close ties with the [[German Empire]]. Germany was the only [[power (international)|international power]] that had supported the preparations for independence, not least by training volunteers as [[Finnish J\u00e4ger troops]]. Germany had also intervened in the [[Finnish Civil War]], despite its own precarious situation. Finland's position ''[[wikt:vis-a-vis|vis-a-vis]]'' Germany was already evolving towards that of a protectorate by spring 1918, and the election of Prince Frederick, brother-in-law of Wilhelm II, was viewed as a confirmation of the close relations between the two nations. The strongly pro-German prime minister, [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], and his government offered the crown to  Prince Frederick in October 1918.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/finland/16.htm  |title=The Establishment of Finnish Democracy |author1=Eric Solsten and Sandra W.

The legitimacy of the royal election was based upon the [[Swedish Constitution of 1772|Instrument of Government]] of 1772, adopted under [[Gustav III of Sweden|King Gustav III of Sweden]], when Finland had been a part of the [[Kingdom of Sweden]]. The same constitutional document had also served as the basis for the rule of the [[List of Russian rulers|Russian Emperors]], as [[List of Finnish monarchs|Grand Dukes of Finland]], during the 19th century.\n\nMember of parliament [[Gustaf Arokallio]] suggested the monarchical designation \"Charles I, King of Finland and [[Karelia]], Duke of [[\u00c5land Islands|\u00c5land]], Grand Duke of [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], Lord of [[Kalevala|Kaleva]] and the [[Pohjola|North]]\" ({{lang-fi|Kaarle I, Suomen ja Karjalan kuningas, Ahvenanmaan herttua, Lapinmaan suuriruhtinas, Kalevan ja Pohjolan is\u00e4nt\u00e4}}; {{lang-sv|Karl I, Kung av Finland och Karelen, hertig av \u00c5land, storhertig av Lappland, herre \u00f6ver Kaleva och Pohjola}}).<ref>Ohto Manninen (p\u00e4\u00e4toim.), Pertti Haapala, Juhani Piilonen, Jukka-Pekka Pieti\u00e4inen: ''Itsen\u00e4istymisen vuodet 1917\u20131920: 3.

Two days later, on 11 November 1918, the armistice between the belligerents of [[World War I]] was signed. Little is known of the Allied powers' view regarding the possibility of a German-born prince as the King of Finland. However, warnings received from the West convinced the Finnish government of Prime Minister [[Lauri Ingman]]{{spaced ndash}}a monarchist himself{{spaced ndash}}to ask Prince Frederick to give up the crown, which he had not yet come to wear in Finland.\n\nThe king-elect Frederick renounced the throne on 14 December 1918. [[Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim|Mannerheim]], the leader of the Whites during the [[Finnish Civil War]], was appointed as Regent.

At the time of the declaration of independence, monarchists were a minority in the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish Parliament]], and Finland was declared a republic. A [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]] followed, and afterwards, while the pro-republican [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] was excluded from the Parliament and before a new constitution was adopted, Frederick was elected to the throne of Finland on 9 October 1918.\n\n[[File:Friedrich Karl HK 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse, the king-elect of Finland]]\n[[File:King of Finland's crown2.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Replica of the Crown designed for the Finnish monarch.

In [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], a \"General Provincial Assembly\" consisting of [[Baltic-German]] aristocrats had called upon the German Emperor, [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]], to recognize the Baltic provinces as a joint monarchy and a German [[protectorate]]. [[Adolf Friedrich, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], was nominated Duke of \"the [[United Baltic Duchy]]\" by the Germans.\n\nAt independence, Finland had, like the Baltic provinces, close ties with the [[German Empire]]. Germany was the only [[power (international)|international power]] that had supported the preparations for independence, not least by training volunteers as [[Finnish J\u00e4ger troops]]. Germany had also intervened in the [[Finnish Civil War]], despite its own precarious situation. Finland's position ''[[wikt:vis-a-vis|vis-a-vis]]'' Germany was already evolving towards that of a protectorate by spring 1918, and the election of Prince Frederick, brother-in-law of Wilhelm II, was viewed as a confirmation of the close relations between the two nations. The strongly pro-German prime minister, [[Juho Kusti Paasikivi]], and his government offered the crown to  Prince Frederick in October 1918.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/finland/16.htm  |title=The Establishment of Finnish Democracy |author1=Eric Solsten and Sandra W.

Two days later, on 11 November 1918, the armistice between the belligerents of [[World War I]] was signed. Little is known of the Allied powers' view regarding the possibility of a German-born prince as the King of Finland. However, warnings received from the West convinced the Finnish government of Prime Minister [[Lauri Ingman]]{{spaced ndash}}a monarchist himself{{spaced ndash}}to ask Prince Frederick to give up the crown, which he had not yet come to wear in Finland.\n\nThe king-elect Frederick renounced the throne on 14 December 1918.

Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) who served under the commanders [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] and his son [[Aspar]] for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]] on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations [[Pulcheria]],  Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. [[Flavius Zeno]], a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of {{lang|la|[[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patrician]]}} upon Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.\n\nMarcian reversed many of the actions of Theodosius{{nbsp}}II in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]'s relationship with the [[Hunnic Empire|Huns]] under [[Attila]] and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Marcian launched expeditions across the [[Danube]] into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], defeating the [[Huns]] in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.\n\nAfter Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes within Roman lands as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}} (\"federates\" providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which declared that [[Jesus]] had two \"[[Nature (philosophy)|natures]]\": divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of [[Byzantine Syria|Syria]] and [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]], as many of them were [[miaphysites]], rejecting the new official [[Christology]]. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million [[solidi]] coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius' tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian's son-in-law, [[Anthemius]], and had a military commander, [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], elected as emperor.\n\n==Early life==\nMarcian was born in {{circa}} 392,{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=153}}{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} in either [[Thracia|Thrace]]{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=104}} or [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyria]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} and named Flavius Marcianus.{{sfn|Keppie|2002|p=137}} The ancient historian [[John Malalas]] describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment.{{sfn|Baldwin|1982 |p=98}} Little of Marcian's early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] in Thrace. By the time of the [[Roman\u2013Sasanian War (421\u2013422)|Roman\u2013Sassanian War of 421\u2013422]], Marcian had likely reached the military rank of [[Military tribune|tribune]]\u2014the historian [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in [[Lycia]]. There he was cared for by [[Tatianus (Praefectus urbi)|Tatianus]], who would be made {{lang|la|[[praefectus urbi]]}} (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus' brother [[Iulius (praeses)|Iulius]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=714\u2013715}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Marcian eventually rose to become the {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) of [[Aspar]], the {{lang|la|[[magister militum]]}} (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-[[Alans|Alanic]] and half-[[Goths|Gothic]], Aspar held much influence in the empire.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=45, 75, 84}} In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where he was captured by [[Vandals]]. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], [[Procopius]] and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]], who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Background==\n===Reign of Theodosius II===\nThe Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius&nbsp;II. In 429 the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the [[Huns]], who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay {{convert|350|lb}} of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for {{convert|700|lb}} of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled many of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and [[Attila]], who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} \n\nOn 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of [[Carthage]]. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa;{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} sending away so many of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius' part. He was betting the fortified cities along the [[Danube]] could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of [[Margus (city)|Margus]] led a raiding party into the Huns' territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of [[Viminacium]], [[Singidunum]], and [[Sirmium]]. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counterattack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201378}}\n\n===Rise to the throne===\nAfter Theodosius&nbsp;II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first [[succession crisis]] in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=94}} Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian's supporters after his election.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian had served Aspar and his father [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius&nbsp;II's sister, who agreed to marry Marcian;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius II{{'}}s religious policies and convoke a Church council.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=104}} Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian's rule, as Pulcheria's family, the [[Theodosian dynasty]], had direct ties to the throne.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of [[virginity]] she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=537}}{{sfn|Holum|1989|p=209}} \n\nHistorian [[Doug Lee (historian)|Doug Lee]] proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and [[Flavius Zeno]], who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] upon Marcian's ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcian{{'}}s accession.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} Aspar{{'s}} son, [[Ardabur (consul 447)|Ardabur]], was promoted to command the army of the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Perfecture of the East]] as the new {{lang|la|[[magister militum per Orientem]]}}, soon after Marcian's accession.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}}\n\nMarcian was elected on 25 August 450, Pulcheria herself crowning him emperor, a unique event symbolizing that the imperial power was shared, and likely to boost Marcian's legitimacy further.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation.{{sfn|Babcock|2005|p=157}} The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. [[Chrysaphius]], the [[eunuch]] and {{lang|la|[[spatharios]]}} (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius' influence, which may have motivated Marcian's actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. [[Byzantine studies|Byzantist]] [[Constance Head]] considers Marcian to be an \"an independent-minded emperor.\"{{sfn|Head|1982|p=20}} Lee states that Marcian \"can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office\", but notes that \"Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.\"{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Conflict with the Huns===\n[[File:450 roman-hunnic-empire 1764x1116.jpg|right|Alt=A map of Europe showing the territories of the Hunnic confederation and the Roman Empire | A map of Europe in 450 AD, showing the Hunnic confederation under Attila in orange, and the Roman Empire in yellow|thumb|upright=2|alt=A colored drawing of Europe in 450 AD, showing the borders of states at the time of Attila by different colors, with the Roman Empire in yellow, the Hunnic Confederation in orange, the Vandal Kingdom in blue, the Franks in green, the Goths in pink, the Sueves in purple, the Saxons in light pink, the Burgundians in brown, the Lombards in bright yellow, and the Alans in light blue.]]\nAlmost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius' treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor [[Valentinian&nbsp;III]] against the [[Visigoths]]. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian's proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from [[Pannonia]] in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}} [[Flavius Aetius]], who was the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as {{lang|la|[[Comes et Magister Utriusque Militiae]]}}, organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, [[Franks]], [[Burgundians]], Alans, Saxons, Celtic [[Armorica]]ns, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila's forces were made up of [[Gepids]], Alans, [[Scirii]], [[Heruli (military unit)|Heruli]], [[Rugii|Rugians]], along with some Franks, Burgundians, and [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=85}}\n\nAttila sacked [[Metz]] and attempted a siege of [[Orleans]], before meeting Aetius' forces at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], in northeast [[Gaul]]. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid, into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of [[Aquileia]] after a long and difficult siege,{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=86}} and [[looted|sacked]] it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack [[Rome]] itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his [[lines of communication]] and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}\n\nDespite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. As well, Attila's homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}} The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the [[breadbasket]] of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila's own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=70}} Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from [[hemorrhaging]] or alcoholic [[suffocation]], after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=88}}\n\nThis fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king [[Ardaric]] came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], [[Valamir]] and [[Videmir]], decisively defeated Attila's oldest son, [[Ellac]], at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation fell apart entirely. In the wake of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in [[Pannonia Prima]] and [[Pannonia Valeria|Valeria]]\u2014nominally two Western Roman provinces\u2014as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}}{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=172}} This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a [[Danube\u2013Iller\u2013Rhine Limes|rigid Danube barrier]], which had previously been manned by Roman {{lang|la|[[laeti]]}}, barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the {{lang|la|laeti}} had been replaced by {{lang|la|foederati}}, although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian's successors would grant the status of {{lang|la|foederati}} to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in [[Lower Moesia]] and [[Scythia]], Gepids in [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]]. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The tribal peoples generally kept each other's power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}} After the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the [[Saracens]] in [[Roman Syria|Syria]] and against the [[Blemmyes]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:Fourth ecumenical council of chalcedon - 1876.jpg|thumb|''Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon'', 1876&nbsp;painting by [[Vasily Surikov]]|alt=A wall painting of the Council of Chalcedon showing Marcian and Pulcheria seated on thrones.]]\nDuring the time period of the 5th century, a central religious issue was the debate concerning how the human and divine nature of [[Jesus Christ]] were associated, following the [[Arian controversy]]. The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|School of Alexandria]], including theologians such as [[Athanasius]], asserted the equality of Christ and God, and therefore focused upon the divinity of Christ. The [[School of Antioch]], including theologians such as [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], determined not to lose the human aspect of Christ, focused upon his humanity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=137}}\n\nShortly before Marcian became emperor, the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called {{lang|la|[[miaphysitism|miaphysis]]}}; this was rejected by the [[Pope]] and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] due to disputes on the matter of [[Christology]], as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as [[heretical]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=99 & 105}}{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=81}} \n\nTo repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass [[ecumenical council|universally respected canons]], in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of [[Nicaea]], which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to [[Chalcedon]]. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] met in October 451. About 500 [[bishops]] attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by [[Pope Leo&nbsp;I]] attended.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=585}}{{sfn|Whitworth|2017|p=360}} This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature ({{lang|la|[[physis]]}}) and a human nature, united in one person ({{lang|la|[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]}}), \"without confusion, change, division, or separation.\"{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=146}}\n\nThe council also agreed to condemn the Coptic [[Pope Dioscorus&nbsp;I of Alexandria]], who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of [[Ibas of Edessa]] and [[Theodoret]], which had taken place during this Council. The council also repeated the importance of the [[See of Constantinople]], placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=122}} The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous [[edicts]] confirming the outcomes of the council;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=148}} One such edict ordered the repression of [[Eutychianism|Eutychianists]], who did not believe in the hypostatic union of Jesus' two natures, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the [[Nestorians]], to be burned.{{sfn|Bury|2012|p=380}} \n\nThe anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch;{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=105}} as well as sending the military to suppress monks in [[Palaestina Prima|Palestine]]<!--Please note that this was the proper Roman name for the province and has no relation to the modern Israel\u2013Palestine debates.--> and placing troops in [[Alexandria]] to ensure the installation of [[Proterius of Alexandria]], who was to replace the deposed Pope Dioscorus I.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} According to the Byzantist [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]], even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=105\u2013106}} Another result of the council and the subsequent edicts was that many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the [[Sassanian Empire]].{{sfn|Bauer|2010|pp=122\u2013123}} The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor [[Justinian I]] ({{Reign|527|565}}), the Miaphysites splitting the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] from the main body of Christians.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=194\u2013202}}\n\nMarcian also funded Pulcheria's extensive building projects until her death in July 453. All of them focused on the construction of religious buildings,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} including the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] and the [[Hodegon Monastery]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}} Marcian was compared to both [[Paul the Apostle]] and the Biblical king [[David]],{{sfn|Herrin|2009|p=11}} by the legates at the Council of Chalcedon.{{sfn|Bjornlie|2016|p=60}}\n\n===Economic and legal policy===\nAt the beginning of Marcian's reign, the Eastern Roman treasury was almost bankrupt, the result of the huge tributes paid to Attila by Theodosius. Marcian reversed this near bankruptcy, not by levying new taxes, but by cutting expenditure.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Upon his accession, he declared a remission of all debts owed to the state.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian attempted to improve the efficiency of the state in multiple ways.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian laid out legal reforms in his [[Novel (Roman law)|novels]], or codes of law, containing 20 laws, many of which were targeted at reducing the corruption and abuses of office that had existed during the reign of Theodosius; five of which are preserved in full.{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=217}}{{sfn|Pharr|Davidson|Pharr|2001|p=562}}\n\nMarcian mandated that the office of [[praetorship]] (officer in charge of public games and works) could only be given to [[Byzantine Senate#Admission and composition|senators]] who resided in Constantinople, attempted to curb the practice of selling administrative offices, and decreed that [[Roman consul|consuls]] should be responsible for the maintenance of [[Valens Aqueduct|Constantinople's aqueducts]]. He repealed the {{lang|la|[[Follis (tax)|follis]]}}, a tax on senators' property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the consuls and praetors, held since the time of the [[Roman Republic]], to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. He further decreed that only a {{lang|la|[[vir illustris]]}} (a high-ranking man) could hold either office.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by [[Constantine I]], which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, [[freedwoman]], actress, or woman of no social status ({{lang|la|[[Honestiores and humiliores|humilis]]}}), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} By the time of his death, Marcian's shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of {{convert|100,000|lb}} of gold.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} \n\nIn 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed [[Paganism|pagan rites]] would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law.{{sfn|Evans|2002|p=66}}\n\n===Politics===\nWhen Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=97}} and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire. This influence was enhanced by the promotion of his son Ardabur to {{lang|la|magister militum per Orientem}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} It is unknown if Aspar and Ardabur influenced Marcian{{'}}s policies directly, but if so, they were extremely careful to avoid upsetting the ruling elites of Constantinople. Despite Aspar's great influence, the Eastern Roman elites retained much of their anti-German sentiment.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian's principal advisors were Pulcheria, [[Euphemius (Magister officiorum)|Euphemius]] the {{lang|la|[[magister officiorum]]}} (master of offices), [[Palladius (praetor)|Palladius]] the praetor, and [[Anatolius of Constantinople]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=305}} In 453, Marcian had his daughter from a previous marriage, [[Marcia Euphemia]], marry [[Anthemius]], an aristocrat and talented general.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}\n\nMarcian patronized the Blues, who were one of the [[Deme#Later usage|two circus teams]], the other being the Greens. The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcus censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years. Marcian's patronage of the Blues may have had personal motivations, as the once powerful Chrysaphius had been favorable to the Greens.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Christophilopoulou|1986|p=286}}{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=85}}\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe Armenian king [[Vardan II Mamikonian]], who was leading a revolt against the Sassanian Empire, sent an embassy to Theodosius in 450, composed of his brother [[Hmayeak Mamikonian]], along with [[Atom Gnuni]], [[Vardan Amatuni]], and [[Meruzhan Artsruni (emissary)|Meruzhan Artsruni]], to ask for assistance. Theodosius received it favorably. Any plans were cut short by his death and the accession of Marcian.{{Sfn|Manoogian|1984|p=23}}{{Sfn|Lacey|2016|p=142}} Marcian was counseled by the diplomat [[Anatolius (consul)|Anatolius]] and {{lang|la|patricius}} [[Florentius (consul 429)|Florentius]] not to make war with the Sassanians, as it would engulf a large amount of the Eastern Roman military resources, and thus Marcian did not agree to help them.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=85\u201386}}{{sfn|Amirav|2015|p=55 & 93}}\n\nKing [[Gubazes I of Lazica]]\u2014a Caucasian state in theory under Eastern Roman suzerainty\u2014was attempting to form an alliance with the Sassanians to break free of Roman control in 456.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|p=346}} Marcian's troops invaded Lazica and restored Roman rule.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=174}} In 455 Marcian banned the export to barbarian tribes of weapons and the tools used to manufacture them.{{sfn|Holmes|Singleton|Jones|2001}}\n\n===Relationship with the Western Roman Empire===\nMarcian was elected without any consultation with the Western Roman Emperor, Valentinian&nbsp;III\u2013 a clear indication of further separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires than before his reign.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=42}} Valentinian would later recognize Marcian as the Eastern Roman Emperor, although the date of his recognition is disputed; Lee states that Valentinian recognized Marcian in March 452,{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}} whereas historian [[Timothy E. Gregory]] states that Marcian was recognized by Valentinian on 30 March 451.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}} Marcian{{'}}s appointment marked a further stage of separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}} One source, [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch's]] {{lang|la|Excerpta de insidiis}}, even suggest that Valentinian would have attempted to depose Marcian, but for Aetius{{'}} opposition.{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43f}} Valentinian also did not recognize the Eastern Roman consuls for 451 or 452.{{sfn|McEvoy|2013|p=290, note 84}} The Western Roman chronicler [[Hydatius]] suggests that Marcian made Eastern Roman troops available to Valentinian to repel the Huns, confusingly led by a man named Aetius, which may simply be a muddling of Aetius' campaign against Attila and Marcian's campaign against the Huns on the Danube.{{sfn|McEvoy|2013|p=294}}\n\nWhen Marcian granted part of Pannonia to the Ostrogoths, and [[Tisza]] to the Gepids, he was accused of encroaching upon the border of Western Roman land.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}} Marcian avoided involving himself with the affairs of the Western Roman Empire when possible. When the Vandals [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacked Rome]] in 455, after [[Petronius Maximus]] assassinated Valentinian&nbsp;III and broke an [[engagement]] treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly due to the influence of Aspar. He merely sent an envoy demanding that the Vandals return the [[Dowager Empress]], [[Licinia Eudoxia]] and her daughters by Valentinian III, [[Placidia]] and [[Eudocia (daughter of Valentinian&nbsp;III)|Eudocia]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} A likely false account is given that Marcian, while captured by the Vandals in his youth, was shaded by an eagle while the other prisoners suffered the hot sun. According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcia pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor.{{efn|name=A|Propaganda involving the story of an eagle blocking the sun, and another figure recognizing they would be emperor, was used by both Byzantine emperors [[Philippikos Bardanes]] and [[Basil&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|Lilie|2014|p=193}}}} This account originates from [[Priscus]], who served as an advisor to Marcian's confidant, Euphemius. Due to Euphemius' influence over foreign policy, some historians, such as [[Edward Arthur Thompson]], have suggested that this account was a part of official imperial propaganda, which was generated to excuse Marcian's lack of retribution towards the Vandals, and quell any discontent.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=68}} Marcian made several diplomatic attempts to have the prisoners returned, before finally beginning to plan an invasion of the Vandal's territory shortly before his death.{{sfn|Clover|1978|pp=193\u2013194}} The historian [[Frank Clover]] has suggested that this sudden reversal of policy was caused by the marriage of Eudocia to [[Huneric]], the son of Gaiseric, which led to such pressure from Eastern Roman elites that Marcian was forced to begin preparations for war to ensure the return of the hostages. Around this time, Marcian made peace with Lazica, which would allow him to direct his attention elsewhere. The East Roman historian [[Theodorus Lector]] speaks of Marcian's sudden reversal of policy, and [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war, in either late 556 or early 557.{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=243}}\n\nMarcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize [[Avitus]], who succeeded Maximus.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=704}} Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian [[Hydatius]] states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian \"for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ({{lang|la|concordia}} in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]], [[J. B. Bury]], and [[William Bayless]] consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; [[Ernst Stein]] suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas [[Norman Baynes]] believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}{{sfn|Baynes|1922|p=223}} Classicist [[Courtenay Edward Stevens]] interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey Nathan]] suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Death==\nMarcian's reign ended on 26 January 457, when he died, possibly of [[gangrene]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} [[Theodorus Lector]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]] say that Marcian died after a long religious procession from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Grand Palace]] to the [[Hebdomon]], where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk due to severe foot [[inflammation]], possibly [[gout]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Kelly|2013|p=240}} He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} in a [[Porphyry (geology)#Imperial sarcophagi|porphyry sarcophagus]] that was described in the 10th century by [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in the {{lang|la|[[De Ceremoniis]]}}.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1948|pp=p1 & 3\u201326}} He left the Eastern Empire with seven million [[solidi]] in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=127}} \n\nAlthough Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in one of the praesental armies\u2014two field armies based near Constantinople. A later source claims that the [[Eastern Roman Senate]] offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: \"I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me\". This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an [[Arian]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=92, 98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} or else to his Alanic heritage.{{sfn|Norwich|1998|p=51}}\n\nAnthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the [[Western Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|emperor]];{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}} Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor [[Libius Severus]] since 465. Leo sent Anthemius to Rome with an army, headed by [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]], the {{lang|la|magister militum}} of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]; upon nearing Rome, Anthemius was installed as emperor on 12 April 467.{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20111224 Flavius Marcianus Augustus Column Fatih Istanbul Turkey.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Color photograph of an ancient stone column set in front of a modern building and parked cars.

Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck: not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems; further, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1297}} He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout \"Reign like Marcian!\" at the installation of future emperors.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}}\n\nThe Prefect of Constantinople [[Tatianus]] built a [[Column of Marcian|column]] dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=1053\u20131054}}{{sfn|D'Ayala |Fodde |2008|p=1167}} It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]],{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=204}} though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost.{{sfn|Freely|\u00c7akmak|2004|p=63}} Marcian also had a statue in the [[Forum of Arcadius]], which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor [[Arcadius]].{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991a|p=1347}} Marcian may have been the sponsor of the [[Chrysotriklinos]] of the Great Palace of Constantinople. The {{lang|la|[[Patria of Constantinople]]}} states that Marcian constructed it, whereas the 10th century encyclopedia {{lang|la|[[Suda]]}} states that Emperor [[Justin&nbsp;II]] built it, a view with which most historians agree.

Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) who served under the commanders [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] and his son [[Aspar]] for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]] on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations [[Pulcheria]],  Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. [[Flavius Zeno]], a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of {{lang|la|[[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patrician]]}} upon Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.\n\nMarcian reversed many of the actions of Theodosius{{nbsp}}II in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]'s relationship with the [[Hunnic Empire|Huns]] under [[Attila]] and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the [[Western Roman Empire]], Marcian launched expeditions across the [[Danube]] into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], defeating the [[Huns]] in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.\n\nAfter Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes within Roman lands as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}} (\"federates\" providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which declared that [[Jesus]] had two \"[[Nature (philosophy)|natures]]\": divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of [[Byzantine Syria|Syria]] and [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]], as many of them were [[miaphysites]], rejecting the new official [[Christology]]. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million [[solidi]] coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius' tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian's son-in-law, [[Anthemius]], and had a military commander, [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], elected as emperor.\n\n==Early life==\nMarcian was born in {{circa}} 392,{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=153}}{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} in either [[Thracia|Thrace]]{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=104}} or [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyria]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} and named Flavius Marcianus.{{sfn|Keppie|2002|p=137}} The ancient historian [[John Malalas]] describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment.{{sfn|Baldwin|1982 |p=98}} Little of Marcian's early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] in Thrace. By the time of the [[Roman\u2013Sasanian War (421\u2013422)|Roman\u2013Sassanian War of 421\u2013422]], Marcian had likely reached the military rank of [[Military tribune|tribune]]\u2014the historian [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in [[Lycia]]. There he was cared for by [[Tatianus (Praefectus urbi)|Tatianus]], who would be made {{lang|la|[[praefectus urbi]]}} (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus' brother [[Iulius (praeses)|Iulius]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=714\u2013715}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Marcian eventually rose to become the {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) of [[Aspar]], the {{lang|la|[[magister militum]]}} (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-[[Alans|Alanic]] and half-[[Goths|Gothic]], Aspar held much influence in the empire.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=45, 75, 84}} In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where he was captured by [[Vandals]]. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], [[Procopius]] and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]], who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Background==\n===Reign of Theodosius II===\nThe Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius&nbsp;II. In 429 the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the [[Huns]], who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay {{convert|350|lb}} of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for {{convert|700|lb}} of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled many of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and [[Attila]], who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} \n\nOn 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of [[Carthage]]. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa;{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} sending away so many of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius' part. He was betting the fortified cities along the [[Danube]] could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of [[Margus (city)|Margus]] led a raiding party into the Huns' territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of [[Viminacium]], [[Singidunum]], and [[Sirmium]]. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counterattack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201378}}\n\n===Rise to the throne===\nAfter Theodosius&nbsp;II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first [[succession crisis]] in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=94}} Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian's supporters after his election.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian had served Aspar and his father [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius&nbsp;II's sister, who agreed to marry Marcian;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius II{{'}}s religious policies and convoke a Church council.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=104}} Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian's rule, as Pulcheria's family, the [[Theodosian dynasty]], had direct ties to the throne.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of [[virginity]] she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=537}}{{sfn|Holum|1989|p=209}} \n\nHistorian [[Doug Lee (historian)|Doug Lee]] proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and [[Flavius Zeno]], who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] upon Marcian's ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcian{{'}}s accession.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} Aspar{{'s}} son, [[Ardabur (consul 447)|Ardabur]], was promoted to command the army of the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Perfecture of the East]] as the new {{lang|la|[[magister militum per Orientem]]}}, soon after Marcian's accession.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}}\n\nMarcian was elected on 25 August 450, Pulcheria herself crowning him emperor, a unique event symbolizing that the imperial power was shared, and likely to boost Marcian's legitimacy further.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation.{{sfn|Babcock|2005|p=157}} The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. [[Chrysaphius]], the [[eunuch]] and {{lang|la|[[spatharios]]}} (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius' influence, which may have motivated Marcian's actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. [[Byzantine studies|Byzantist]] [[Constance Head]] considers Marcian to be an \"an independent-minded emperor.\"{{sfn|Head|1982|p=20}} Lee states that Marcian \"can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office\", but notes that \"Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.\"{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Conflict with the Huns===\n[[File:450 roman-hunnic-empire 1764x1116.jpg|right|Alt=A map of Europe showing the territories of the Hunnic confederation and the Roman Empire | A map of Europe in 450 AD, showing the Hunnic confederation under Attila in orange, and the Roman Empire in yellow|thumb|upright=2|alt=A colored drawing of Europe in 450 AD, showing the borders of states at the time of Attila by different colors, with the Roman Empire in yellow, the Hunnic Confederation in orange, the Vandal Kingdom in blue, the Franks in green, the Goths in pink, the Sueves in purple, the Saxons in light pink, the Burgundians in brown, the Lombards in bright yellow, and the Alans in light blue.]]\nAlmost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius' treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor [[Valentinian&nbsp;III]] against the [[Visigoths]]. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian's proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from [[Pannonia]] in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}} [[Flavius Aetius]], who was the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as {{lang|la|[[Comes et Magister Utriusque Militiae]]}}, organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, [[Franks]], [[Burgundians]], Alans, Saxons, Celtic [[Armorica]]ns, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila's forces were made up of [[Gepids]], Alans, [[Scirii]], [[Heruli (military unit)|Heruli]], [[Rugii|Rugians]], along with some Franks, Burgundians, and [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=85}}\n\nAttila sacked [[Metz]] and attempted a siege of [[Orleans]], before meeting Aetius' forces at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], in northeast [[Gaul]]. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid, into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of [[Aquileia]] after a long and difficult siege,{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=86}} and [[looted|sacked]] it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack [[Rome]] itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his [[lines of communication]] and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}\n\nDespite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. As well, Attila's homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}} The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the [[breadbasket]] of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila's own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=70}} Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from [[hemorrhaging]] or alcoholic [[suffocation]], after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=88}}\n\nThis fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king [[Ardaric]] came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], [[Valamir]] and [[Videmir]], decisively defeated Attila's oldest son, [[Ellac]], at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation fell apart entirely. In the wake of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in [[Pannonia Prima]] and [[Pannonia Valeria|Valeria]]\u2014nominally two Western Roman provinces\u2014as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}}{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=172}} This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a [[Danube\u2013Iller\u2013Rhine Limes|rigid Danube barrier]], which had previously been manned by Roman {{lang|la|[[laeti]]}}, barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the {{lang|la|laeti}} had been replaced by {{lang|la|foederati}}, although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian's successors would grant the status of {{lang|la|foederati}} to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in [[Lower Moesia]] and [[Scythia]], Gepids in [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]]. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The tribal peoples generally kept each other's power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}} After the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the [[Saracens]] in [[Roman Syria|Syria]] and against the [[Blemmyes]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:Fourth ecumenical council of chalcedon - 1876.jpg|thumb|''Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon'', 1876&nbsp;painting by [[Vasily Surikov]]|alt=A wall painting of the Council of Chalcedon showing Marcian and Pulcheria seated on thrones.]]\nDuring the time period of the 5th century, a central religious issue was the debate concerning how the human and divine nature of [[Jesus Christ]] were associated, following the [[Arian controversy]]. The [[Catechetical School of Alexandria|School of Alexandria]], including theologians such as [[Athanasius]], asserted the equality of Christ and God, and therefore focused upon the divinity of Christ. The [[School of Antioch]], including theologians such as [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]], determined not to lose the human aspect of Christ, focused upon his humanity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=137}}\n\nShortly before Marcian became emperor, the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called {{lang|la|[[miaphysitism|miaphysis]]}}; this was rejected by the [[Pope]] and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] due to disputes on the matter of [[Christology]], as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as [[heretical]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=99 & 105}}{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=81}} \n\nTo repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass [[ecumenical council|universally respected canons]], in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of [[Nicaea]], which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to [[Chalcedon]]. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] met in October 451. About 500 [[bishops]] attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by [[Pope Leo&nbsp;I]] attended.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=585}}{{sfn|Whitworth|2017|p=360}} This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature ({{lang|la|[[physis]]}}) and a human nature, united in one person ({{lang|la|[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]}}), \"without confusion, change, division, or separation.\"{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=146}}\n\nThe council also agreed to condemn the Coptic [[Pope Dioscorus&nbsp;I of Alexandria]], who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of [[Ibas of Edessa]] and [[Theodoret]], which had taken place during this Council. The council also repeated the importance of the [[See of Constantinople]], placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=122}} The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous [[edicts]] confirming the outcomes of the council;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=148}} One such edict ordered the repression of [[Eutychianism|Eutychianists]], who did not believe in the hypostatic union of Jesus' two natures, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the [[Nestorians]], to be burned.{{sfn|Bury|2012|p=380}} \n\nThe anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch;{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=105}} as well as sending the military to suppress monks in [[Palaestina Prima|Palestine]]<!--Please note that this was the proper Roman name for the province and has no relation to the modern Israel\u2013Palestine debates.--> and placing troops in [[Alexandria]] to ensure the installation of [[Proterius of Alexandria]], who was to replace the deposed [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus I]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} According to the Byzantist [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]], even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=105\u2013106}} Another result of the council and the subsequent edicts was that many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the [[Sassanian Empire]].{{sfn|Bauer|2010|pp=122\u2013123}} The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor [[Justinian I]] ({{Reign|527|565}}), the Miaphysites splitting the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] from the main body of Christians.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=194\u2013202}}\n\nMarcian also funded Pulcheria's extensive building projects until her death in July 453. All of them focused on the construction of religious buildings,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} including the [[Church of St. Mary of Blachernae (Istanbul)|Church of St. Mary of Blachernae]] and the [[Hodegon Monastery]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}} Marcian was compared to both [[Paul the Apostle]] and the Biblical king [[David]],{{sfn|Herrin|2009|p=11}} by the legates at the Council of Chalcedon.{{sfn|Bjornlie|2016|p=60}}\n\n===Economic and legal policy===\nAt the beginning of Marcian's reign, the Eastern Roman treasury was almost bankrupt, the result of the huge tributes paid to Attila by Theodosius. Marcian reversed this near bankruptcy, not by levying new taxes, but by cutting expenditure.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Upon his accession, he declared a remission of all debts owed to the state.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian attempted to improve the efficiency of the state in multiple ways.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian laid out legal reforms in his [[Novel (Roman law)|novels]], or codes of law, containing 20 laws, many of which were targeted at reducing the corruption and abuses of office that had existed during the reign of Theodosius; five of which are preserved in full.{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=217}}{{sfn|Pharr|Davidson|Pharr|2001|p=562}}\n\nMarcian mandated that the office of [[praetorship]] (officer in charge of public games and works) could only be given to [[Byzantine Senate#Admission and composition|senators]] who resided in Constantinople, attempted to curb the practice of selling administrative offices, and decreed that [[Roman consul|consuls]] should be responsible for the maintenance of [[Valens Aqueduct|Constantinople's aqueducts]]. He repealed the {{lang|la|[[Follis (tax)|follis]]}}, a tax on senators' property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] and praetors, held since the time of the [[Roman Republic]], to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. He further decreed that only a {{lang|la|[[vir illustris]]}} (a high-ranking man) could hold either office.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by [[Constantine I]], which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, [[freedwoman]], actress, or woman of no social status ({{lang|la|[[Honestiores and humiliores|humilis]]}}), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} By the time of his death, Marcian's shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of {{convert|100,000|lb}} of gold.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} \n\nIn 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed [[Paganism|pagan rites]] would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law.{{sfn|Evans|2002|p=66}}\n\n===Politics===\nWhen Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=97}} and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire.

Despite Aspar's great influence, the Eastern Roman elites retained much of their anti-German sentiment.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian's principal advisors were Pulcheria, [[Euphemius (Magister officiorum)|Euphemius]] the {{lang|la|[[magister officiorum]]}} (master of offices), [[Palladius (praetor)|Palladius]] the praetor, and [[Anatolius of Constantinople]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=305}} In 453, Marcian had his daughter from a previous marriage, [[Marcia Euphemia]], marry [[Anthemius]], an aristocrat and talented general.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}\n\nMarcian patronized the Blues, who were one of the [[Deme#Later usage|two circus teams]], the other being the Greens. The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcus censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years. Marcian's patronage of the Blues may have had personal motivations, as the once powerful Chrysaphius had been favorable to the Greens.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Christophilopoulou|1986|p=286}}{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=85}}\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe Armenian king [[Vardan II Mamikonian]], who was leading a revolt against the Sassanian Empire, sent an embassy to Theodosius in 450, composed of his brother [[Hmayeak Mamikonian]], along with [[Atom Gnuni]], [[Vardan Amatuni]], and [[Meruzhan Artsruni (emissary)|Meruzhan Artsruni]], to ask for assistance. Theodosius received it favorably. Any plans were cut short by his death and the accession of Marcian.{{Sfn|Manoogian|1984|p=23}}{{Sfn|Lacey|2016|p=142}} Marcian was counseled by the diplomat [[Anatolius (consul)|Anatolius]] and {{lang|la|patricius}} [[Florentius (consul 429)|Florentius]] not to make war with the Sassanians, as it would engulf a large amount of the Eastern Roman military resources, and thus Marcian did not agree to help them.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=85\u201386}}{{sfn|Amirav|2015|p=55 & 93}}\n\nKing [[Gubazes I of Lazica]]\u2014a Caucasian state in theory under Eastern Roman suzerainty\u2014was attempting to form an alliance with the Sassanians to break free of Roman control in 456.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|p=346}} Marcian's troops invaded Lazica and restored Roman rule.{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=174}} In 455 Marcian banned the export to barbarian tribes of weapons and the tools used to manufacture them.{{sfn|Holmes|Singleton|Jones|2001}}\n\n===Relationship with the Western Roman Empire===\nMarcian was elected without any consultation with the Western Roman Emperor, Valentinian&nbsp;III\u2013 a clear indication of further separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires than before his reign.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=42}} Valentinian would later recognize Marcian as the Eastern Roman Emperor, although the date of his recognition is disputed; Lee states that Valentinian recognized Marcian in March 452,{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}} whereas historian [[Timothy E.

When the Vandals [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacked Rome]] in 455, after [[Petronius Maximus]] assassinated Valentinian&nbsp;III and broke an [[engagement]] treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly due to the influence of Aspar. He merely sent an envoy demanding that the Vandals return the [[Dowager Empress]], [[Licinia Eudoxia]] and her daughters by Valentinian III, [[Placidia]] and [[Eudocia (daughter of Valentinian&nbsp;III)|Eudocia]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} A likely false account is given that Marcian, while captured by the Vandals in his youth, was shaded by an eagle while the other prisoners suffered the hot sun. According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcia pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor.{{efn|name=A|Propaganda involving the story of an eagle blocking the sun, and another figure recognizing they would be emperor, was used by both Byzantine emperors [[Philippikos Bardanes]] and [[Basil&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|Lilie|2014|p=193}}}} This account originates from [[Priscus]], who served as an advisor to Marcian's confidant, Euphemius. Due to Euphemius' influence over foreign policy, some historians, such as [[Edward Arthur Thompson]], have suggested that this account was a part of official imperial propaganda, which was generated to excuse Marcian's lack of retribution towards the Vandals, and quell any discontent.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=68}} Marcian made several diplomatic attempts to have the prisoners returned, before finally beginning to plan an invasion of the Vandal's territory shortly before his death.{{sfn|Clover|1978|pp=193\u2013194}} The historian [[Frank Clover]] has suggested that this sudden reversal of policy was caused by the marriage of Eudocia to [[Huneric]], the son of Gaiseric, which led to such pressure from Eastern Roman elites that Marcian was forced to begin preparations for war to ensure the return of the hostages. Around this time, Marcian made peace with Lazica, which would allow him to direct his attention elsewhere. The East Roman historian [[Theodorus Lector]] speaks of Marcian's sudden reversal of policy, and [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war, in either late 556 or early 557.{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=243}}\n\nMarcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize [[Avitus]], who succeeded Maximus.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=704}} Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian [[Hydatius]] states that in 455 Avitus sent ambassadors to Marcian \"for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ({{lang|la|concordia}} in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]], [[J. B. Bury]], and [[William Bayless]] consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; [[Ernst Stein]] suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas [[Norman Baynes]] believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}{{sfn|Baynes|1922|p=223}} Classicist [[Courtenay Edward Stevens]] interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey Nathan]] suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Death==\nMarcian's reign ended on 26 January 457, when he died, possibly of [[gangrene]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} [[Theodorus Lector]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]] say that Marcian died after a long religious procession from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Grand Palace]] to the [[Hebdomon]], where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk due to severe foot [[inflammation]], possibly [[gout]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Kelly|2013|p=240}} He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} in a [[Porphyry (geology)#Imperial sarcophagi|porphyry sarcophagus]] that was described in the 10th century by [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in the {{lang|la|[[De Ceremoniis]]}}.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1948|pp=p1 & 3\u201326}} He left the Eastern Empire with seven million [[solidi]] in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=127}} \n\nAlthough Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in one of the praesental armies\u2014two field armies based near Constantinople. A later source claims that the [[Eastern Roman Senate]] offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: \"I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me\". This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an [[Arian]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=92, 98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} or else to his Alanic heritage.{{sfn|Norwich|1998|p=51}}\n\nAnthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the [[Western Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|emperor]];{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}} Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor [[Libius Severus]] since 465.

Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck: not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems; further, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1297}} He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout \"Reign like Marcian!\" at the installation of future emperors.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}}\n\nThe Prefect of Constantinople [[Tatianus]] built a [[Column of Marcian|column]] dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=1053\u20131054}}{{sfn|D'Ayala |Fodde |2008|p=1167}} It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]],{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=204}} though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost.{{sfn|Freely|\u00c7akmak|2004|p=63}} Marcian also had a statue in the [[Forum of Arcadius]], which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor [[Arcadius]].{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991a|p=1347}} Marcian may have been the sponsor of the [[Chrysotriklinos]] of the Great Palace of Constantinople.
