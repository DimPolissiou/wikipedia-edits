He left school at 16 to become a junior reporter with the ''[[Western Daily Press]]''. At 18 he left to do two years of [[National Service]] and spoke into a microphone for the first time when he became a radio operator in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), serving one year at [[RAF Seletar]] in Singapore.\n\nBack in [[Bristol]] with the ''Western Daily Press'' in the autumn of 1948, Tidmarsh began to specialise in sport, reporting each week on [[Bristol Rovers]]. After doing a \"live\" commentary one Saturday for the newly created [[Hospital Radio]] Service, the BBC Controller in West Region, the former war correspondent [[Frank Gillard]], offered him a job, initially as a resident freelance, reporting and presenting the regional magazine ''The Week in the West''. He later joined the staff as the regional organiser of coverage for national television news.\n\nAfter four years in Bristol, Tidmarsh was invited to join the reporting staff at [[Broadcasting House]] in London and within two months was sent on a four-month assignment at the [[United Nations Headquarters|United Nations]] in New York.\n\nBack in England, Tidmarsh worked at [[Alexandra Palace]], the headquarters of BBC Television News, and presented the daily news magazine for South East England, ''Town and Around''. Occasionally he presented the national news and later joined [[Gerald Priestland]] to present the first ever two-handed news presentation, which was on the newly created [[BBC2]].\n\nFor most of his remaining years on the staff he worked out of Broadcasting House, where from time to time he stood in for [[Jack de Manio]], presenting the popular ''[[Today programme]]''. Most of the time he was reporting on foreign news, often in France during the crisis over [[Charles de Gaulle]] and independence for [[Algeria]]. He covered the final talks for Algerian independence at [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains]] and was actually in [[Algiers]] on Independence Day.\n\nTidmarsh had many more overseas assignments, including the revolt in [[Lebanon]] in June 1958 to overthrow [[Camille Chamoun]], the two wars between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in 1962 and 1965, a three-month assignment in [[Vietnam]] in 1965 and the USA, where he covered the whole of the [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Civil Rights March]] from [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] in [[Alabama]], led by [[Martin Luther King]].\n\nIn 1966, Tidmarsh resigned from the staff and set himself up as a correspondent for the BBC in Brussels (a \"[[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]]\"). From there he flew to London every Thursday morning, back again on Friday night, after presenting [[Outlook (radio programme)|''Outlook'']], a new current affairs and magazine programme which he had been asked to join on BBC World Service. He thus became the BBC's first European commuter, before returning to Britain in 1968.\n\nTraditionalists said that ''Outlook'' would not last six months.

When John finally retired in 1998, shortly after his 70th birthday, he had been with the programme for more than 30 years.

They are particularly distinguished from other turtles by being land-dwelling, while many (though not all) other turtle species are at least partly aquatic. Like other turtles, tortoises have a [[turtle shell|shell]] to protect from predation and other threats. The shell in tortoises is generally hard, and like other members of the suborder [[Cryptodira]], they retract their necks and heads directly backwards into the shell to protect them.\n\nTortoises are unique among [[vertebrates]] in that the [[pectoral girdle|pectoral]] and [[pelvic girdle]]s are inside the ribcage rather than outside. Tortoises can vary in dimension from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals with tendencies to be [[crepuscular]] depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally [[reclusive]] animals. Tortoises are the longest-living land animal in the world, although the longest-living species of tortoise is a matter of debate. [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]s are noted to live over 150 years, but an [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] named [[Adwaita]] may have lived an estimated 255 years. In general, most tortoise species can live 80\u2013150 years.\n\n==Terminology==\nDifferences exist in usage of the common terms [[turtle]], tortoise, and [[terrapin]], depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory.<ref name=\"Simoons\">Simoons, Frederick J.

Incubation is characteristically long in most species, the average incubation period are between 100 and 160 days. Egg-laying typically occurs at night, after which the mother tortoise covers her [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] with sand, soil, and organic material. The eggs are left unattended, and depending on the species, take from 60 to 120 days to incubate.<ref name=\"Incubation\">{{cite web|author=Highfield, Andy|url=http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|title=Tortoise egg incubation|publisher=Tortoisetrust.org|accessdate=2009-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905231033/http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|archive-date=2013-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The size of the egg depends on the size of the mother and can be estimated by examining the width of the [[cloacal]] opening between the [[carapace]] and [[Turtle shell#Plastron|plastron]]. The plastron of a female tortoise often has a noticeable V-shaped notch below the tail which facilitates passing the eggs. Upon completion of the incubation period, a fully formed [[hatchling]] uses an [[egg tooth]] to break out of its shell. It digs to the surface of the nest and begins a life of survival on its own. They are hatched with an embryonic egg sac which serves as a source of nutrition for the first three to seven days until they have the strength and mobility to find food. Juvenile tortoises often require a different balance of nutrients than adults, so may eat foods which a more mature tortoise would not. For example, the young of a strictly [[herbivory|herbivorous]] species commonly will consume [[worm]]s or insect [[larva]]e for additional protein.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe number of concentric rings on the carapace, much like the cross-section of a [[tree]], can sometimes give a clue to how old the animal is, but, since the growth depends highly on the accessibility of food and water, a tortoise that has access to plenty of [[forage]] (or is regularly fed by its owner) with no seasonal variation will have no noticeable rings. Moreover, some tortoises grow more than one ring per season, and in some others, due to wear, some rings are no longer visible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Veterinary Services Department, Drs.

The females, as a general rule, have smaller tails, dropped down, whereas the males have much longer tails which are usually pulled up and to the side of the rear shell.\n\n===Brain===\nThe brain of a tortoise is extremely small. The tortoises, from Central and South America, do not have an area in the brain called the [[hippocampus]], which relates to emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. Studies have shown that red-footed tortoises may rely on an area of the brain called the medial cortex for emotional actions, an area that humans use for actions such as decision making.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/47155-tortoise-touchscreen-learning.html|title=Tortoises Show Off Smarts by Mastering Touch-Screen Tech|newspaper=Live Science|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[Francesco Redi]] performed an experiment that involved removing the brain of a land tortoise, which then proceeded to live six months.

Too much protein is detrimental in herbivorous species, and has been associated with shell deformities and other medical problems.

They are particularly distinguished from other turtles by being land-dwelling, while many (though not all) other turtle species are at least partly aquatic. Like other turtles, tortoises have a [[turtle shell|shell]] to protect from predation and other threats. The shell in tortoises is generally hard, and like other members of the suborder [[Cryptodira]], they retract their necks and heads directly backwards into the shell to protect them.\n\nTortoises are unique among [[vertebrates]] in that the [[pectoral girdle|pectoral]] and [[pelvic girdle]]s are inside the ribcage rather than outside. Tortoises can vary in dimension from a few centimeters to two meters. They are usually [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animals with tendencies to be [[crepuscular]] depending on the ambient temperatures. They are generally [[reclusive]] animals. Tortoises are the longest-living land animal in the world, although the longest-living species of tortoise is a matter of debate. [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise]]s are noted to live over 150 years, but an [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] named [[Adwaita]] may have lived an estimated 255 years. In general, most tortoise species can live 80\u2013150 years.\n\n==Terminology==\nDifferences exist in usage of the common terms [[turtle]], tortoise, and [[terrapin]], depending on the variety of English being used; usage is inconsistent and contradictory.<ref name=\"Simoons\">Simoons, Frederick J.

Incubation is characteristically long in most species, the average incubation period are between 100 and 160 days. Egg-laying typically occurs at night, after which the mother tortoise covers her [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] with sand, soil, and organic material. The eggs are left unattended, and depending on the species, take from 60 to 120 days to incubate.<ref name=\"Incubation\">{{cite web|author=Highfield, Andy|url=http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|title=Tortoise egg incubation|publisher=Tortoisetrust.org|accessdate=2009-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905231033/http://www.tortoisetrust.org/articles/eggfaq.html|archive-date=2013-09-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> The size of the egg depends on the size of the mother and can be estimated by examining the width of the [[cloacal]] opening between the [[carapace]] and [[Turtle shell#Plastron|plastron]]. The plastron of a female tortoise often has a noticeable V-shaped notch below the tail which facilitates passing the eggs. Upon completion of the incubation period, a fully formed [[hatchling]] uses an [[egg tooth]] to break out of its shell. It digs to the surface of the nest and begins a life of survival on its own. They are hatched with an embryonic egg sac which serves as a source of nutrition for the first three to seven days until they have the strength and mobility to find food. Juvenile tortoises often require a different balance of nutrients than adults, so may eat foods which a more mature tortoise would not. For example, the young of a strictly [[herbivory|herbivorous]] species commonly will consume [[worm]]s or insect [[larva]]e for additional protein.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe number of concentric rings on the carapace, much like the cross-section of a [[tree]], can sometimes give a clue to how old the animal is, but, since the growth depends highly on the accessibility of food and water, a tortoise that has access to plenty of [[forage]] (or is regularly fed by its owner) with no seasonal variation will have no noticeable rings. Moreover, some tortoises grow more than one ring per season, and in some others, due to wear, some rings are no longer visible.<ref>{{cite web|last=Veterinary Services Department, Drs.

The easiest way to determine the sex of a tortoise is to look at the tail. The females, as a general rule, have smaller tails, dropped down, whereas the males have much longer tails which are usually pulled up and to the side of the rear shell.\n\n===Brain===\nThe brain of a tortoise is extremely small. The tortoises, from Central and South America, do not have an area in the brain called the [[hippocampus]], which relates to emotion, learning, memory and spatial navigation. Studies have shown that red-footed tortoises may rely on an area of the brain called the medial cortex for emotional actions, an area that humans use for actions such as decision making.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/47155-tortoise-touchscreen-learning.html|title=Tortoises Show Off Smarts by Mastering Touch-Screen Tech|newspaper=Live Science|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[Francesco Redi]] performed an experiment that involved removing the brain of a land tortoise, which then proceeded to live six months. Freshwater tortoises, when subjected to the same experiment, continued similarly, but did not live so long.

Pet tortoises typically require diets based on wild grasses, weeds, leafy greens and certain flowers. Certain species consume [[worm]]s or [[insect]]s and carrion in their normal habitats. Too much protein is detrimental in herbivorous species, and has been associated with shell deformities and other medical problems. As different tortoise species vary greatly in their nutritional requirements, it is essential to thoroughly research the dietary needs of individual tortoises.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThis species list largely follows [[Turtle Taxonomy Working Group]] (2019)<ref name=iucn>{{cite journal|url=http://images.turtleconservancy.org/documents/2017/crm-7-checklist-atlas-v8-2017.pdf |title=Turtles of the world, 2017 update: Annotated checklist and atlas of taxonomy, synonymy, distribution, and conservation status(8th Ed.)|journal=Chelonian Research Monographs |volume=7 |accessdate=October 4, 2019|date=August 3, 2017 |last1=Rhodin | first1=Anders G.J. |last2=Inverson |first2=John B. |last3=Roger |first3=Bour |last4=Fritz |first4=Uwe |last5=Georges |first5=Arthur |last6=Shaffer |first6=H.

On the May 14 edition of ''Raw'', the [[Professional wrestling authority figures|general manager]] of Raw and SmackDown [[John Laurinaitis]] fired Big Show for making fun of his voice. At [[Over the Limit (2012)|Over the Limit]], just before John Cena would defeat Laurinaitis, Big Show turned heel and used his [[Hook (boxing)|WMD]] (Weapon of Mass Destruction) finisher to incapacitate Cena, allowing Laurinaitis to pin Cena and keep his job as General Manager of ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown''. The next night on ''Raw'', Laurinaitis revealed that he gave Big Show back his job, complete with an ironclad contract with a bonus on the condition that he would take out Cena as Show was exempt from the \"no interference\" stipulation for the match. Show stated that he only helped Laurinaitis when he didn't receive any sympathy from the other Superstars, and because of his ironclad contract, started attacking every superstar on the WWE roster in revenge. Laurinaitis would soon book a match between Cena and Big Show inside a steel cage for the pay-per-view. On the June 11 edition of ''Raw'', [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] returned to evaluate Laurinaitis's job, but was interrupted by the Big Show, at which point Mr. McMahon announced that if Big Show lost, Laurinaitis would be fired, at which point the Big Show knocked out Mr. McMahon with the WMD after Cena ducked. On the June 15 episode of ''SmackDown,'' Laurinaitis announced the stipulation if Cena lost, he would be fired, at which point Cena knocked Laurinaitis out.\n\nThe main event of SmackDown was originally [[Sheamus]] defending his [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Alberto Del Rio]]. Following a successful title defense by Sheamus against Del Rio, [[Randy Orton]] and [[Chris Jericho]] at Over the Limit, Del Rio, Orton and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] competed in a triple threat match on the May 25 edition of ''SmackDown'' to earn a title match against Sheamus at No Way Out, which Del Rio won. However, Del Rio was pulled from the match following a concussion during the June 8 episode of ''SmackDown''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/2012/del-rio-concussion|title=Concussion wipes out Alberto Del Rio for No Way Out|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> On the June 11 edition of ''Raw'', [[Dolph Ziggler]] defeated [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]], [[Jack Swagger]] and [[The Great Khali]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|fatal-four way elimination match]] to become the new number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nThe main event of Raw involved the [[WWE Champion]] [[CM Punk]] defending his title in a Triple Threat match against [[Daniel Bryan]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. On the May 18 edition of ''SmackDown,'' Punk was put in a match against Kane, where Bryan was in commentary observing the match. Bryan would run interference by attacking Kane with a steel chair and making it look like Punk did it, causing Kane to attack Punk with the chair. On the May 21 edition of ''Raw'', Bryan, who demanded a rematch due to Punk tapping out moments after scoring the pin during their WWE Championship match at Over the Limit, was facing off against Kane, set up by Punk in which the situation nearly reversed itself. Afterwards, Kane would start attacking both indiscriminately after being a pawn in each of their plans. On the June 1 episode of ''SmackDown'', which involved Punk defending the WWE Championship against Kane, Bryan would interfere in the match, attacking both once more, only for Kane to [[Chokeslam|chokeslam]] both Bryan and Punk. Afterwards, John Laurinaitis came out to announce a triple threat match involving Punk, Bryan and Kane for the WWE Championship at No Way Out.\n\n==Event==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=3|English [[Sportscaster|Commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish Commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodriguez]]\n|-\n|Backstage [[interviewer]]\n|[[Matt Striker]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Lilian Garcia]]\n|-\n|[[Justin Roberts]]\n|-\n|rowspan=5|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mike Chioda]]\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] \n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|[[Scott Armstrong (wrestler)|Scott Armstrong]]\n|-\n|Chad Patton\n|}\n\n===Pre-show===\nThe pre-show featured Brodus Clay defeating David Otunga by countout.\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nThe event opened with [[Sheamus]] defending the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Dolph Ziggler]].

On the May 14 edition of ''Raw'', the [[Professional wrestling authority figures|general manager]] of Raw and SmackDown [[John Laurinaitis]] fired Big Show for making fun of his voice. At [[Over the Limit (2012)|Over the Limit]], just before John Cena would defeat Laurinaitis, Big Show turned heel and used his [[Hook (boxing)|WMD]] (Weapon of Mass Destruction) finisher to incapacitate Cena, allowing Laurinaitis to pin Cena and keep his job as General Manager of ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown''. The next night on ''Raw'', Laurinaitis revealed that he gave Big Show back his job, complete with an ironclad contract with a bonus on the condition that he would take out Cena as Show was exempt from the \"no interference\" stipulation for the match. Show stated that he only helped Laurinaitis when he didn't receive any sympathy from the other Superstars, and because of his ironclad contract, started attacking every superstar on the WWE roster in revenge. Laurinaitis would soon book a match between Cena and Big Show inside a steel cage for the pay-per-view. On the June 11 edition of ''Raw'', [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] returned to evaluate Laurinaitis's job, but was interrupted by the Big Show, at which point Mr. McMahon announced that if Big Show lost, Laurinaitis would be fired, at which point the Big Show knocked out Mr. McMahon with the WMD after Cena ducked. On the June 15 episode of ''SmackDown,'' Laurinaitis announced the stipulation if Cena lost, he would be fired, at which point Cena knocked Laurinaitis out.\n\nThe main event of SmackDown was originally [[Sheamus]] defending his [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Alberto Del Rio]]. Following a successful title defense by Sheamus against Del Rio, [[Randy Orton]] and [[Chris Jericho]] at Over the Limit, Del Rio, Orton and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] competed in a triple threat match on the May 25 edition of ''SmackDown'' to earn a title match against Sheamus at No Way Out, which Del Rio won. However, Del Rio was pulled from the match following a concussion during the June 8 episode of ''SmackDown''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/2012/del-rio-concussion|title=Concussion wipes out Alberto Del Rio for No Way Out|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2012-06-11}}</ref> On the June 11 edition of ''Raw'', [[Dolph Ziggler]] defeated [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]], [[Jack Swagger]] and [[The Great Khali]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic elimination matches|fatal-four way elimination match]] to become the new number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nThe main event of Raw involved the [[WWE Champion]] [[CM Punk]] defending his title in a Triple Threat match against [[Daniel Bryan]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. On the May 18 edition of ''SmackDown,'' Punk was put in a match against Kane, where Bryan was in commentary observing the match. Bryan would run interference by attacking Kane with a steel chair and making it look like Punk did it, causing Kane to attack Punk with the chair. On the May 21 edition of ''Raw'', Bryan, who demanded a rematch due to Punk tapping out moments after scoring the pin during their WWE Championship match at Over the Limit, was facing off against Kane, set up by Punk in which the situation nearly reversed itself. Afterwards, Kane would start attacking both indiscriminately after being a pawn in each of their plans. On the June 1 episode of ''SmackDown'', which involved Punk defending the WWE Championship against Kane, Bryan would interfere in the match, attacking both once more, only for Kane to [[Chokeslam|chokeslam]] both Bryan and Punk. Afterwards, John Laurinaitis came out to announce a triple threat match involving Punk, Bryan and Kane for the WWE Championship at No Way Out.\n\n==Event==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=3|English [[Sportscaster|Commentators]]\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]]\n|-\n|[[Jerry Lawler]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish Commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodriguez]]\n|-\n|Backstage [[interviewer]]\n|[[Matt Striker]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|[[Lilian Garcia]]\n|-\n|[[Justin Roberts]]\n|-\n|rowspan=5|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|[[Mike Chioda]]\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] \n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|[[Scott Armstrong (wrestler)|Scott Armstrong]]\n|-\n|Chad Patton\n|}\n\n===Pre-show===\nThe pre-show featured Brodus Clay defeating David Otunga by countout.\n\n===Preliminary matches===\nThe event opened with [[Sheamus]] defending the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Dolph Ziggler]].

(In spite of the unanimous testimony of published texts of the Septuagint, [[Kaufmann Kohler]] says that the Greek Septuagint translation is \"[[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphoros]]\".)<ref name=Kohler1923/> --> Similarly the [[Vulgate]] renders \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc in [[Latin]] as ''Lucifer'', the name in that language for the morning star. According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit. Those who see you stare at you, they ponder your fate: 'Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble, the man who made the world a wilderness, who overthrew its cities and would not let his captives go home?'<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:12\u201317|NIV}}</ref>}}\n\nJ. Carl Laney has pointed out that in the final verses here quoted, the king of Babylon is described not as a god or an angel but as a man, and that man may have been not [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], but rather his son, [[Belshazzar]]. Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.<ref name=Laney/><ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}</ref>\n\nFor the unnamed<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 |title=Isaiah: God's Poet of Light |author=Carol J.

According to the [[King James Bible]]-based [[Strong's Concordance]], the original Hebrew word means \"shining one, light-bearer\", and the English translation given in the King James text is the Latin name for the planet Venus, \"Lucifer\",<ref name=\"H1966\"/> as it was already in the [[Wycliffe Bible]].\n\nHowever, the translation of \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"Lucifer\" has been abandoned in modern English translations of Isaiah 14:12. Present-day translations render \u05d4\u05b5\u05d9\u05dc\u05b5\u05dc as \"morning star\" ([[New International Version]], [[New Century Version]], [[New American Standard Bible]], [[Good News Bible|Good News Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[Contemporary English Version]], [[Common English Bible]], [[Messianic Bible translations|Complete Jewish Bible]]), \"daystar\" ([[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]), \"Day Star\" ([[New Revised Standard Version]], [[English Standard Version]]), \"shining one\" ([[New Life Version]], [[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures|New World Translation]], [[JPS Tanakh]]), or \"shining star\" ([[New Living Translation]]).\n\nIn a modern translation from the original Hebrew, the passage in which the phrase \"Lucifer\" or \"morning star\" occurs begins with the statement: \"On the day the Lord gives you relief from your suffering and turmoil and from the harsh labour forced on you, you will take up this taunt against the king of Babylon: How the oppressor has come to an end! How his fury has ended!\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:3\u20134|NIV}}</ref> After describing the death of the king, the taunt continues:\n\n{{quote|How you have fallen from heaven, ''morning star'', son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of [[Mount Aqraa|Mount Zaphon]]. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.

Nebuchadnezzar was gripped by a spiritual fervor to build a temple to the moon god [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]], and his son ruled as regent. The Abrahamic scriptural texts could be interpreted as a weak usurping of true kingly power, and a taunt at the failed regency of Belshazzar.<ref name=Laney/><ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|14:16|NIV}}</ref>\n\nFor the unnamed<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Yf-BVeN6TbIC&pg=PA34&lpg=PA34&dq=Dempsey+%22king+remains+obscure%22 |title=Isaiah: God's Poet of Light |author=Carol J.

In what is known as the [[Taxil hoax]], he alleged that leading Freemason [[Albert Pike]] had addressed \"The 23 Supreme Confederated Councils of the world\" (an invention of Taxil), instructing them that Lucifer was God, and was in opposition to the evil god [[Adonai]].

As described by ''Freemasonry Disclosed'' in 1897:\n{{quote|With frightening cynicism, the miserable person we shall not name here [Taxil] declared before an assembly especially convened for him that for twelve years he had prepared and carried out to the end the most sacrilegious of hoaxes.

We are now giving in this issue a complete list of these articles, which can now be considered as not having existed.<ref>''Freemasonry Disclosed'' April 1897</ref>}}\n\nSupporters of Freemasonry assert that, when Albert Pike and other Masonic scholars spoke about the \"Luciferian path,\" or the \"energies of Lucifer,\" they were referring to the Morning Star, the light bearer, the search for light; the very antithesis of dark. Pike says in Morals and Dogma, \"Lucifer, the Son of the Morning! Is it ''he'' who bears the Light, and with its splendors intolerable blinds feeble, sensual, or selfish Souls?

(2009). Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character. Pp. 40-60 in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing.</ref> In Leland's mythology, Diana pursued her brother Lucifer across the sky as a cat pursues a mouse. According to Leland, after dividing herself into light and darkness:\n:\"...Diana saw that the light was so beautiful, the light which was her other half, her brother Lucifer, she yearned for it with exceeding great desire. Wishing to receive the light again into her darkness, to swallow it up in rapture, in delight, she trembled with desire. This desire was the Dawn. But Lucifer, the light, fled from her, and would not yield to her wishes; he was the light which files into the most distant parts of heaven, the mouse which flies before the cat.\"<ref name=aradia>Charles G. Leland, ''Aradia: The Gospel of Witches'', Theophania Publishing, US, 2010</ref>\n\nHere, the motions of Diana and Lucifer once again mirror the celestial motions of the moon and Venus, respectively.<ref name=stregheria>Magliocco, Sabina.
