The elections were later called in early October 2012 after failure to agree on the budget for the 2013 fiscal year.\n\nThe elections saw the [[Likud Yisrael Beiteinu]] alliance emerge as the largest faction in the Knesset, winning 31 of the 120 seats.

Some left-wing figures stated that the operation was actually an \"Election War\" aimed at putting aside socio-economic issues and replacing them with a defense agenda, and claimed that the operation would not help Israel in the long term.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.1864921 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e1\u05d9 \u05e9\u05e8\u05d9\u05d3 | \u05d7\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05de\u05d3 \u05d2'\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9: \u05d1\u05e1\u05e8\u05d8 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4 \u05db\u05d1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5 - \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5]</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.co.il/1.1864907 \u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05e9\u05d2\u05d1 | \u05d7\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05dc \u05d0\u05d7\u05de\u05d3 \u05d2'\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9: \u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d1\u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea - \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5]</ref>\n\nAfter the Israeli government signed the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, a number of figures in the Israeli right-wing political spectrum, including [[Naftali Bennett]] and [[Aryeh Eldad]], criticized the government's decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4309598,00.html |title=ynet \u05d1\u05e0\u05d8 \u05e0\u05d2\u05d3 \u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5: \"\u05d0\u05d5\u05d1\u05d3\u05df \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7 \u05dc\u05d7\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d6\u05d4\" - \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea |publisher=Ynet.co.il |date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mako.co.il/video-blogs-mati-shemoelof/Article-3bf891d191e1b31004.htm \u05de\u05e4\u05dc\u05d2\u05ea \u05e2\u05d5\u05e6\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05e6\u05d9\u05d2\u05d4: \u05e4\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05d6\u05dd \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9]</ref> During the operation and the shelling of southern Israel, various parties declared that they would suspend their political campaign until the operation would end\u2014among them the Likud Party<ref>[http://www.inn.co.il/News/Flash.aspx/385935 \u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9\u05df \u05de\u05e9\u05d4\u05d4 \u05d0\u05ea \u05e7\u05de\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6 \u05e0\u05d5\u05db\u05d7 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d1 \u05d1\u05d3\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd - \u05de\u05d1\u05d6\u05e7\u05d9\u05dd - \u05e2\u05e8\u05d5\u05e5 7]</ref> and the opposition parties [[Kadima]] and the Labor party.<ref>[http://news.walla.co.il/elections/?w=/2780/2586282 \u05d1\u05d2\u05dc\u05dc \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05dc\u05de\u05d4: \u05d4\u05de\u05e4\u05dc\u05d2\u05d5\u05ea \u05de\u05e7\u05e4\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d0\u05ea \u05e7\u05de\u05e4\u05d9\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d1\u05d7\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea - \u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4!

The request further alleged that Zoabi rejects Israel's existence as a [[Jewish state|Jewish]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] state, which makes Knesset candidates eligible for disqualification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4317728,00.html |title=Elections Committee to discuss Zoabi's disqualification - Israel News, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=3 January 2013}}</ref> Zoabi called the sponsors of the request fascists and said that \"for whoever does not want citizens to have free elections, I am one of many targets ...\"<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Election-committee-to-debate-disqualifying-Zoabi Election committee to debate disqualifying Zoabi]</ref> After hearing the case, the Central Elections Committee disqualified Zoabi in a 19-9 vote.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/19/haneen-zoabi-disqualified-re-election-knesset</ref> The [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israeli Supreme Court]] unanimously overturned the disqualification.<ref>[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4326059,00.html]</ref>\n\n===Kadima===\n\n{{main|Kadima leadership election, 2012}}\n{| style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em; clear:left; width:300px;\" class=\"toccolours\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background: #EEE; text-align: center;\" | '''Kadima leadership election'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"width:50%;\" | <u>'''Mofaz'''</u> || style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\" | <u>'''Livni'''</u>\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"width:50%;\" | 62.3% (<small>23,987</small>) || style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\" | 37.7% (<small>14,516</small>)\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background: #EEE; text-align: center;\" | '''The [[Kadima]] list'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n<div style=\"overflow-y:scroll;height:75px;\">\n{| style=\"width:100%; font-size: 8pt\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:8px\" | 1\n| style= | [[Shaul Mofaz]]\n| style=\"width:8px\" | 2\n| style=\"width:40%\" | [[Yisrael Hasson]]\n|-\n| 3\n| [[Yohanan Plesner]]\n| 4\n| [[Ronit Tirosh]]\n|-\n| 5\n| [[Shai Hermesh]]\n| 6\n| [[Yuval Tzelner]]\n|-\n| 7\n| [[Doron Avital]]\n| 8\n| [[Akram Hasson]]\n|-\n| 9\n| [[Ahmad Dabbah]]\n| 10\n| [[Eti Livni]]\n|}</div>\n|}\n[[File:Mofaz portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The winner of the Kadima primaries - [[Shaul Mofaz]].]]\nPrime Minister Netanyahu's announcement about having early primaries in the Likud started a debate among the Kadima party members over when to hold leadership elections for their party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yallakadima.co.il/fullArticleDetails.aspx?id=2029 |title=\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05de\u05d4 &#124; \u05e0\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5 \u05d9\u05e6\u05dc\u05d9\u05d7 \u05d4\u05d9\u05db\u05df \u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e4\u05d6 \u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05db\u05d8\u05e8 \u05db\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5? |publisher=Yallakadima.co.il |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> Following increasing pressure to hold the election, party leader Tzipi Livni announced that the election for the leadership of Kadima would be held on 27 March 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=253268|title=Livni mulls March Kadima race|last=Hoffman|first=Gil|date=12 January 2012|work=jpost.com|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.co.il/site/newsletter_article.php?id=14093&newsletter=07.12.2011 |title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd &#124; \u05d7\"\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05de\u05d4: \"\u05d4\u05de\u05e4\u05dc\u05d2\u05d4 \u05ea\u05ea\u05e4\u05e8\u05e7 \u05d0\u05dd \u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d9\u05d5\u05e7\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\" |publisher=Israelhayom.co.il |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.walla.co.il/?w=/9/2501460 |title=\u05e6\u05d9\u05e4\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9: \u05dc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05db\u05e0\u05e2 \u05dc\u05e4\u05d5\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8\u05d9\u05e7\u05d4 \u05e7\u05d8\u05e0\u05d4, \u05d0\u05e0\u05e6\u05d7 \u05d1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6 - \u05d5\u05d5\u05d0\u05dc\u05d4! \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea |publisher=News.walla.co.il |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> In addition to Livni, party members [[Shaul Mofaz]] and [[Avi Dichter]] announced their intention to run for chairman position of the party.\n\nMofaz won the election 62.3% to 37.7% with a turnout of approximately 40%.<ref name=\"result\">{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/154231#.T3JFNo6aPws|title=Mofaz Wins Kadima Leadership|last=Benari|first=Elad|date=28 March 2012|work=Israel National News|publisher=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=27 March 2012}}</ref> Livni later resigned from her seat in Knesset complaining that Israel was sitting \"on a volcano.

The elections were later called in early October 2012 after failure to agree on the budget for the 2013 fiscal year.\n\nThe elections saw the [[Likud Yisrael Beiteinu]] alliance emerge as the largest faction in the Knesset, winning 31 of the 120 seats.

On 17 January 2011, disillusionment with Barak, over his support for coalition policies, especially regarding the peace process, led to his resignation from the Labor Party with four other Knesset members to establish a new \"centrist, Zionist and democratic\" party named [[Independence (Israeli political party)|Independence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Article.aspx?id=203946|title=Barak: New faction to be 'centralist, Zionist, democratic'|last=Hoffman|first=Gil|author2=Herb Keinon|date=17 January 2011|work=jpost.com|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref> Following this move, all Labor Party government ministers resigned. Splitting the Labour Party enabled Barak to keep a faction of Labour MKs loyal to him within Netanyahu's coalition, preventing the departure of all 13 Labour MKs from the coalition. Due to the split, the party remained without a chairman for a while and was even regarded in the public and the media as a party in demise. However, Barak's departure led to increased interest in the party, particularly since the remaining members began campaigning to win the position of party chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleID=828832 |title=\u05e0\u05e2\u05e0\u05e210 - \u05d9\u05de\u05de\u05d4 \u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05d6 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4: 4 \u05d4\u05de\u05ea\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05ea\u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d5\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d1\u05d8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05d5\u05df - \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea |publisher=News.nana10.co.il |date=17 June 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the first round of voting, which was held on 12 September 2011, MK Shelly Yacimovich managed to get first position, and was followed, in a low margin, by [[Amir Peretz]].

She was the first female physician with a university education in her country. She was also a feminist and a politician, and engaged in the questions of sexual education and female suffrage. She was chairwoman of the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] and a member of the Stockholm city council.\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m 001.jpg|thumb|left|Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]]\n\nKarolina Widerstr\u00f6m was the daughter of the gymnastic teacher and veterinarian Otto Fredrik Widerstr\u00f6m and Olivia Erika Dill\u00e9n. The family moved to Stockholm in 1873.\n\n===Education===\nWomen were officially admitted to the universities in Sweden in 1870. Her father wished for her to be a gymnastic teacher like himself. In 1873\u20131875, Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m was a student at the [[Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences|Royal Central Gymnastics Institute]], and in 1875\u20131877, she was the assistant to Professor Branting. She was also active as a medical gymnast. In 1879, she received her exam at ''[[Wallinska skolan]]'' and in 1880 her exam in medical philosophy at the university at Uppsala. In May 1884, she received her medical exam at the ''[[Karolinska Institutet]]'' in Stockholm.\n\n===Medical career===\nWiderstr\u00f6m wanted women and girls to know more about their own bodies, to dress more healthily, and to receive the same rights and possibilities as men. She was especially active within gynecology and women's health.

She was the first female physician with a university education in her country. She was also a feminist and a politician, and engaged in the questions of sexual education and female suffrage. She was chairwoman of the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]] and a member of the Stockholm city council.\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m 001.jpg|thumb|left|Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m]]\n\nKarolina Widerstr\u00f6m was the daughter of the gymnastic teacher and veterinarian Otto Fredrik Widerstr\u00f6m and Olivia Erika Dill\u00e9n. The family moved to Stockholm in 1873.\n\n===Education===\nWomen were officially admitted to the universities in Sweden in 1870. Her father wished for her to be a gymnastic teacher like himself. In 1873\u20131875, Karolina Widerstr\u00f6m was a student at the [[Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences|Royal Central Gymnastics Institute]], and in 1875\u20131877, she was the assistant to Professor Branting. She was also active as a medical gymnast. In 1879, she received her exam at ''[[Wallinska skolan]]'' and in 1880 her exam in medical philosophy at the university at Uppsala. In May 1884, she received her medical exam at the ''[[Karolinska Institutet]]'' in Stockholm.\n\n===Medical career===\nWiderstr\u00f6m wanted women and girls to know more about their own bodies, to dress more healthily, and to receive the same rights and possibilities as men. She was especially active within gynecology and women's health.  Her best-known work within her field was ''Kvinnohygien'' ('Women's hygiene'), which was first published in 1899, and reprinted in seven editions until 1932. \n\n===Activism===\n\nConcerned for women's health issued, she was a strong supporter of the [[Svenska dr\u00e4gtreformf\u00f6reningen|Swedish Dress Reform Association]] and a vocal force in writing medical articles advocating against [[corset controversy|tight laced corsets]], which at this point in time was a serious health issue.<ref>Bagerius, Henric..

The Schengen Area was established separately from the [[European Communities]], when consensus could not be reached among all EC member states on the abolition of border controls.\n\nThe Agreement was supplemented in 1990 by the Schengen Convention, which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a common visa policy.<ref name=\"Baltic Legal\">{{citation |title=Schengen area by Latvian Law Firm |publisher=Baltic Legal|url=http://www.immigration-residency.eu/counsel/schengen-area/}}</ref> The Agreements and the rules adopted under them were entirely separate from the [[Institutions of the European Union|EC structures]], and led to the creation of the Schengen Area on 26 March 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biblio.ucv.ro/bib_web/bib_pdf/EU_books/0056.pdf |title=The Schengen Area |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nAs more EU member states signed the Schengen Agreement, consensus was reached on absorbing it into the procedures of the EU. The Agreement and its related conventions were incorporated into the mainstream of [[European Union law]] by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1997, which came into effect in 1999. A consequence of the Agreement being part of European law is that any amendment or regulation is made within its processes, in which the non-EU members are not participants. The UK and Ireland have operated a [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA) since 1923 (with passport-free travel and freedom of movement with each other), but the UK would not abolish border controls with any other counties and therefore opted out of the Agreement. While not signing the Schengen Treaty, Ireland has always looked more favourably on joining, but has not done so in order to maintain the CTA and its open border with [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0450/D.0450.199503140014.html Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, ''D\u00e1il Debates'' volume 450 column 1171 (14 March 1995)]; [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0501/D.0501.199903090246.htmlMinister for Justice, John O'Donoghue, ''D\u00e1il Debates'' volume 501 column 1506 (9 March 1999)]{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}; \"Declaration by Ireland on Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland\" attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam.</ref> The Nordic members required Norway and Iceland to be included, which was accepted, so a consensus could be reached.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n== Membership ==\n=== Current members ===\n{{Schengen Agreement Labelled Map 2}}\n\nThe Schengen Area consists of 26 states, including four which are not members of the [[European Union]] (EU).

Instead, the border guard should check the validity of the residence permit. (See Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of the provisions on stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0489:FIN:EN:PDF COM (2009) 489, p. 7]), \"The Commission is of the opinion that travel documents of third-country nationals who are in possession of a valid residence permit issued by a Schengen Member State should not be stamped. The purpose of stamping a passport serves to establish whether a third country national respected the authorised length of a short stay within the Schengen area.

As a result, the length of time taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), an entry check for an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute.<ref name=\"Entryexit2\"/> The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to a more thorough check) are even greater. For example, an entry check for an [[Visa policy of the European Union#Visa requirements for the Schengen Area, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania|Annex II]] national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three to five minutes on average in Slovakia.<ref name=\"Entryexit1\"/><ref name=\"Entryexit3\"/> Similarly, an entry check for an [[Visa policy of the European Union#Visa requirements for the Schengen Area, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania|Annex I]] national on average lasts around 30\u201360 seconds in The Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two to five minutes on average.<ref name=\"Entryexit1\"/>\n\nAfter the new regime came into force on 7 April 2017, significantly longer waiting times were reported at numerous external border crossing points, especially as it was just before the [[Easter]] holiday. Travellers entering [[Slovenia]] from [[Croatia]] (which, though a [[European Union member state]], is not yet part of the Schengen Area) had to wait several hours as Slovenian [[border guard]]s systematically checked the travel documents of all travellers (including those with the right of free movement) against relevant databases.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/c2dd5f19864e483080e44ec0a5c36af1 |title=New EU Border Controls Create Traffic Nightmare |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=2017-04-14 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref> The [[Prime Minister of Slovenia]], [[Miro Cerar]], acknowledged that the situation was 'unacceptable'.

As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the [[Finnish Border Guard]] at the automated border gates in [[Helsinki Airport]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]] and [[United States passport|United States]] [[biometric passport]]s,<ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.raja.fi/facts/news_from_the_border_guard/1/0/expanded_use_of_automated_border_control_gates_at_the_west_terminal_54569 |title=News from the Border Guard \u2013 The Finnish Border Guard |publisher=Raja.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}</ref> as well as by the Portuguese [[Servi\u00e7o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras]] at the automated border gates in [[Lisbon Airport]] where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Angolan passport|Angolan]] and [[Brazilian passport|Brazilian]] passports and holders of [[Diplomatic passport|diplomatic/service passports]]. This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of [[EGate (Italy)|eGates]] include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Israeli passport|Israeli]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United States passport|United States]] and [[Vatican passport|Vatican]] [[biometric passport]]s. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]] (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s), as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper with the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point where the state of facilities are such as to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them instead to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref> At the [[Port of Helsinki]], the [[Finnish Border Guard]] has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] (who, as [[Visa policy of the Schengen Area#Visa exemptions|Annex I]] nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.<ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"/>\n\nSometimes, external border controls are located on non-Schengen territory.

Further, since immigrants have the [[Right of asylum|right to apply for asylum]] at border control at ports of entry in the EU, though such applications must be made in person in the country where asylum status is sought, this measure has the effect of preventing prospective asylum seekers from boarding public transportation to the Schengen Area (unless they have already obtained a Schengen visa or are visa-exempt).\n\n=== Short-stay and transit visas ===\n[[File:Schengen visa requirements.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|'''Schengen Area visa lists'''\n{{legend|#003399|Schengen Area}}\n{{legend|#00A4E9|Other EU members outside Schengen Area but bound by same visa policy and special territories of the EU and Schengen member states.}}\n{{legend|#FFCC00|Members or former members of the EU with an independent visa policy}}\n{{legend|#22B14C|Visa-free access to the Schengen states for 90 days in any 180 day period, although some Annex II nationals can enjoy longer visa-free access in some circumstances (EC 539/2001 Annex II)}}\n{{legend|#ADADAD|Visa required to enter the Schengen states (EC 539/2001 Annex I)}}\n{{legend|#282828|Visa required for transit via the Schengen states (EC 810/2009 Annex IV)}}\n{{legend|#FFFFFF|Visa status unknown}}]]\n\n[[File:FRTD.jpg|thumb|Facilitated Rail Transit Document]]\n{{Main|Visa policy of the Schengen Area}}\n\nThe rules applicable to short-term entry visas into the Schengen Area are set out in EU regulations which contain two lists: a list of the nationalities (or classes of [[travel document]] holder) which require a visa for a short-term stay (the ''Annex I list'') and a list which do not (the ''Annex II list'').<ref name=\"visa regulations\">Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R0539:EN:NOT OJ L 81, 21 March 2001, p. 1]).</ref>\n\nBeing listed in the visa-free list will sometimes but not always exempt the listed nationality or class from the requirement to obtain a work permit if they wish to take up employment or self-employed activity during their stay; business trips are not normally considered employment in this sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/aufenthv/__17.html |title=Section 17 of the German Aufenthaltsverordnung |language=German |date=25 November 2004 |accessdate=28 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222171653/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/aufenthv/__17.html |archivedate=22 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Schengen visa fee ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nIn accordance with the guidelines of the European Union, any Schengen visa application has to be accompanied by a payment of visa fees.\nThe fees (processing + visa) are to be paid on the day the application is being submitted and are normally payable only in the local currency equivalent.

The Schengen Borders Code lists requirements which third-country nationals must meet to be allowed into the Schengen Area. For this purpose, a third-country national is a person who does ''not'' enjoy the [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|right of free movement]] (i.e. a person who is not an EU, EEA, Swiss or British citizen, nor a family member of such a person who is in possession of a [[Residence card of a family member of a Union citizen|residence permit with the indication \"family

a third-country national will need to hold either a long-stay visa for a period no longer than a year, or a residence permit for longer periods. A long-stay visa is a national visa but is issued in accordance with a uniform format. It entitles the holder to enter the Schengen Area and remain in the issuing state for a period longer than 90 days but no more than one year. If a Schengen state wishes to allow the holder of a long-stay visa to remain there for longer than a year, the state must issue him or her with a residence permit.\n\nThe holder of a long-stay visa or a residence permit is entitled to move freely within other states which compose the Schengen Area for a period of up to three months in any half-year.<ref>Regulation (EU) No 265/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 March 2010 amending the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement and Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards movement of persons with a long-stay visa ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010R0265:EN:NOT OJ L 85, 31 March 2010, p. 1])</ref> Third-country nationals who are [[Long-term resident (European Union)|long-term residents in a Schengen state]] may also acquire the right to move to and settle in another Schengen state without losing their legal status and social benefits.<ref>Council Directive 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0109:EN:NOT OJ L 16, 23 January 2004, p.44]).</ref>\n\n[[Asylum seeker]]s who request international protection under the [[Geneva Convention]] from a Schengen member state are not issued a residence permit, but are instead issued, within three days of the application being lodged, an authorisation to remain on the territory of the member state while the application is pending or being examined.

The [[European Commission]] has proposed to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to lift the visa requirements for the people of Kosovo by transferring Kosovo to the visa-free list for short-stays in the Schengen area. The proposal is presented together with the Commission's positive assessment confirming that Kosovo has fulfilled the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap.\n\nThe European Commission launched a visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo on 19 January 2012. In June 2012, the Commission handed over a roadmap on visa liberalisation to the Kosovo authorities, which identified the legislation and institutional measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation.\n\nVisa liberalisation negotiations between the EU and the [[Western Balkans]] (excluding Kosovo) were launched in the first half of 2008, and ended in 2009 (for Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) and 2010 (for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina). Before visas were fully abolished, the Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) had signed \"visa facilitation agreements\" with the Schengen states in 2008. The visa facilitation agreements were, at the time, supposed to shorten waiting periods, lower visa fees (including free visas for certain categories of travellers), and reduce paperwork. In practice, however, the new procedures turned out to be longer, more cumbersome, more expensive, and many people complained that it was easier to obtain visas before the facilitation agreements entered into force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:209867-Nevidljivi-Sengen-popust|title=Nevidljivi \u0160engen popust|language=Serbian|date=3 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nezavisne.com/komentari/nezavisnistav/Vizne-olaksice-32938.html|title=Vizne olak\u0161ice|language=Serbian|date=22 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3834057,00.html|title=Nevolje sa vizama |language=Bosnian|date=28 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Police and judicial co-operation ==\nTo counter the potentially aggravating effects of the abolition of border controls on undocumented immigration and cross-border crime, the Schengen ''acquis'' contains compensatory police and judicial measures.<ref name=\"EC-Schengen\">{{cite web |title=The Schengen area and cooperation |publisher=European Commission |url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33020_en.htm |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Chief among these is the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS),<ref name=\"EC-Schengen\"/> a database operated by all EU and Schengen states and which by January 2010 contained in excess of 30 million entries and by January 2014 contained in excess of 50 million entries, according to a document published in June 2015 by the [[Council of the European Union]].<ref name=\"consilium.europa.eu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2015/pdf/qc0114838enn_pdf/|title='Schengen', June 2015, General Secretariat for the Council of the European Union|publisher=}}</ref> Around 1 million of the entries relate to persons, 72% of which were not allowed to enter and stay in the Schengen area.

The Agreement and its related conventions were incorporated into the mainstream of [[European Union law]] by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1997, which came into effect in 1999. A consequence of the Agreement being part of European law is that any amendment or regulation is made within its processes, in which the non-EU members are not participants. The UK and Ireland have operated a [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA) since 1923 (with passport-free travel and freedom of movement with each other), but the UK would not abolish border controls with any other counties and therefore opted out of the Agreement. While not signing the Schengen Treaty, Ireland has always looked more favourably on joining, but has not done so in order to maintain the CTA and its open border with [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>[http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0450/D.0450.199503140014.html Minister for Justice, Nora Owen, ''D\u00e1il Debates'' volume 450 column 1171 (14 March 1995)]; [http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0501/D.0501.199903090246.htmlMinister for Justice, John O'Donoghue, ''D\u00e1il Debates'' volume 501 column 1506 (9 March 1999)]{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}; \"Declaration by Ireland on Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland\" attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam.</ref> The Nordic members required Norway and Iceland to be included, which was accepted, so a consensus could be reached.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n== Membership ==\n=== Current members ===\n{{Schengen Agreement Labelled Map 2}}\n\nThe Schengen Area consists of 26 states, including four which are not members of the [[European Union]] (EU).

Instead, the border guard should check the validity of the residence permit. (See Report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of the provisions on stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals in accordance with Articles 10 and 11 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0489:FIN:EN:PDF COM (2009) 489, p. 7]), \"The Commission is of the opinion that travel documents of third-country nationals who are in possession of a valid residence permit issued by a Schengen Member State should not be stamped. The purpose of stamping a passport serves to establish whether a third country national respected the authorised length of a short stay within the Schengen area.

As a result, the length of time taken to perform checks differs between Schengen countries. Under the previous regime (whereby those with the right to freedom of movement were subject only to a 'minimum check'), an entry check for an EU, EEA or Swiss citizen took around five seconds on average in Italy, whilst in Norway, on average it took around 1 minute.<ref name=\"Entryexit2\"/> The disparities in checks on third-country nationals (who are subject to a more thorough check) are even greater. For example, an entry check for an [[Visa policy of the European Union#Visa requirements for the Schengen Area, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania|Annex II]] national takes around 15 seconds on average in Greece, whilst it takes three to five minutes on average in Slovakia.<ref name=\"Entryexit1\"/><ref name=\"Entryexit3\"/> Similarly, an entry check for an [[Visa policy of the European Union#Visa requirements for the Schengen Area, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Romania|Annex I]] national on average lasts around 30\u201360 seconds in The Netherlands, whilst in Latvia, it lasts around two to five minutes on average.<ref name=\"Entryexit1\"/>\n\nAfter the new regime came into force on 7 April 2017, significantly longer waiting times were reported at numerous external border crossing points, especially as it was just before the [[Easter]] holiday. Travellers entering [[Slovenia]] from [[Croatia]] (which, though a [[European Union member state]], is not yet part of the Schengen Area) had to wait several hours as Slovenian [[border guard]]s systematically checked the travel documents of all travellers (including those with the right of free movement) against relevant databases.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/c2dd5f19864e483080e44ec0a5c36af1 |title=New EU Border Controls Create Traffic Nightmare |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=2017-04-14 |accessdate=2017-05-13}}</ref> The [[Prime Minister of Slovenia]], [[Miro Cerar]], acknowledged that the situation was 'unacceptable'.

As shown by the examples listed above of automated border control systems which have been developed at external border crossing points of the Schengen Area, national border authorities have been able to adapt the design of their automated border control systems to allow third-country nationals to make use of them. One solution is to have a border guard physically positioned next to the automated border gates who can stamp travel documents where required: this approach has been adopted by the [[Finnish Border Guard]] at the automated border gates in [[Helsinki Airport]], where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]] and [[United States passport|United States]] [[biometric passport]]s,<ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.raja.fi/facts/news_from_the_border_guard/1/0/expanded_use_of_automated_border_control_gates_at_the_west_terminal_54569 |title=News from the Border Guard \u2013 The Finnish Border Guard |publisher=Raja.fi |date= |accessdate=2015-07-31}}</ref> as well as by the Portuguese [[Servi\u00e7o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras]] at the automated border gates in [[Lisbon Airport]] where eligible users (who are required to receive a passport stamp) include holders of [[Angolan passport|Angolan]] and [[Brazilian passport|Brazilian]] passports and holders of [[Diplomatic passport|diplomatic/service passports]]. This approach has also been adopted in Italy, where eligible users of [[EGate (Italy)|eGates]] include holders of [[Australian passport|Australian]], [[Canadian passport|Canadian]], [[Israeli passport|Israeli]], [[Japanese passport|Japanese]], [[New Zealand passport|New Zealand]], [[Singaporean passport|Singaporean]], [[South Korean passport|South Korean]], [[United States passport|United States]] and [[Vatican passport|Vatican]] [[biometric passport]]s. A similar but slightly different solution has been adopted by the Dutch [[Royal Marechaussee]] at the Privium [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Amsterdam Schiphol Airport]] (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens, US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members, and all nationals who are holders of [[diplomatic passport]]s), as well as by the [[Federal Police (Germany)|German Federal Police]] at the ABG Plus [[iris recognition]] automated border gates at [[Frankfurt Airport]] (where eligible users include registered EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and US citizens who are [[Global Entry]] members): when eligible third-country nationals use Privium/ABG Plus, after their iris is scanned and verified, a different gate opens to that for EU/EEA/Swiss citizens and the third-country national is directed to a lane which leads them to the front of the queue for manual passport checks at immigration desks, where the border officer stamps the user's passport. Another possible solution would be to design the automated border gates to print a paper slip with an entry or exit stamp on it, as well as the traveller's name and travel document number, whenever the user is a traveller who is subject to the requirement to have his or her travel document stamped.<ref>Art 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 562/2005 recognises that an entry or exit stamp may be recorded on a sheet of paper with the traveller's name and travel document number (rather than inside the traveller's travel document) where stamping the travel document would cause 'serious difficulties' for the traveller. It could be argued that at a particular border crossing point where the state of facilities are such as to deny travellers subject to the stamping obligation access to automated border gates and to require them instead to be processed manually by border guards would constitute 'serious difficulties' for such persons.</ref> At the [[Port of Helsinki]], the [[Finnish Border Guard]] has adapted the design of the automated border gates there to widen eligibility to include [[Citizenship of Russia|Russian citizens]] (who, as [[Visa policy of the Schengen Area#Visa exemptions|Annex I]] nationals, are required to have a visa) by requiring them to scan both the biodata page and the visa inside their passport, then to step into the gate for a facial image and fingerprint recognition, and after the gate opens to approach a border officer to have their passport stamped.<ref name=\"Finnish Border Guard July 2014 press release\"/>\n\nSometimes, external border controls are located on non-Schengen territory.

Further, since immigrants have the [[Right of asylum|right to apply for asylum]] at border control at ports of entry in the EU, though such applications must be made in person in the country where asylum status is sought, this measure has the effect of preventing prospective asylum seekers from boarding public transportation to the Schengen Area (unless they have already obtained a Schengen visa or are visa-exempt).\n\n=== Short-stay and transit visas ===\n[[File:Schengen visa requirements.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|'''Schengen Area visa lists'''\n{{legend|#003399|Schengen Area}}\n{{legend|#00A4E9|Other EU members outside Schengen Area but bound by same visa policy and special territories of the EU and Schengen member states.}}\n{{legend|#FFCC00|Members or former members of the EU with an independent visa policy}}\n{{legend|#22B14C|Visa-free access to the Schengen states for 90 days in any 180 day period, although some Annex II nationals can enjoy longer visa-free access in some circumstances (EC 539/2001 Annex II)}}\n{{legend|#ADADAD|Visa required to enter the Schengen states (EC 539/2001 Annex I)}}\n{{legend|#282828|Visa required for transit via the Schengen states (EC 810/2009 Annex IV)}}\n{{legend|#FFFFFF|Visa status unknown}}]]\n\n[[File:FRTD.jpg|thumb|Facilitated Rail Transit Document]]\n{{Main|Visa policy of the Schengen Area}}\n\nThe rules applicable to short-term entry visas into the Schengen Area are set out in EU regulations which contain two lists: a list of the nationalities (or classes of [[travel document]] holder) which require a visa for a short-term stay (the ''Annex I list'') and a list which do not (the ''Annex II list'').<ref name=\"visa regulations\">Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001R0539:EN:NOT OJ L 81, 21 March 2001, p. 1]).</ref>\n\nBeing listed in the visa-free list will sometimes but not always exempt the listed nationality or class from the requirement to obtain a work permit if they wish to take up employment or self-employed activity during their stay; business trips are not normally considered employment in this sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/aufenthv/__17.html |title=Section 17 of the German Aufenthaltsverordnung |language=German |date=25 November 2004 |accessdate=28 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222171653/http://bundesrecht.juris.de/aufenthv/__17.html |archivedate=22 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Schengen visa fee ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nIn accordance with the guidelines of the European Union, any Schengen visa application has to be accompanied by a payment of visa fees.\nThe fees (processing + visa) are to be paid on the day the application is being submitted and are normally payable only in the local currency equivalent.

The Schengen Borders Code lists requirements which third-country nationals must meet to be allowed into the Schengen Area. For this purpose, a third-country national is a person who does ''not'' enjoy the [[Directive 2004/38/EC on the right to move and reside freely|right of free movement]] (i.e. a person who is not an EU, EEA, Swiss or British citizen, nor a family member of such a person who is in possession of a [[Residence card of a family member of a Union citizen|residence permit with the indication \"family

a third-country national will need to hold either a long-stay visa for a period no longer than a year, or a residence permit for longer periods. A long-stay visa is a national visa but is issued in accordance with a uniform format. It entitles the holder to enter the Schengen Area and remain in the issuing state for a period longer than 90 days but no more than one year. If a Schengen state wishes to allow the holder of a long-stay visa to remain there for longer than a year, the state must issue him or her with a residence permit.\n\nThe holder of a long-stay visa or a residence permit is entitled to move freely within other states which compose the Schengen Area for a period of up to three months in any half-year.<ref>Regulation (EU) No 265/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 March 2010 amending the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement and Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 as regards movement of persons with a long-stay visa ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32010R0265:EN:NOT OJ L 85, 31 March 2010, p. 1])</ref> Third-country nationals who are [[Long-term resident (European Union)|long-term residents in a Schengen state]] may also acquire the right to move to and settle in another Schengen state without losing their legal status and social benefits.<ref>Council Directive 2003/109/EC concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0109:EN:NOT OJ L 16, 23 January 2004, p.44]).</ref>\n\n[[Asylum seeker]]s who request international protection under the [[Geneva Convention]] from a Schengen member state are not issued a residence permit, but are instead issued, within three days of the application being lodged, an authorisation to remain on the territory of the member state while the application is pending or being examined.

The [[European Commission]] has proposed to the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament to lift the visa requirements for the people of Kosovo by transferring Kosovo to the visa-free list for short-stays in the Schengen area. The proposal is presented together with the Commission's positive assessment confirming that Kosovo has fulfilled the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap.\n\nThe European Commission launched a visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo on 19 January 2012. In June 2012, the Commission handed over a roadmap on visa liberalisation to the Kosovo authorities, which identified the legislation and institutional measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation.\n\nVisa liberalisation negotiations between the EU and the [[Western Balkans]] (excluding Kosovo) were launched in the first half of 2008, and ended in 2009 (for Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) and 2010 (for Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina). Before visas were fully abolished, the Western Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia) had signed \"visa facilitation agreements\" with the Schengen states in 2008. The visa facilitation agreements were, at the time, supposed to shorten waiting periods, lower visa fees (including free visas for certain categories of travellers), and reduce paperwork. In practice, however, the new procedures turned out to be longer, more cumbersome, more expensive, and many people complained that it was easier to obtain visas before the facilitation agreements entered into force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/naslovna/aktuelno.69.html:209867-Nevidljivi-Sengen-popust|title=Nevidljivi \u0160engen popust|language=Serbian|date=3 February 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nezavisne.com/komentari/nezavisnistav/Vizne-olaksice-32938.html|title=Vizne olak\u0161ice|language=Serbian|date=22 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,3834057,00.html|title=Nevolje sa vizama |language=Bosnian|date=28 November 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Police and judicial co-operation ==\nTo counter the potentially aggravating effects of the abolition of border controls on undocumented immigration and cross-border crime, the Schengen ''acquis'' contains compensatory police and judicial measures.<ref name=\"EC-Schengen\">{{cite web |title=The Schengen area and cooperation |publisher=European Commission |url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/free_movement_of_persons_asylum_immigration/l33020_en.htm |accessdate=9 February 2013}}</ref> Chief among these is the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS),<ref name=\"EC-Schengen\"/> a database operated by all EU and Schengen states and which by January 2010 contained in excess of 30 million entries and by January 2014 contained in excess of 50 million entries, according to a document published in June 2015 by the [[Council of the European Union]].<ref name=\"consilium.europa.eu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/publications/2015/pdf/qc0114838enn_pdf/|title='Schengen', June 2015, General Secretariat for the Council of the European Union|publisher=}}</ref> Around 1 million of the entries relate to persons, 72% of which were not allowed to enter and stay in the Schengen area.

{"title_page": "Derryragh", "text_new": "{{cleanup|reason=short paragraphs, punctuation, over-bolding, especially quote marks not following [[MOS:DOUBLE]].|date=May 2019}}\n'''Derryragh''' ({{Irish derived place name|Doire R\u00e1tha meaning 'The Oakwood of the Fort'}}) is a [[townland]] in the [[civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of [[Templeport]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The local pronunciation is Dharraugh.\n\n==Geography==\n\nDerryragh is bounded on the north by [[Porturlan]] and [[Killywillin]] townlands, on the west by [[Ballymagauran]] townland, on the south by [[Sruhagh]] and [[Gorteen, Templeport]] townlands and on the east by [[Camagh]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Ballymagauran Lough, streams, five spring wells, dug wells and forestry plantations. Derryragh is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 208 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nAlthough J.P. Dalton suggested that the fort on top on Derryragh hill was the centre of the worship of the pagan idol [[Crom Cruach]], there is no evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Magh Slecht' 1921 pp. 23-67\">''Cromm Cruaich of Magh Slecht'' by Dalton, J.P., in Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 36,(1921) pp. 23-67.</ref> Kevin White carried out an archaeological survey and found no such evidence [http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf] and there is no mention in the Patrician sources or in the Book of Magauran to support such a suggestion. The fact that there are five spring wells in the townland and none of them are associated with [[Saint Patrick]], unlike others in the parish, is also a negative point. All the evidence points to the [[Killycluggin Stone]] being the Crom idol. At best the Darragh fort was an assembly or camping place for the Royal visitors on their pilgrimage to the idol. The placename may also be a corruption of 'Doire R\u00ed' meaning \"The King's Oakwood\". The only tradition connected with the fort is about a fairy living there. A book published in 1912 entitled \"''Folk Tales of Breffny''\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/folktalesofbreff00hunt]</ref> by a Templeport author Mrs Augusta Wardell, n\u00e9e Hunt, under the pen name 'Bunda Hunt' gives a version of the tale which she learned it at the age of seven from an old man named Dolan. It goes as follows-\n\n{{blockquote|There was once a man of these parts and he had a great longing for to find a treasure. It chanced one evening that he seen a gankeynogue in the field, sitting in under a bush, and he says: \"Yon lad will surely be worth a powerful weight of gold.\" With that he went over and caught a hold of the gankey. [According to Patrick Joyce in ''English as we speak it in Ireland'' (London 1910) Gankinna means a fairy or a leprechaun, from the Irish gann meaning small.]\n\n\"Let you discover a treasure.\" says he, \"or else I'll keep you like a dog on a chain from this out.\" \"Keep away!\" says the gankey. \"How would a poor creature like myself be finding treasure for a strong farmer!\" \"Let you not let on to be miserable,\" says the man, \"for well I know it's great wealth you enjoy.\" \"Is it me!\" says the gankeynogue. \"Sure I support a lengthy family entirely by my own industry.\" But the farmer would not believe a word of the sort. He carried the gankey to his house and put him into a big oak chest. \"You'll never get out except for to show me where treasure is lodged,\" he allows. But the gankeynogue wasn't in notion of giving the least information. He sat up in the oak chest, hammering, shouting and singing until he had the people's heads light. All the while the farmer was determined to get the better of him and he never agreed to let him go. The lad was his tenth day in the chest when the man of the house came running in that evening, shouting at the top of his voice: \"Darragh fort's on fire! Darragh fort's on fire!\" With that the gankey began the most woeful lamentations, and he hammering like mad to get out of the chest. \"What ails you at all?\" asks the farmer. \"My wife and family are in that place,\" says the gankey. \"Let me away to bring them safe from the fire.\" \"Will you show me a treasure?\" asks the man. \"Aye surely!\" says the gankeynogue.\" \"But let's go first to Darragh fort to save my weak family, and then I'll bestow the treasure.\" So the two started off for Darragh fort, and it not on fire at all- that was a story the man was after inventing for to scare the gankeynogue. When they landed in sight of the place the man allowed the fire to be to have burnt out. Didn't the gankey make a run and lept in among the trees. \"I'm safe from you now,\" says he. But the man never let on to be vexed that he couldn't see the lad any more, he listened to his voice speaking for to know the direction he went. Then he lay down in that part of the fort and let on to be asleep. After a while he heard the gankeynogue telling his wife about how he was kept in the chest. \"I was ten days in that place,\" says he. \"And I full of venom against the farmer.\" \"But it's the cunning lad I am, for I never let on where the treasure is buried at all.\" \"Where is it!\" asks the gankeynogue's wife. \"Under a stone in the stree before his house,\" says the gankey. \"And herself tripped and spilled a bucket of milk just over the place this morning. I was looking out on a hole in the chest, and still never let on one word when I seen what happened.\" \"You're a wise little fellow, sure enough,\" says his wife. The farmer got up and away home with him after hearing what they said. He asked herself where she spilled the milk at the morning of the day. \"By that stone,\" says she, setting her foot on a flag in the street. He brought the loy and a crowbar for to hoke up the place, and didn't he discover a beautiful treasure of gold.\"\n|''The Gankeynogue in the Oak Chest'' (pp.&nbsp;187\u2013192)}}\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Darreragh''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Derryreagh''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Derirea''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 4 June 1611, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted ''one poll of Derry to Callo O'Gowne, gentleman at an annual rent of \u00a31-12s''.\n\nThe O'Gowne lands in Derryragh were confiscated in the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] and were distributed as follows-\n\nA grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King [[Charles II of England]] to [[Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet]] which included, inter alia, 2 cartrons of ''Derriereagh'' containing 64 acres of profitable land and 38 acres-0 roods-16 perches of unprofitable land.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/op1244157-1001#page/n47/mode/2up/search/rospressell]</ref> By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King [[Charles II of England]] to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of ''Derrereagh'' were included in the creation of a new ''Manor of Beresford''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924091769590/page/n301]</ref>\n\nBy deed dated 19 October 1749 Frederick Lawder of Ballymagauran sold his leasehold estate of six poles of the lands of Ballymagauran and a half pole in Derriereagh (which he held on lease from [[Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone]]) to Randal Slack, of Dublin and Lakefield, County Leitrim, gentleman, for the sum of \u00a3504-3s-3d.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]]. The local pronunciation is Dharraugh.\n\n==Geography==\n\nDerryragh is bounded on the north by [[Porturlan]] and [[Killywillin]] townlands, on the west by [[Ballymagauran]] townland, on the south by [[Sruhagh]] and [[Gorteen, Templeport]] townlands and on the east by [[Camagh]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Ballymagauran Lough, streams, five spring wells, dug wells and forestry plantations. Derryragh is traversed by the national secondary [[R205 road (Ireland)]], minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 208 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nAlthough J.P. Dalton suggested that the fort on top on Derryragh hill was the centre of the worship of the pagan idol [[Crom Cruach]], there is no evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Magh Slecht' 1921 pp. 23-67\">''Cromm Cruaich of Magh Slecht'' by Dalton, J.P., in Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy 36,(1921) pp. 23-67.</ref> Kevin White carried out an archaeological survey and found no such evidence [http://www.templeport.ie/magh-slecht-dara-fort/plain-of-blood.pdf] and there is no mention in the Patrician sources or in the Book of Magauran to support such a suggestion. The fact that there are five spring wells in the townland and none of them are associated with [[Saint Patrick]], unlike others in the parish, is also a negative point. All the evidence points to the [[Killycluggin Stone]] being the Crom idol. At best the Darragh fort was an assembly or camping place for the Royal visitors on their pilgrimage to the idol. The placename may also be a corruption of 'Doire R\u00ed' meaning \"The King's Oakwood\". The only tradition connected with the fort is about a fairy living there. A book published in 1912 entitled \"''Folk Tales of Breffny''\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/folktalesofbreff00hunt]</ref> by a Templeport author Mrs Augusta Wardell, n\u00e9e Hunt, under the pen name 'Bunda Hunt' gives a version of the tale which she learned it at the age of seven from an old man named Dolan. It goes as follows-\n\n{{blockquote|There was once a man of these parts and he had a great longing for to find a treasure. It chanced one evening that he seen a gankeynogue in the field, sitting in under a bush, and he says: \"Yon lad will surely be worth a powerful weight of gold.\" With that he went over and caught a hold of the gankey. [According to Patrick Joyce in ''English as we speak it in Ireland'' (London 1910) Gankinna means a fairy or a leprechaun, from the Irish gann meaning small.]\n\n\"Let you discover a treasure.\" says he, \"or else I'll keep you like a dog on a chain from this out.\" \"Keep away!\" says the gankey. \"How would a poor creature like myself be finding treasure for a strong farmer!\" \"Let you not let on to be miserable,\" says the man, \"for well I know it's great wealth you enjoy.\" \"Is it me!\" says the gankeynogue. \"Sure I support a lengthy family entirely by my own industry.\" But the farmer would not believe a word of the sort. He carried the gankey to his house and put him into a big oak chest. \"You'll never get out except for to show me where treasure is lodged,\" he allows. But the gankeynogue wasn't in notion of giving the least information. He sat up in the oak chest, hammering, shouting and singing until he had the people's heads light. All the while the farmer was determined to get the better of him and he never agreed to let him go. The lad was his tenth day in the chest when the man of the house came running in that evening, shouting at the top of his voice: \"Darragh fort's on fire! Darragh fort's on fire!\" With that the gankey began the most woeful lamentations, and he hammering like mad to get out of the chest. \"What ails you at all?\" asks the farmer. \"My wife and family are in that place,\" says the gankey. \"Let me away to bring them safe from the fire.\" \"Will you show me a treasure?\" asks the man. \"Aye surely!\" says the gankeynogue.\" \"But let's go first to Darragh fort to save my weak family, and then I'll bestow the treasure.\" So the two started off for Darragh fort, and it not on fire at all- that was a story the man was after inventing for to scare the gankeynogue. When they landed in sight of the place the man allowed the fire to be to have burnt out. Didn't the gankey make a run and lept in among the trees. \"I'm safe from you now,\" says he. But the man never let on to be vexed that he couldn't see the lad any more, he listened to his voice speaking for to know the direction he went. Then he lay down in that part of the fort and let on to be asleep. After a while he heard the gankeynogue telling his wife about how he was kept in the chest. \"I was ten days in that place,\" says he. \"And I full of venom against the farmer.\" \"But it's the cunning lad I am, for I never let on where the treasure is buried at all.\" \"Where is it!\" asks the gankeynogue's wife. \"Under a stone in the stree before his house,\" says the gankey. \"And herself tripped and spilled a bucket of milk just over the place this morning. I was looking out on a hole in the chest, and still never let on one word when I seen what happened.\" \"You're a wise little fellow, sure enough,\" says his wife. The farmer got up and away home with him after hearing what they said. He asked herself where she spilled the milk at the morning of the day. \"By that stone,\" says she, setting her foot on a flag in the street. He brought the loy and a crowbar for to hoke up the place, and didn't he discover a beautiful treasure of gold.\"\n|''The Gankeynogue in the Oak Chest'' (pp.&nbsp;187\u2013192)}}\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Darreragh''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Derryreagh''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Derirea''.\n\nIn the [[Plantation of Ulster]] by grant dated 4 June 1611, along with other lands, King [[James VI and I]] granted ''one poll of Derry to Callo O'Gowne, gentleman at an annual rent of \u00a31-12s''.\n\nThe O'Gowne lands in Derryragh were confiscated in the Cromwellian [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652]] and were distributed as follows-\n\nA grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King [[Charles II of England]] to [[Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet]] which included, inter alia, 2 cartrons of ''Derriereagh'' containing 64 acres of profitable land and 38 acres-0 roods-16 perches of unprofitable land.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/op1244157-1001#page/n47/mode/2up/search/rospressell]</ref> By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King [[Charles II of England]] to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of ''Derrereagh'' were included in the creation of a new ''Manor of Beresford''.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924091769590/page/n301]</ref>\n\nBy deed dated 19 October 1749 Frederick Lawder of Ballymagauran sold his leasehold estate of six poles of the lands of Ballymagauran and a half pole in Derriereagh (which he held on lease from [[Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone]]) to Randal Slack, of Dublin and Lakefield, County Leitrim, gentleman, for the sum of \u00a3504-3s-3d.

Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a celebration of the Techno Trolls, which is crashed by the Hard Rock Trolls, led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her guitar's power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best. Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power cord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream.  The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music.  Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hi-jack the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to so stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make [[rock]] supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs.

The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a celebration of the Techno Trolls, which is crashed by the Hard Rock Trolls, led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her guitar's power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best. Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power cord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream.  The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music.  Quincy explains to Poppy that differences aren't bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same doesn't help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls hi-jack the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she can't be a good queen if she's a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to so stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make [[rock]] supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the [[guitar]]. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events of the film, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the sweetest, optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

They emerged through [[MTV]] as one of the first [[post-grunge]] bands of the 1990s.\n\n==''Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope''==\n[[Single (music)|Singles]] from ''...Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope'' were \"High,\" \"Dropping Anchor,\" \"Blood,\" and \"Another Day.\" \"High\" and \"Dropping Anchor\" both have music videos. The video for \"High\" was shown on MTV's ''120 Minutes.'' Many of the songs that were included on ''PTSE'' were included on previous independent releases.\n\n==''Bring Your Own Stereo''==\n''[[Bring Your Own Stereo]]'' was released by Island Defjam in 1999. The time between the two major releases was a troubled time for the band internally. There were several changes of members and also trouble with the major label as they were shunted from Rocket/Island to Rocket/A&M then back to Rocket/Island and after the sale of Polygram to Universal Music Group, they were moved onto Island Defjam. \"Do Right\", \"Trash\" and \"Lazy Boy Dash\" were singles released from ''B.Y.O.S''. \"Do Right\" was the first single released and the only JCS music video to make it onto MTV's ''Total Request Live'' with Carson Daly. \"Trash\" never received much airplay but was played live on music show on the USA Network.  A promo single of \"Lazy Boy Dash\" was released when it was featured in the 2000 movie The In Crowd.  \"Ooh\" was featured in the 2000 movie Pay It Forward.\n\nWith early releases of ''B.Y.O.S'', there was a card to mail to [[Fowl Records]] for a free copy of the ''[[Slow Change EP]]''. This EP is rare, but can still be occasionally found.\n\nThe tour for this album included dates playing with bands such as 311, Creed, Fuel, Finger Eleven, and Joydrop.\n\nIn January 2000, the band received arguably its highest compliment to date when it was chosen as openers for 311.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430628/20000119/jimmies_chicken_shack.jhtml |title=News - Articles - 1430628 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2000-01-19 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref> Fresh off a New Years show with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], the Omaha, Nebraska quintet announced a month-plus long, 27-show tour, spanning from February 21 to March 29, with Jimmie's Chicken Shack as the sole opening act (including one special guest appearance by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] at a Winston-Salem show).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2000/03/28/Arts/Jimmies.Chicken.Shack.Enjoying.Wave.Of.Success-1733752.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090720225657/http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2000/03/28/Arts/Jimmies.Chicken.Shack.Enjoying.Wave.Of.Success-1733752.shtml |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==''re.present''==\nAfter fighting for nearly three years to get released from Island Defjam, they released ''[[re.present]]'' on Koch Records in April 2004. \"Falling Out\" (featuring [[Aaron Lewis (musician)|Aaron Lewis]] of [[Staind]]) was the only single released from ''[[re.present]]''. A music video was made for the single and received limited airplay through various outlets.\n\n==''Fail On Cue''==\nFail On Cue was released in January 2008 on Fowl Records.  Some of the new songs on the album are \"Mutha Luvas,\" \"The Quiet Ones,\" \"Another Great Idea,\" and \"Making Babies.\" The album also included the band's second studio recorded cover of a song, Fugazi's \"Waiting Room\".\n\n==\"Jarflys\"==\nJimi Haha started a band in 2002 called Jarflys.

They emerged through [[MTV]] as one of the first [[post-grunge]] bands of the 1990s.\n\n==''Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope''==\n[[Single (music)|Singles]] from ''...Pushing the Salmanilla Envelope'' were \"High,\" \"Dropping Anchor,\" \"Blood,\" and \"Another Day.\" \"High\" and \"Dropping Anchor\" both have music videos. The video for \"High\" was shown on MTV's ''120 Minutes.'' Many of the songs that were included on ''PTSE'' were included on previous independent releases.\n\n==''Bring Your Own Stereo''==\n''[[Bring Your Own Stereo]]'' was released by Island Defjam in 1999. The time between the two major releases was a troubled time for the band internally. There were several changes of members and also trouble with the major label as they were shunted from Rocket/Island to Rocket/A&M then back to Rocket/Island and after the sale of Polygram to Universal Music Group, they were moved onto Island Defjam. \"Do Right\", \"Trash\" and \"Lazy Boy Dash\" were singles released from ''B.Y.O.S''. \"Do Right\" was the first single released and the only JCS music video to make it onto MTV's ''Total Request Live'' with Carson Daly. \"Trash\" never received much airplay but was played live on music show on the USA Network.  A promo single of \"Lazy Boy Dash\" was released when it was featured in the 2000 movie The In Crowd.  \"Ooh\" was featured in the 2000 movie Pay It Forward.\n\nWith early releases of ''B.Y.O.S'', there was a card to mail to [[Fowl Records]] for a free copy of the ''[[Slow Change EP]]''. This EP is rare, but can still be occasionally found.\n\nThe tour for this album included dates playing with bands such as 311, Creed, Fuel, Finger Eleven, and Joydrop.\n\nIn January 2000, the band received arguably its highest compliment to date when it was chosen as openers for 311.<ref>{{cite web|last=Basham |first=David |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430628/20000119/jimmies_chicken_shack.jhtml |title=News - Articles - 1430628 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=2000-01-19 |accessdate=2012-04-03}}</ref> Fresh off a New Years show with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], the Omaha, Nebraska quintet announced a month-plus long, 27-show tour, spanning from February 21 to March 29, with Jimmie's Chicken Shack as the sole opening act (including one special guest appearance by [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] at a Winston-Salem show).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2000/03/28/Arts/Jimmies.Chicken.Shack.Enjoying.Wave.Of.Success-1733752.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090720225657/http://media.www.dailynebraskan.com/media/storage/paper857/news/2000/03/28/Arts/Jimmies.Chicken.Shack.Enjoying.Wave.Of.Success-1733752.shtml |archivedate=2009-07-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==''re.present''==\nAfter fighting for nearly three years to get released from Island Defjam, they released ''[[re.present]]'' on Koch Records in April 2004. \"Falling Out\" (featuring [[Aaron Lewis (musician)|Aaron Lewis]] of [[Staind]]) was the only single released from ''[[re.present]]''. A music video was made for the single and received limited airplay through various outlets.\n\n==''Fail On Cue''==\nFail On Cue was released in January 2008 on Fowl Records.  Some of the new songs on the album are \"Mutha Luvas,\" \"The Quiet Ones,\" \"Another Great Idea,\" and \"Making Babies.\" The album also included the band's second studio recorded cover of a song, Fugazi's \"Waiting Room\".\n\n==\"Jarflys\"==\nJimi Haha started a band in 2002 called Jarflys. They put out a record called Anonymous. They continue to play in Annapolis. They have never had a band practice. \n\n==\"Mend The Hollow\"==\n[[Jimi Haha]] put out his first solo cd under the name Mend The Hollow in December 2016.
