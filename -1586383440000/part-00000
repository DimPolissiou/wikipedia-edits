Sampling techniques that aggressively seek out extremes of self-regard may indeed find enough pathological individuals to yield unusual results and confirm some of the more unsavory impressions and hypotheses about low self-esteem. For the most part, however, low self-esteem is not marked by those patterns. People with low self-esteem can be well understood as ordinary people who are trying in a fairly sensible, rational fashion to adapt effectively to their circumstances and to make their way through life with a minimum of suffering, distress, and humiliation. In that, of course, they are no different from people with high self-esteem.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Irrationality and self-defeating behavior===\nIn a series of journal articles and books, Baumeister inquired about the reasons for self-defeating behavior. His conclusions: there is no self-defeating urge (as some have thought). Rather, self-defeating behavior is either a result of trade-offs (enjoying drugs now at the expense of the future), backfiring strategies (eating a snack to reduce stress only to feel more stressed), or a psychological strategy to escape the self&nbsp;\u2013 where various self-defeating strategies are rather directed to relieve the burden of selfhood.<ref>Baumeister R. (1991) ''Escaping the Self: Alcoholism, Spirituality, Masochism, and Other Flights from the Burden of Selfhood''. Basic Books.</ref>\n\n===''The Need to Belong''===\nBaumeister wrote a paper on the [[belongingness|need-to-belong]] theory with [[Mark Leary]] in 1995. This theory seeks to show that humans have a natural need to belong with others. Baumeister and Leary suggest that human beings naturally push to form relationships.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" >Baumeister, R. F., & Leary, M. R. (1995). The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation. ''Psychological Bulletin, 117(3)'', 497-529. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497.</ref> This push helps to distinguish a need (rather than a desire). In addition to the drive for attachment, people also struggle to avoid the disintegration of these relationships.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" /> As part of this theory, a lack of belonging would have a long-term, negative impact on mood and health, and those who do not meet their belonging needs may suffer from behavioral and psychological issues.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />\nNeed-to-belong theory has two necessary parts:<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />\n\n# There is frequent contact between the people involved in the attachment that is typically conflict-free.\n# The notion of an ongoing and continued relationship between them is essential.\n\nThis work was groundbreaking in that it separated itself from previous theories relating to [[Attachment theory|attachment]] such as those of [[John Bowlby]]. While Bowlby's theory implied the attachment needs to be applied to a group [[leader]] or authority figure,<ref name =  \"Bowlby, 1969\" >Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment. New York:Basic Books.</ref> Baumeister and Leary's need-to-belong theory posited that the relationship could be with anyone.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />  To further distinguish the two theories, Baumeister and Leary theorized that if a relationship dissolved, the bond can often be replaced with a bond to another person.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />\n\nLater, Baumeister published evidence that the way people look for [[belongingness]] differs between men and women. Women prefer a few close and intimate relationships, whereas men prefer many but shallower connections. Men realize more of their need to belong via a group of people, or a cause, rather than in close interpersonal relations.<ref>{{cite journal |title= What do men want? Gender differences and two spheres of belongingness: Comment on Cross and Madson (1997).|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/122/1/38/}}</ref>\n\n===Self regulation===\nBaumeister also researched self-regulation. He coined the term \"[[ego depletion]]\" to describe the evidence that humans' ability to self-regulate is limited, and after using it there is less ability (or energy) to self-regulate.<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Bratslavsky, E., Muraven, M., & Tice, D. M. (1998). Ego depletion: Is the active self a limited resource? Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74(5), 1252-1265.</ref> Ego depletion has a general effect, such that exerting self-control in one area will use up energy for further regulation in other areas of life.<ref>Vohs, K., Baumeister, R., Schmeichel, B., Twenge, J., Nelson, N., & Tice, D. (2008). Making choices impairs subsequent self-control: A limited-resource account of decision making, self-regulation, and active initiative. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 94(5), 883-898</ref> Further research by Baumeister and colleagues has led to the development of the Strength Model of self-control, which likens this ego depletion to the tiredness that comes from physically exerting a muscle. A corollary to this analogy, supported by his research, is that self-control can be strengthened over time, much like a muscle.<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Vohs, K. D., & Tice, D. M. (2007). The strength model of self-control. Current Directions In Psychological Science, 16(6), 351-355</ref> The energy used up is more than metaphorical, however; his research has found a strong link between ego depletion and depletion of blood-glucose levels.<ref>Gailliot, M., Baumeister, R., DeWall, C., Maner, J., Plant, E., Tice, D., & Schmeichel, B. (2007). Self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(2), 325-336.</ref> Baumeister also edited two academic books on self-regulation, ''Losing Control'' and ''Handbook of Self-Regulation'', and has devoted numerous experiments and journal papers to the topic. He also describes this research in a book, ''Willpower'', authored with former New York Times journalist John Tierney.\n\nIn 2016 a large study carried out at two-dozen labs in countries across the world that sought to reproduce the effects described in these studies was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top|title= Everything Is Crumbling|last= Engber|first= Daniel|date= 2016-03-06|newspaper= Slate|language= en-US|issn= 1091-2339|access-date= 2016-03-07}}</ref> Baumeister, however, disputed the protocol used in this replication. Baumeister also plans to run his own pre-registered replication using a protocol that is more in line with most ego-depletion experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|url= http://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RRR-comment-BaumeisterVohs-revised-March17-002.pdf|title= Misguided Effort with Elusive Implications - Association for Psychological Science|website= www.psychologicalscience.org|access-date= 2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\n===Culture and human sexuality===\nA series of studies of human sexuality has addressed questions such as how nature and culture influence people's sex drive, rape and sexual coercion, the cultural suppression of [[Human_female_sexuality|female sexuality]], and how couples negotiate their sexual patterns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/baumeister.dp.html|title=Roy Baumeister's page, Florida State University|publisher=www.psy.fsu.edu}}</ref> In his research, Baumeister reached four major conclusions:<ref name=\":2\" />\n# The relative influence of culture and nature on sexuality varies by gender. Female sexuality is more cultural/nurture, and male sexuality is more in-born/nature (see [[erotic plasticity]]).\n# There is a gender difference with sex drive. Men, on average, want more sex than women. \n# The present widespread cultural suppression of female sexuality exists in large part at the behest of women.\n# Sexual interactions can be analyzed in terms of cost-benefit analysis and market dynamics with \"[[Sex economy|sexual economics]].\"\n\n===Free will===\nBaumeister approaches the topic of [[free will]] from the view-point of [[evolutionary psychology]]. He has listed the major aspects that make up free will as self-control, rational, intelligent choice, planful behavior, and autonomous initiative.<ref>Stillman, T. F., Baumeister, R. F., & Mele, A. R. (2011). Free will in everyday life: Autobiographical accounts of free and unfree actions. Philosophical Psychology, 24(3), 381-394</ref> Baumeister proposes that \"the defining thrust of human psychological evolution was selection in favor of cultural capability\" <ref>Baumeister, R. (2008). Free will in scientific psychology. Perspectives On Psychological Science, 3(1), 14-19.</ref> and that these four psychological capabilities evolved to help humans function in the context of culture. In his view, free will is an advanced form of action control that allows humans to act in pro-social ways towards their [[enlightened self-interest]] when acting in these ways would otherwise be in conflict with the fulfillment of evolutionarily older drives or instincts.<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Crescioni, A., & Alquist, J. L. (2011). Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture. Neuroethics, 4(1), 1-11</ref> Research by Baumeister and colleagues (principally Kathleen Vohs) has shown that disbelief in free will can lead people to act in ways that are harmful to themselves and society, such as cheating on a test, increased aggression, decreased helpfulness, lower achievement levels in the workplace, and possible barriers to beating addiction.<ref>Vohs, K. D., & Schooler, J. W. (2008). The value of believing in free will: Encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating. Psychological Science, 19(1), 49-54.</ref><ref>Baumeister, R. F., Masicampo, E. J., & DeWall, C. (2009). Prosocial benefits of feeling free: Disbelief in free will increases aggression and reduces helpfulness.

F. (2009). Addiction and free will. Addiction Research & Theory, 17(3), 231-235.</ref>\n\n===Erotic plasticity===\nBaumeister coined the term \"[[erotic plasticity]]\", which is the extent to which one's sex drive can be shaped by cultural, social and situational factors.<ref>\nBaumeister, R. F. (2000). Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity: The Female Sex Drive as Socially Flexible and Responsive. ''Psychological Bulletin, 126''(3), 347-374\n</ref><ref>Baumeister, R. F. (2004). Gender and erotic plasticity: sociocultural influences on the sex drive. ''Sexual and Relationship Therapy, 19''(2), 1468-1479</ref> He argues that women have high plasticity, meaning that their sex drive can more easily change in response to external pressures. On the other hand, men have low plasticity, and therefore have sex drives that are relatively inflexible.\n\n==Works==\n=== Books authored ===\n* ''Is There Anything Good About Men?: How Cultures Flourish by Exploiting Men'' (2010).\n* ''[[Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength]]'' (2011).\n* ''Escaping the Self: Alcoholism, Spirituality, Masochism, and Other Flights from the Burden of Selfhood'' (1991).\n* ''Your Own Worst Enemy: Understanding the Paradox of Self-Defeating Behavior'' (1993).\n* ''Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty'' (1997). \n* ''Identity: Cultural Change and the Struggle for Self'' (1986).\n* ''Masochism and the Self'' (1989).\n* ''Meanings of Life'' (1991).\n* ''Breaking Hearts: The Two Sides of Unrequited Love'' (1994).\n* ''Losing Control: How and Why People Fail at Self-Regulation'' (1994).\n* With Dianne Tice, ''The Social Dimension of Sex'' (2000).\n* With Tina S.

Baumeister wrote a chapter titled, \"The Self\" in ''The Handbook of Social Psychology'',<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Baumeister\n| first1 = Roy F.\n| author-link1 = Roy Baumeister\n| year = 1954\n| chapter = 15: The Self\n| editor1-last = Gilbert\n| editor1-first = Daniel T.\n| editor1-link = Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)\n| editor2-last = Fiske\n| editor2-first = Susan T.\n| editor2-link = Susan Fiske\n| editor3-last = Lindzey\n| editor3-first = Gardner\n| editor3-link = Gardner Lindzey\n| title = The Handbook of Social Psychology\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-4InWCsra7IC\n| volume = 1\n| edition = 4\n| location = Boston\n| publisher = McGraw-Hill\n| publication-date = 1998\n| pages = 680\u2013740\n| isbn = 9780195213768\n| access-date = 2017-07-30\n}}\n</ref>\nand reviewed the research on [[self-esteem]], concluding that the perceived importance of self-esteem is overrated.<ref>\nCompare:\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Baumeister\n| first1 = Roy F.\n| author-link1 = Roy Baumeister\n| year = 1993\n| series = The Springer Series in Social Clinical Psychology\n| chapter = 11: Understanding the Inner Nature of Low Self-Esteem: Uncertain, Fragile, Protective, and Conflicted\n| editor1-last = Baumeister\n| editor1-first = Roy F.\n| editor1-link = Roy Baumeister\n| title = Self-Esteem: The Puzzle of Low Self-Regard\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZeyBwAAQBAJ\n| location = New York\n| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media\n| publication-date = 2013\n| pages = 217\u2013218\n| isbn = 9781468489569\n| access-date = 2017-07-31\n| quote = [...] there may be isolated individuals who combine low self-esteem with irrational, self-destructive, or other pathological signs. Sampling techniques that aggressively seek out extremes of self-regard may indeed find enough pathological individuals to yield unusual results and confirm some of the more unsavory impressions and hypotheses about low self-esteem. For the most part, however, low self-esteem is not marked by those patterns. People with low self-esteem can be well understood as ordinary people who are trying in a fairly sensible, rational fashion to adapt effectively to their circumstances and to make their way through life with a minimum of suffering, distress, and humiliation. In that, of course, they are no different from people with high self-esteem.\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Irrationality and self-defeating behavior===\nIn a series of journal articles and books, Baumeister inquired about the reasons for self-defeating behavior. His conclusions: there is no self-defeating urge (as some have thought). Rather, self-defeating behavior is either a result of trade-offs (enjoying drugs now at the expense of the future), backfiring strategies (eating a snack to reduce stress only to feel more stressed), or a psychological strategy to escape the self&nbsp;\u2013 where various self-defeating strategies are rather directed to relieve the burden of selfhood.<ref>Baumeister R. (1991) ''Escaping the Self: Alcoholism, Spirituality, Masochism, and Other Flights from the Burden of Selfhood''. Basic Books.</ref>\n\n===''The Need to Belong''===\nBaumeister wrote a paper on the [[belongingness|need-to-belong]] theory with [[Mark Leary]] in 1995. This theory seeks to show that humans have a natural need to belong with others. Baumeister and Leary suggest that human beings naturally push to form relationships.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" >Baumeister, R. F., & Leary, M. R. (1995). The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation. ''Psychological Bulletin, 117(3)'', 497-529. doi: 10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497.</ref> This push helps to distinguish a need (rather than a desire). In addition to the drive for attachment, people also struggle to avoid the disintegration of these relationships.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" /> As part of this theory, a lack of belonging would have a long-term, negative impact on mood and health, and those who do not meet their belonging needs may suffer from behavioral and psychological issues.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />\nNeed-to-belong theory has two necessary parts:<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />\n\n# There is frequent contact between the people involved in the attachment that is typically conflict-free.\n# The notion of an ongoing and continued relationship between them is essential.\n\nThis work was groundbreaking in that it separated itself from previous theories relating to [[Attachment theory|attachment]] such as those of [[John Bowlby]]. While Bowlby's theory implied the attachment needs to be applied to a group [[leader]] or authority figure,<ref name =  \"Bowlby, 1969\" >Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment. New York:Basic Books.</ref> Baumeister and Leary's need-to-belong theory posited that the relationship could be with anyone.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />  To further distinguish the two theories, Baumeister and Leary theorized that if a relationship dissolved, the bond can often be replaced with a bond to another person.<ref name = \" Baumeister & Leary, 1995\" />\n\nLater, Baumeister published evidence that the way people look for [[belongingness]] differs between men and women. Women prefer a few close and intimate relationships, whereas men prefer many but shallower connections. Men realize more of their need to belong via a group of people, or a cause, rather than in close interpersonal relations.<ref>{{cite journal |title= What do men want? Gender differences and two spheres of belongingness: Comment on Cross and Madson (1997).|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/122/1/38/}}</ref>\n\n===Self regulation===\nBaumeister also researched self-regulation. He coined the term \"[[ego depletion]]\" to describe the evidence that humans' ability to self-regulate is limited, and after using it there is less ability (or energy) to self-regulate.<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Bratslavsky, E., Muraven, M., & Tice, D. M. (1998). Ego depletion: Is the active self a limited resource? Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74(5), 1252-1265.</ref> Ego depletion has a general effect, such that exerting self-control in one area will use up energy for further regulation in other areas of life.<ref>Vohs, K., Baumeister, R., Schmeichel, B., Twenge, J., Nelson, N., & Tice, D. (2008). Making choices impairs subsequent self-control: A limited-resource account of decision making, self-regulation, and active initiative. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 94(5), 883-898</ref> Further research by Baumeister and colleagues has led to the development of the Strength Model of self-control, which likens this ego depletion to the tiredness that comes from physically exerting a muscle. A corollary to this analogy, supported by his research, is that self-control can be strengthened over time, much like a muscle.<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Vohs, K. D., & Tice, D. M. (2007). The strength model of self-control. Current Directions In Psychological Science, 16(6), 351-355</ref> The energy used up is more than metaphorical, however; his research has found a strong link between ego depletion and depletion of blood-glucose levels.<ref>Gailliot, M., Baumeister, R., DeWall, C., Maner, J., Plant, E., Tice, D., & Schmeichel, B. (2007). Self-control relies on glucose as a limited energy source: Willpower is more than a metaphor. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 92(2), 325-336.</ref> Baumeister also edited two academic books on self-regulation, ''Losing Control'' and ''Handbook of Self-Regulation'', and has devoted numerous experiments and journal papers to the topic. He also describes this research in a book, ''Willpower'', authored with former New York Times journalist John Tierney.\n\nIn 2016 a large study carried out at two-dozen labs in countries across the world that sought to reproduce the effects described in these studies was unsuccessful.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/cover_story/2016/03/ego_depletion_an_influential_theory_in_psychology_may_have_just_been_debunked.html?wpsrc=sh_all_dt_tw_top|title= Everything Is Crumbling|last= Engber|first= Daniel|date= 2016-03-06|newspaper= Slate|language= en-US|issn= 1091-2339|access-date= 2016-03-07}}</ref> Baumeister, however, disputed the protocol used in this replication. Baumeister also plans to run his own pre-registered replication using a protocol that is more in line with most ego-depletion experiments.<ref>{{Cite journal|url= http://www.psychologicalscience.org/redesign/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/RRR-comment-BaumeisterVohs-revised-March17-002.pdf|title= Misguided Effort with Elusive Implications - Association for Psychological Science|website= www.psychologicalscience.org|access-date= 2016-04-20}}</ref>\n\n===Culture and human sexuality===\nA series of studies of human sexuality has addressed questions such as how nature and culture influence people's sex drive, rape and sexual coercion, the cultural suppression of [[Human_female_sexuality|female sexuality]], and how couples negotiate their sexual patterns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psy.fsu.edu/faculty/baumeister.dp.html|title=Roy Baumeister's page, Florida State University|publisher=www.psy.fsu.edu}}</ref> In his research, Baumeister reached four major conclusions:<ref name=\":2\" />\n# The relative influence of culture and nature on sexuality varies by gender. Female sexuality is more cultural/nurture, and male sexuality is more in-born/nature (see [[erotic plasticity]]).\n# There is a gender difference with sex drive. Men, on average, want more sex than women. \n# The present widespread cultural suppression of female sexuality exists in large part at the behest of women.\n# Sexual interactions can be analyzed in terms of cost-benefit analysis and market dynamics with \"[[Sex economy|sexual economics]].\"\n\n===Free will===\nBaumeister approaches the topic of [[free will]] from the view-point of [[evolutionary psychology]]. He has listed the major aspects that make up free will as self-control, rational, intelligent choice, planful behavior, and autonomous initiative.<ref>Stillman, T. F., Baumeister, R. F., & Mele, A. R. (2011). Free will in everyday life: Autobiographical accounts of free and unfree actions. Philosophical Psychology, 24(3), 381-394</ref> Baumeister proposes that \"the defining thrust of human psychological evolution was selection in favor of cultural capability\" <ref>Baumeister, R. (2008). Free will in scientific psychology. Perspectives On Psychological Science, 3(1), 14-19.</ref> and that these four psychological capabilities evolved to help humans function in the context of culture. In his view, free will is an advanced form of action control that allows humans to act in pro-social ways towards their [[enlightened self-interest]] when acting in these ways would otherwise be in conflict with the fulfillment of evolutionarily older drives or instincts.<ref>Baumeister, R. F., Crescioni, A., & Alquist, J. L. (2011). Free will as advanced action control for human social life and culture. Neuroethics, 4(1), 1-11</ref> Research by Baumeister and colleagues (principally Kathleen Vohs) has shown that disbelief in free will can lead people to act in ways that are harmful to themselves and society, such as cheating on a test, increased aggression, decreased helpfulness, lower achievement levels in the workplace, and possible barriers to beating addiction.<ref>Vohs, K. D., & Schooler, J. W. (2008). The value of believing in free will: Encouraging a belief in determinism increases cheating. Psychological Science, 19(1), 49-54.</ref><ref>Baumeister, R.

F. (2009). Addiction and free will. Addiction Research & Theory, 17(3), 231-235.</ref>\n\n===Erotic plasticity===\nBaumeister coined the term \"[[erotic plasticity]]\", which is the extent to which one's sex drive can be shaped by cultural, social and situational factors.<ref>\nBaumeister, R. F. (2000). Gender Differences in Erotic Plasticity: The Female Sex Drive as Socially Flexible and Responsive. ''Psychological Bulletin, 126''(3), 347-374\n</ref><ref>Baumeister, R. F. (2004). Gender and erotic plasticity: sociocultural influences on the sex drive. ''Sexual and Relationship Therapy, 19''(2), 1468-1479</ref> He argues that women have high plasticity, meaning that their sex drive can more easily change in response to external pressures. On the other hand, men have low plasticity, and therefore have sex drives that are relatively inflexible.\n\n==Works==\n=== Books authored ===\n* ''Is There Anything Good About Men?: How Cultures Flourish by Exploiting Men'' (2010).\n* ''[[Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength]]'' (2011).\n* ''Escaping the Self: Alcoholism, Spirituality, Masochism, and Other Flights from the Burden of Selfhood'' (1991).\n* ''Your Own Worst Enemy: Understanding the Paradox of Self-Defeating Behavior'' (1993).\n* ''Evil: Inside Human Violence and Cruelty'' (1997). \n* ''Identity: Cultural Change and the Struggle for Self'' (1986).\n* ''Masochism and the Self'' (1989).\n* ''Meanings of Life'' (1991).\n* ''Breaking Hearts: The Two Sides of Unrequited Love'' (1994).\n* ''Losing Control: How and Why People Fail at Self-Regulation'' (1994).\n* With Dianne Tice, ''The Social Dimension of Sex'' (2000).\n* With Tina S.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

It is designed to prepare students in the field of health sciences leading to Doctor of Medicine. \n\nThe Nuclear Medicine Technology program opened in A.Y. 2019-2020 joining it to the former ''College of Medical Radiation Technology'' which was renamed thereafter. The Biotechnology course, on the other hand, was first offered in A.Y. 2020-2021 as the institution\u2019s newest course offering after being granted the autonomous status by CHED.\n\n===Admission===\nDLSMHSI accepts walk-in, online, and foreign applicants for the senior high school, undergraduate, and medicine program.

The hospital is administered by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres, a Catholic religious congregation providing health services throughout the country.\n\nIn 1990, a 4-storey annex, the Raul Wu Chiu Kuan Building was added, increasing bed capacity to 175. Modern equipment continued to be acquired to make DLSUMC comparable with any of the large hospitals in Metro Manila. A Pulmonary Unit, [[Hemodialysis]] Unit, 12-bed [[Intensive Care Unit]], Cardiovascular Laboratory, [[CT Scan]], Echo-Doppler, and [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] are just some of the services offered by the medical center.\n\nAugust 28, 1997 marked the inauguration of the 10-storey hospital annex building, the De La Salle University-Do\u00f1a Teodorica Favis Vda.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.
