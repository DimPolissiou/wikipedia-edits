The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]] became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single.<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'' was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Tejas \u2013 Awards |publisher= AllMusic.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the prominent in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs were credited to Gibbons. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]] became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single.<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'' was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Tejas \u2013 Awards |publisher= AllMusic.

The first Japanese one-yen coin was minted in 1870, and was made out of silver. Eventually gold coins were also produced, resulting in co-circulation among the two. Silver one-yen coins ceased production in 1914. Brass one-yen coins were made in the late 1940s, but the current design was first minted in 1955. The current design is made up of an aluminium alloy which has remained unchanged since the coin was first minted. \n\nIn the early 2010s increasing usage of electronic money led to a lack of demand, and production of the coin was confined to mint sets until 2014. Regular production only lasted until 2016, when new one yen coins were again confined only to mint sets. Like with the [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]], the [[Japan Mint]] has minted one-yen coins at a loss due to the rising cost of the base metal used in the coins.\n\n==History==\nThe first Japanese one-yen coin was minted in 1870; at first these coins were primarily minted in silver. The obverse featured a [[dragon]] with a circular inscription around it. The reverse had a radiant sun surrounded by a wreath, with the [[chrysanthemum]] emblem (a symbol of the [[Japanese Imperial Family]]) flanked by two seals of the Japanese government. The following year, though, Japan switched to the [[gold standard]] to keep up with countries in North America and Europe.<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|url=http://antique-marks.com/collecting-silver-yen.html|title=Collecting Japanese Silver Yen: The Dragon Yen 1870-1914|publisher=Antique Marks|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}</ref> Production of silver one-yen coins was halted, and new small gold coins took their place. Through 1874-1875, one-yen silver coins were again minted with a new design, only to be halted again sometime in 1875 in favor of \"Trade Dollars\". Some yen coins were countermarked (\"Gin\") between 1874 and 1897 for use in [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Formosa]]. Both silver and gold coins co-circulated after 1878 when Japan went with a bimetallic standard, and production of silver one-yen coins resumed, but again ceased in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgs.com/SetRegistry/composite.aspx?c=1264|title=Japan Gold Complete Yen Set 1871-1880|publisher=[[Professional Coin Grading Service]]|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"AM\"/> \n\nThe coinage was reformed in 1948 with the issue of a [[brass]] one-yen coin. 451,170,000 coins were minted until production stopped in 1950.<ref name=\"Krause\">{{cite book|title=Collecting World Coins 10th edition|author=Chester L.

The first Japanese one-yen coin was minted in 1870, and was made out of silver. Eventually gold coins were also produced, resulting in co-circulation among the two. Silver one-yen coins ceased production in 1914. Brass one-yen coins were made in the late 1940s, but the current design was first minted in 1955. The current design is made up of an aluminium alloy which has remained unchanged since the coin was first minted. \n\nIn the early 2010s increasing usage of electronic money led to a lack of demand, and production of the coin was confined to mint sets until 2014. Regular production only lasted until 2016, when new one yen coins were again confined only to mint sets. Like with the [[penny (United States coin)|U.S. penny]], the [[Japan Mint]] has minted one-yen coins at a loss due to the rising cost of the base metal used in the coins.\n\n==History==\nThe first Japanese one-yen coin was minted in 1870; at first these coins were primarily minted in silver. The obverse featured a [[dragon]] with a circular inscription around it. The reverse had a radiant sun surrounded by a wreath, with the [[chrysanthemum]] emblem (a symbol of the [[Japanese Imperial Family]]) flanked by two seals of the Japanese government. The following year, though, Japan switched to the [[gold standard]] to keep up with countries in North America and Europe.<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|url=http://antique-marks.com/collecting-silver-yen.html|title=Collecting Japanese Silver Yen: The Dragon Yen 1870-1914|publisher=Antique Marks|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}</ref> Production of silver one-yen coins was halted, and new small gold coins took their place. Through 1874-1875, one-yen silver coins were again minted with a new design, only to be halted again sometime in 1875 in favor of \"Trade Dollars\". Some yen coins were countermarked (\"Gin\") between 1874 and 1897 for use in [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Formosa]]. Both silver and gold coins co-circulated after 1878 when Japan went with a bimetallic standard, and production of silver one-yen coins resumed, but again ceased in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgs.com/SetRegistry/composite.aspx?c=1264|title=Japan Gold Complete Yen Set 1871-1880|publisher=[[Professional Coin Grading Service]]|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"AM\"/> \n\nThe coinage was reformed in 1948 with the issue of a [[brass]] one-yen coin. 451,170,000 coins were minted until production stopped in 1950.<ref name=\"Krause\">{{cite book|title=Collecting World Coins 10th edition|author=Chester L.

From 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the [[Census of India prior to independence|Decennial Census]], the British classified all J\u0101tis into one or the other of the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' categories as described in ancient texts. Herbert Hope Risley, the Census Commissioner, noted that \"The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system.\"<ref>Crooke, William. \"Social Types\". Chapter II in Risley, Sir Herbert Hope. The People of India</ref> The system of ''Varnas'' propounded in ancient Hindu texts envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmin]]s (scholars and yajna priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (rulers and warriors), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (workmen/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the ''Varnas'' system was never truly operational in society and there is no evidence of it ever being a reality in Indian history. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''J\u0101tis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations to geographic areas. The ''J\u0101tis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status.

Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalization and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilization of people and policy development.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sen|first1=Ronojoy.|title=The persistence of caste in indian politics|journal=Pacific Affairs|date=2012|volume=85|issue=2|pages=363\u2013369|doi=10.5509/2012852363}}</ref>\n\nStudies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=FROM CASTE TO CLASS IN INDIAN SOCIETY|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1\u201314}}</ref> While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has provided a network for younger Indians to take control of their relationships through the use of dating apps.

Men are expected to marry within their caste, or one below, with no social repercussions. If a woman marries into a higher caste, then her children will take the status of their father. If she marries down, her family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. In this case, the women are bearers of the egalitarian principle of the marriage. There would be no benefit in marrying a higher caste if the terms of the marriage did not imply equality.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Kingsley Davis | date=13 June 2013 | title=Intermarriage in Caste Societies | journal=[[AnthroSource]] | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=376\u2013395 | doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.3.02a00030 }}</ref> However, men are systematically shielded from the negative implications of the agreement.\n\nGeographical factors also determine adherence to the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to participate in exogamous marriage, due to a lack of eligible suitors within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women, of the northern mountains, have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma. This often leads to better husbandry as his actions are not protected by social expectations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\nChiefly among the factors influencing the rise of exogamy is the rapid [[urbanisation in India]] experienced over the last century. It is well known that urban centers tend to be less reliant on tradition and are more progressive as a whole. As India\u2019s cities boomed in population, the job market grew to keep pace. Prosperity and stability were now more easily attained by an individual, and the anxiety to marry quickly and effectively was reduced as traditional marriage was viewed as a means to attain these principles. Thus, younger, more progressive generations of urban Indians are less likely than ever to participate in the antiquated system of arranged endogamy.\n\nIndia has also experimented with Affirmative Action, locally known as \u201creservation groups\u201d. Quota system jobs, as well as placements in publicly funded colleges, hold spots for the 8% of India\u2019s minority, and underprivileged groups. As a result, in states such as Tamil Nadu or those in the north-east, where underprivileged populations predominate, over 80% of government jobs are set aside in quotas. In education, colleges lower the marks necessary for the Dalits to enter.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Delhi A.R | date=13 June 2013 | title=Indian Reservations | url=https://www.economist.com/banyan/2013/06/29/indian-reservations | journal=[[The Economist]] | access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India (62).jpg|thumb|A page from the manuscript ''Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India'', which consists of 72 full-color hand-painted images of men and women of various religions, occupations and ethnic groups found in [[Madurai|Madura, India]] in 1837, which confirms the popular perception and nature of caste as Jati, before the British made it applicable only to Hindus grouped under the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' categories from the 1901 census onwards.]]\n\n==Caste systems in the rest of South Asia==\n===Nepal===\n{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}\nThe [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles in some respects the Indian ''j\u0101ti'' system, with numerous ''j\u0101ti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed.

The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.<ref name=boon/>\n\n====Philippines====\n[[File:Naturales 3.png|thumb|A [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royal couple (''[[maginoo]]''), from the [[Boxer Codex]] (c. 1590)]]\nIn the Philippines, pre-colonial societies do not have a single social structure.

Examples include the [[Mangyan people|Mangyan]] and the [[Kalanguya people]]s.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Warrior societies - societies where a distinct warrior class exists, and whose membership depends on martial prowess. Examples include the [[Mandaya people|Mandaya]], [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]], [[Tagakaulo people|Tagakaulo]], and [[B'laan people]]s who had warriors called the ''bagani'' or ''magani''. Similarly, in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera highlands]] of [[Luzon]], the [[Isneg people|Isneg]] and [[Kalinga people]]s refer to their warriors as ''mengal'' or ''maingal''. This society is typical for [[head-hunting]] ethnic groups or ethnic groups which had seasonal raids (''[[mangayaw]]'') into enemy territory.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Petty [[Plutocracy|plutocracies]] - societies which have a wealthy class based on property and the hosting of periodic prestige feasts. In some groups, it was an actual caste whose members had specialized leadership roles, married only within the same caste, and wore specialized clothing. These include the ''kadangyan'' of the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]], [[Bontoc people|Bontoc]], and [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] peoples, as well as the ''baknang'' of the [[Ibaloi people]]. In others, though wealth may give one prestige and leadership qualifications, it was not a caste per se.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n*Principalities - societies with an actual ruling class and caste systems determined by birthright. Most of these societies are either [[Greater India|Indianized]] or [[lstal ethnic groups like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Visayan people|Visayan]], and [[Moro people|Moro]] societies. Most of them were usually divided into four to five caste systems with different names under different ethnic groups that roughly correspond to each other. The system was more or less [[feudalistic]], with the ''datu'' ultimately having control of all the lands of the community. The land is subdivided among the enfranchised classes, the ''sakop'' or ''sa-op'' ([[vassal]]s, lit. \"those under the power of another\"). The castes were hereditary, though they were not rigid. They were more accurately a reflection of the interpersonal political relationships, a person is always the follower of another. People can move up the caste system by marriage, by wealth, or by doing something extraordinary; and conversely they can be demoted, usually as criminal punishment or as a result of debt. Shamans are the exception, as they are either volunteers, chosen by the ranking shamans, or born into the role by innate propensity for it. They are enumerated below from the highest rank to the lowest:<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/><ref name=\"arcilla\">{{cite book|author=Arcilla, Jos\u00e9 S. |title =An Introduction to Philippine History|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|year =1998|page=14&ndash;16|isbn =9789715502610|url =https://books.google.com/?id=uxEYobbU-D8C&lpg=PA15&dq=timawa&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q=timawa&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"scott2\">{{cite book|author=Scott, William Henry |title =Barangay: sixteenth-century Philippine culture and society|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=9789715501354|year =1994}}</ref>\n:* Royalty - ([[Visayan people|Visayan]]: ''[[kadatoan]]'') the ''[[datu]]'' and immediate descendants. They are often further categorized according to purity of lineage. The power of the ''datu'' is dependent on the willingness of their followers to render him respect and obedience. Most roles of the datu were judicial and military. In case of an unfit ''datu'', support may be withdrawn by his followers. ''Datu'' were almost always male, though in some ethnic groups like the [[Banwaon people]], the female shaman (''[[babaylan|babaiyon]]'') co-rules as the female counterpart of the ''datu''.\n:* Nobility - (Visayan: ''[[tumao]]''; [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]: ''[[maginoo]]''; [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] ''ginu''; [[Tausug people|Tausug]]: ''bangsa mataas'') the ruling class, either inclusive of or exclusive of the royal family. Most are descendants of the royal line or gained their status through wealth or bravery in battle. They owned lands and subjects, from whom they collected taxes.\n:* Shamans - (Visayan: ''[[babaylan]]''; Tagalog: ''[[katalonan]]'') the spirit mediums, usually female or feminized men. While they weren't technically a caste, they commanded the same respect and status as nobility.\n:* Warriors - (Visayan: ''[[timawa]]''; Tagalog: ''[[maharlika]]'') the martial class. They could own land and subjects like the higher ranks, but were required to fight for the ''datu'' in times of war. In some Filipino ethnic groups, they were often tattooed extensively to record feats in battle and as protection against harm. They were sometimes further subdivided into different classes, depending on their relationship with the ''datu''. They traditionally went on seasonal raids on enemy settlements.\n:* Commoners and slaves - (Visayan, [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]]: ''[[ulipon]]''; Tagalog: ''[[alipin]]''; Tausug: ''kiapangdilihan''; [[Maranao people|Maranao]]: ''kakatamokan'') - the lowest class composed of the rest of the community who were not part of the enfranchised classes. They were further subdivided into the commoner class who had their own houses, the servants who lived in the houses of others, and the slaves who were usually captives from raids, criminals, or debtors. Most members of this class were equivalent to the European [[serf]] class, who paid taxes and can be conscripted to communal tasks, but were more or less free to do as they please.\n\n===East Asia===\n\n====China and Mongolia====\n\nDuring the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system.

Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.\n\nHowell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L.

The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitans]] who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion.  They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads.  Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.\n\nIn 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means \"two classes\". It was composed of scholars (''munban'') and warriors (''muban''). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' (\uc911\uc778-\u4e2d\u4eba: literally \"middle people\". This was a small class of specialized professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the ''sangmin'' (\uc0c1\ubbfc-\u5e38\u6c11: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a [[serf]] population known as the ''nobi''. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780874368857|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl01rodr/page/392 392]|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalencycl01rodr|url-access=registration|quote=10 percent of the total population on average, but it could rise up to one-third of the total.|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|year=1997}}</ref> In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Youngmin|last2=Pettid|first2=Michael J.|title=Women and Confucianism in Choson Korea: New Perspectives|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438437774|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwgUa6WWFBMC&pg=PA141#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2011-11-01}}</ref> and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea.<ref name=\"nobi\">{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Gwyn|title=Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135759179|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0iRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2004-11-23}}</ref> The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886\u201387 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894,<ref name=\"nobi\" /> but traces remained until 1930.\n\nThe opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate ''baekjeong'' into worship, with non-''baekjeong'' finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the same time, the ''baekjeong'' began to resist open social discrimination.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekch\u014fng Movement in Colonial Korea|title=Colonial Modernity in Korea|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|editor=Gi-Wook Shin and Michael Robinson|year=1999|pages=326|isbn=978-0-674-00594-5}}</ref> They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society.

Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.<ref name=\"proper\">Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894\u20131910''</ref>\n\nWhile most Koreans by then had surnames and even [[bongwan]], although still substantial number of [[cheonmin]], mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Untouchability|untouchables]] did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' (\"people\") and later, ''kungmin'' (\"citizen\").<ref name=\"proper\"/>\n\n====North Korea====\n{{Main|Songbun}}\n\nThe [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] reported that \"Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=06 Jun 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9313174/North-Korea-caste-system-underpins-human-rights-abuses.html |title=North Korea caste system 'underpins human rights abuses' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref> Called ''[[Songbun]]'', [[Barbara Demick]] describes this \"class structure\" as an updating of the hereditary \"caste system\", a combination of [[Confucianism]] and [[Stalinism]].<ref>Barbara Demick, ''Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea'', Fourth Estate, London, 2010, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> She claims that a bad family background is called \"tainted blood\", and that by law this \"tainted blood\" lasts three generations.<ref>Demick, pp. 28, 197, 202.</ref>\n\n===West Asia===\n{{further|Yazidi}}\n\n[[Yezidi]] society is hierarchical.

The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual.

Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.<ref name=Obinna1/>\n\nThe ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the \"Osus\" people as \"owned by deities\" and outcasts.\n\nThe Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society.

These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|issue=1|pages=37\u201354|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mand\u00e9]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.\n\nTamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.\n\nAs West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.<ref name=tamari1>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221\u2013250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}</ref>\n\n====Central Africa====\n{{Expand section|date=February 2019}}\n\nEthel M.

Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|title=La Caste en Afrique? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M.

From 1901 onwards, for the purposes of the [[Census of India prior to independence|Decennial Census]], the British classified all J\u0101tis into one or the other of the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' categories as described in ancient texts. Herbert Hope Risley, the Census Commissioner, noted that \"The principle suggested as a basis was that of classification by social precedence as recognized by native public opinion at the present day, and manifesting itself in the facts that particular castes are supposed to be the modern representatives of one or other of the castes of the theoretical Indian system.\"<ref>Crooke, William. \"Social Types\". Chapter II in Risley, Sir Herbert Hope. The People of India</ref> The system of ''Varnas'' propounded in ancient Hindu texts envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmin]]s (scholars and yajna priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (rulers and warriors), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (workmen/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|Varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the ''Varnas'' system was never truly operational in society and there is no evidence of it ever being a reality in Indian history. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''J\u0101tis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations to geographic areas. The ''J\u0101tis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status.

There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties.

As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=FROM CASTE TO CLASS IN INDIAN SOCIETY|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1\u201314}}</ref> While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has provided a network for younger Indians to take control of their relationships through the use of dating apps.

Men are expected to marry within their caste, or one below, with no social repercussions. If a woman marries into a higher caste, then her children will take the status of their father. If she marries down, her family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. In this case, the women are bearers of the egalitarian principle of the marriage. There would be no benefit in marrying a higher caste if the terms of the marriage did not imply equality.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Kingsley Davis | date=13 June 2013 | title=Intermarriage in Caste Societies | journal=[[AnthroSource]] | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=376\u2013395 | doi=10.1525/aa.1941.43.3.02a00030 }}</ref> However, men are systematically shielded from the negative implications of the agreement.\n\nGeographical factors also determine adherence to the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to participate in exogamous marriage, due to a lack of eligible suitors within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women, of the northern mountains, have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma. This often leads to better husbandry as his actions are not protected by social expectations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55\u201358}}</ref>\n\nChiefly among the factors influencing the rise of exogamy is the rapid [[urbanisation in India]] experienced over the last century. It is well known that urban centers tend to be less reliant on tradition and are more progressive as a whole. As India\u2019s cities boomed in population, the job market grew to keep pace. Prosperity and stability were now more easily attained by an individual, and the anxiety to marry quickly and effectively was reduced as traditional marriage was viewed as a means to attain these principles. Thus, younger, more progressive generations of urban Indians are less likely than ever to participate in the antiquated system of arranged endogamy.\n\nIndia has also experimented with Affirmative Action, locally known as \u201creservation groups\u201d. Quota system jobs, as well as placements in publicly funded colleges, hold spots for the 8% of India\u2019s minority, and underprivileged groups. As a result, in states such as Tamil Nadu or those in the north-east, where underprivileged populations predominate, over 80% of government jobs are set aside in quotas. In education, colleges lower the marks necessary for the Dalits to enter.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Delhi A.R | date=13 June 2013 | title=Indian Reservations | url=https://www.economist.com/banyan/2013/06/29/indian-reservations | journal=[[The Economist]] | access-date=4 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India (62).jpg|thumb|A page from the manuscript ''Seventy-two Specimens of Castes in India'', which consists of 72 full-color hand-painted images of men and women of various religions, occupations and ethnic groups found in [[Madurai|Madura, India]] in 1837, which confirms the popular perception and nature of caste as Jati, before the British made it applicable only to Hindus grouped under the ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' categories from the 1901 census onwards.]]\n\n==Caste systems in the rest of South Asia==\n===Nepal===\n{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}\nThe [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles in some respects the Indian ''j\u0101ti'' system, with numerous ''j\u0101ti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed.

The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.<ref name=boon/>\n\n====Philippines====\n[[File:Naturales 3.png|thumb|A [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] royal couple (''[[maginoo]]''), from the [[Boxer Codex]] (c. 1590)]]\nIn the Philippines, pre-colonial societies do not have a single social structure.

Examples include the [[Mangyan people|Mangyan]] and the [[Kalanguya people]]s.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Warrior societies - societies where a distinct warrior class exists, and whose membership depends on martial prowess. Examples include the [[Mandaya people|Mandaya]], [[Bagobo people|Bagobo]], [[Tagakaulo people|Tagakaulo]], and [[B'laan people]]s who had warriors called the ''bagani'' or ''magani''. Similarly, in the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera highlands]] of [[Luzon]], the [[Isneg people|Isneg]] and [[Kalinga people]]s refer to their warriors as ''mengal'' or ''maingal''. This society is typical for [[head-hunting]] ethnic groups or ethnic groups which had seasonal raids (''[[mangayaw]]'') into enemy territory.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n* Petty [[Plutocracy|plutocracies]] - societies which have a wealthy class based on property and the hosting of periodic prestige feasts. In some groups, it was an actual caste whose members had specialized leadership roles, married only within the same caste, and wore specialized clothing. These include the ''kadangyan'' of the [[Ifugao people|Ifugao]], [[Bontoc people|Bontoc]], and [[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]] peoples, as well as the ''baknang'' of the [[Ibaloi people]]. In others, though wealth may give one prestige and leadership qualifications, it was not a caste per se.<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/>\n*Principalities - societies with an actual ruling class and caste systems determined by birthright. Most of these societies are either [[Greater India|Indianized]] or [[Islamized]] to a degree. They include the larger coastal ethnic groups like the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]], [[Visayan people|Visayan]], and [[Moro people|Moro]] societies. Most of them were usually divided into four to five caste systems with different names under different ethnic groups that roughly correspond to each other. The system was more or less [[feudalistic]], with the ''datu'' ultimately having control of all the lands of the community. The land is subdivided among the enfranchised classes, the ''sakop'' or ''sa-op'' ([[vassal]]s, lit. \"those under the power of another\"). The castes were hereditary, though they were not rigid. They were more accurately a reflection of the interpersonal political relationships, a person is always the follower of another. People can move up the caste system by marriage, by wealth, or by doing something extraordinary; and conversely they can be demoted, usually as criminal punishment or as a result of debt. Shamans are the exception, as they are either volunteers, chosen by the ranking shamans, or born into the role by innate propensity for it. They are enumerated below from the highest rank to the lowest:<ref name=\"Scott1979\"/><ref name=\"arcilla\">{{cite book|author=Arcilla, Jos\u00e9 S. |title =An Introduction to Philippine History|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|year =1998|page=14&ndash;16|isbn =9789715502610|url =https://books.google.com/?id=uxEYobbU-D8C&lpg=PA15&dq=timawa&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q=timawa&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"scott2\">{{cite book|author=Scott, William Henry |title =Barangay: sixteenth-century Philippine culture and society|publisher =Ateneo de Manila University Press|isbn=9789715501354|year =1994}}</ref>\n:* Royalty - ([[Visayan people|Visayan]]: ''[[kadatoan]]'') the ''[[datu]]'' and immediate descendants. They are often further categorized according to purity of lineage. The power of the ''datu'' is dependent on the willingness of their followers to render him respect and obedience. Most roles of the datu were judicial and military. In case of an unfit ''datu'', support may be withdrawn by his followers. ''Datu'' were almost always male, though in some ethnic groups like the [[Banwaon people]], the female shaman (''[[babaylan|babaiyon]]'') co-rules as the female counterpart of the ''datu''.\n:* Nobility - (Visayan: ''[[tumao]]''; [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]]: ''[[maginoo]]''; [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangan]] ''ginu''; [[Tausug people|Tausug]]: ''bangsa mataas'') the ruling class, either inclusive of or exclusive of the royal family. Most are descendants of the royal line or gained their status through wealth or bravery in battle. They owned lands and subjects, from whom they collected taxes.\n:* Shamans - (Visayan: ''[[babaylan]]''; Tagalog: ''[[katalonan]]'') the spirit mediums, usually female or feminized men. While they weren't technically a caste, they commanded the same respect and status as nobility.\n:* Warriors - (Visayan: ''[[timawa]]''; Tagalog: ''[[maharlika]]'') the martial class. They could own land and subjects like the higher ranks, but were required to fight for the ''datu'' in times of war. In some Filipino ethnic groups, they were often tattooed extensively to record feats in battle and as protection against harm. They were sometimes further subdivided into different classes, depending on their relationship with the ''datu''. They traditionally went on seasonal raids on enemy settlements.\n:* Commoners and slaves - (Visayan, [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanao]]: ''[[ulipon]]''; Tagalog: ''[[alipin]]''; Tausug: ''kiapangdilihan''; [[Maranao people|Maranao]]: ''kakatamokan'') - the lowest class composed of the rest of the community who were not part of the enfranchised classes. They were further subdivided into the commoner class who had their own houses, the servants who lived in the houses of others, and the slaves who were usually captives from raids, criminals, or debtors. Most members of this class were equivalent to the European [[serf]] class, who paid taxes and can be conscripted to communal tasks, but were more or less free to do as they please.\n\n===East Asia===\n\n====China and Mongolia====\n\nDuring the period of [[Yuan Dynasty]], ruler [[Kublai Khan]] enforced a ''Four Class System'', which was a legal caste system.

At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Sh\u014dgun and daimy\u014d. Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.\n\nHowell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L.

Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' (\uc911\uc778-\u4e2d\u4eba: literally \"middle people\".

Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.<ref name=\"proper\">Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California.

The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters.

These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|issue=1|pages=37\u201354|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mand\u00e9]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.\n\nTamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.\n\nAs West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.<ref name=tamari1>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221\u2013250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}</ref>\n\n====Central Africa====\n{{Expand section|date=February 2019}}\n\nEthel M.

Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|title=La Caste en Afrique? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M.

Geologically, it is built on the confluence of [[Quaternary]] lava flows to the west, [[Silurian]] [[mudstone]]s to the east, and [[Holocene]] sand accumulation to the southeast along [[Port Phillip]]. The southeastern suburbs are situated on the [[Selwyn fault]] which transects [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] and [[Cranbourne, Victoria|Cranbourne]].\n\nMelbourne extends along the [[Yarra River]] towards the [[Yarra Valley]] and the [[Dandenong Ranges]] to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries\u2014[[Moonee Ponds Creek]] (toward Tullamarine Airport), [[Merri Creek]], [[Darebin Creek]] and [[Plenty River]]\u2014to the outer suburban growth corridors of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]] and [[Whittlesea, Victoria|Whittlesea]].\n\nThe city reaches southeast through [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] to the growth corridor of [[Pakenham, Victoria|Pakenham]] towards [[West Gippsland]], and southward through the [[Dandenong Creek]] valley and the city of [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]]. In the west, it extends along the [[Maribyrnong River]] and its tributaries north towards [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] and the foothills of the [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]], and along the flat volcanic plain country towards [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] in the west, [[Werribee]] at the foothills of the [[You Yangs]] [[granite]] ridge south west of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city.\n\nMelbourne's major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like [[Port Melbourne]], [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], [[Elwood, Victoria|Elwood]], [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], [[Sandringham, Victoria|Sandringham]], [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] and Werribee South.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually.

These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having \"four seasons in one day\",<ref name=autogenerated1>{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |accessdate=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}</ref> The lowest temperature on record is {{convert|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.<ref name=\"snow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=123&p_display_type=dailyDataFile&p_startYear=1869&p_c=-1481637067&p_stn_num=86071 |title=Bureau of Meteorology \u2013 Climate Data Online |accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref> The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title = Monthly climate statistics | publisher= Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 30 March 2012}}</ref> While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 March 2009|title=BOM -

Geologically, it is built on the confluence of [[Quaternary]] lava flows to the west, [[Silurian]] [[mudstone]]s to the east, and [[Holocene]] sand accumulation to the southeast along [[Port Phillip]]. The southeastern suburbs are situated on the [[Selwyn fault]] which transects [[Mount Martha, Victoria|Mount Martha]] and [[Cranbourne, Victoria|Cranbourne]].\n\nMelbourne extends along the [[Yarra River]] towards the [[Yarra Valley]] and the [[Dandenong Ranges]] to the east. It extends northward through the undulating bushland valleys of the Yarra's tributaries\u2014[[Moonee Ponds Creek]] (toward Tullamarine Airport), [[Merri Creek]], [[Darebin Creek]] and [[Plenty River]]\u2014to the outer suburban growth corridors of [[Craigieburn, Victoria|Craigieburn]] and [[Whittlesea, Victoria|Whittlesea]].\n\nThe city reaches southeast through [[Dandenong, Victoria|Dandenong]] to the growth corridor of [[Pakenham, Victoria|Pakenham]] towards [[West Gippsland]], and southward through the [[Dandenong Creek]] valley and the city of [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]]. In the west, it extends along the [[Maribyrnong River]] and its tributaries north towards [[Sunbury, Victoria|Sunbury]] and the foothills of the [[Shire of Macedon Ranges|Macedon Ranges]], and along the flat volcanic plain country towards [[Melton, Victoria|Melton]] in the west, [[Werribee]] at the foothills of the [[You Yangs]] [[granite]] ridge south west of the CBD. The Little River, and the township of the same name, marks the border between Melbourne and neighbouring Geelong city.\n\nMelbourne's major bayside beaches are in the various suburbs along the shores of Port Phillip Bay, in areas like [[Port Melbourne]], [[Albert Park, Victoria|Albert Park]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], [[Elwood, Victoria|Elwood]], [[Brighton, Victoria|Brighton]], [[Sandringham, Victoria|Sandringham]], [[Mentone, Victoria|Mentone]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]], [[Altona, Victoria|Altona]], [[Williamstown, Victoria|Williamstown]] and Werribee South.

This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, however, are usually very stable, but rather damp and often cloudy.\n\nPort Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a \"bay effect\" similar to the \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" seen in colder climates where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, Melbourne is, owing to the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Otway Ranges]], nonetheless drier than average for southern Victoria. Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{convert|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{convert|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually.

These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having \"four seasons in one day\",<ref name=autogenerated1>{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office|accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |accessdate=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |archivedate=19 July 2008 |df= }}</ref> The lowest temperature on record is {{convert|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.<ref name=\"snow\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/jsp/ncc/cdio/weatherData/av?p_nccObsCode=123&p_display_type=dailyDataFile&p_startYear=1869&p_c=-1481637067&p_stn_num=86071 |title=Bureau of Meteorology \u2013 Climate Data Online |accessdate=6 January 2015 }}</ref> The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{convert|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title = Monthly climate statistics | publisher= Bureau of Meteorology | accessdate = 30 March 2012}}</ref> While snow is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 March 2009|title=BOM -

In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through [[RGB color model|red, green and blue]] [[filter (optics)|filters]] and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maxwell |first1=James Clerk |year=1855 |title=Experiments on Colour, as Perceived by the Eye, with Remarks on Colour-Blindness |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=275\u2013298 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800032117|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2041790 }} (This thought-experiment is described on pages 283\u2013284. The short-wavelength filter is specified as \"violet\", but during the 19th century \"violet\" could be used to describe a deep violet-blue such as the colour of cobalt glass.)</ref>\n\nDuring an 1861 Royal Institution lecture on colour theory, Maxwell presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]], inventor of the [[single-lens reflex camera]], took the picture. He photographed a [[tartan]] ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's [[photographic plate]]s were  insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, the results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that \"if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue,\" it \"would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved.\"<ref name=\"Tolstoy_p 103-104\"/><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://notesonphotographs.org/index.php?title=Maxwell,_J._Clerk._%22On_the_Theory_of_Three_Primary_Colours.%22|author=Maxwell, J.

He examined the nature of both electric and magnetic fields in his two-part paper \"[[On physical lines of force]]\", which was published in 1861. In it he provided a conceptual model for [[electromagnetic induction]], consisting of tiny spinning cells of [[magnetic flux]]. Two more parts were later added to and published in that same paper in early 1862. In the first additional part he discussed the nature of [[electrostatics]] and [[displacement current]]. In the second additional part, he dealt with the rotation of the plane of the [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation of light]] in a magnetic field, a phenomenon that had been discovered by Faraday and is now known as the [[Faraday effect]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mahon|2003|p=109}}</ref>\n\n===Later years, 1865\u20131879===\n[[File:JCM Grave-1.jpg|thumb|The gravestone at Parton Kirk (Galloway) of James Clerk Maxwell, his parents and his wife]]\n[[File:JCM Memorial Stone-1.jpg|thumb|This memorial stone to James Clerk Maxwell stands on a green in front of the church, beside the war memorial at Parton (Galloway).]]\nIn 1865 Maxwell resigned the chair at King's College, London, and returned to Glenlair with Katherine.

Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called ''[[Metamerism (color)|metameres]]''. [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Young |first=Thomas |title=Bakerian Lecture: Experiments and calculations relative to physical optics |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |year=1804 |volume=94 |pages=1\u201316 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false |bibcode=1804RSPT...94....1Y |doi=10.1098/rstl.1804.0001 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427130034/https://books.google.com/books?id=7AZGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1 |archivedate=27 April 2016 }}</ref> the ''[[Young\u2013Helmholtz theory|trichromatic colour theory]]''. Maxwell used the recently developed [[Linear algebra]] to prove Young's theory.

He demonstrated that to be the case,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maxwell |first=James Clerk |date=1857 |title=XVIII.\u2014Experiments on Colour, as perceived by the Eye, with Remarks on Colour-Blindness |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=275\u2013298 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800032117 }}</ref> inventing colour matching experiments and [[Colourimetry]].\n\nMaxwell was also interested in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in [[colour photography]]. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced with a set of three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through [[RGB color model|red, green and blue]] [[filter (optics)|filters]] and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be perceived by the human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maxwell |first1=James Clerk |year=1855 |title=Experiments on Colour, as Perceived by the Eye, with Remarks on Colour-Blindness |journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=275\u2013298 |doi=10.1017/S0080456800032117|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2041790 }} (This thought-experiment is described on pages 283\u2013284. The short-wavelength filter is specified as \"violet\", but during the 19th century \"violet\" could be used to describe a deep violet-blue such as the colour of cobalt glass.)</ref>\n\nDuring an 1861 Royal Institution lecture on colour theory, Maxwell presented the world's first demonstration of colour photography by this principle of three-colour analysis and synthesis. [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]], inventor of the [[single-lens reflex camera]], took the picture. He photographed a [[tartan]] ribbon three times, through red, green, and blue filters, also making a fourth photograph through a yellow filter, which, according to Maxwell's account, was not used in the demonstration. Because Sutton's [[photographic plate]]s were  insensitive to red and barely sensitive to green, the results of this pioneering experiment were far from perfect. It was remarked in the published account of the lecture that \"if the red and green images had been as fully photographed as the blue,\" it \"would have been a truly-coloured image of the riband. By finding photographic materials more sensitive to the less refrangible rays, the representation of the colours of objects might be greatly improved.\"<ref name=\"Tolstoy_p 103-104\"/><ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://notesonphotographs.org/index.php?title=Maxwell,_J._Clerk._%22On_the_Theory_of_Three_Primary_Colours.%22|author=Maxwell, J.

Peter is excited but also learns that his rival Sky Pierson, host of a more successful wildlife show, will pay Bill $1,000 for the map. Unable to pay the amount, Peter tells Bill that he will have the money and pay him in a week at his mountain cabin.\n\nPeter along with his crew, Fred Wolf (soundman), Lynn Cooker (equipment manager), Danny Gutierrez (RV driver), and Junior (camera man) start preparing for the long trip. They also bring in two new people: Whitaker, a former car mechanic now hired as the animal handler, and Cheryl, a travel agent. While stopping to shoot a show on sea lions, Danny dresses up as a seal to get good angles but gets attacked by a shark and ends up hospitalized. Outside the hospital, Peter and Fred get into trouble with a local Hispanic gang, get their front teeth knocked out and go to a local dentist. These incidents result in the group's funds being drained.\n\nThe group arrive three days to Bill's cabin and learn that he already sold the map to Pierson. However, he manages to make a copy of the map since Pierson studied the map under one of Bill's security cameras. He also manages to acquire the help of renowned tracker, Gus Hayden, but the group does not have the money to hire him. While urinating in the bushes, Peter is attacked out of nowhere by a mother turkey and ends up with his penis inside the bird's mouth. The group rushes him to a hospital to remove the turkey off his penis. The group stops the doctor from cutting the turkey's head off when a wildlife ranger and his son, who are the turkey's owners, say there is a $5,000 reward for the bird's return.\n\nThe group continue their journey and eventually reach Ecuador where they meet up with Dick, a friend of Bill and explorer, who takes them to Gus Hayden. The next morning, however, they wake up to find that Gus has left, stolen their equipment, and Cheryl has gone with him. Though hesitant and Peter not willing to give up, Dick agrees to lead the group through the jungle. During the night, Cheryl catches up with the group where she explains that she saw Gus stealing their equipment and pretended to run off with him so she could convince him to give her the map. The next day while crossing the river, Dick gets attacked and eaten by piranhas. They also come across Pierson's camp and find that he and his team have been killed by local pygmies. The group then gathers the camp's equipment and eventually reach Bigfoot's cave. While filming, a confused Bigfoot steps out and ends up getting gunned down when the group was scared at his presence. Not sure how to end the show in a good way, Cooker comes up with the idea of showing Bigfoot committing suicide. They return to the studio to show Lawson their footage, where he berates them for their ridiculousness and cancels the show. This leads to a huge fight within the group.\n\nA year later, Peter gets a visit from Milas (the original cameraman and a friend of his father) and encourages him to revive the show. Peter gets everyone back together and they make an episode about a shark attack. They show the episode to Lawson, who decides to put the show back on the air since people love shark attacks and Pierson's death gives them no competition.\n\nThe film ends with captions explaining that ''Strange Wilderness'' became successful again and six months later, they went searching for the Loch ness Monster.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as Peter Gaulke\n* [[Allen Covert]] as [[Fred Wolf (writer)|Fred Wolf]]\n* [[Justin Long]] as Junior\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Lynn Cooker\n* [[Robert Patrick]] as Gus Hayden\n* [[Ashley Scott]] as Cheryl\n* [[Harry Hamlin]] as Sky Pierson\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Milas\n* [[Jeff Garlin]] as Ed Lawson\n* [[Kevin Heffernan (comedian)|Kevin Heffernan]] as Whitaker\n* [[John P.

The district was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] on 1 April 1974 from the former area of [[Basildon Urban District]] and the part of [[Thurrock Urban District]] that was within the Basildon New Town. The population of the district as of 2010 is about 172,000. The council made an application for [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in February 2010 and this was given approval that year, with Cllr Mo Larkin becoming the first mayor in October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062153/http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 July 2011 |title=Basildon to get its first Mayor |publisher=Basildon District Council |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-11315875 | title=Basildon district becomes borough | publisher=BBC News | date=15 September 2010 | accessdate=26 March 2011 }}</ref> The local authority is [[Basildon Borough Council]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{see also|Basildon local elections}}\nElections to [[Basildon Borough Council]] are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 42 seats on the council being elected at each election.

The towns of [[Billericay]] and [[Wickford]] are two of the areas which both have surrounding villages. Occasional proposals have been made to move Billericay and Wickford to other districts, leaving Basildon more focused on the new town.<ref name=cooksey>LGCE.

December 1995.</ref>\n\nThe other, largest, population centre is commonly referred to as [[Basildon]] and comprises three original settlements: [[Laindon]], Basildon and [[Pitsea]] (from west to east) which have merged with other minor settlements to form the New Town, which is a continuous urban area.\n\nThe remaining land, approximately half of the district is designated as [[green belt]], has several [[site of special scientific interest|sites of special scientific interest]]. Two are around Billericay and the remainder are to the south of Basildon New Town. There are also wildlife areas of varying sizes around most of the district, except in the East.\n\nThe source of the [[River Crouch]] is in the district. The river runs across the district, through [[Wickford]] before it leaves the district.\n\nThe district is linked well by road and rail with significant surrounding destinations, including [[London]].\n\nIn the west of the Basildon district, the [[Dunton Plotlands]] is an area of small plots of land used as weekend cottages or smallholdings inhabited during the mid twentieth century.\n\n=== List of settlements ===\nIt contains the towns of:\n\n* [[Basildon]] (the administrative headquarters)\n** [[Laindon]]\n** [[Langdon Hills]]\n** [[Pitsea]]\n** [[Vange]]\n* [[Billericay]]\n* [[Wickford]]\n\nVillages within the district are:\n* [[Bowers Gifford]]\n* [[Crays Hill]]\n* [[Dunton Wayletts]]\n* [[Great Burstead]]\n* [[Little Burstead]]\n* [[Nevendon]]\n* [[North Benfleet]]\n* [[Ramsden Bellhouse]]\n* [[Shotgate]]\n* [[Great Berry]]\n\n==Regeneration plans==\nBasildon District is a prosperous business location and has in recent years seen significant inward investment and jobs growth. Throughout Basildon District there are major developments planned estimated to total nearly \u00a32 billion. These include:\n\n*The regeneration of Basildon, Wickford, Pitsea, and Laindon Town Centres\n*A new Sporting Village and improvements to playing pitches and sports facilities throughout the District to make Basildon the Centre for Sport in South Essex. The sporting village is expected in 2010, and is being highly sought after as an Olympic training base for one of the top teams, including the Russians. Its combined benefits, of having some of the top facilities so close to London, including one of the few Olympic (50m) size pools in the UK, will make it a true asset to whatever team(s) use it.\n*The creation of a health and education research centre near Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital and FE College\n*Investment in the Basildon Enterprise Corridor, the largest business area in the Thames Gateway outside London, home to 45,000 jobs and over 5,000 businesses, including Ford, Selex, Visteon, Case New Holland, [[First Data]] Europe, International Financial Services Limited, RBS, and Starbucks\n*The creation of one of the largest wetland nature reserves in Europe in the Thames Marshes by the RSPB, Land Restoration Trust, Basildon District Council and Veolia\n*A strategic review of the District's housing, with investment in housing estates such as Craylands, Five Links and Felmores to create first class places to live\n\nCoordinating and promoting this programme of investment is the Basildon Renaissance Partnership which was set up in 2003 by Basildon District Council. Its partners also include the East Of England Development Agency, English Partnerships, Essex County Council, and the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership with support from the Department for Communities and Local Government.\n\nThe BBC noted the council had decided to sell for \u00a31 a plot of land it bought next to the golf course for \u00a31m in order to build a 4 star hotel.  The Conservative leader described the sale as an exciting step forward.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-47172198|title=Basildon Council to sell land it bought for \u00a31m for \u00a31|work=BBC news|date=8 February 2019|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nThe district is connected to [[London]] and [[Southend-on-sea|Southend]] via two train operators: [[c2c]] and [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. The route operated by c2c is the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. Three principal stations of the railway line are in the district: [[Basildon railway station]], [[Laindon railway station]] and [[Pitsea railway station]]\n\nThe former [[First Great Eastern|Great Eastern]] service (now [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]) operates on the [[Shenfield to Southend Line]]. Trains stop at [[Billericay railway station|Billericay]] and [[Wickford railway station]]. At Wickford, the [[Crouch Valley Line]] diverges from the Shenfield to Southend line.\n\nThree [[Primary status|primary route]]s are within the district. The [[A127 road|A127]] goes through its centre, the [[A13 road (Great Britain)|A13]] goes through the south-east at Pitsea. Both these primary routes connect the district with [[Greater London]] and Southend-on-Sea. At Bowers Gifford at a terminus of the A13's [[primary status]] there is a junction with the beginning of primary status for the [[A130 road|A130]] with runs along a small section of the western boundary of the district. The A130 connects the district with [[Chelmsford]]. The [[A129 road|A129]] is the major road link between Billericay and Wickford, which are linked via [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|A-Roads]] to the urban area of Basildon, Pitsea and Laindon by the [[A176 road|A176]] and the [[A132 road (England)|A132]], respectively.\n\n==Freedom of the Borough==\nThe following people and military units have received the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Borough]] of Basildon.\n \n{{Expand list|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Individuals===\n* [[Max Whitlock]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}}: February 2016.\n* [[Stuart Bingham]]: February 2016.\n* [[Trudi Westmore-Cox]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}}: September 2019.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Donald Sheppard]]: September 2019.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yellowad.co.uk/basildon-war-hero-and-hospice-founder-awarded-freedom-of-the-borough/|title=Basildon war hero and hospice founder awarded Freedom of the Borough|last=Thomson|first=Charles|date=2019-11-25|website=Yellow Advertiser|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Military Units===\n* The [[Royal Anglian Regiment]]: April 2011.\n\n<ref>https://www.basildon.gov.uk/article/3938/Freedom-of-the-Borough?contactid=3046</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://basildon.gov.uk/ Basildon District Home Page]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003558/http://www.basildonrenaissance.co.uk/ Basildon Renaissance Partnership]\n* [http://www.basildonheritage.org.uk/ Basildon Heritage]\n* [http://basildonhistory.wix.com/essex Basildon Borough History]\n\n{{Essex}}\n{{East_of_England}}\n{{coord|51.5705|0.4545|type:adm3rd_dim:15000_region:GB-ESS|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basildon, Borough of}}\n[[Category:Borough of Basildon| ]]\n[[Category:Non-metropolitan districts of Essex]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See {{Infobox settlement}} for the full list of available fields -->\n<!-- Elements common to United Kingdom -->\n| official_name           = Borough of Basildon\n| settlement_type         = [[Non-metropolitan district]], [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough]]\n| image_skyline           = \n| imagesize               = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| image_shield            =\n| shield_size             = \n| shield_alt              = \n| shield_link             = \n| image_map               = Basildon UK locator map.svg\n| mapsize                 = 150px\n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = Basildon shown within Essex\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Sovereign state]]\n| subdivision_name        = [[United Kingdom]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[Countries of the United Kingdom|Constituent country]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Regions of England|Region]]\n| subdivision_type3       = [[Non-metropolitan county]]\n| subdivision_type4       = Status\n| subdivision_type5       = Admin HQ\n| subdivision_name1       = [[England]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[East of England]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Essex]]\n| subdivision_name4       = [[Non-metropolitan district]], [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|Borough]]\n| subdivision_name5       = [[Basildon]]\n| established_title1      = Incorporated\n| established_date1       = 1 April 1974\n| government_type         = Non-metropolitan district council\n| governing_body          = [[Basildon Borough Council]]\n| leader_party            = {{English district control|GSS=E07000066}}\n| leader_title            = Leadership\n| leader_name             = Committee\n| leader_title1           = [[List of MPs elected in the 2015 United Kingdom general election|MPs]]\n| leader_name1            = [[John Baron (politician)|John Baron]]<br />[[Stephen Metcalfe (politician)|Stephen Metcalfe]]<br />[[Mark Francois]]\n| area_total_km2          = 110.02\n| area_rank               = {{English district area rank|GSS=E07000066}} [[List of English districts by area|(of {{English district total}})]]\n| population_total        = {{English district population|GSS=E07000066}}\n| population_as_of        = {{English statistics year}}\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_rank         = {{English district rank|GSS=E07000066}} [[List of English districts by population|(of {{English district total}})]]\n| population_blank1_title = Ethnicity\n| population_blank1       = 94.5% White<br />2.0% S.

The district was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] on 1 April 1974 from the former area of [[Basildon Urban District]] and the part of [[Thurrock Urban District]] that was within the Basildon New Town. The population of the district as of 2010 is about 172,000. The council made an application for [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] in February 2010 and this was given approval that year, with Cllr Mo Larkin becoming the first mayor in October.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718062153/http://www2.basildon.gov.uk/website2/newsroom.nsf/APR/CCC4336CF850161A8025779F002EFDBE?OpenDocument |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 July 2011 |title=Basildon to get its first Mayor |publisher=Basildon District Council |date=15 September 2010 |accessdate=15 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-11315875 | title=Basildon district becomes borough | publisher=BBC News | date=15 September 2010 | accessdate=26 March 2011 }}</ref> The local authority is [[Basildon Borough Council]].\n\n==Governance==\n{{see also|Basildon local elections}}\nElections to [[Basildon Borough Council]] are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 42 seats on the council being elected at each election.

The towns of [[Billericay]] and [[Wickford]] are two of the areas which both have surrounding villages. Occasional proposals have been made to move Billericay and Wickford to other districts, leaving Basildon more focused on the new town.<ref name=cooksey>LGCE.

December 1995.</ref>\n\nThe other, largest, population centre is commonly referred to as [[Basildon]] and comprises three original settlements: [[Laindon]], Basildon and [[Pitsea]] (from west to east) which have merged with other minor settlements to form the New Town, which is a continuous urban area.\n\nThe remaining land, approximately half of the district is designated as [[green belt]], has several [[site of special scientific interest|sites of special scientific interest]]. Two are around Billericay and the remainder are to the south of Basildon New Town. There are also wildlife areas of varying sizes around most of the district, except in the East.\n\nThe source of the [[River Crouch]] is in the district. The river runs across the district, through [[Wickford]] before it leaves the district.\n\nThe district is linked well by road and rail with significant surrounding destinations, including [[London]].\n\nIn the west of the Basildon district, the [[Dunton Plotlands]] is an area of small plots of land used as weekend cottages or smallholdings inhabited during the mid twentieth century.\n\n=== List of settlements ===\nIt contains the towns of:\n\n* [[Basildon]] (the administrative headquarters)\n** [[Laindon]]\n** [[Langdon Hills]]\n** [[Pitsea]]\n** [[Vange]]\n* [[Billericay]]\n* [[Wickford]]\n\nVillages within the district are:\n* [[Bowers Gifford]]\n* [[Crays Hill]]\n* [[Dunton Wayletts]]\n* [[Great Burstead]]\n* [[Little Burstead]]\n* [[Nevendon]]\n* [[North Benfleet]]\n* [[Ramsden Bellhouse]]\n* [[Shotgate]]\n* [[Great Berry]]\n\n==Regeneration plans==\nBasildon District is a prosperous business location and has in recent years seen significant inward investment and jobs growth. Throughout Basildon District there are major developments planned estimated to total nearly \u00a32 billion. These include:\n\n*The regeneration of Basildon, Wickford, Pitsea, and Laindon Town Centres\n*A new Sporting Village and improvements to playing pitches and sports facilities throughout the District to make Basildon the Centre for Sport in South Essex. The sporting village is expected in 2010, and is being highly sought after as an Olympic training base for one of the top teams, including the Russians. Its combined benefits, of having some of the top facilities so close to London, including one of the few Olympic (50m) size pools in the UK, will make it a true asset to whatever team(s) use it.\n*The creation of a health and education research centre near Basildon and Thurrock University Hospital and FE College\n*Investment in the Basildon Enterprise Corridor, the largest business area in the Thames Gateway outside London, home to 45,000 jobs and over 5,000 businesses, including Ford, Selex, Visteon, Case New Holland, [[First Data]] Europe, International Financial Services Limited, RBS, and Starbucks\n*The creation of one of the largest wetland nature reserves in Europe in the Thames Marshes by the RSPB, Land Restoration Trust, Basildon District Council and Veolia\n*A strategic review of the District's housing, with investment in housing estates such as Craylands, Five Links and Felmores to create first class places to live\n\nCoordinating and promoting this programme of investment is the Basildon Renaissance Partnership which was set up in 2003 by Basildon District Council. Its partners also include the East Of England Development Agency, English Partnerships, Essex County Council, and the Thames Gateway South Essex Partnership with support from the Department for Communities and Local Government.\n\nThe BBC noted the council had decided to sell for \u00a31 a plot of land it bought next to the golf course for \u00a31m in order to build a 4 star hotel.  The Conservative leader described the sale as an exciting step forward.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-47172198|title=Basildon Council to sell land it bought for \u00a31m for \u00a31|work=BBC news|date=8 February 2019|accessdate=12 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nThe district is connected to [[London]] and [[Southend-on-sea|Southend]] via two train operators: [[c2c]] and [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]. The route operated by c2c is the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]]. Three principal stations of the railway line are in the district: [[Basildon railway station]], [[Laindon railway station]] and [[Pitsea railway station]]\n\nThe former [[First Great Eastern|Great Eastern]] service (now [[Abellio Greater Anglia]]) operates on the [[Shenfield to Southend Line]]. Trains stop at [[Billericay railway station|Billericay]] and [[Wickford railway station]]. At Wickford, the [[Crouch Valley Line]] diverges from the Shenfield to Southend line.\n\nThree [[Primary status|primary route]]s are within the district. The [[A127 road|A127]] goes through its centre, the [[A13 road (Great Britain)|A13]] goes through the south-east at Pitsea. Both these primary routes connect the district with [[Greater London]] and Southend-on-Sea. At Bowers Gifford at a terminus of the A13's [[primary status]] there is a junction with the beginning of primary status for the [[A130 road|A130]] with runs along a small section of the western boundary of the district.

Only one example was flown.\n\n==Design and development==\n\nW. L. \"Bill\" Manuel, who had designed and built a glider as early as 1929 and was later responsible for the [[Manuel Wren|Willow Wren]], designed the Hawk during his retirement.  It was a single-seat aircraft intended for soaring in weak [[thermal]]s.<ref name=JAWA73/> He built the Hawk himself during 1968 and 1969<ref name=Ell/> before taking it to the [[College of Aeronautics]] at [[Cranfield]] for structural analysis.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\nThe Hawk was an all-wood, [[cantilever]] [[shoulder wing]] [[monoplane]].  The centre section of the three-piece wing was of constant [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] and fitted with parallel-ruler type, upper surface [[air brake (aircraft)|airbrakes]] positioned at 28.26% of the half-span and at 42% chord. The outer panels were tapered with rounded tips and carried the [[ailerons]].  The wing had an angle of incidence of 3\u00b0 and the outer panels had 3\u00b0 of [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]]. Structurally, the wings had a [[spruce]] main spar at 33% chord with a [[plywood]]-covered torsion box ahead of it and [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covering]] aft.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\nThe [[fuselage]] was a [[semi-monocoque]] spruce structure with plywood covering.  The fin was also plywood-covered, carrying a fabric-covered [[rudder]] which reached from the underside of the [[T-tail]] to the bottom of the fuselage.  The fixed-incidence [[tailplane]] was likewise plywood-covered and the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] fabric-covered.  The latter carried a [[Flettner]]-type [[trim tab]] on its starboard edge. The Hawk's single seat was forward of the wing and under a hinged, framed [[Aircraft canopy|canopy]].  It landed on a single fixed wheel assisted by a tailskid.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\nThe first flight was on 25 November 1972, piloted by Howard Torode of the Cranfield Institute.  Tests showed a lack of rudder power, quickly cured by an increase in area, but no other concerns.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\n==Operational history==\nOnly one Hawk was built.  It was certified as ''BGA 1778'' by February 1973.<ref name=ABDig/>  In July that year it was at the [[Sywell]] PFA weekend, where it gained third place in a competition amongst homebuilt aircraft.<ref name=Flight/> Since 2013 it has been preserved by the Gliding Heritage Centre at Lasham.<ref>[http://www.glidingheritage.org.uk/collection.htm The Gliding Heritage Centre - Collection]</ref>\n<!-- ==Variants== -->\n<!-- ==Units using this aircraft/Operators (choose)== -->\n\n==Specifications==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1973/74<ref name=JAWA73/>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|genhide=\n\n|crew=1\n|length m=6.25\n|length note=\n|span ft=42\n|span in=0\n|span note=\n|height m=1.41\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=149\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=12\n|airfoil=Wortmann FX6-184 inboard, FX-61-210 tip\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=407\n|empty weight note=equipped\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=640\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|perfhide=\n\n|max speed kmh=146\n|max speed note= in smooth air.

Only one example was flown.\n\n==Design and development==\n\nW.L. \"Bill\" Manuel, who had designed and built a glider as early as 1929 and was later responsible for the [[Manuel Wren|Willow Wren]], designed the Hawk during his retirement.  It was a single-seat aircraft intended for soaring in weak [[thermal]]s.<ref name=JAWA73/> He built the Hawk himself during 1968 and 1969<ref name=Ell/> before taking it to the [[College of Aeronautics]] at [[Cranfield]] for structural analysis.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\nThe Hawk was an all-wood, [[cantilever]] [[shoulder wing]] [[monoplane]].  The centre section of the three-piece wing was of constant [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] and fitted with parallel-ruler type, upper surface [[air brake (aircraft)|airbrakes]] positioned at 28.26% of the half-span and at 42% chord. The outer panels were tapered with rounded tips and carried the [[ailerons]].  The wing had an angle of incidence of 3\u00b0 and the outer panels had 3\u00b0 of [[dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]]. Structurally, the wings had a [[spruce]] main spar at 33% chord with a [[plywood]]-covered torsion box ahead of it and [[aircraft fabric covering|fabric covering]] aft.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\nThe [[fuselage]] was a [[semi-monocoque]] spruce structure with plywood covering.  The fin was also plywood-covered, carrying a fabric-covered [[rudder]] which reached from the underside of the [[T-tail]] to the bottom of the fuselage.  The fixed-incidence [[tailplane]] was likewise plywood-covered and the [[elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] fabric-covered.  The latter carried a [[Flettner]]-type [[trim tab]] on its starboard edge. The Hawk's single seat was forward of the wing and under a hinged, framed [[Aircraft canopy|canopy]].  It landed on a single fixed wheel assisted by a tailskid.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\nThe first flight was on 25 November 1972, piloted by Howard Torode of the Cranfield Institute.  Tests showed a lack of rudder power, quickly cured by an increase in area, but no other concerns.<ref name=JAWA73/>\n\n==Operational history==\nOnly one Hawk was built.  It was certified as ''BGA 1778'' by February 1973.<ref name=ABDig/>  In July that year it was at the [[Sywell]] PFA weekend, where it gained third place in a competition amongst homebuilt aircraft.<ref name=Flight/> Since 2013 it has been preserved by the Gliding Heritage Centre at Lasham.<ref>[http://www.glidingheritage.org.uk/collection.htm The Gliding Heritage Centre - Collection]</ref>\n<!-- ==Variants== -->\n<!-- ==Units using this aircraft/Operators (choose)== -->\n\n==Specifications==\n{{Aircraft specs\n|ref=Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1973/74<ref name=JAWA73/>\n|prime units?=imp\n<!--\n        General characteristics\n-->\n|genhide=\n\n|crew=1\n|length m=6.25\n|length note=\n|span ft=42\n|span in=0\n|span note=\n|height m=1.41\n|height note=\n|wing area sqft=149\n|wing area note=\n|aspect ratio=12\n|airfoil=Wortmann FX6-184 inboard, FX-61-210 tip\n|empty weight kg=\n|empty weight lb=407\n|empty weight note=equipped\n|gross weight kg=\n|gross weight lb=\n|gross weight note=\n|max takeoff weight kg=\n|max takeoff weight lb=640\n|max takeoff weight note=\n|more general=\n<!--\n        Performance\n-->\n|perfhide=\n\n|max speed kmh=146\n|max speed note= in smooth air.

People may choose fields, bushes, forests, ditches, streets, canals or other open space for defecation. They do so because either they do not have a toilet readily accessible or due to traditional cultural practices.<ref name=\"ClasenBoisson2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clasen T, Boisson S, Routray P, Torondel B, Bell M, Cumming O, Ensink J, Freeman M, Jenkins M, Odagiri M, Ray S, Sinha A, Suar M, Schmidt WP | display-authors = 6 | title = Effectiveness of a rural sanitation programme on diarrhoea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, and child malnutrition in Odisha, India: a cluster-randomised trial | journal = The Lancet.

Even if toilets are available, [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] efforts may still be needed to promote the use of toilets.\n\n'''Open defecation free''' (ODF) is used to describe communities that have shifted to using a toilet instead of open defecation. This can happen for example after [[community-led total sanitation]] programs have been implemented.\n\nThe current estimate is that around 673 million people practice open defecation, with over 75% (520 million) of this being from India.<ref name=\"JMP2019\">WHO and UNICEF (2019) [https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/jmp-report-2019/en/ Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000\u20132017: Special focus on inequalities], Geneva, Switzerland</ref>{{rp|74}} This is down from about 892 million people, or 12 percent of the global population, who practiced open defecation in 2016.<ref name=\"JMP2017\" /> In that year, seventy-six percent (678 million) of the 892 million people practicing open defecation in the world live in just seven countries.<ref name=\"JMP2017\" />\n\nOpen defecation can pollute the environment and cause health problems.

In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land. It was believed that defecating in the open causes little harm when done in areas with low population, forests, or camping type situations. With development and urbanization, open defecating started becoming a challenge and thereby an important [[public health]] issue, and an issue of human [[dignity]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=O'Reilly |first=Kathleen | name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-01-01|title=From toilet insecurity to toilet security: creating safe sanitation for women and girls|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Water|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=19\u201324|doi=10.1002/wat2.1122|issn=2049-1948}}</ref> With the increase in population in smaller areas, such as cities and towns, more attention was given to hygiene and health.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied.

In ancient times, there were more open spaces and less population pressure on land.

This was due to the publications by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (JMP) and the UN [[International Year of Sanitation]]. The JMP is a joint program by [[World Health Organization|WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] to monitor the water and sanitation targets of the [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]].\n\nFor monitoring purposes, two categories were created: 1) [[improved sanitation]] and (2) [[unimproved sanitation]]. Open defecation falls into the category of unimproved sanitation. This means that people who practice open defecation do not have access to improved sanitation.\n\nIn 2013 [[World Toilet Day]] was celebrated as an official UN day for the first time. The term \"open defecation\" was used in high-level speeches, that helped to draw global attention to this issue (for example, in the \"call to action\" on sanitation issued by the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations in March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/pdf/DSG%20sanitation%20two-pager%20FINAL.pdf|title=United Nations Deputy Secretary-General's Call to Action on Sanitation|date=2013|website=United Nations|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Open defecation free ===\n\n\"Open defecation free\" (ODF) is a phrase first used in [[community-led total sanitation]] (CLTS) programs. ODF has now entered use in other contexts. The original meaning of ODF stated that all community members are using sanitation facilities (such as toilets) instead of going to the open for defecation. This definition was improved and more criteria were added in some countries that have adopted the CLTS approach in their programs to stop the practice of open defecation.<ref name=\"Cavill\">{{cite book |url= http://www.communityledtotalsanitation.org/resource/frontiers-clts-issue-4-sustainability-and-clts-taking-stock |title=Sustainability and CLTS: Taking Stock Frontiers of CLTS: Innovations and Insights Issue 4 |last1=Cavill |last2=Chambers |last3=Vernon | name-list-format = vanc |date=2015 |publisher=IDS |isbn=978-1-78118-222-2 |page=18 }}</ref>\n\nThe Indian [[Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation]] has in mid-2015 defined ODF as \"the termination of [[fecal-oral transmission]], defined by:\n\n# No visible feces found in the environment or village and\n# Every household as well as public/community institutions using safe technology option for disposal of feces\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdws.gov.in/sites/default/files/R_274_1441280478318.pdf|title=Guidelines for ODF Verification|date=2015|publisher=Indian Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation}}</ref>\n\nHere, 'safe technology option' means toilets that contain feces so that there is no contamination of surface soil, groundwater or surface water; flies or animals do not come in contact with the open feces; no one handles excreta; there is no smell and there are no visible feces around in the environment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://forum.susana.org/71-behaviour-change-and-user-psychology-issues/13746-definition-of-odf-open-defecation-free-indian-government-publication|title=Definition of ODF \u2013 Open Defecation Free (Indian government publication)|date=2015-06-18|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en-gb}}</ref> This definition is part of the [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] (Clean India Campaign).\n\n== Reasons ==\n\nThe reasons for open defecation are varied.

The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London, England, to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid. In 2002, Booth was named among the [[100 Greatest Britons]] in a BBC poll.\n\n==Conversion and early ministry==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nWilliam Booth was born in [[Sneinton]], [[Nottingham, England|Nottingham]], the second son of five children born to [[Samuel Booth]] and his second wife, [[Mary Moss]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=13}}</ref> Booth's father was relatively wealthy by the standards of the time, but during William's childhood, the family descended into poverty. In 1842, Samuel Booth, who could no longer afford his son's school fees, apprenticed the 13-year-old William Booth to a pawnbroker. Samuel Booth died on 23 September 1842.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=17}}</ref>\n\nTwo years into his apprenticeship Booth was [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Methodism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=19}}</ref> He then read extensively and trained himself in writing and in speech, becoming a Methodist local [[preacher]]. Booth was encouraged to be an [[Evangelism|evangelist]] primarily through his best friend, Will Sansom. Sansom and Booth both began in the 1840s to preach to the poor and the [[sin]]ners of Nottingham, and Booth would probably have remained as Sansom's partner in his new Mission ministry, as Sansom titled it, if Sansom had not died of [[tuberculosis]], in 1849.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|pp=23\u201325}}</ref>\n\nWhen his apprenticeship ended in 1848, Booth was unemployed and spent a year looking in vain for work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=30}}</ref> In 1849, Booth reluctantly left his family and moved to London, where he again found work with a pawnbroker. Booth tried to continue lay preaching in London, but the small amount of preaching work that came his way frustrated him, and so he resigned as a lay preacher and took to open-air [[evangelism|evangelising]] in the streets and on [[Kennington Park|Kennington Common]].\n\n[[File:william-booth-c1862.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Booth in about 1862]]\nIn 1851, Booth joined the Reformers ([[Methodist Reform Church]]), and on 10 April 1852, his 23rd birthday, he left pawnbroking and became a full-time preacher at their headquarters at Binfield Chapel in [[Clapham]]. William styled his preaching after the [[Christian revival|revival]]ist American [[James Caughey]], who had made frequent visits to England and preached at the church in Nottingham where Booth was a member, Broad Street Chapel. Just over a month after he started full-time preaching, on 15 May 1852, William Booth became formally engaged to [[Catherine Booth|Catherine Mumford]].\n\nInterested in the Congregationalist approach, Booth consulted [[David Thomas (born 1813)|David Thomas]] at [[Stockwell]] about the ministry. Through Thomas, he met [[John Campbell (minister)|John Campbell]] and then [[James William Massie]]. The recommendation was training under Rev. John Frost; but Booth disliked Frost's school, and left shortly.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herbert Hewitt Stroup|title=Social Welfare Pioneers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYyUTxgj_6EC&pg=PA98|year=1986|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=978-0-88229-212-0|pages=98\u201399}}</ref> In November 1853, he was invited to become the Reformers' minister at [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], in [[Lincolnshire]]. He married Catherine Mumford on 16 July 1855 at Stockwell Green Congregational Church in London.\n\nThough Booth became a prominent Methodist [[evangelism|evangelist]], he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the [[Liverpool]] conference in 1861, after having spent three years at [[Gateshead]], his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the [[Methodist New Connexion]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Will A Man Give In Exchange For His Soul|last=Johnson|first=George D.|publisher=Xlibris|year=2011|isbn=1465380973|location=|pages=88}}</ref>\n\nSoon he was barred from campaigning in Methodist congregations, so he became an independent evangelist. His [[doctrine]] remained much the same, though; he preached that [[Hell|eternal punishment]] was the fate of those who do not believe the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the necessity of [[repentance]] from [[sin]], and the promise of [[Sacred|holiness]]. He taught that this belief would manifest itself in a life of love for God and mankind.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The ''Ethical'' characteristic of William Booth's business ventures was evident in the manufacture of boxes of Salvation Army matches<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Salvationists|last=Coutts|first=John|publisher=A R Mowbray & Co Ltd|year=1977|isbn=0-264-66071-4|location=Oxford|page=85}}</ref> which bore the slogan \"Lights in darkest England, Security from fire, Fair wages for fair work\". His match factory on Old Ford paid 4 pence a gross, while the larger firms only paid 2 1/2 pence.\n\n==The Christian Mission==\n[[File:christian-mission-volunteer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Manifesto of The Christian Mission as a \"Volunteer Army\" (1878)]]\n\nThe tent was set up on an old [[Quaker]] burial ground on Mile End Waste in [[Whitechapel]], with an initial goal to deliver the [[Good News (Christianity)|good news]] to all. <ref name=IHC>[http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/Who-We-Are/History-and-heritage/Salvation-Army-generals/William-Booth/ William Booth \u2013 Founder Of The Salvation Army], 'The Salvation Army Australia, Southern Territory - History and Heritage' section website</ref>\n\nBy 1865, Booth and his wife [[Catherine Mumford|Catherine]] had opened 'The Christian Revival Society' in the [[East End of London]], which held regular evening meetings to share the repentance that Booth believed Christian [[salvation]] could bring both the poor and marginalised.

William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary [[George Scott Railton]] and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" [[Bramwell Booth]] heard his father and said, \"Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\".<ref>[http://www.gospeltruth.net/booth/boothbioshort.htm William Bramwell Booth 1829\u20131912 His Life and Ministry] \u2013 A Very Short Biography</ref>(The printer's proof copy of the Missions' report for 1878 declared \"The Christian Mission Is A Volunteer Army\", but the corrected proof read \"The Christian Mission Is ... A Salvation Army\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Salvationists|last=Coutts|first=John|publisher=A R Mowbray & Co Ltd|year=1977|isbn=0-264-66071-4|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=23}}</ref>)  The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in \"God's Army\" would wear the army's own [[Uniform of The Salvation Army|uniform]], 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the \"[[General of The Salvation Army|General]]\" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as \"[[Officer in The Salvation Army|officers]]\". Other members became \"[[Soldier in The Salvation Army|soldiers]]\".\n\nThough the early years were lean ones, with the need of money to help the needy an ever growing issue, Booth and The Salvation Army persevered. In the early 1880s, operations were extended to other countries, notably the United States, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]] and others, including to most of the countries of the [[British Empire]]: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Cape Colony]], [[New Zealand]], [[Jamaica]], etc.\n\nOften the beginnings in other countries occurred through \"salvationist\" activities by non-officers who had emigrated. With some initial success they would contact London to 'send officers.'\n\nIn other cases, like in [[Argentina]], a non-salvationist told Booth that there were thousands of British people there who needed salvation. The four officers sent in 1890 found that those British were scattered all over the [[pampas]]. But the missionaries started ministry in the Spanish language and the work spread throughout the country \u2013 initially following the rail-road development, since the British in charge of building the rail-roads were usually sympathetic to the movement.\n\nDuring his lifetime, William Booth established Army work in 58 countries and colonies, travelling extensively and holding, \"salvation meetings.\"\n\nBooth regularly published a magazine and was the author of a number of books; he also composed several songs. His book [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/475 In Darkest England and the Way Out] not only became a [[best-seller]] after its 1890 release, it set the foundation for the army's modern social welfare approach. It compared what was considered \"civilised\" England with \"Darkest Africa\" \u2013 a land then considered poor and backward. What Booth suggested was that much of London and greater England after the [[Industrial Revolution]] was not better off in the quality of life than those in the underdeveloped world.\n\nHe proposed a strategy to apply the Christian Gospel and work ethic to the problems. The book speaks of abolishing [[vice]] and poverty by establishing homes for the [[homelessness|homeless]], farm [[community|communities]] such as [[Hadleigh, Essex#Salvation Army Farm Colony|Hadleigh Farm]] where the urban poor can be trained in agriculture, training centres for prospective [[emigrant]]s, homes for fallen women and released prisoners, aid for the poor, and help for drunkards. He also lays down schemes for poor men's lawyers, banks, clinics, industrial schools and even a seaside resort. He says that if the state fails to meet its social obligations it will be the task of each Christian to step into the breach.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} However, Booth was not departing from his spiritual convictions to set up a socialist or communist society or sub-class, supported by people forced to finance his plans; Booth's ultimate aim was to get people \"saved.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nBooth asserts in his introduction,\n\n{{quote|I have no intention to depart in the smallest degree from the main principles on which I have acted in the past.  My only hope for the permanent deliverance of mankind from misery, either in this world or the next, is the regeneration or remaking of the individual by the power of the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ.  But in providing for the relief of temporal misery I reckon that I am only making it easy where it is now difficult, and possible where it is now all but impossible, for men and women to find their way to the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.}}\n\nIt was asserted in some circles that ''In Darkest England'' was actually written by the crusading journalist, [[William Thomas Stead|W.&nbsp;T. Stead]], who, in his own words, acted as a \"literary hack\" for the General when Mrs. Booth lay dying. However, this assumption was swiftly dismissed by Stead some years later, declaring that, \"The idea of Darkest England ... was the General's own. My part, of which I had no wish to speak ... was strictly subordinate throughout.\"<ref>Quoted in Robert Sandall, ''The History of the Salvation Army'', vol. 3, 1883\u20131953, Social Reform and Welfare Work (1955), Appendix B, pp. 324\u201332</ref>\n\n''In Darkest England and the Way Out'' was reprinted several times and lately in 2006.\n\nThere are also other works that have focused on the impact and significance of ''In Darkest England''. For example, marking the 125th anniversary of the publication of ''In Darkest England'', the book ''Darkness and Deliverance: 125 Years of the Darkest England Scheme'' contains fifteen chapters from leading and emerging authors that explore various historical aspects and future implications of the ''Darkest England'' scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chaordiccreative.com/darkness-and-deliverance|title=Darkness and Deliverance: 125 years of the Darkest England scheme|last=Seaman (ed.)|first=Matthew|date=2016|website=|publisher=Salvo Publishing / Chaordic Creative|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\n[[File:booth-money.jpg|thumb|right|''The Entr'acte'' cartoon of 1882 captioned, \"Now, Mr Booth, let us know what you are going to do with all this money!\"]]\nDuring its early years The Salvation Army faced a great deal of opposition, especially from those in the alcohol-selling industry who were concerned that the activities of Booth and his followers would persuade the poorer classes to stop drinking. One group opposed to Booth and The Salvation Army was the [[Skeleton Army]], a diffuse group, particularly in [[Southern England]], that opposed and disrupted [[The Salvation Army]]'s marches against alcohol from the early 1880s until about 1892. Clashes between the two groups lead to the deaths of several [[The Salvation Army|Salvationists]] and injuries to many others. During 1882 alone 662 Salvation Army [[Soldier in The Salvation Army|soldiers]] were assaulted: 251 of them were women and 23 of them were under fifteen years of age.<ref>[http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/726/thesis.pdf? ''Officership in the Salvation Army: A Case Study in Clericalisation''] Doctoral thesis by Harold Ivor Winston Hill \u2013 Victoria University of Wellington (2004)</ref>\n\nOther accusations centred around the fact that Booth appointed his own children to posts for which others were better qualified, leading to claims that The Salvation Army was a Booth family-business. For example, he appointed his daughter [[Emma Booth (The Salvation Army)|Emma Booth]] as the Principal of the Officers' Training Home, The Salvation Army's first training school for women when she was just 19. While William Booth had once said to his children that \"The Salvation Army does not belong to you, or to me, it belongs to the world\" and was very wary of the leadership of the army becoming a dynasty,<ref name=\"Larsson\">{{Cite book |last=Larrson |first=John |year=2009 |title=1929: A Crisis that Shaped The Salvation Army's Future |place=London |publisher=Salvation Books |isbn=978-0-85412-794-8 }}</ref> others believed that Booth was creating a dynasty, as was suggested by the fact that he insisted that his sons-in-law added 'Booth' to their own names (see [[Frederick Booth-Tucker]] and [[Arthur Booth-Clibborn]]).<ref>Hodges, Samuel Horatio ''General Booth: \"the Family\", and the Salvation Army: Showing its Rise, Progress, and ... Decline'' (1890)</ref> This was further borne out when Booth appointed his son, [[Bramwell Booth]], as his successor as [[Generals of The Salvation Army|General]] in his will.\n\nThe press was often hostile to Booth and The Salvation Army as well because their methods and message were widely misinterpreted. The army's motto \"Blood & Fire\", which had deep [[theology|theological]] meaning representing the saving \"blood of Jesus\" and the sanctifying \"fire of the [[Holy Spirit]]\", was erroneously thought to mean the blood of sinners and the fire of hell. There was also suspicion about the army's motives, with Booth often portrayed as a charlatan only out to make money.<ref>[http://www.ourchurch.com/view/?pageID=12278 The Booths: The Salvation Army (1878\u20131890)] ourchurch.com</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of England]] was at first also extremely hostile to the activities of Booth and The Salvation Army. The philanthropist, politician, and evangelist [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] even went so far as to describe Booth as the \"[[Anti-Christ]]\". One of the main complaints against Booth was his \"elevation of women to man's status\". Many found him dictatorial and hard to work with. Some of his own children denounced him as their leader and turned their backs on The Salvation Army, including his daughter [[Kate Booth]] and his sons [[Herbert Booth|Herbert]] and [[Ballington Booth]], the latter founding a separate organisation, the [[Volunteers of America]] with himself as \"General\". The evangelist [[Rodney \"Gipsy\" Smith]] left him because of his rigidity and [[Dwight L. Moody|D.&nbsp;L. Moody]] would not support him because he felt there was a threat to the local church. But no one could deny his compassion for the sufferings of his fellow man.<ref>[http://www.gospeltruth.net/booth/boothbioshort.htm William Booth: His Life and Ministry], the Gospel Truth website</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:booth-booth-1904.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Booth and his granddaughter [[Catherine Bramwell-Booth]] during the 1904 motorcade]]\n\nOpinion of [[The Salvation Army]] and William Booth eventually changed to that of favour. In his later years, he was received in audience by kings, emperors and presidents, who were among his ardent admirers. Even the mass media began to use his title of 'General' with reverence.\n\nIn 1899, Booth suffered from blindness in both eyes, but with a short rest, was able to recover his sight. In 1904 he took part in a \"motorcade\" when he was driven around Great Britain, stopping off in cities, towns and villages to preach to the assembled crowds from his open-top car. In 1906 Booth was made a Freeman of the [[City of London]], and was granted an honorary degree from the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1902 he was invited to attend the coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]].\n\nHis last visit to \nNorth America was made in 1907, and in 1909 he embarked on a six-month motor tour of the United Kingdom. During this tour he discovered he was blind in his right eye and the sight in his left eye was dimmed by [[glaucoma|cataracts]]. The rest of the tour had to be cancelled. On 21 August 1909 a surgeon at [[Guy's Hospital]] removed his right eye. Despite this setback, in 1910 Booth campaigned in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], Switzerland and [[Italy]]. On his return to England he embarked on his seventh and last motor tour.\n\nWilliam Booth was 83 years old when he died (or, in Salvationist parlance, was [[Promoted to Glory]]) at his home in [[Hadley Wood]], London. At the three-day lying in state at Clapton Congress Hall 150,000 people filed past his casket. On 27 August 1912 Booth's funeral service was held at London's [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] where 40,000 people attended, including [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], who sat almost unrecognised far to the rear of the great hall.\n\nThe following day Booth's funeral procession set out from International Headquarters. As it moved off 10,000 uniformed [[The Salvation Army|Salvationists]] fell in behind. Forty Salvation Army bands played the \"Dead March\" from [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'' as the vast procession set off. He was buried with his wife [[Catherine Mumford|Catherine Booth]] in the main London burial ground for 19th century non-conformist ministers and tutors, the non-denominational [[Abney Park Cemetery]] in [[Stoke Newington]].<ref>{{YouTube|utDd1awwPaE|William Booth's funeral}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Booth at his birthplace - geograph.org.uk - 1275114.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of William Booth outside his birthplace in [[Sneinton]]]]\nIn Booth's honour, [[Vachel Lindsay]] wrote the poem, \"General William Booth Enters Into Heaven\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/271/48.html|title=General William Booth Enters into Heaven by Vachel Lindsay.

The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London, England, to many parts of the world and is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid. In 2002, Booth was named among the [[100 Greatest Britons]] in a BBC poll.\n\n==Conversion and early ministry==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2017}}\nWilliam Booth was born in [[Sneinton]], [[Nottingham, England|Nottingham]], the second son of five children born to [[Samuel Booth]] and his second wife, [[Mary Moss]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=13}}</ref> Booth's father was relatively wealthy by the standards of the time, but during William's childhood, the family descended into poverty. In 1842, Samuel Booth, who could no longer afford his son's school fees, apprenticed the 13-year-old William Booth to a pawnbroker. Samuel Booth died on 23 September 1842.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=17}}</ref>\n\nTwo years into his apprenticeship Booth was [[Religious conversion|converted]] to [[Methodism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=19}}</ref> He then read extensively and trained himself in writing and in speech, becoming a Methodist local [[preacher]]. Booth was encouraged to be an [[Evangelism|evangelist]] primarily through his best friend, Will Sansom. Sansom and Booth both began in the 1840s to preach to the poor and the [[sin]]ners of Nottingham, and Booth would probably have remained as Sansom's partner in his new Mission ministry, as Sansom titled it, if Sansom had not died of [[tuberculosis]], in 1849.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|pp=23\u201325}}</ref>\n\nWhen his apprenticeship ended in 1848, Booth was unemployed and spent a year looking in vain for work.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=30}}</ref> In 1849, Booth reluctantly left his family and moved to London, where he again found work with a pawnbroker. Booth tried to continue lay preaching in London, but the small amount of preaching work that came his way frustrated him, and so he resigned as a lay preacher and took to open-air [[evangelism|evangelising]] in the streets and on [[Kennington Park|Kennington Common]].\n\n[[File:william-booth-c1862.jpg|thumb|left|upright|William Booth in about 1862]]\nIn 1851, Booth joined the Reformers ([[Methodist Reform Church]]), and on 10 April 1852, his 23rd birthday, he left pawnbroking and became a full-time preacher at their headquarters at Binfield Chapel in [[Clapham]]. William styled his preaching after the [[Christian revival|revival]]ist American [[James Caughey]], who had made frequent visits to England and preached at the church in Nottingham where Booth was a member, Broad Street Chapel. Just over a month after he started full-time preaching, on 15 May 1852, William Booth became formally engaged to [[Catherine Booth|Catherine Mumford]].\n\nInterested in the Congregationalist approach, Booth consulted [[David Thomas (born 1813)|David Thomas]] at [[Stockwell]] about the ministry. Through Thomas, he met [[John Campbell (minister)|John Campbell]] and then [[James William Massie]]. The recommendation was training under Rev. John Frost; but Booth disliked Frost's school, and left shortly.<ref>{{cite book|author=Herbert Hewitt Stroup|title=Social Welfare Pioneers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYyUTxgj_6EC&pg=PA98|year=1986|publisher=Taylor Trade Publications|isbn=978-0-88229-212-0|pages=98\u201399}}</ref> In November 1853, he was invited to become the Reformers' minister at [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], in [[Lincolnshire]]. He married Catherine Mumford on 16 July 1855 at Stockwell Green Congregational Church in London.\n\nThough Booth became a prominent Methodist [[evangelism|evangelist]], he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the [[Liverpool]] conference in 1861, after having spent three years at [[Gateshead]], his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the [[Methodist New Connexion]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Will A Man Give In Exchange For His Soul|last=Johnson|first=George D.|publisher=Xlibris|year=2011|isbn=1465380973|location=|pages=88}}</ref>\n\nSoon he was barred from campaigning in Methodist congregations, so he became an independent evangelist. His [[doctrine]] remained much the same, though; he preached that [[Hell|eternal punishment]] was the fate of those who do not believe the [[Gospel]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the necessity of [[repentance]] from [[sin]], and the promise of [[Sacred|holiness]]. He taught that this belief would manifest itself in a life of love for God and mankind.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The ''Ethical'' characteristic of William Booth's business ventures was evident in the manufacture of boxes of Salvation Army matches<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Salvationists|last=Coutts|first=John|publisher=A R Mowbray & Co Ltd|year=1977|isbn=0-264-66071-4|location=Oxford|page=85}}</ref> which bore the slogan \"Lights in darkest England, Security from fire, Fair wages for fair work\". His match factory on Old Ford paid 4 pence a gross, while the larger firms only paid 2 1/2 pence.\n\n==The Christian Mission==\n[[File:christian-mission-volunteer.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Manifesto of The Christian Mission as a \"Volunteer Army\" (1878)]]\n\nThe tent was set up on an old [[Quaker]] burial ground on Mile End Waste in [[Whitechapel]], with an initial goal to deliver the [[Good News (Christianity)|good news]] to all. <ref name=IHC>[http://www.salvationarmy.org.au/en/Who-We-Are/History-and-heritage/Salvation-Army-generals/William-Booth/ William Booth \u2013 Founder Of The Salvation Army], 'The Salvation Army Australia, Southern Territory - History and Heritage' section website</ref>\n\nBy 1865, Booth and his wife [[Catherine Mumford|Catherine]] had opened 'The Christian Revival Society' in the [[East End of London]], which held regular evening meetings to share the repentance that Booth believed Christian [[salvation]] could bring both the poor and marginalised. The Christian Revival Society was later renamed [[The Christian Mission]], subsequently to become the ''East London Christian Mission''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Salvationists|last=Coutts|first=John|publisher=A R Mowbray & Co Ltd|year=1977|isbn=0-264-66071-4|location=Oxford, Great Britain|pages=21}}</ref>\nThe Christian Mission's slow growth was hard work for Booth; His wife writes that he would \"stumble home night after night haggard with fatigue, often his clothes were torn and bloody bandages swathed his head where a stone had struck[.]\" {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nEvening meetings were held in an old warehouse where [[Street children|urchin]]s threw stones and fireworks through the window.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Outposts were established throughout the city, attracting converts, but the Christian Mission remained just one of the five hundred charitable groups working in London's East End.<ref name=IHC/>\n\nBooth practiced various types of [[charity]] himself, such as opening \"Food for the Million\" ([[soup kitchen]]s). {{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==The Salvation Army==\n[[File:christian-mission-army.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Christian Mission becomes The Salvation Army (May 1878)]]\n[[File:William Booth, In Darkest England and the Way Out, 1890, Cornell CUL PJM 1104 01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Salvation Army Social Campaign, 1890, by William Booth.]]\n\nHaving been founded as the ''East London Christian Mission'' in 1865, the name ''[[The Salvation Army]]'' developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary [[George Scott Railton]] and said, \"We are a volunteer army.\" [[Bramwell Booth]] heard his father and said, \"Volunteer, I'm no volunteer, I'm a regular!\" Railton was instructed to cross out the word \"volunteer\" and substitute the word \"salvation\".<ref>[http://www.gospeltruth.net/booth/boothbioshort.htm William Bramwell Booth 1829\u20131912 His Life and Ministry] \u2013 A Very Short Biography</ref>(The printer's proof copy of the Missions' report for 1878 declared \"The Christian Mission Is A Volunteer Army\", but the corrected proof read \"The Christian Mission Is ... A Salvation Army\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Salvationists|last=Coutts|first=John|publisher=A R Mowbray & Co Ltd|year=1977|isbn=0-264-66071-4|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=23}}</ref>)  The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in \"God's Army\" would wear the army's own [[Uniform of The Salvation Army|uniform]], 'putting on the armour,' for meetings and ministry work. He became the \"[[General of The Salvation Army|General]]\" and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as \"[[Officer in The Salvation Army|officers]]\". Other members became \"[[Soldier in The Salvation Army|soldiers]]\".\n\nThough the early years were lean ones, with the need of money to help the needy an ever growing issue, Booth and The Salvation Army persevered. In the early 1880s, operations were extended to other countries, notably the United States, [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]] and others, including to most of the countries of the [[British Empire]]: [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[India]], [[Cape Colony]], [[New Zealand]], [[Jamaica]], etc.\n\nOften the beginnings in other countries occurred through \"salvationist\" activities by non-officers who had emigrated. With some initial success they would contact London to 'send officers.'\n\nIn other cases, like in [[Argentina]], a non-salvationist told Booth that there were thousands of British people there who needed salvation. The four officers sent in 1890 found that those British were scattered all over the [[pampas]]. But the missionaries started ministry in the Spanish language and the work spread throughout the country \u2013 initially following the rail-road development, since the British in charge of building the rail-roads were usually sympathetic to the movement.\n\nDuring his lifetime, William Booth established Army work in 58 countries and colonies, travelling extensively and holding, \"salvation meetings.\"\n\nBooth regularly published a magazine and was the author of a number of books; he also composed several songs. His book [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/475 In Darkest England and the Way Out] not only became a [[best-seller]] after its 1890 release, it set the foundation for the army's modern social welfare approach. It compared what was considered \"civilised\" England with \"Darkest Africa\" \u2013 a land then considered poor and backward. What Booth suggested was that much of London and greater England after the [[Industrial Revolution]] was not better off in the quality of life than those in the underdeveloped world.\n\nHe proposed a strategy to apply the Christian Gospel and work ethic to the problems. The book speaks of abolishing [[vice]] and poverty by establishing homes for the [[homelessness|homeless]], farm [[community|communities]] such as [[Hadleigh, Essex#Salvation Army Farm Colony|Hadleigh Farm]] where the urban poor can be trained in agriculture, training centres for prospective [[emigrant]]s, homes for fallen women and released prisoners, aid for the poor, and help for drunkards. He also lays down schemes for poor men's lawyers, banks, clinics, industrial schools and even a seaside resort. He says that if the state fails to meet its social obligations it will be the task of each Christian to step into the breach.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} However, Booth was not departing from his spiritual convictions to set up a socialist or communist society or sub-class, supported by people forced to finance his plans; Booth's ultimate aim was to get people \"saved.\"{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nBooth asserts in his introduction,\n\n{{quote|I have no intention to depart in the smallest degree from the main principles on which I have acted in the past.  My only hope for the permanent deliverance of mankind from misery, either in this world or the next, is the regeneration or remaking of the individual by the power of the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ.  But in providing for the relief of temporal misery I reckon that I am only making it easy where it is now difficult, and possible where it is now all but impossible, for men and women to find their way to the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.}}\n\nIt was asserted in some circles that ''In Darkest England'' was actually written by the crusading journalist, [[William Thomas Stead|W.&nbsp;T. Stead]], who, in his own words, acted as a \"literary hack\" for the General when Mrs. Booth lay dying. However, this assumption was swiftly dismissed by Stead some years later, declaring that, \"The idea of Darkest England ... was the General's own. My part, of which I had no wish to speak ... was strictly subordinate throughout.\"<ref>Quoted in Robert Sandall, ''The History of the Salvation Army'', vol. 3, 1883\u20131953, Social Reform and Welfare Work (1955), Appendix B, pp. 324\u201332</ref>\n\n''In Darkest England and the Way Out'' was reprinted several times and lately in 2006.\n\nThere are also other works that have focused on the impact and significance of ''In Darkest England''. For example, marking the 125th anniversary of the publication of ''In Darkest England'', the book ''Darkness and Deliverance: 125 Years of the Darkest England Scheme'' contains fifteen chapters from leading and emerging authors that explore various historical aspects and future implications of the ''Darkest England'' scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chaordiccreative.com/darkness-and-deliverance|title=Darkness and Deliverance: 125 years of the Darkest England scheme|last=Seaman (ed.)|first=Matthew|date=2016|website=|publisher=Salvo Publishing / Chaordic Creative|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Opposition==\n[[File:booth-money.jpg|thumb|right|''The Entr'acte'' cartoon of 1882 captioned, \"Now, Mr Booth, let us know what you are going to do with all this money!\"]]\nDuring its early years The Salvation Army faced a great deal of opposition, especially from those in the alcohol-selling industry who were concerned that the activities of Booth and his followers would persuade the poorer classes to stop drinking. One group opposed to Booth and The Salvation Army was the [[Skeleton Army]], a diffuse group, particularly in [[Southern England]], that opposed and disrupted [[The Salvation Army]]'s marches against alcohol from the early 1880s until about 1892. Clashes between the two groups lead to the deaths of several [[The Salvation Army|Salvationists]] and injuries to many others. During 1882 alone 662 Salvation Army [[Soldier in The Salvation Army|soldiers]] were assaulted: 251 of them were women and 23 of them were under fifteen years of age.<ref>[http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10063/726/thesis.pdf? ''Officership in the Salvation Army: A Case Study in Clericalisation''] Doctoral thesis by Harold Ivor Winston Hill \u2013 Victoria University of Wellington (2004)</ref>\n\nOther accusations centred around the fact that Booth appointed his own children to posts for which others were better qualified, leading to claims that The Salvation Army was a Booth family-business. For example, he appointed his daughter [[Emma Booth (The Salvation Army)|Emma Booth]] as the Principal of the Officers' Training Home, The Salvation Army's first training school for women when she was just 19. While William Booth had once said to his children that \"The Salvation Army does not belong to you, or to me, it belongs to the world\" and was very wary of the leadership of the army becoming a dynasty,<ref name=\"Larsson\">{{Cite book |last=Larrson |first=John |year=2009 |title=1929: A Crisis that Shaped The Salvation Army's Future |place=London |publisher=Salvation Books |isbn=978-0-85412-794-8 }}</ref> others believed that Booth was creating a dynasty, as was suggested by the fact that he insisted that his sons-in-law added 'Booth' to their own names (see [[Frederick Booth-Tucker]] and [[Arthur Booth-Clibborn]]).<ref>Hodges, Samuel Horatio ''General Booth: \"the Family\", and the Salvation Army: Showing its Rise, Progress, and ... Decline'' (1890)</ref> This was further borne out when Booth appointed his son, [[Bramwell Booth]], as his successor as [[Generals of The Salvation Army|General]] in his will.\n\nThe press was often hostile to Booth and The Salvation Army as well because their methods and message were widely misinterpreted. The army's motto \"Blood & Fire\", which had deep [[theology|theological]] meaning representing the saving \"blood of Jesus\" and the sanctifying \"fire of the [[Holy Spirit]]\", was erroneously thought to mean the blood of sinners and the fire of hell. There was also suspicion about the army's motives, with Booth often portrayed as a charlatan only out to make money.<ref>[http://www.ourchurch.com/view/?pageID=12278 The Booths: The Salvation Army (1878\u20131890)] ourchurch.com</ref>\n\nThe [[Church of England]] was at first also extremely hostile to the activities of Booth and The Salvation Army. The philanthropist, politician, and evangelist [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] even went so far as to describe Booth as the \"[[Anti-Christ]]\". One of the main complaints against Booth was his \"elevation of women to man's status\". Many found him dictatorial and hard to work with. Some of his own children denounced him as their leader and turned their backs on The Salvation Army, including his daughter [[Kate Booth]] and his sons [[Herbert Booth|Herbert]] and [[Ballington Booth]], the latter founding a separate organisation, the [[Volunteers of America]] with himself as \"General\". The evangelist [[Rodney \"Gipsy\" Smith]] left him because of his rigidity and [[Dwight L. Moody|D.&nbsp;L. Moody]] would not support him because he felt there was a threat to the local church. But no one could deny his compassion for the sufferings of his fellow man.<ref>[http://www.gospeltruth.net/booth/boothbioshort.htm William Booth: His Life and Ministry], the Gospel Truth website</ref>\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:booth-booth-1904.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Booth and his granddaughter [[Catherine Bramwell-Booth]] during the 1904 motorcade]]\n\nOpinion of [[The Salvation Army]] and William Booth eventually changed to that of favour. In his later years, he was received in audience by kings, emperors and presidents, who were among his ardent admirers. Even the mass media began to use his title of 'General' with reverence.\n\nIn 1899, Booth suffered from blindness in both eyes, but with a short rest, was able to recover his sight. In 1904 he took part in a \"motorcade\" when he was driven around Great Britain, stopping off in cities, towns and villages to preach to the assembled crowds from his open-top car. In 1906 Booth was made a Freeman of the [[City of London]], and was granted an honorary degree from the [[University of Oxford]]. In 1902 he was invited to attend the coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]].\n\nHis last visit to \nNorth America was made in 1907, and in 1909 he embarked on a six-month motor tour of the United Kingdom. During this tour he discovered he was blind in his right eye and the sight in his left eye was dimmed by [[glaucoma|cataracts]]. The rest of the tour had to be cancelled. On 21 August 1909 a surgeon at [[Guy's Hospital]] removed his right eye. Despite this setback, in 1910 Booth campaigned in the [[Netherlands]], [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], Switzerland and [[Italy]]. On his return to England he embarked on his seventh and last motor tour.\n\nWilliam Booth was 83 years old when he died (or, in Salvationist parlance, was [[Promoted to Glory]]) at his home in [[Hadley Wood]], London. At the three-day lying in state at Clapton Congress Hall 150,000 people filed past his casket. On 27 August 1912 Booth's funeral service was held at London's [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] where 40,000 people attended, including [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]], who sat almost unrecognised far to the rear of the great hall.\n\nThe following day Booth's funeral procession set out from International Headquarters. As it moved off 10,000 uniformed [[The Salvation Army|Salvationists]] fell in behind. Forty Salvation Army bands played the \"Dead March\" from [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]]'s ''[[Saul (Handel)|Saul]]'' as the vast procession set off. He was buried with his wife [[Catherine Mumford|Catherine Booth]] in the main London burial ground for 19th century non-conformist ministers and tutors, the non-denominational [[Abney Park Cemetery]] in [[Stoke Newington]].<ref>{{YouTube|utDd1awwPaE|William Booth's funeral}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:William Booth at his birthplace - geograph.org.uk - 1275114.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of William Booth outside his birthplace in [[Sneinton]]]]\nIn Booth's honour, [[Vachel Lindsay]] wrote the poem, \"General William Booth Enters Into Heaven\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/271/48.html|title=General William Booth Enters into Heaven by Vachel Lindsay.

In 1990 a diesel locomotive in the [[British Rail]] fleet was named 'The William Booth'.\n\nThe William Booth rose, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honour. [[William Booth Memorial Training College|The William Booth Memorial Training College]] in [[Denmark Hill]], [[London]], the College for Officer Training of The Salvation Army in the United Kingdom, is named after him,<ref>[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/4723 William Booth College, Denmark Hill], Geograph</ref> as is the William Booth Primary School in his native [[Nottingham]] and William Booth Lane in central [[Birmingham]]. Many Salvation Army training colleges, schools, orphanages hospitals and other institutions around the world bear his name. \n\nStatues of each of the Booths by [[George Edward Wade]] were erected on [[Champion Hill]] in London, next to the Salvation Army's training college in London in 1929.<ref>Darke, Jo, ''The Monument Guide to England and Wales: A National Portrait in Bronze and Stone'', photographs by Jorge Lewinski and Mayotte Magnus, a MacDonald Illustrated Book, London, 1991 pp.  72-73</ref> Replicas of these statues stand in the Mile End Road, close to the site of the first Salvation Army meeting: that of William was unveiled in 1979, and that of Catherine in 2015.\n\nIn his honour One Mile End, a brewery from East London created a craft beer called Salvation! Pale Ale. The beer is sold in a couple of pubs including the White Hart Brewpub, only a few meters away from the statue of William Booth on Mile End Road.\n\n[[Mount William Booth]] in [[Alberta, Canada]] was named after Booth.<ref name=\"pf\">[http://www.peakfinder.com/peaks/1530 Mount William Booth] PeakFinder</ref>\n[[File:Mount William Booth.jpg|thumb|Mount William Booth]]\n\n==Children of William and Catherine Booth==\nWilliam Booth and Catherine Mumford were married on 17 June 1855<ref>{{Harvnb|Sandall|1947|p=7}}</ref> at Stockwell New Chapel, at that time part of [[Surrey]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hattersley|1999|p=73}}</ref> They had eight children:<ref name=ODNB>L.
