By 1934 it became the site of the [[Rizal Memorial Sports Complex]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abante-tonite.com/issue/may2707/leisure_trivia.htm |title=Leisure&nbsp;\u2013 Trivia |work=Abante |location=Manila |language=Filipino |date=27 May 2007 |accessdate=25 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715230501/http://www.abante-tonite.com/issue/may2707/leisure_trivia.htm |archive-date=15 July 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> One of the facilities within the complex is the 12,000 capacity [[national stadium]], known as the Rizal Memorial Track and Football Stadium or simply the Rizal Memorial Stadium.  Since its opening, it has been the home venue of the Philippine national team until May 2015 where they declared the 25,000 seater and [[Philippine Sports Stadium]] in [[Bocaue, Bulacan]] as their new home. However, due to disappointing attendance numbers in PSS and RMS and an impressive crowd for [[Ceres\u2013Negros F.C.]]'s run to the [[2017 AFC Cup]], the [[Philippine Football Federation]] decided to make [[Panaad Park and Stadium|Panaad Stadium]] as the national team's home again for the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification|2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers]].<ref>{{ cite news |last=Tupas |first=Cedelf |title=Impressed by turnout, PFF sends Azkals back to Panaad |work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=8 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe RMS has also become a hub for [[track and field]]. The continued use for athletics along with poor maintenance has deteriorated the stadium and the [[1991 Southeast Asian Games]] was the last time it was used for international football matches.  In early 2009, the [[Philippine Sports Commission]] planned to transform it to a modern football stadium which would make it usable by the national team for international matches.<ref>{{cite

It has been worn by military personnel from many different nations including Australia, Britain, India, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia, France, the United States, the Confederate States, Germany and many others. Australia and New Zealand have had various models of slouch hat as standard issue headwear since the late Victorian period.\n\nToday it is worn by military personnel from a number of countries, although it is primarily associated with Australia, where it is considered to be a national symbol. The distinctive Australian slouch hat, sometimes called an \"Australian bush hat\" or \"digger hat\", has one side of the brim turned up or pinned to the side of the hat with a [[Rising Sun (badge)|Rising Sun Badge]] in order to allow a rifle to be slung over the shoulder. This was also the practice with the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade|New Zealand Mounted Rifles]], with the New Zealand military insignia worn on the front of the puggaree of that era.\n\nIn the United States it was also called the Kossuth hat, after [[Lajos Kossuth]]. During the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) the headgear was common among both Confederate and Union troops in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], although not always with its brim turned up at the side. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], as commander of the [[Rough Riders]], Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became known for wearing a slouch hat.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VCAgansingRai.jpg|thumb|Naik [[Agansing Rai]] VC, [[5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]]]\n\nThe name \"slouch hat\" refers to the fact that one side droops down as opposed to the other which is pinned against the side of the crown.<ref name=\"diggerhistory.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|title=NZ Slouch|publisher=Digger History|accessdate=1 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920015848/http://diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|archivedate=20 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This style of hat has been worn for many hundreds of years, especially during the [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century when it became associated with the forces of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[Cavaliers]], but it was also fashionable for the aristocracy throughout Europe during that time until it was superseded by the cocked hat with two ([[bicorne|bicorn]]) or three ([[tricorn]]) points.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIt was introduced into Australia around 1885, although it traces its military use back to Austrian skirmishers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/web2.airmail.net/napoleon/Austrian_infantry.htm#austrianinfantryuniforms |title=Austrian Infantry|author=Unknown |publisher=napolun.com Chinese Napoleonic History|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The modern slouch hat is derived from the black \"Corsican hat\" (Korsehut) &ndash; historically used in the Austrian army during the Napoleonic Wars.

It was originally reintroduced for wear by Queen Alexandra's Mounted Rifles in the mid-1990s, but in 2000 its issue was broadened to all Corps for wear with [[New Zealand Army#Dress|working dress]] (influenced by such use by QAMR) as well as with service dress.

The local tailors usually used green fatigue cloth or leopard skin pattern [[military camouflage]] from old parachutes. The hat often had a cloth arc emblazoned with the word VIET-NAM on the brim.  The US [[1st Air Commando Group]] members officially adopted the green slouch hat on 22 May 1964<ref>Chinnery 1994, p.97.</ref> as their distinctive and practical headgear with an \"AIR COMMANDO\" arc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIn 1972 the [[United States Army|US Army]] authorized female drill sergeants to wear a similar type cloth bush hat with the brim pinned up on the side as their distinctive headgear.

It has been worn by military personnel from many different nations including Australia, Britain, India, New Zealand, Southern Rhodesia, France, the United States, the Confederate States, Germany and many others. Australia and New Zealand have had various models of slouch hat as standard issue headwear since the late Victorian period.\n\nToday it is worn by military personnel from a number of countries, although it is primarily associated with Australia, where it is considered to be a national symbol. The distinctive Australian slouch hat, sometimes called an \"Australian bush hat\" or \"digger hat\", has one side of the brim turned up or pinned to the side of the hat with a [[Rising Sun (badge)|Rising Sun Badge]] in order to allow a rifle to be slung over the shoulder. This was also the practice with the [[New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade|New Zealand Mounted Rifles]], with the New Zealand military insignia worn on the front of the puggaree of that era.\n\nIn the United States it was also called the Kossuth hat, after [[Lajos Kossuth]]. During the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) the headgear was common among both Confederate and Union troops in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]], although not always with its brim turned up at the side. During the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], as commander of the [[Rough Riders]], Colonel [[Theodore Roosevelt]] became known for wearing a slouch hat.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VCAgansingRai.jpg|thumb|Naik [[Agansing Rai]] VC, [[5th Royal Gurkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]]]\n\nThe name \"slouch hat\" refers to the fact that one side droops down as opposed to the other which is pinned against the side of the crown.<ref name=\"diggerhistory.info\">{{cite web|url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|title=NZ Slouch|publisher=Digger History|accessdate=1 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920015848/http://diggerhistory.info/pages-uniforms/nz-slouch.htm|archivedate=20 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This style of hat has been worn for many hundreds of years, especially during the [[English Civil War]] during the 17th century when it became associated with the forces of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[Cavaliers]], but it was also fashionable for the aristocracy throughout Europe during that time until it was superseded by the cocked hat with two ([[bicorne|bicorn]]) or three ([[tricorn]]) points.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nIt was introduced into Australia around 1885, although it traces its military use back to Austrian skirmishers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.napolun.com/mirror/web2.airmail.net/napoleon/Austrian_infantry.htm#austrianinfantryuniforms |title=Austrian Infantry|author=Unknown |publisher=napolun.com Chinese Napoleonic History|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref> The modern slouch hat is derived from the black \"Corsican hat\" (Korsehut) &ndash; historically used in the Austrian army during the Napoleonic Wars.

The local tailors usually used green fatigue cloth or leopard skin pattern [[military camouflage]] from old parachutes. The hat often had a cloth arc emblazoned with the word VIET-NAM on the brim.

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine considerations are often one aspect of [[border control]]. \n\nThe concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[American Samoa|East Samoa]] during the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country. In some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of [[biosecurity]]; for example [[biosecurity in Australia|Australian biosecurity]] is governed by the single overarching ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''.\n\n==Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word ''quarantine'' comes from ''quarantena'', meaning \"forty days\", used in the 14th-15th-century [[Venetian language]] and designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]]; it followed the ''trentino'', or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1377 in the [[Republic of Ragusa]], [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia).<ref name=\"JSM17\"/><ref name=\"Eccles\">{{cite book|editor1=Ronald Eccles|editor2=Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref><ref name=\"Mayer\">{{cite web |first= Johanna |last= Mayer |title= The Origin Of The Word 'Quarantine' |date=4 September 2018 |url= https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-quarantine/ |access-date=17 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"EID2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3201/eid1902.ET1902|title=Etymologia: Quarantine|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n[[Merriam-Webster]] gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the [[Freedom of movement|movement of people]] and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of [[disease]] or [[Pest (organism)|pests]]\".

Those afflicted with [[leprosy]] were historically isolated long-term from society, and attempts were made to check the spread of [[syphilis]] in northern Europe after 1492, the advent of [[yellow fever]] in Spain at the beginning of the 19th century, and the arrival of Asiatic [[cholera]] in 1831.\n\n[[Republic of Venice|Venice]] took the lead in measures to check the spread of plague, having appointed three guardians of public health in the first years of the Black Death (1348).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.21061/vtuhr.v2i0.16|title=A Brief History of Quarantine|year=2013|last1=Drews|first1=Kelly|journal=The Virginia Tech Undergraduate Historical Review|volume=2|doi-access=free}}</ref> The next record of preventive measures comes from [[Reggio Emilia| Reggio]]/[[Modena]] in 1374.

The great lazaret of Marseille, perhaps the most complete of its kind, was founded in 1526 on the island of [[Frioul archipelago |Pom\u00e8gues]]. The practice at all the Mediterranean lazarets did not differ from the English procedure in the Levantine and North African trade.

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 Text of the 1903 convention] British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ''www.fco.gov.uk'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134555/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 |date=26 September 2012}}, accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\nA multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 4, pp. 282\u2013413.</ref> This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.\n\n====21st century====\nIn the 21st century, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of [[Andrew Speaker]] (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and [[Kaci Hickox]] (Ebola, 2014). Moving infected patients to [[isolation ward]]s and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the [[Western African Ebola virus epidemic]] was ended in 2016; members of the 8th [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Emergency Committee criticised international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|title=Statement on the 8th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa|author=|date=|publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] has employed mass quarantines - firstly of the city of [[Wuhan]] and subsequently of all of [[Hubei]] province (population 55.5 million) - in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

It is sometimes called the \"yellow jack\" but this was also a name for [[yellow fever]], which probably derives its common name from the flag, not the colour of the victims (cholera ships also used a yellow flag).<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Sehdev PS|title=The origin of quarantine|journal=[[Clinical Infectious Diseases]]|date=1 November 2002|volume=35|issue=9|pages=1071\u20132|doi=10.1086/344062|pmid=12398064|doi-access=free}}</ref> The plain [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] (\"Quebec\" or '''Q''' in [[international maritime signal flags]]) probably derives its letter symbol for its initial use in ''quarantine'', but this flag in modern times indicates the opposite\u2014a ship that 'requests free [[pratique]]', i.e. that declares itself free of quarantinable disease, and requests boarding and routine port inspection.<ref>[http://flagspot.net/flags/xf~q.html Quarantine Flag history] ''flagspot.net'', accessed 2 February 2020</ref>\n\n==Ethical and practical considerations==\nThe quarantining of people often raises questions of [[civil rights]], especially in cases of long confinement or segregation from society, such as that of [[Mary Mallon]] (also known as Typhoid Mary), a [[typhoid fever]] [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]] who was arrested and quarantined in 1907 and later spent the last 23 years and 7 months of her life in medical isolation at Riverside Hospital on [[North and South Brother Islands, New York City#North Brother Island|North Brother Island]].<ref>[http://broadstreetonline.org/2015/02/typhoid-mary-and-the-publics-right-to-health/ \"Typhoid Mary and the Public's Right to Health,\"] ''Broad Street Magazine,'' 16 February 2015, 12:37 pm</ref><ref>[http://time.com/3474945/politics-quarantines-typhoid-mary-ebola/ Mary Beth Keane, \"The History of Quarantine Is the History of Discrimination,\"] 6 October 2014 ''Time Magazine,'', accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\n===The United Nations and the Siracusa Principles===\nGuidance on when and how human rights can be restricted to prevent the spread of infectious disease is found in The Siracusa Principles, a non-binding document developed by the [[Siracusa International Institute for Criminal Justice and Human Rights]] and adopted by the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] in 1984.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4672bc122.html United Nations Economic and Social Council UN Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, \"The Siracusa Principles on the limitation and derogation provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,\" Section I.A.12 UN Doc.

Limitations on rights (such as quarantine) must be 'strictly necessary,' meaning that they must: \n* respond to a pressing public or social need (health)\n* [[Proportionality (law)|proportionately]] pursue a legitimate aim (prevent the spread of infectious disease)\n* be the [[least restrictive means]] required for achieving the purpose of the limitation\n* be provided for and carried out in accordance with the law\n* be neither arbitrary nor discriminatory\n* only limit rights that are within the jurisdiction of the state seeking to impose the limitation.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 4463097|year = 2013|last1 = Todrys|first1 = K.

These include [[post-traumatic stress]], confusion and anger.  According to a \"Rapid Review\" published in [[The Lancet]] in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], \"Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8|title=The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence|year=2020|last1=Brooks|first1=Samantha K.|last2=Webster|first2=Rebecca K.|last3=Smith|first3=Louise E.|last4=Woodland|first4=Lisa|last5=Wessely|first5=Simon|last6=Greenberg|first6=Neil|last7=Rubin|first7=Gideon James|journal=The Lancet|volume=395|issue=10227|pages=912\u2013920|pmid=32112714|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Short-term quarantines, e.g. for decontamination===\nQuarantine periods can be very short, such as in the case of a suspected [[anthrax]] attack, in which people are allowed to leave as soon as they shed their potentially contaminated garments and undergo a [[decontamination]] shower. For example, an article entitled \"Daily News workers quarantined\" describes a brief quarantine that lasted until people could be showered in a decontamination tent.<ref>[https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Anthrax-scare-temporarily-closes-Midland-Daily-7020034.php Kelly Nankervis: Anthrax scare temporarily closes Midland Daily News] ''Daily News/ www.ourmidland.com''</ref>\n\nThe February/March 2003 issue of ''HazMat Magazine'' suggests that people be \"locked in a room until proper decon could be performed\", in the event of \"suspect anthrax\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' senior correspondent Steve Urbon (14 February 2003) describes such temporary quarantine powers:\n<blockquote>\nCivil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have \"certain powers to quarantine people\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tognotti|first1=E.|title=Lessons from the history of quarantine, from plague to influenza A.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=19|issue=2|pages=254\u2013259|doi=10.3201/eid1902.120312|pmid=23343512|pmc=3559034|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Qureshi|first1=Adnan|title=Ebola Virus Disease: From Origin to Outbreak|date=2016|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0128042304|page=62}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe purpose of such quarantine-for-decontamination is to prevent the spread of contamination and to contain the contamination such that others are not put at risk from a person fleeing a scene where contamination is suspect. It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].\n\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==\n{{Globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=February 2020}}\n===Australia===\n{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}\nBiosecurity in Australia is governed by the ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''. The [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] (AQIS) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from AQIS. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$220, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAustralia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome\u2014including the [[Torres Strait]]\u2014is the focus for quarantine activities that protect all Australians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |title=Public Awareness and Education |accessdate=27 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405091101/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |archivedate=5 April 2013  }}</ref> As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem free of several severe pests and diseases that are present in many parts of the world.<ref name=\"daff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|title=Quarantine in Australia - Department of Agriculture|publisher=daff.gov.au|accessdate=14 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713013953/http://daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|archive-date=13 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.<ref name=\"australia\">{{cite web|title=Australian Quarantine a shared responsibility: The Government response|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/australia/reports-pubs/nairn/govt-response|website=Australian Government|publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Energy|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThere are three quarantine [[Acts of Parliament]] in Canada: ''Quarantine Act'' (humans) and ''Health of Animals Act'' (animals) and ''Plant Protection Act'' (vegetations). The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travellers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveller, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveller who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognised yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harbouring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.<ref name=Booker/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments.

It is often used in connection to disease and illness, preventing the movement of those who may have been exposed to a [[infection|communicable disease]], but do not have a confirmed [[medical diagnosis]]. It is distinct from [[Isolation (health care)|medical isolation]], in which those confirmed to be infected with a communicable disease are isolated from the healthy population. Quarantine considerations are often one aspect of [[border control]]. \n\nThe concept of quarantine has been known since biblical times, and is known to have been practised through history in various places. Notable quarantines in modern history include that of the village of [[Eyam]] in 1665 during the [[bubonic plague]] outbreak in England; [[American Samoa|East Samoa]] during the [[Spanish flu|1918 flu pandemic]]; the [[1972 Yugoslav smallpox outbreak]], and extensive quarantines applied throughout the world during the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\nEthical and practical considerations need to be considered when applying quarantine to people. Practice differs from country to country. In some countries, quarantine is just one of many measures governed by legislation relating to the broader concept of [[biosecurity]]; for example [[biosecurity in Australia|Australian biosecurity]] is governed by the single overarching ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''.\n\n==Etymology and terminology ==\nThe word ''quarantine'' comes from ''quarantena'', meaning \"forty days\", used in the 14th-15th-century [[Venetian language]] and designating the period that all ships were required to be isolated before passengers and crew could go ashore during the [[Black Death]] plague [[epidemic]]; it followed the ''trentino'', or thirty-day isolation period, first imposed in 1377 in the [[Republic of Ragusa]], [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia).<ref name=\"JSM17\"/><ref name=\"Eccles\">{{cite book|editor1=Ronald Eccles|editor2=Olaf Weber|title=Common cold|year=2009|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|location=Basel|isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1|pages=210|edition=Online-Ausg.}}</ref><ref name=\"Mayer\">{{cite web |first= Johanna |last= Mayer |title= The Origin Of The Word 'Quarantine' |date=4 September 2018 |url= https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-origin-of-the-word-quarantine/ |access-date=17 March 2020 }}</ref><ref name=\"EID2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.3201/eid1902.ET1902|title=Etymologia: Quarantine|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2013|volume=19|issue=2|pages=263|doi-access=free}}</ref> \n\n[[Merriam-Webster]] gives various meanings to the noun form, including \"a period of 40 days\", several relating to ships, \"a state of enforced isolation\", and as \"a restriction on the [[Freedom of movement|movement of people]] and goods which is intended to prevent the spread of [[disease]] or [[Pest (organism)|pests]]\".

All but that of 1897 were concerned with [[cholera]]. No result came of those at Paris (1852), Constantinople (1866), Vienna (1874), and Rome (1885), but each of the subsequent ones doctrine of constructive infection of a ship as coming from a scheduled port, and an approximation to the principles advocated by Great Britain for many years. The principal countries which retained the old system at the time were Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Greece and Russia (the British possessions at the time, Gibraltar, Malta and Cyprus, being under the same influence). The aim of each international sanitary convention had been to bind the governments to a uniform minimum of preventive action, with further restrictions permissible to individual countries. The minimum specified by international conventions was very nearly the same as the British practice, which had been in turn adapted to continental opinion in the matter of the importation of rags.\n\nThe Venice convention of 30 January 1892 dealt with cholera by the [[Suez Canal]] route; that of Dresden of 15 April 1893, with cholera within European countries; that of Paris of 3 April 1894, with cholera by the pilgrim traffic; and that of Venice, on 19 March 1897, was in connection with the outbreak of plague in the East, and the conference met to settle on an international basis the steps to be taken to prevent, if possible, its spread into Europe. An additional convention was signed in Paris on 3 December 1903.<ref>[http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 Text of the 1903 convention] British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, ''www.fco.gov.uk'' {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926134555/http://www.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/pdf/treaties/TS1/1907/27 |date=26 September 2012}}, accessed 5 February 2020</ref>\n\nA multilateral international sanitary convention was concluded at Paris on 17 January 1912.<ref>Text in ''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 4, pp. 282\u2013413.</ref> This convention was most comprehensive and was designated to replace all previous conventions on that matter.

It was admitted that the incubation period was, as a rule, a comparatively short one, namely, of some three or four days. After much discussion ten days was accepted by a very large majority. The principle of [[disease notification]] was unanimously adopted. Each government had to notify to other governments on the existence of plague within their several jurisdictions, and at the same time state the measures of prevention which are being carried out to prevent its diffusion. The area deemed to be infected was limited to the actual district or village where the disease prevailed, and no locality was deemed to be infected merely because of the importation into it of a few cases of plague while there has been no diffusion of the malady. As regards the precautions to be taken on land frontiers, it was decided that during the prevalence of plague every country had the inherent right to close its land frontiers against traffic. As regards the [[Red Sea]], it was decided after discussion that a healthy vessel could pass through the Suez Canal, and continue its voyage in the Mediterranean during the period of incubation of the disease the prevention of which is in question. It was also agreed that vessels passing through the Canal in quarantine might, subject to the use of the electric light, coal in quarantine at Port Said by night as well as by day, and that passengers might embark in quarantine at that port. Infected vessels, if these carry a doctor and are provided with a disinfecting stove, have a right to navigate the Canal, in quarantine, subject only to the landing of those who were suffering from plague.\n\n====21st century====\nIn the 21st century, people suspected of carrying infectious diseases have been quarantined, as in the cases of [[Andrew Speaker]] (multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, 2007) and [[Kaci Hickox]] (Ebola, 2014). Moving infected patients to [[isolation ward]]s and home-based self-quarantine of people potentially exposed was the main way the [[Western African Ebola virus epidemic]] was ended in 2016; members of the 8th [[World Health Organization|WHO]] Emergency Committee criticized international travel restrictions imposed during the epidemic as ineffective due to difficulty of enforcement, and counterproductive as they slowed down aid efforts.<ref>{{cite report|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2015/ihr-ebola-8th-meeting/en/|title=Statement on the 8th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa|author=|date=|publisher=WHO |accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> The [[People's Republic of China]] has employed mass quarantines - firstly of the city of [[Wuhan]] and subsequently of all of [[Hubei]] province (population 55.5 million) - in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].

These include [[post-traumatic stress]], confusion and anger.  According to a \u201cRapid Review\u201d published in [[The Lancet]] in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], \u201cStressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30460-8|title=The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence|year=2020|last1=Brooks|first1=Samantha K.|last2=Webster|first2=Rebecca K.|last3=Smith|first3=Louise E.|last4=Woodland|first4=Lisa|last5=Wessely|first5=Simon|last6=Greenberg|first6=Neil|last7=Rubin|first7=Gideon James|journal=The Lancet|volume=395|issue=10227|pages=912\u2013920|pmid=32112714|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Short-term quarantines, e.g. for decontamination===\nQuarantine periods can be very short, such as in the case of a suspected [[anthrax]] attack, in which people are allowed to leave as soon as they shed their potentially contaminated garments and undergo a [[decontamination]] shower. For example, an article entitled \"Daily News workers quarantined\" describes a brief quarantine that lasted until people could be showered in a decontamination tent.<ref>[https://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Anthrax-scare-temporarily-closes-Midland-Daily-7020034.php Kelly Nankervis: Anthrax scare temporarily closes Midland Daily News] ''Daily News/ www.ourmidland.com''</ref>\n\nThe February/March 2003 issue of ''HazMat Magazine'' suggests that people be \"locked in a room until proper decon could be performed\", in the event of \"suspect anthrax\".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n''[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|Standard-Times]]'' senior correspondent Steve Urbon (14 February 2003) describes such temporary quarantine powers:\n<blockquote>\nCivil rights activists in some cases have objected to people being rounded up, stripped and showered against their will. But Capt. Chmiel said local health authorities have \"certain powers to quarantine people\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tognotti|first1=E.|title=Lessons from the history of quarantine, from plague to influenza A.|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|volume=19|issue=2|pages=254\u2013259|doi=10.3201/eid1902.120312|pmid=23343512|pmc=3559034|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Qureshi|first1=Adnan|title=Ebola Virus Disease: From Origin to Outbreak|date=2016|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0128042304|page=62}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe purpose of such quarantine-for-decontamination is to prevent the spread of contamination and to contain the contamination such that others are not put at risk from a person fleeing a scene where contamination is suspect. It can also be used to limit exposure, as well as eliminate a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]].\n\nNew developments for quarantine include new concepts in quarantine vehicles such as the [[ambulance bus]], mobile hospitals, and lockdown/invacuation (inverse evacuation) procedures, as well as docking stations for an ambulance bus to dock to a facility under lockdown.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Standard quarantine practices in different countries==\n{{Globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=February 2020}}\n===Australia===\n{{further|Biosecurity in Australia}}\nBiosecurity in Australia is governed by the ''[[Biosecurity Act 2015]]''. The [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] (AQIS) is responsible for border inspection of products brought into Australia, and assesses the risks the products might harm Australian environment. No person, goods and vessels are permitted into Australia without clearance from AQIS. Visitors are required to fill in the information card on arriving in Australia. Besides other risk factors, visitors are required to declare what food and products made of wood and other natural materials they have. Visitors who fail to do so may be subject to a fine of A$220, or may face criminal prosecution and be fined up to A$100,000 or imprisonment of up to 10 years.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAustralia has very strict quarantine standards. Quarantine in northern Australia is especially important because of its proximity to South-East Asia and the Pacific, which have many pests and diseases not present in Australia. For this reason, the region from Cairns to Broome\u2014including the [[Torres Strait]]\u2014is the focus for quarantine activities that protect all Australians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |title=Public Awareness and Education |accessdate=2013-03-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405091101/http://www.daff.gov.au/aqis/about/public-awareness |archivedate=5 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As Australia has been geographically isolated from other major continents for millions of years, there is an endemically unique ecosystem free of several severe pests and diseases that are present in many parts of the world.<ref name=\"daff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|title=Quarantine in Australia - Department of Agriculture|publisher=daff.gov.au|accessdate=14 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713013953/http://daff.gov.au/biosecurity/quarantine|archive-date=13 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> If other products are brought inside along with pests and diseases, it would damage the ecosystem seriously and add millions of costs in the local agricultural businesses.<ref name=\"australia\">{{cite web|title=Australian Quarantine a shared responsibility: The Government response|url=http://www.agriculture.gov.au/biosecurity/australia/reports-pubs/nairn/govt-response|website=Australian Government|publisher=Department of Primary Industries and Energy|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThere are three quarantine [[Acts of Parliament]] in Canada: ''Quarantine Act'' (humans) and ''Health of Animals Act'' (animals) and ''Plant Protection Act'' (vegetations). The first legislation is enforced by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] after a complete rewrite in 2005. The second and third legislations are enforced by the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]. If a health emergency exists, the Governor in Council can prohibit importation of anything that it deems necessary under the ''Quarantine Act''.\n\nUnder the ''Quarantine Act'', all travelers must submit to screening and if they believe they might have come into contact with [[communicable disease]]s or [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], they must disclose their whereabouts to a [[Border Services Officer]]. If the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveller is or might have been infected with a communicable disease or refused to provide answers, a quarantine officer (QO) must be called and the person is to be isolated. If a person refuses to be isolated, any [[peace officer]] may arrest without warrant.\n\nA QO who has reasonable grounds to believe that the traveler has or might have a communicable disease or is infested with vectors, after the medical examination of a traveler, can order him/her into treatment or measures to prevent the person from spreading the disease. QO can detain any traveler who refuses to comply with his/her orders or undergo health assessments as required by law.\n\nUnder the ''Health of Animals Act'' and ''Plant Protection Act'', inspectors can prohibit access to an infected area, dispose or treat any infected or suspected to be infected animals or plants. The Minister can order for compensation to be given if animals/plants were destroyed pursuant to these acts.\n\nEach province also enacts its own quarantine/environmental health legislation.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nUnder the ''Prevention and Control of Disease Ordinance'' (HK Laws. Chap 599), a health officer may seize articles they believe to be infectious or containing infectious agents. All travellers, if requested, must submit themselves to a health officer. Failure to do so is against the law and is subject to arrest and prosecution.\n\nThe law allows for a health officer who have reasonable grounds to detain, isolate, quarantine anyone or anything believed to be infected and to restrict any articles from leaving a designated quarantine area. He/she may also order the Civil Aviation Department to prohibit the landing or leaving, embarking or disembarking of an aircraft. This power also extends to land, sea or air crossings.\n\nUnder the same ordinance, any police officer, health officer, member of the [[Civil Aid Service]], or member of the [[Auxiliary Medical Service]] can arrest a person who obstructs or escapes from detention.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nTo reduce the risk of introducing [[rabies]] from continental Europe, the United Kingdom used to require that dogs, and most other animals introduced to the country, spend six months in quarantine at an [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|HM Customs and Excise]] pound; this policy was abolished in 2000 in favour of a scheme generally known as [[Pet Passports]], where animals can avoid quarantine if they have documentation showing they are up to date on their appropriate [[vaccine|vaccinations]].<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad#countries-and-territories Bringing your pet dog, cat or ferret to the UK] ''www.gov.uk'', accessed 27 January 2020</ref>\n\n====British maritime quarantine rules 1711\u20131896====\nThe plague had disappeared from England for more than thirty years before the practice of quarantine against it was definitely established by the Quarantine Act 1710 (''[[9 Ann.]]'') The first act was called for due to fears that the plague might be imported from Poland and the [[Baltic states]]. The second act of 1721 was due to the prevalence of plague at [[Marseille]] and other places in [[Provence, France]]. It was renewed in 1733 after a new outbreak in [[continental Europe]], and again in 1743, due to an epidemic in [[Messina]]. In 1752 a rigorous quarantine clause was introduced into an act regulating trade with [[the Levant]], and various arbitrary orders were issued during the next twenty years to meet the supposed danger of infection from the Baltic states. Although no plague cases ever came to England during that period, the restrictions on traffic became more stringent, and in 1788 a very strict Quarantine Act was passed, with provisions affecting cargoes in particular. The act was revised in 1801 and 1805, and in 1823\u201324 an elaborate inquiry was followed by an act making quarantine only at discretion of the [[privy council]], which recognized yellow fever or other highly infectious diseases as calling for quarantine, along with plague. The threat of cholera in 1831 was the last occasion in England of the use of quarantine restrictions. Cholera affected every country in Europe despite all efforts to keep it out. When cholera returned to England in 1849, 1853 and 1865\u201366, no attempt was made to seal the ports. In 1847 the privy council ordered all arrivals with a clean [[bill of health]] from the [[Black Sea]] and the Levant to be admitted, provided there had been no case of plague during the voyage, and afterwards the practice of quarantine was discontinued.<ref name=Booker>[https://books.google.com/books?id=B7OoDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT5&lpg=PT5&dq= John Booker, ''Maritime Quarantine: The British Experience, c.1650\u20131900,'' in ''The History of Medicine in Context,'' Routledge, 2016.]{{ISBN|1351919849}} ''books.google.com'', accessed 6 February 2020</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the protective practices in England were haphazard and arbitrary. In 1721 two vessels carrying cotton goods from Cyprus, then affected by the plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving an [[indemnity]]. By the clause in the Levant Trade Act of 1752, ships arriving in the United Kingdom with a \"foul bill\" (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to return to the [[lazaret]]s of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to complete a quarantine or to have their cargoes opened and aired. Since 1741 [[Stangate]] Creek (on the [[Medway]]) had been the quarantine station but it was available only for vessels with clean bills of health. In 1755 lazarets in the form of [[Hulk (ship type)|floating hulks]] were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to [[dew]]s) having been done previously on the ship's deck. No medical inspections were conducted, but control was the responsibility of the Officers of [[Customs|Royal Customs]] and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to spend forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air their cargoes, but due to complaints mainly from Edinburgh and Leith, an exception was made for grain after that date. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine to hoist a [[yellow flag (contagion)|yellow flag]] in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or upon arriving within four [[league (unit)|leagues]] of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland.<ref name=Booker/>\n\nAfter 1800, ships from plague-affected countries (or with foul bills) were permitted to complete their quarantine in the Medway instead of at a Mediterranean port on the way, and an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] (although it was later demolished). The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with [[hide (skin)|hides]] from [[Mogador]] in Morocco were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the [[Nore]], the owners receiving an indemnity. Animal hides were suspected of harboring infections, along with a long list of other items, and these had to be exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each installment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired for another forty days. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. From 1846 onwards the quarantine establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the [[Public Health Act]] of 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act of 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the [[Local Government Board]] the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague. The powers to deal with cholera ships had been already transferred by the [[Public Health Act 1875]].<ref name=Booker/>\n\nBritish regulations of 9 November 1896 applied to [[yellow fever]], [[Bubonic plague|plague]] and [[cholera]]. Officers of the Customs, as well as of [[Coast Guard|Royal Coast Guard]] and the [[Board of Trade]] (for signalling), were empowered to take the initial steps. They certified in writing the master of a supposedly infected ship, and detained the vessel provisionally for not more than twelve hours, giving notice meanwhile to the [[Port authority|port sanitary authority]]. The medical officer of the port boarded the ship and examined every person in it. Every person found infected was taken to a hospital and quarantined under the orders of the medical officer, and the vessel remained under his orders. Every person suspected could be detained on board for 48 hours or removed to the hospital for a similar period. All others were free to land upon giving the addresses of their destinations to be sent to the respective local authorities, so that the dispersed passengers and crew could be kept individually under observation for a few days. The ship was then disinfected, dead bodies buried at sea, infected clothing, bedding, etc., destroyed or disinfected, and [[bilge-water]] and [[Sailing ballast|water-ballast]] pumped out at a suitable distance before the ship entered a dock or basin. Mail was subject to no detention. A stricken ship within 3 miles of the shore had to fly a yellow and black flag at the main mast from sunrise to sunset.<ref name=Booker/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, authority to quarantine people with infectious diseases is split between the state and federal governments.

The convoy, designated BM.12, had come under an aerial attack in the [[Bangka Strait]] on 4 February 1942 and suffered only minor damage.

It was said that much of the vital military materiel and aid-supplies lost in the sinking of the ship would have been supplied and provided to the badly-equipped [[Dalforce|Singapore Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Battalion]] as well as reinforcing and strengthening the rest of the poorly-equipped and ill-supplied British-commanded defending troops, aside from British troops, comprising Australian, Indian and Malayan soldiers.\n\nThe last convoy of evacuees leaving Singapore included SS ''Sing Kheng Seng'' of the Straits Shipping Company, carrying 45 crewmen from ''Empress of Asia'' along with an unknown number of others.<ref>[http://singaporeevacuation1942.blogspot.com/  Singapore evacuation 1942]: Civilian evacuation lists; 13 February 1942.</ref>\n\n[[Leonard H.

Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May.

CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thinking about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequential suspension of production.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\">{{Cite

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.-->the eleventh film in the [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) and<!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Director [[Matt Reeves]] stated: \"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n*[[Jack Griffo]] as [[Dick Grayson|Dick Grayson/Robin]]: A circus acrobat, Dick is adopted by Bruce after Falcone kills his parents in a circus event. He becomes your partner in fighting crime, Robin. Some actors were considered for the role like [[Tye Sheridan]] (Cyclops of the X-Men franchise) and [[Vincent Martella]] (Greg Wulliguer of Everybody Hates Chris).\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character,<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> who was previously portrayed by [[J.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thinking about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and the consequential suspension of production.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\">{{Cite

Its current MP is [[Carolyn Bennett]]. Prior to the [[42nd Canadian federal election|2015 election]], the riding was known as '''St. Paul's'''.<ref>http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=6654879&File=4</ref>\n\nThe small but densely populated [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] covers the area to the north and northeast of [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]] (often called \"Midtown\" Toronto). In the past, it had been considered a [[bellwether]] riding, having been represented by only three [[Official Opposition|opposition]] MPs. However, like most Toronto-based ridings, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] have dominated recent elections. Since the Liberals won all but one seat in Ontario in their [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 landslide]], they have won all but one election in St. Paul's by 10,000 votes or more.\n\nAs of 2015, it includes the southern two-thirds of the wealthy Toronto neighbourhood of [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], plus the neighbourhoods of [[Deer Park, Toronto|Deer Park]], [[Davisville Village]],  [[Chaplin Estates, Toronto|Chaplin Estates]], [[South Hill, Toronto|South Hill]], [[Humewood-Cedarvale]], the southern two-thirds of [[Fairbank, Toronto|Fairbank]], and the northern half of [[Summerhill, Toronto|Summerhill]].\n==Demographics==\n:''According to the [[Canada 2006 Census]]''\n\n'''Ethnic groups:''' 76.08% White, 5.31% Black, 4.04% Filipino, 3.73% Chinese, 2.85% Latin American, 2.46% South Asian <br />\n'''Languages:''' 67.47% English, 1.87% French, 30.47% Others <br />\n'''Religions (2001):''' 29.28% Catholic, 25.01% Protestant, 19.60% Non religious, 14.03% Jewish, 4.18% Christian Orthodox, 2.62% Other Christian, 2.52% Muslim, 1.35% Buddhist <br />\n'''Average income:''' $34,617\n\n==History==\n\nIt was created in 1933 from parts of [[Toronto East Centre]], [[Toronto Northeast]], [[Toronto South]] and [[Toronto West Centre]] [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]].\n\nIt consisted initially of the central part of the City of Toronto (\"Downtown Toronto\")  It was bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by [[Sherbourne Street, Toronto|Sherbourne Street]] and on the north and west by a line drawn from Sherbourne Street west along Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the belt line railway, south and west along the western limit of the city, south along Dunvegan Road, east along St. Clair Avenue, south along Poplar Plains Road, west along Dupont Street, south along St. George and Beverley Streets, east along Queen Street, south along John Street.\n\nIn 1947, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by a line drawn from the Bay north along Sherbourne Street, west along Bloor Street East and north along Yonge Street, on the north by the south boundary of Ward Nine of the city of Toronto, and on the west by a line drawn from the Bay north on John Street, west along Queen Street West, north on Beverley Street and along St. George Street, east along Dupont Street, north along [[Davenport Road]] and Poplar Plains Road, west along St. Clair Avenue West, north along Dunvegan Road, east and north along the city limit to the southern boundary of Ward Nine.\n\nIn 1966, the southern part of the riding, what would be considered to be \"Downtown Toronto\" was removed from the electoral district (added to Rosedale electoral district) and the riding was shifted northward redefined to consist of the part of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] bounded by a line drawn from Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the Canadian National Railway line, north along Elmsthorpe Avenue, west along Eglinton Avenue, north along Castlewood Road, west along Briar Hill Avenue, south along Old Park Road and Glen Cedar Road, southeast along Claxton Boulevard, south along Bathurst Street and east along Bloor Street to Yonge Street.\n\nIn 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway line north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north and east along the eastern limit of the City of York, east and north along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Yonge Street and westerly along the CPR line to Ossington Avenue (removing lands between the CPR lands and Bloor Street).\n\nIn 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north along the eastern limit of the City of York, east along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Bathurst Street, southeast along the Belt Line (formerly the Canadian National Railway), east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south and east along the eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, south along the ravine situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south and east along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Woodlawn Avenue East, south along Yonge Street, and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn 2003, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Toronto bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Holland Park Avenue, north along Oakwood Avenue, west along Rogers Road, north along Dufferin Street, east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south along the former eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, southeast along the Don River Tributary situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Jackes Avenue, south along Yonge Street and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]], St. Paul's lost territory to [[Don Valley West]], gained a small fraction from [[Davenport (electoral district)|Davenport]] and was renamed Toronto\u2014St. Paul's.\n\n=== Churches named for St Paul in the electoral district ===\n\nFrom its creation until 1966, the electoral district included two prominent churches named for [[St Paul]] the apostle: [[St. Paul's, Bloor Street]] at 227 Bloor Street East, which is the largest Anglican church in Toronto by [[seating capacity]]; and [[St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church]] at Avenue Road and Webster Avenue, which was the church of many of Toronto's [[elite]]. The electoral district ceased to include 227 Bloor Street East after a redefinition of the district's boundaries in 1966. In 1980, the congregation at St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church moved to 427 Bloor Street West during a church merger creating [[Trinity-St. Paul's United Church]]. The electoral district ceased to include 427 Bloor Street West after a boundary redefinition in 1987. Therefore, Toronto\u2014St Paul's no longer contains a St Paul's.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\nThis riding has elected the following [[Member of Parliament|Members of

Its current MP is [[Carolyn Bennett]]. Prior to the [[42nd Canadian federal election|2015 election]], the riding was known as '''St. Paul's'''.<ref>http://www.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&DocId=6654879&File=4</ref>\n\nThe small but densely populated [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]] covers the area to the north and northeast of [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]] (often called \"Midtown\" Toronto). In the past, it had been considered a [[bellwether]] riding, having been represented by only three [[Official Opposition|opposition]] MPs. However, like most Toronto-based ridings, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberals]] have dominated recent elections. Since the Liberals won all but one seat in Ontario in their [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 landslide]], they have won all but one election in St. Paul's by 10,000 votes or more.\n\nAs of 2015,

Centre]], [[Toronto Northeast]], [[Toronto South]] and [[Toronto West Centre]] [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]].\n\nIt consisted initially of the central part of the City of Toronto (\"Downtown Toronto\")  It was bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by [[Sherbourne Street, Toronto|Sherbourne Street]] and on the north and west by a line drawn from Sherbourne Street west along Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the belt line railway, south and west along the western limit of the city, south along Dunvegan Road, east along St. Clair Avenue, south along Poplar Plains Road, west along Dupont Street, south along St. George and Beverley Streets, east along Queen Street, south along John Street.\n\nIn 1947, it was redefined to consist of the part of the city of Toronto bounded on the south by Toronto Bay, on the east by a line drawn from the Bay north along Sherbourne Street, west along Bloor Street East and north along Yonge Street, on the north by the south boundary of Ward Nine of the city of Toronto, and on the west by a line drawn from the Bay north on John Street, west along Queen Street West, north on Beverley Street and along St. George Street, east along Dupont Street, north along [[Davenport Road]] and Poplar Plains Road, west along St. Clair Avenue West, north along Dunvegan Road, east and north along the city limit to the southern boundary of Ward Nine.\n\nIn 1966, the southern part of the riding, what would be considered to be \"Downtown Toronto\" was removed from the electoral district (added to Rosedale electoral district) and the riding was shifted northward redefined to consist of the part of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] bounded by a line drawn from Bloor Street, north along Yonge Street, northwest along the Canadian National Railway line, north along Elmsthorpe Avenue, west along Eglinton Avenue, north along Castlewood Road, west along Briar Hill Avenue, south along Old Park Road and Glen Cedar Road, southeast along Claxton Boulevard, south along Bathurst Street and east along Bloor Street to Yonge Street.\n\nIn 1987, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway line north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north and east along the eastern limit of the City of York, east and north along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Yonge Street and westerly along the CPR line to Ossington Avenue (removing lands between the CPR lands and Bloor Street).\n\nIn 1996, it was redefined to consist of the part of the cities of Toronto and York bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Eglinton Avenue West, north along the eastern limit of the City of York, east along the northern limit of the City of Toronto, south along Bathurst Street, southeast along the Belt Line (formerly the Canadian National Railway), east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south and east along the eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, south along the ravine situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south and east along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Woodlawn Avenue East, south along Yonge Street, and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn 2003, it was redefined to consist of the part of the City of Toronto bounded by a line drawn from the Canadian Pacific Railway north along Ossington Avenue, east along Davenport Road, north along Winona Drive, west along Holland Park Avenue, north along Oakwood Avenue, west along Rogers Road, north along Dufferin Street, east along Eglinton Avenue West, north along Yonge Street, east along Broadway Avenue, south along the former eastern limit of the City of Toronto, west along the south side of the Mount Pleasant Cemetery, southeast along the Don River Tributary situated east of Avoca Avenue, west along Rosehill Avenue, south along the west side of the Rosehill Reservoir, west along Jackes Avenue, south along Yonge Street and west along the Canadian Pacific Railway to Ossington Avenue.\n\nIn the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]], St. Paul's lost territory to [[Don Valley West]], gained a small fraction from [[Davenport (electoral district)|Davenport]] and was renamed Toronto\u2014St. Paul's.\n\n=== Churches named for St Paul in the electoral district ===\n\nFrom its creation until 1966, the electoral district included two prominent churches named for [[St Paul]] the apostle: [[St. Paul's, Bloor Street]] at 227 Bloor Street East, which is the largest Anglican church in Toronto by [[seating capacity]]; and [[St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church]] at Avenue Road and Webster Avenue, which was the church of many of Toronto's [[elite]]. The electoral district ceased to include 227 Bloor Street East after a redefinition of the district's boundaries in 1966. In 1980, the congregation at St. Paul's-Avenue Road United Church moved to 427 Bloor Street West during a church merger creating [[Trinity-St. Paul's United Church]]. The electoral district ceased to include 427 Bloor Street West after a boundary redefinition in 1987. Therefore, Toronto\u2014St Paul's no longer contains a St Paul's.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\nThis riding has elected the following [[Member of Parliament|Members of

The organization's president is [[Franklin Graham]], son of Christian evangelist [[Billy Graham]]. The name of the organization is derived from the [[New Testament]] [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].\n\nSamaritan's Purse works in more than 100 countries. Their international headquarters are in [[Boone, North Carolina]], with additional U.S. facilities in [[Charlotte]] and [[North Wilkesboro, N.C.]] Affiliate offices are in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Hong Kong, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Field offices are also located in around 20 countries across five continents.\n\nThe organization has been criticized for requiring recipients of aid to participate in religious activities, for Graham's controversial statements, and for his compensation. {{citation needed}}\n\n== History ==\n[[Robert Pierce|Bob Pierce]] founded Samaritan's Purse in 1970 with a vision \"to meet emergency needs in crisis areas through existing evangelical mission agencies and national churches.\"  Pierce had previously founded [[World Vision]] in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Vision Our History|url=http://www.worldvision.org/about-us/our-history/|work=World Vision|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[Franklin Graham]] met Pierce in 1973, and they made several trips together to visit relief projects and missionary partners in Asia and elsewhere.
