As a singer, she placed 30 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart, was a [[Grand Ole Opry]] member and was nominated for several major awards. As a writer, she wrote poems and published an autobiography. Additionally, she was married to American country songwriter [[Harlan Howard]].\n\nHoward was mostly raised in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. The family moved to various homes during her childhood. Marrying in her teens, Howard and her husband relocated various times. This included [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]] and Missouri. She took several part-time jobs to support her growing family, which now included three children. Howard would divorce her first husband in 1953. She met and married her second husband the same year. Moving to his military base, the couple and her three children lived a suburban lifestyle. In 1955, Howard discovered that he was a [[bigamist]] and she resettled with her children in [[Los Angeles]], California. \n\nIn 1957, she met and married Harlan Howard. Early in their marriage, he discovered that she could sing. Impressed by her voice, Harlan arranged for her to record [[demo (music)|demonstration tapes]]. These tapes were heard by other country artists and led to her first recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Howard had her first major country hit in 1960 with \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\". As her husband's songwriting became more successful, Howard's recording career followed suit. She had her biggest success after signing with [[Decca Records]]. Howard had major hits with the singles \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\" (1966) and \"[[My Son (song)|My Son]]\" (1968). She also had several hits after teaming up with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], including the number 1 hit \"[[For Loving You]]\" (1967). The pair continued recording and touring together until the mid 1970s.\n\nBy 1973, two of Howard's children had died and she divorced Harlan Howard. In a depressive state, she nearly gave up her career. Upon the encouragement of other performers, she released several more albums and singles into the 1980s. At the same time, she began devoting time to other interests including writing. In 1987, Howard published her best-selling autobiography entitled ''Sunshine and Shadow''. She also started writing poems and short stories and remained active in other ways. This included making regular appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. She also worked with [[United States Military]] veterans through various programs. She donated to charities and spoke at fundraisers.\n\n==Early life==\n===1929\u20131945: Childhood and teenage years===\nJan Howard was born Lula Grace Johnson in [[West Plains, Missouri]], the daughter of Linnie and Rolla Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usobit.com/obituaries-2020/03/jan-howard-march-13-1929-march-28-2020/|title=Jan Howard March 13 1929 March 28 2020|publisher=United States Obituary Notice|accessdate=2020-03-29}}</ref> She was the eighth of 11 children.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Two of her siblings died before the age of two.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=6}} Howard's father was a [[bricklayer|brick mason]] who received employment assistance from the [[Works Progress Administration]] during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=4}} In her early childhood, the family moved frequently as her father found work and better housing. They lived in nearby towns such as [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Birch Tree, Missouri|Birch Tree]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} When she was eight years old, the family briefly returned to West Plains. After returning, Howard was [[raped]] by a family friend. In her 1987 autobiography, she commented on the experience: \"My body was violated and my mind was damaged in a way I wasn't to know the full extent of for years to come.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} She kept it a secret from her family for many years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nIn her childhood, she developed an interest in listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] radio broadcasts with her father. In 2003, she recalled memories of listening with her father, \"The first time I heard the Opry I was eight or nine years old. My dad used to tune it in on the radio on Saturday nights, but he only listened enough to hear [[Texas Ruby]]. She was his favorite.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} In 1943, Howard's mother temporarily separated from her father. To help support the family, Howard worked as a dishwasher in a local cafe. Because the cafe owner could not afford to pay her, he gave Howard's family food for weekly meals. At age 16, she took a new job at a drugstore called Model Drugs.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=36-38}} \n[[File:West Plains Washington Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A downtown view of [[West Plains, Missouri]], the hometown of Howard.]] \n\nIn 1945, she married Mearle Wood and subsequently dropped out of high school.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} Wood enrolled in the military soon after their marriage began. Finding military housing for his wife, Wood resettled the couple to [[Waynesville, Missouri]]. In their first home together, they shared a house with another military couple. She briefly returned to her parents' house after discovering Wood was engaging in an affair. However, when Wood was re-stationed in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], Howard reunited with him in his new location.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=54}}\n\n===1946\u20131957: Early adulthood===\nHoward gave birth to three sons between the late 1940s and early 1950s.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} The young family continued to move as Wood took on various jobs. Among the cities they lived in were [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas]] and [[Greeley, Colorado]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=66-68}} While in Greeley, the family's house caught on fire. According to Howard she woke to the smell of smoke in the middle of the night and saved her three children from the fumes. Wood was not present at the time of the incident.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=80}} Towards the end of their marriage, the family moved back to West Plains. Howard later revealed in 1987 that Wood was physically abusive, especially at the end of their marriage. During one incident, Wood held a butcher knife to Howard's throat, nearly killing her. The same day, Howard and her three sons fled to live with her siblings in Oklahoma.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} \"Until midnight, Mom and Daddy kept us hidden. Then, with as much money as we could spare, we boarded a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] for Oklahoma City,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=101}} In 1953, she divorced Wood.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nWhile living with her brother, Howard became acquainted with his friend, Lowell \"Smitty\" Smith. Smith was also an active member of the [[United States Military|military]]. Developing a romantic affection, the two married in 1953.<ref name=\"Popular Music\">{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=1992}}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Living with Smith and her three sons on a military base, the family lived a suburban lifestyle. Howard also got a part-time job in the \"tea room\" of the Morehouse Fashion Department Store. In 1954, she gave birth to a fourth child named Janet Louise Smith. The child had a series of medical problems and died shortly after being born.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=114-116}} In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience: \"They were closing the top of the incubator. The realization hit me. The baby was dead,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=115}}\n\nThe Smith family then moved to a base in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], where they rented a newly-built home. The couple bought furniture on credit to decorate the home.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=121}} During this time, she became pregnant again and eventually [[miscarriage|miscarried]] the child.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Shortly after the miscarriage, Smith was re-stationed in [[Panama]]. Howard arranged for their furniture to be sent to Panama while Smith moved there. Howard and her children were to meet him there within a few months after.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=127-28}} Shortly after Smith left, she discovered that he was still married to another woman. Upon realizing this, she ended the relationship and moved with her sons to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1955.<ref name=\"Popular Music\"/>\n\nHoward worked a series of part-time jobs upon moving to Los Angeles. For a short time, she worked as a cocktail waitress in a strip club. \"I must have had thirty jobs in the next thirty days,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=137}} After several months, she got a job as a secretary. She later recalled that the position was challenging because she could not \"type or take [[shorthand]]\". In 1957, she met aspiring country music songwriter [[Harlan Howard]]. The pair met through her friend's association with country artist [[Wynn Stewart]] (Stewart was also a friend of Harlan Howard's).{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Within a month of meeting, the couple were married on May 10, 1957 in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}}\n\n==Singing career==\n===1958\u20131963: Early success===\nAt home, Jan would often sing to herself while her husband was out working. Coming home early one day, Harlan heard her singing while she was washing dishes. \"I didn't know you could sing,\" Harlan said.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=227-28}} The same day, he accompanied Jan on guitar while she sang his composition \"Mommy for a Day\". Harlan realized he could use Jan's singing voice for [[demo (music)|demo]] records. The Howards recorded the song's demo in their bathroom in [[Gardena, California]]. The song was sent to a publisher in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] where it was recorded and made a hit by [[Kitty Wells]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=164-65}} Howard also sang the demos for \"Pick Me Up on Your Way Down\" and \"I Wish I Could Fall in Love Again\". Both songs were recorded by [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]]. Harlan brought Jan's demo tapes to Joe Johnson of [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]].

Go call your mother, then be prepared to work you ass off!'\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=321}} Howard also recalled Jimmy's nervousness as he prepared for Vietnam.

She had trouble eating and sleeping, taking pills on a regular basis to help her through the anxieties and grief. \"I was crying when I woke up, and crying when I went to sleep,\" she wrote in 1987. One morning, Howard made the decision to dispose of all her medicine and continue on with her life. \"As I walked into the den and saw the relief on Corky and David's faces, my efforts were worthwhile,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=360-61}}\n\nHoward's youngest son, David, began abusing [[substance abuse|drugs]] in the years following Jimmy's death.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\">{{cite news |last1=Edwardsd |first1=Joe |title=Personal Setbacks Make Her Stronger |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19810404&id=AWRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zegMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2414,1548685&hl=en |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |date=1981}}</ref> Prior to this, he had been employed at the ''[[Opryland USA]]'' theme park, where he appeared as an actor in several shows.

Howard got surgery completed at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles and within three weeks she was back to a normal routine.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=163}}\n\nHer trauma followed her into her marriage with Harlan Howard. While married, her weight dropped below 97 pounds and she would pace their home at night. This prompted Harlan to institutionalize Jan.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} In her autobiography, she recounted being brought into a hospital room with doctors and nurses. She recalled that she was screaming and shouting until a nurse gave her a shot which put her \"six feet under\". A doctor diagnosed her with having [[paroxysmal tachycardia]] and sent her home.

According to her psychiatrist, she developed a series of phobias from the traumatic experiences in her childhood.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=186-87}} After moving to Nashville, she continued having depressive episodes. One evening in 1962, she took a handful of sleeping pills and was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, her blood pressure dropped significantly low and was in critical condition.

'''Lula Grace Johnson'''; March 13, 1929 \u2013 March 28, 2020) was an American [[country music]] singer, songwriter, and author. As a singer, she placed 30 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country songs]] chart, was a [[Grand Ole Opry]] member and was nominated for several major awards. As a writer, she wrote poems and published an autobiography. Additionally, she was married to American country songwriter [[Harlan Howard]].\n\nHoward was mostly raised in [[West Plains, Missouri]]. The family moved to various homes during her childhood. Marrying in her teens, Howard and her husband relocated various times. This included [[Colorado]], [[Kansas]], [[Illinois]] and Missouri. She took several part-time jobs to support her growing family, which now included three children. Howard would divorce her first husband in 1953. She met and married her second husband the same year. Moving to his military base, the couple and her three children lived a suburban lifestyle. In 1955, Howard discovered that he was a [[bigamist]] and she resettled with her children in [[Los Angeles]], California. \n\nIn 1957, she met and married Harlan Howard. Early in their marriage, he discovered that she could sing. Impressed by her voice, Harlan arranged for her to record [[demo (music)|demonstration tapes]]. These tapes were heard by other country artists and led to her first recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Howard had her first major country hit in 1960 with \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\". As her husband's songwriting became more successful, Howard's recording career followed suit. She had her biggest success after signing with [[Decca Records]]. Howard had major hits with the singles \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\" (1966) and \"[[My Son (song)|My Son]]\" (1968). She also had several hits after teaming up with [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]], including the number 1 hit \"[[For Loving You]]\" (1967). The pair continued recording and touring together until the mid 1970s.\n\nBy 1973, two of Howard's children had died and she divorced Harlan Howard. In a depressive state, she nearly gave up her career. Upon the encouragement of other performers, she released several more albums and singles into the 1980s. At the same time, she began devoting time to other interests including writing. In 1987, Howard published her best-selling autobiography entitled ''Sunshine and Shadow''. She also started writing poems and short stories and remained active in other ways. This included making regular appearances on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. She also worked with [[United States Military]] veterans through various programs. She donated to charities and spoke at fundraisers.\n\n==Early life==\n===1929\u20131945: Childhood and teenage years===\nJan Howard was born Lula Grace Johnson in [[West Plains, Missouri]], the daughter of Linnie and Rolla Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usobit.com/obituaries-2020/03/jan-howard-march-13-1929-march-28-2020/|title=Jan Howard March 13 1929 March 28 2020|publisher=United States Obituary Notice|accessdate=2020-03-29}}</ref> She was the eighth of 11 children.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Two of her siblings died before the age of two.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=6}} Howard's father was a [[bricklayer|brick mason]] who received employment assistance from the [[Works Progress Administration]] during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=4}} In her early childhood, the family moved frequently as her father found work and better housing. They lived in nearby towns such as [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Birch Tree, Missouri|Birch Tree]] and [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} When she was eight years old, the family briefly returned to West Plains. After returning, Howard was [[raped]] by a family friend. In her 1987 autobiography, she commented on the experience: \"My body was violated and my mind was damaged in a way I wasn't to know the full extent of for years to come.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=3-11}} She kept it a secret from her family for many years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nIn her childhood, she developed an interest in listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] radio broadcasts with her father. In 2003, she recalled memories of listening with her father, \"The first time I heard the Opry I was eight or nine years old. My dad used to tune it in on the radio on Saturday nights, but he only listened enough to hear [[Texas Ruby]]. She was his favorite.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} In 1943, Howard's mother temporarily separated from her father. To help support the family, Howard worked as a dishwasher in a local cafe. Because the cafe owner could not afford to pay her, he gave Howard's family food for weekly meals. At age 16, she took a new job at a drugstore called Model Drugs.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=36-38}} \n[[File:West Plains Washington Avenue.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A downtown view of [[West Plains, Missouri]], the hometown of Howard.]] \n\nIn 1945, she married Mearle Wood and subsequently dropped out of high school.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} Wood enrolled in the military soon after their marriage began. Finding military housing for his wife, Wood resettled the couple to [[Waynesville, Missouri]]. In their first home together, they shared a house with another military couple. She briefly returned to her parents' house after discovering Wood was engaging in an affair. However, when Wood was re-stationed in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], Howard reunited with him in his new location.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=54}}\n\n===1946\u20131957: Early adulthood===\nHoward gave birth to three sons between the late 1940s and early 1950s.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} The young family continued to move as Wood took on various jobs. Among the cities they lived in were [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas]] and [[Greeley, Colorado]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=66-68}} While in Greeley, the family's house caught on fire. According to Howard she woke to the smell of smoke in the middle of the night and saved her three children from the fumes. Wood was not present at the time of the incident.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=80}} Towards the end of their marriage, the family moved back to West Plains. Howard later revealed in 1987 that Wood was physically abusive, especially at the end of their marriage. During one incident, Wood held a butcher knife to Howard's throat, nearly killing her. The same day, Howard and her three sons fled to live with her siblings in Oklahoma.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} \"Until midnight, Mom and Daddy kept us hidden. Then, with as much money as we could spare, we boarded a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] for Oklahoma City,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=101}} In 1953, she divorced Wood.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}}\n\nWhile living with her brother, Howard became acquainted with his friend, Lowell \"Smitty\" Smith. Smith was also an active member of the [[United States Military|military]]. Developing a romantic affection, the two married in 1953.<ref name=\"Popular Music\">{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Colin |title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music |date=1992}}</ref>{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Living with Smith and her three sons on a military base, the family lived a suburban lifestyle. Howard also got a part-time job in the \"tea room\" of the Morehouse Fashion Department Store. In 1954, she gave birth to a fourth child named Janet Louise Smith. The child had a series of medical problems and died shortly after being born.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=114-116}} In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience: \"They were closing the top of the incubator. The realization hit me. The baby was dead,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=115}}\n\nThe Smith family then moved to a base in [[Warrensburg, Missouri]], where they rented a newly-built home. The couple bought furniture on credit to decorate the home.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=121}} During this time, she became pregnant again and eventually [[miscarriage|miscarried]] the child.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Shortly after the miscarriage, Smith was re-stationed in [[Panama]]. Howard arranged for their furniture to be sent to Panama while Smith moved there. Howard and her children were to meet him there within a few months after.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=127-28}} Shortly after Smith left, she discovered that he was still married to another woman. Upon realizing this, she ended the relationship and moved with her sons to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1955.<ref name=\"Popular Music\"/>\n\nHoward worked a series of part-time jobs upon moving to Los Angeles. For a short time, she worked as a cocktail waitress in a strip club. \"I must have had thirty jobs in the next thirty days,\" Howard wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=137}} After several months, she got a job as a secretary. She later recalled that the position was challenging because she could not \"type or take [[shorthand]]\". In 1957, she met aspiring country music songwriter [[Harlan Howard]]. The pair met through her friend's association with country artist [[Wynn Stewart]] (Stewart was also a friend of Harlan Howard's).{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=227}} Within a month of meeting, the couple were married on May 10, 1957 in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}}\n\n==Singing career==\n===1958\u20131963: Early success===\nAt home, Jan would often sing to herself while her husband was out working. Coming home early one day, Harlan heard her singing while she was washing dishes. \"I didn't know you could sing,\" Harlan said.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=227-28}} The same day, he accompanied Jan on guitar while she sang his composition \"Mommy for a Day\". Harlan realized he could use Jan's singing voice for [[demo (music)|demo]] records. The Howards recorded the song's demo in their bathroom in [[Gardena, California]]. The song was sent to a publisher in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] where it was recorded and made a hit by [[Kitty Wells]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=164-65}} Howard also sang the demos for \"Pick Me Up on Your Way Down\" and \"I Wish I Could Fall in Love Again\". Both songs were recorded by [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]]. Harlan brought Jan's demo tapes to Joe Johnson of [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Johnson liked the songs however, Harlan would not let Johnson take them unless he signed Jan to the label. Johnson agreed and she officially signed with Challenge in 1958.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=166-67}}{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} After signing, the label changed her name from \"Lula Grace Howard\" to \"Jan Howard\".{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}}\n[[File:Jan Howard--Most Promising Female Vocalist.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Early publicity photo of Howard in an ad from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 1960.]]\n\nJan and Stewart's first recording, \"Yankee Go Home\", was released on Challenge Records in 1959.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\">{{cite web |last1=Brennan |first1=Sandra |title=Jan Howard: Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/jan-howard-mn0000214907 |website=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> The duo also released a second single together entitled \"Wrong Company\".

From interacting with other country artists at clubs, Jan was presented with performance opportunities of her own. Among her first engagements was singing on the regional television show ''[[Town Hall Party]]''. However, Jan had fears about performing. In her autobiography, Howard recalled the experience at the show. \"The band started 'Pick Me Up on Your Way Down' and someone pushed me onstage. After that, everything was a total blank...If I'd been given warning, I'd have been long gone.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=174-75}}\n\nThe success of \"Wrong Company\" prompted Joe Johnson to find Jan a solo release. Johnson chose the song \"[[The One You Slip Around With]]\", which was co-written by Harlan Howard and Fuzzy Owen. On the record, Jan also sang the third-part harmony.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=175}} Released in late 1959, the song became a major hit by February 1960, reaching number 13 on the ''Billboard'' country sides chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"The One You Slip Around With\" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/jan-howard/chart-history/CSI/song/837400 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> She recalled hearing the song on the radio for the first time: \"For once, I was proud of what I heard but it was as though I was listening to someone else, not me.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=175}} The song's success helped Howard receive the \"Most Promising Country Female\" award from ''Billboard'' and ''Jukebox Operators''.{{sfn|Trott, Walt|2012|p=250}} Also in 1960, the Howard family moved to Nashville where Jan regularly appeared on the \"Prince Albert\" segment of the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> Howard met several country artists while playing there regularly, notably [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|p=131}}\n\nThe Howards bought a four-bedroom home located in [[Madison, Tennessee|Madison]], a suburb of the city. Harlan converted the home's garage into a den where he could use it as songwriting space.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=189}} Still on Challenge Records, Jan continued to record demo material for her husband. Among the demos she performed on was \"[[I Fall to Pieces]]\", which Harlan composed with [[Hank Cochran]].{{sfn|Nassour, Ellis|1993|pp=132-40}} Jan liked the song so much that she wanted to record it for her own label. However, Harlan offered the track to Patsy Cline first. Cline's version became a hit.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=189-90}} When not recording demos or at her new home, Jan toured package shows with other country artists. Among the first tours she embarked on was in [[Florida]] alongside [[June Carter]], [[Skeeter Davis]], [[George Jones]], [[Buck Owens]] and [[Faron Young]].{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=189-99}}\n\nIn 1962, [[Capitol Records]] bought Jan's recording contract from Challenge.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=207}} According to Jan, her first Capitol sessions with an unnamed producer were \"a disaster\". Frustrated with the sessions, she called [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]] and asked him to record her instead. Nelson agreed and sent her to Los Angeles for their next session. At Capitol, it was suggested that she would be marketed as towards [[pop music|pop]] rather than country. This prompted Nelson to have her record a mix of pop standards and country covers.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=207}} From the sessions, Howard's debut studio album was released in 1962, ''[[Sweet and Sentimental]]''. The album featured covers of various songs, including her husband's \"[[He Called Me Baby]]\" and \"[[Heartaches by the Number]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Jan Howard with the Jordanaires - ''Sweet and Sentimental'' (1962, Vinyl) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Jan-Howard-With-The-Jordanaires-Sweet-And-Sentimental/release/7981669 |website=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> Although at Capitol for several years, Howard only had one charting single with the label: a cover of \"I Wish I Was a Single Girl Again\".

Finding herself touring frequently, she hired a housekeeper to take care of domestic needs.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=233}} Harlan also found a booking agent for her shows. He arranged for Hubert Long (owner of the \"Hubert Long Talent Agency\") to work with his wife. According to Jan, Long booked many dates because the Howard's owed the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] 20,000 dollars in back taxes.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=219-20}} At concerts, she was making an estimated amount of five to six hundred dollars a gig. At the same time, Harlan informed Jan that [[Owen Bradley]] of [[Decca Records]] was interested in signing her. She soon signed a recording contract with Bradley in 1964.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=249-50}} Her first Decca release was the single \"What Makes a Man Wander\".<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> It reached the top 25 of the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles]] chart in 1965.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"What Makes a Man Wander\" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/jan-howard/chart-history/CSI/song/837054 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> Bradley and Jan had trouble finding a quality single for her next release. They soon found a song written by Harlan called \"[[Evil on Your Mind]]\". Jan and Bradley liked the song and thought it could be a hit.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=259}} Released as a single in 1966, \"Evil on Your Mind\" reached number 5 on the ''Billboard'' country singles chart in July. \"Evil on Your Mind\" became the biggest solo hit of her career.<ref>{{cite web |title=\"Evil on Your Mind\" chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/jan-howard/chart-history/CSI/song/836323 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref> Since its release, it's been considered Jan's [[List of signature songs|signature song]].<ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=Ken |title=Country Music: Jan Howard Biography |url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/country-music/jan-howard-biography/ |website=[[PBS]] |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> Its success prompted Decca to issue her second studio album. In September 1966, ''[[Jan Howard Sings Evil on Your Mind]]'' peaked at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Jan Howard Sings Evil on Your Mind'' chart history |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/jan-howard/chart-history/CLP/song/831856 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe success of \"Evil on Your Mind\" also led to an increased demand for Howard's concert bookings. \"If I thought I'd been busy before, it was a vacation compared to now,\" Howard wrote. In 1966, she played a tour alongside other artists that ended at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in California. She also played a show in [[Detroit, Michigan]] that attracted roughly 24,000 people.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=259-61}} While not touring, Howard was in the recording studio.

The funeral of my girlhood,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=41-43}} Her second marriage to Lowell \"Smitty\" Smith lasted only two years after discovering that he was a [[bigamist]].{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} \n\nIn her third marriage to Harlan Howard, Jan's three children legally were adopted by him and took on his last name.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=215}} In the mid-1960s, the couple owned a publishing company in Nashville called \"Wilderness Music\". Together, they bought an older home, renovated it and turned it into a series of offices for the company.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=230}} Jan later commented that Harlan took control of the Wilderness when they divorced. According to Harlan, the company and its music were his \"brainchildren\". Upset about the situation, Jan said to her divorce lawyers, \"I don't want anything. Just the divorce.\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=291}} Following her divorce, she became closer to her divorce lawyer, Jack Norman. A licensed pilot, Norman took her on plane rides and also spent many nights at her home. The two became romantically involved while Norman was still married.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=305-09}} Their affair carried on into the mid 1970s.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=485}} In 1990, she remarried for a fourth time to Dr. Maurice Acree, Jr.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} Only married for a short period of time, Acree died in 2013, according to an obituary from ''[[The Tennessean]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Maurice Acree OBITUARY |url=https://obits.tennessean.com/obituaries/tennessean/obituary.aspx?n=maurice-m-acree&pid=164078081 |website=[[The Tennesseean]] |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Children===\nFrom her first marriage, Howard gave birth to three sons: Jimmy, Carter (Corky) and David.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|pp=227-29}} As a young child, Jimmy was hospitalized in critical condition with [[spinal meningitis]]. Within four weeks, he recovered from the illness.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=171-72}} During the Vietnam War in 1968, Jimmy was drafted into the military. Once he received his draft notice, Carter volunteered for the army. \"If Jimmy's going, I'm going,\" he said to Howard.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=321}} After being sent to basic training, the military was supposed to let Jimmy come home, but they refused. Upset about the situation, Howard discussed the situation with her friend and country DJ, [[Ralph Emery]]. Through the assistance of Emery, Howard got in contact with [[Richard Fulton|Congressman Richard Fulton]]. Emery found Fulton at a restaurant at nine o'clock the same night when he contacted him. It was Fulton who got permission from the military to send Jimmy home for 21 days. In her autobiography, Howard recounted the phone call she received from Jimmy the day he came home, \"Mom! What did you do? The Secretary of the Army himself called down here! My sergeant came and got me and said, 'Howard! Go call your mother, then be prepared to work you ass off!'\"{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=321}} Howard also recalled Jimmy's nervousness as he prepared for Vietnam. The evening before his departure, he sat at her bedside explaining his nervousness and anxieties. The next evening, he flew out at three o'clock in the morning.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=339}} \n{{quote box\n |quote  = The world was black. I prayed for death.

Realizing the reasons for them being there, she began screaming and crying. Howard remembered the days following Jimmy's death in her autobiography. She recalled going through the days and weeks by \"forcing\" herself to keep going. She had trouble eating and sleeping, taking pills on a regular basis to help her through the anxieties and grief. \"I was crying when I woke up, and crying when I went to sleep,\" she wrote in 1987. One morning, Howard made the decision to dispose of all her medicine and continue on with her life. \"As I walked into the den and saw the relief on Corky and David's faces, my efforts were worthwhile,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=360-61}}\n\nHoward's youngest son, David, began abusing [[substance abuse|drugs]] in the years following Jimmy's death.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\">{{cite news |last1=Edwardsd |first1=Joe |title=Personal Setbacks Make Her Stronger |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19810404&id=AWRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zegMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2414,1548685&hl=en |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |date=1981}}</ref> Prior to this, he had been employed at the ''[[Opryland USA]]'' theme park, where he appeared as an actor in several shows. This included a major role in the cast of the play ''[[I Hear America Singing]]''.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=412-13}} Howard then began noticing changes in his behavior, including coming home late at night and having symptoms of [[depression (mood)|depression]]. When she would ask David he would reply by saying that he was \"just tired.\" She also noticed that he began associating with people who provided David with substances.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=432}} She eventually had him see a [[psychiatrist]] for his personal setbacks, but only found out that he was using the time for other reasons.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=435}} One morning in 1972, Howard found David in his bedroom dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She recalled that the next several days were a \"blur\". Devastated by her son's suicide, she stayed in bed for days at a time. After many weeks of grieving, Howard cleaned out his room and sold his [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. \"When everything was done, I took one last look around, walked out, and closed the door on the past. But it would never be locked,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=461-67}}\n\nIn the years following David's and Jimmy's deaths, Howard's middle son Carter began working with military veterans. He also owned his own business and became a real estate broker in Nashville.<ref name=\"Gazette 2\"/>\n\n===Other personal challenges===\nThe psychological trauma of Howard's childhood affected her as she entered her adult years.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} After giving birth to her third child, she would cry uncontrollably. \"There were many times my heart would pound so hard I thought it would pop out of my chest,\" Howard commented. Howard's sister took her to see a doctor who explained that she was having a \"[[nervous breakdown]]\". To calm her anxieties, he prescribed Howard a strong pharmaceutical drug that she was told take four times per day.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=86}} In the early 1960s, she was rushed to the hospital after experiencing intense bleeding. Doctors told her that after giving birth to a stillborn baby and a previous operation, Howard had a strong possibility of developing [[cancer]] if she did not have her [[uterus]] removed. Howard got surgery completed at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] in Los Angeles and within three weeks she was back to a normal routine.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=163}}\n\nHer trauma followed her into her marriage with Harlan Howard. While married, her weight dropped below 97 pounds and she would pace their home at night. This prompted Harlan to institutionalize Jan.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=228}} In her autobiography, she recounted being brought into a hospital room with doctors and nurses. She recalled that she was screaming and shouting until a nurse gave her a shot which put her \"six feet under\". A doctor diagnosed her with having [[paroxysmal tachycardia]] and sent her home. He also ordered her to seek [[therapy|counseling]] services from a psychiatrist. According to her psychiatrist, she developed a series of phobias from the traumatic experiences in her childhood.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|pp=186-87}} After moving to Nashville, she continued having depressive episodes. One evening in 1962, she took a handful of sleeping pills and was rushed to the hospital. While at the hospital, her blood pressure dropped significantly low and was in critical condition. When she awoke, she recalled seeing [[Maybelle Carter|Mother Maybelle Carter]] feeding her. \"Little by little I felt stronger and knew, thank God, that I was going to live,\" she wrote.{{sfn|Howard, Jan|1987|p=227}}\n\nYears later, Howard reflected on her life experiences: \"One thing I want to make clear is that I'm not a martyr. I can't stand self-pity. I don't deserve and don't want any kind of pity...There are a lot of people who have gone through worse things than I have.\"{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=229}}\n\nHoward died on March 28, 2020, fifteen days after her 91st birthday, in [[Gallatin, Tennessee]]. \"We were all so lucky so many nights to hear her voice on stage and to catch up with her backstage. We\u2019re all better for having had her in our lives,\" said Dan Rogers, Vice President of the Grand Ole Opry.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paulson |first1=Dave |title=Jan Howard, Opry member and country
