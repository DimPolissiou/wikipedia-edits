When Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] expelled Abu Nidal to Syria at the US's request in November 1983, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] sent [[Donald Rumsfeld]] to meet Saddam as a special envoy and to cultivate ties. By the time the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#1987\u201388: Towards a ceasefire|ceasefire with Iran]] was signed in August 1988, Iraq was heavily debt-ridden and tensions within society were rising.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 333.</ref> Most of its debt was owed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Iraq pressured both nations to forgive the debts, but they refused.<ref>Simons (2003). pp. 341\u2013342.</ref>\n\n[[File:Saddam rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|[[Donald Rumsfeld]], US special envoy to the Middle East, meets [[Saddam Hussein]] on 19\u201320 December 1983.]]\n\nThe Iraq\u2013Kuwait dispute also involved Iraqi claims to Kuwait as Iraqi territory.<ref name=\"stork\" /> Kuwait had been a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s [[Basra Vilayet|province of Basra]], something that Iraq claimed made it rightful Iraqi territory.<ref name=\"simons343344\">Simons (2003). pp. 343\u2013344.</ref> Its ruling dynasty, the [[House of Sabah|al-Sabah family]], had concluded a [[protectorate]] agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for its foreign affairs to the United Kingdom. The UK drew the border between the two countries in 1922, making Iraq virtually landlocked.<ref name=\"stork\" /> Kuwait rejected Iraqi attempts to secure further provisions in the region.<ref name=\"simons343344\" />\n\nIraq also accused Kuwait of exceeding its [[OPEC]] quotas for oil production. In order for the cartel to maintain its desired price of $18 a barrel, discipline was required. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were consistently overproducing; the latter at least in part to repair losses caused by Iranian attacks in the Iran\u2013Iraq War and to pay for the losses of an economic scandal. The result was a slump in the oil price{{snd}}as low as $10 a barrel{{snd}}with a resulting loss of $7 billion a year to Iraq, equal to its 1989 [[balance of payments]] deficit.<ref>Simons (2003). pp. 339\u2013340.</ref> Resulting revenues struggled to support the government's basic costs, let alone repair Iraq's damaged infrastructure. [[Jordan]] and Iraq both looked for more discipline, with little success.<ref name=\"simons341\">Simons (2003). p. 341.</ref> The Iraqi government described it as a form of economic warfare,<ref name=\"simons341\" /> which it claimed was aggravated by Kuwait [[Directional drilling|slant-drilling]] across the border into Iraq's [[Rumaila oil field]].<ref>Cleveland, William L. ''A History of the Modern Middle East. 2nd Ed'' pg. 464</ref> At the same time, Saddam looked for closer ties with those Arab states that had supported Iraq in the war. This move was supported by the US, who believed that Iraqi ties with pro-Western Gulf states would help bring and maintain Iraq inside the US' sphere of influence.<ref name=\"Simons334\">Simons (2003). p. 334.</ref>\n\nIn 1989, it appeared that [[Iraq\u2013Saudi Arabia relations|Saudi\u2013Iraqi relations]], strong during the war, would be maintained. A pact of non-interference and non-aggression was signed between the countries, followed by a Kuwaiti-Iraqi deal for Iraq to supply Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation, although a request for Kuwait to lease Iraq [[Umm Qasr]] was rejected.<ref name=\"Simons334\" /> Saudi-backed development projects were hampered by Iraq's large debts, even with the [[demobilization]] of 200,000 soldiers. Iraq also looked to increase arms production so as to become an exporter, although the success of these projects was also restrained by Iraq's obligations; in Iraq, resentment to OPEC's controls mounted.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 335.</ref>\n\nIraq's relations with its Arab neighbors{{snd}}in particular Egypt{{snd}}were degraded by mounting violence in Iraq against expatriate groups, who were well-employed during the war, by unemployed Iraqis, among them demobilized soldiers. These events drew little notice outside the Arab world because of fast-moving events directly related to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. However, the US did begin to condemn Iraq's human rights record, including the well-known use of torture.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 336.</ref> The UK also condemned the execution of [[Farzad Bazoft]], a journalist working for the British newspaper ''[[Observer (newspaper)|The Observer]]''.<ref name=\"stork\" /> Following Saddam's declaration that \"binary chemical weapons\" would be used on Israel if it used military force against Iraq, Washington halted part of its funding.<ref>Simons (2003). pp. 337\u2013338.</ref> A UN mission to the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], where riots had resulted in Palestinian deaths, was [[veto]]ed by the US, making Iraq deeply skeptical of US foreign policy aims in the region, combined with the reliance of the US on Middle Eastern energy reserves.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 338.</ref>\n\nIn early July 1990, Iraq complained about Kuwait's behavior, such as not respecting their quota, and openly threatened to take military action. On the 23rd, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reported that Iraq had moved 30,000 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait border, and the US naval fleet in the Persian Gulf was placed on alert.

The Iran\u2013Iraq war had been going on for five years by that time and there were significant casualties on both sides, reaching into the hundreds of thousands. Within President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents. A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]], to review US options. It was determined that there was a high likelihood that the conflict would spread into Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region. Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy, which was just beginning to gain momentum. On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the [[Oval Office]] by [[William Flynn Martin]] who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study.

The plan was approved by President Reagan and later affirmed by the G-7 leaders headed by the United Kingdom's Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], in the [[10th G7 summit|London Summit of 1984]]. The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.\n\nWithin hours of the invasion, Kuwait and US delegations requested a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 660|Resolution 660]], condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops.<ref>Finlan (2003). p. 29.<!--Is it page 29 or 13?--></ref><ref name=UN>{{cite book|title=Report of the Security Council: 16 June 1990{{snd}}15 June 1991|date=1993|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|issn=0082-8238|page=30|type=digital document}}</ref> On 3 August 1990, the [[Arab League]] passed its own resolution, which called for a solution to the conflict from within the league, and warned against outside intervention.

Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, would have given Saddam control over the majority of the world's oil reserves. Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran. The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of [[Shia]] Iran's [[Islamic revolution]] on its own Shia minority. After the war, Saddam felt he should not have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran.\n\nSoon after his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam began verbally attacking the Saudis. He argued that the US-supported Saudi state was an illegitimate and unworthy guardian of the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. He combined the language of the [[Islamist]] groups that had recently fought in Afghanistan with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis.<ref>[[Gilles Kepel]] ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam.''</ref>\n[[File:Stinger Crew Operation Desert Shield.jpg|thumb|left|US Army soldiers from the [[11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (United States)|11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade]] during the Gulf War]]\n\nActing on the [[Carter Doctrine]] policy, and out of fear the Iraqi Army could launch an invasion of Saudi Arabia, US President George H. W. Bush quickly announced that the US would launch a \"wholly defensive\" mission to prevent Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia, under the codename Operation Desert Shield. The operation began on 7 August 1990, when US troops were sent to Saudi Arabia, due also to the request of its monarch, [[King Fahd]], who had earlier called for US military assistance.<ref name=\"AFPS Timeline\">{{cite web|title=The Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm Timeline |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Aug2000/n08082000_20008088.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526135240/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=45404 |archivedate=26 May 2008 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> This \"wholly defensive\" doctrine was quickly abandoned when, on 8 August, Iraq declared Kuwait to be Iraq's 19th province and Saddam named his cousin, Ali Hassan Al-Majid, as its military-governor.<ref name=AFPS15years>{{cite web|title=15 Years After Desert Storm, U.S. Commitment to Region Continues |url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=14792 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608084842/http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=14792|archivedate=2011-06-08|accessdate=29 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Navy|US Navy]] dispatched two naval battle groups built around the [[aircraft carriers]] [[USS Dwight D.

The US also sent the battleships [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] and [[USS Wisconsin (BB-64)|USS ''Wisconsin'']] to the region. A total of 48 US Air Force F-15s from the [[1st Fighter Wing]] at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia, landed in Saudi Arabia and immediately commenced round-the-clock air patrols of the Saudi\u2013Kuwait\u2013Iraq border to discourage further Iraqi military advances. They were joined by 36 F-15 A-Ds from the [[36th Wing|36th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Bitburg, Germany]]. The Bitburg contingent was based at [[Al Kharj Air Base]], approximately an hour south east of Riyadh. The 36th TFW would be responsible for 11 confirmed Iraqi Air Force aircraft shot down during the war. There were also two Air National Guard units stationed at Al Kharj Air Base, the [[South Carolina Air National Guard]]'s 169th Fighter Wing flew bombing missions with 24 F-16s flying 2,000 combat missions and dropping {{convert|4,000,000|lb|kg t|spell=in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of munitions, and the [[New York Air National Guard]]'s 174th Fighter Wing from [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] flew 24 F-16s on bombing missions. Military buildup continued from there, eventually reaching 543,000 troops, twice the number used in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

The first stop was Saudi Arabia, which a month before had already granted permission to the United States to use its facilities. However, Baker believed that Saudi Arabia, an immensely wealthy nation, should assume some of the cost of the military efforts, since one of the most important military objectives was to defend Saudi Arabia. When Baker asked King Fahd for 15 billion dollars, the King readily agreed, with the promise that Baker ask Kuwait for the same amount.\n\nThe next day, 7 September, he did just that, and the [[Emir of Kuwait]], displaced in a Sheraton hotel outside his invaded country, easily agreed. Baker then moved to enter talks with Egypt, whose leadership he considered to be \"the moderate voice of the Middle East\". President Mubarak of Egypt was furious with Saddam for his invasion of Kuwait, and for the fact that Saddam had assured Mubarak that an invasion was not his intention. Egypt received approximately $7 billion in debt forgiveness for its providing of support and troops for the US-led intervention.<ref>New York Times, 10 Apr. 1991, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/10/business/egypt-s-reward-forgiven-debt.html Egypt's 'Reward': Forgiven Debt]</ref>\n\nAfter stops in Helsinki and Moscow to smooth out Iraqi demands for a Middle-Eastern peace conference with the [[Soviet Union]], Baker traveled to Syria to discuss its role in the crisis with its President [[Hafez al-Assad|Hafez Assad]]. Assad had a deep personal enmity towards Saddam, which was defined by the fact that \"Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years.\" Harboring this animosity and being impressed with Baker's diplomatic initiative to visit Damascus (relations had been severed since the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|1983 bombing of US Marine barracks]] in [[Beirut]]), Assad agreed to pledge up to 100,000 Syrian troops to the coalition effort. This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition. In exchange, Washington gave Syrian dictator President [[Hafez al-Assad]] the green light to wipe out forces in opposition to Syria's rule in [[Lebanon]] and arranged for weapons valued at a billion dollars to be provided to Syria, mostly through Gulf states.<ref name=\"newstatesman.com\">''[[New Statesman]]'', 23 September 2002, \"[https://www.newstatesman.com/node/192550 John Pilger Reveals How the Bushes Bribe the World, from Russia to Iran]\"</ref> In exchange for Iran's support for the US-led intervention, the US government promised the Iranian government to end US opposition to [[World Bank]] loans to Iran.

Although [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's constitution]] (which was brokered essentially by the United States) prohibited military involvement in outside nations, Kohl committed a two billion dollar contribution to the coalition's war effort, as well as further economic and military support of coalition ally Turkey, and the transportation of Egyptian soldiers and ships to the Persian Gulf.<ref>Baker, James Addison, and Thomas M.

Some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair or did not want to increase US influence in the Middle East. In the end, however, many nations were persuaded by Iraq's belligerence towards other Arab states, offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness, and threats to withhold aid.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/31/AR2006103101217.html |title=Security Council Seat Tied to Aid |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=18 March 2010 |first=Colum |last=Lynch |date=1 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Justification for intervention====\n[[File:Cheney meeting with Prince Sultan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dick Cheney]] meets with [[Sultan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Prince Sultan, Minister of Defence and Aviation]] in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to handle the [[invasion of Kuwait]].]]\n\nThe US and the UN gave several public justifications for involvement in the conflict, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity.

About a third of the coalition's air power was devoted to attacking Scuds, some of which were on trucks and therefore difficult to locate. US and British [[special forces|special operations forces]] had been covertly inserted into western Iraq to aid in the search for and destruction of Scuds.\n\nIraqi anti-aircraft defenses, including [[man-portable air-defense systems]], were surprisingly ineffective against enemy aircraft, and the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, 44 due to Iraqi action.

On the ground, special operations forces also infiltrated Iraq, tasked with locating and destroying Scuds. Once special operations were combined with air patrols, the number of attacks fell sharply, then increased slightly as Iraqi forces adjusted to coalition tactics.\n\nAs the Scud attacks continued, the Israelis grew increasingly impatient, and considered taking unilateral military action against Iraq.

Eleven Americans were killed in two separate [[friendly fire]] incidents, an additional 14 US airmen were killed when their [[AC-130]] gunship was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile, and two US soldiers were captured during the battle. Saudi and Qatari forces had a total of 18 dead. Iraqi forces in Khafji had 60\u2013300 dead and 400 captured.\n\nThe Battle of Khafji was an example of how air power could single-handedly hinder the advance of enemy ground forces. Upon learning of Iraqi troop movements, 140 coalition aircraft were diverted to attack an advancing column consisting of two armored divisions in battalion-sized units. Precision stand-off attacks were conducted during the night and through to the next day. Iraqi vehicle losses included 357 tanks, 147 armored personnel carriers, and 89 mobile artillery pieces. Some crews simply abandoned their vehicles upon realizing that they could be destroyed by guided bombs without warning, stopping the divisions from massing for an organized attack on the town.

On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City. They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields. However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours. Several tank battles took place, but otherwise coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered. The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering. However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft. Meanwhile, forces from Arab states advanced into Kuwait from the east, encountering little resistance and suffering few casualties.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nDespite the successes of coalition forces, it was feared that the Iraqi Republican Guard would escape into Iraq before it could be destroyed. It was decided to send British armored forces into Kuwait 15 hours ahead of schedule, and to send US forces after the Republican Guard. The coalition advance was preceded by a heavy artillery and rocket barrage, after which 150,000 troops and 1,500 tanks began their advance. Iraqi forces in Kuwait counterattacked against US troops, acting on a direct order from Saddam Hussein himself. Despite the intense combat, the Americans repulsed the Iraqis and continued to advance towards Kuwait City.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nKuwaiti forces were tasked with liberating the city. Iraqi troops offered only light resistance. The Kuwaitis quickly liberated the city despite losing one soldier and having one plane shot down. On 27 February, Saddam ordered a retreat from Kuwait, and President Bush declared it liberated. However, an Iraqi unit at [[Kuwait International Airport]] appeared not to have received the message and fiercely resisted. US Marines had to fight for hours before securing the airport, after which Kuwait was declared secure. After four days of fighting, Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait. As part of a [[scorched earth]] policy, they [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set fire to nearly 700 oil wells]] and placed land mines around the wells to make extinguishing the fires more difficult.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Initial moves into Iraq===\n[[File:RemnantsofLAV25.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Destroyed LAV-25]]\n\nThe war's ground phase was officially designated Operation Desert Saber.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_sabre.htm |title=Operation Desert Sabre / Gulf War Ground Campaign |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref> The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British [[Special Air Service]]'s B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, [[Bravo Two Zero]], and Bravo Three Zero, in late January.

It was a feint attack, designed to make the Iraqis think that a coalition invasion would take place from the south. The Iraqis fiercely resisted, and the Americans eventually withdrew as planned back into the Wadi Al-Batin. Three US soldiers were killed and nine wounded, with one M2 Bradley IFV turret destroyed, but they had taken 40 prisoners and destroyed five tanks, and successfully deceived the Iraqis. This attack led the way for the XVIII Airborne Corps to sweep around behind the 1st Cav and attack Iraqi forces to the west. On 22 February 1991, Iraq agreed to a Soviet-proposed ceasefire agreement. The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre-invasion positions within six weeks following a total ceasefire, and called for monitoring of the ceasefire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council.\n\nThe coalition rejected the proposal, but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked,{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} and gave 24 hours for Iraq to withdraw its forces. On 23 February, fighting resulted in the capture of 500 Iraqi soldiers.

The [[101st Airborne Division]] conducted a combat air assault into enemy territory.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The 101st Airborne Division had struck {{convert|155|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} behind enemy lines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> It was the deepest air assault operation in history.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Approximately 400 helicopters transported 2,000 soldiers into Iraq where they destroyed Iraqi columns trying to flee westward and prevented the escape of Iraqi forces.<ref>''Screaming Eagles: The 101st Airborne Division from D-Day to Desert Storm'' by Christopher J Anderson P.8</ref> The 101st Airborne Division travelled a further {{convert|50|to|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=on}} into Iraq.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> By nightfall, the 101st cut off Highway 8 which was a vital supply line running between Basra and the Iraqi forces.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The 101st had lost 16 soldiers in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war.\n\nThe French force quickly overcame Iraq's 45th Infantry Division, suffering light casualties and taking a large number of prisoners, and took up blocking positions to prevent an Iraqi counterattack on the coalition's flank. The movement's right flank was protected by the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom's 1st Armoured Division]]. Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape. The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug-in positions and stationary vehicles, and even mounted armored charges.\n\nUnlike many previous engagements, the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender. The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles, while US casualties were comparatively low, with a single Bradley knocked out. Coalition forces pressed another 10&nbsp;km into Iraqi territory, and captured their objective within three hours. They took 500 prisoners and inflicted heavy losses, defeating Iraq's 26th Infantry Division. A US soldier was killed by an Iraqi land mine, another five by friendly fire, and 30 wounded during the battle. Meanwhile, British forces attacked Iraq's Medina Division and a major Republican Guard logistics base. In nearly two days of some of the war's most intense fighting, the British destroyed 40 enemy tanks and captured a division commander.\n\nMeanwhile, US forces attacked the village of [[Muthanna Governorate|Al Busayyah]], meeting fierce resistance. The US force destroyed a considerable amount of military hardware and took prisoners, while suffering no casualties.\n\nOn 25 February 1991, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at an American barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The missile attack killed 28 US military personnel.<ref>''Twentieth Century Battlefields'', \"The Gulf War\".</ref>\n\nThe coalition's advance was much swifter than US generals had expected. On 26 February, Iraqi troops began retreating from Kuwait, after they had set 737 of its oil wells on fire. A long convoy of retreating Iraqi troops formed along the main Iraq\u2013Kuwait highway. Although they were retreating, this convoy was bombed so extensively by coalition air forces that it came to be known as the [[Highway of Death]]. Thousands of Iraqi troops were killed. American, British, and French forces continued to pursue retreating Iraqi forces over the border and back into Iraq, eventually moving to within {{convert|150|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} of Baghdad, before withdrawing back to Iraq's border with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\"Holsti2011\">{{cite book|last=Holsti|first=Ole R.|author-link=Ole R.

At the conference, Iraq was authorized to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure. Soon after, these helicopters and much of Iraq's military were used to fight an [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|uprising in the south]]. The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of \"The Voice of Free Iraq\" on 2 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia. The Arabic service of the Voice of America supported the uprising by stating that the rebellion was well supported, and that they soon would be liberated from Saddam.<ref>[[Robert Fisk|Fisk, Robert]]. ''[[Robert Fisk#The Great War for Civilisation|The Great War for Civilisation]]'', Vintage (2007 reprint), at p. 646.</ref>\n\nIn the North, Kurdish leaders took American statements that they would support an uprising to heart, and began fighting, hoping to trigger a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]]. However, when no US support came, Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|Kurdish uprising]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and Kurdish areas of Iran. These events later resulted in [[no-fly zone]]s being established in northern and southern Iraq. In Kuwait, the Emir was restored, and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed. Eventually, over 400,000 people were expelled from the country, including a large number of [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], because of [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] support of Saddam. Yasser Arafat didn't apologize for his support of Iraq, but after his death, the Fatah under [[Mahmoud Abbas]]' authority formally apologized in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4089961.stm |work=BBC News |title=Abbas apology to Kuwait over Iraq |date=12 December 2004}}</ref>\n\nThere was some criticism of the Bush administration, as they chose to allow Saddam to remain in power instead of pushing on to capture Baghdad and overthrowing his government. In their co-written 1998 book, ''[[A World Transformed]]'', Bush and [[Brent Scowcroft]] argued that such a course would have fractured the alliance, and would have had many unnecessary political and human costs associated with it.\n\nIn 1992, the US Defense Secretary during the war, Dick Cheney, made the same point:\n\n{{quote|I would guess if we had gone in there, we would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home.\n\nAnd the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties. I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.\n\nAnd the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam [Hussein] worth? And the answer is, not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/192908_cheney29.html|title=\"Cheney changed his view on Iraq\", by Charles Pope, ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 29 September 2004|date=28 September 2004|accessdate=7 January 2005}}</ref>}}\n\nOn 10 March 1991, 540,000 US troops began moving out of the Persian Gulf.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nOn 15 March 1991, the US-led coalition restored to power [[Sheikh]] [[Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah]], the unelected authoritarian ruler of Kuwait.

The Australian Task Force was also placed at great risk with regard to the sea mine threat, with HMAS ''Brisbane'' narrowly avoiding a mine.

When the air war began, the CF-18s were integrated into the coalition force and were tasked with providing air cover and attacking ground targets. This was the first time since the [[Korean War]] that Canada's military had participated in offensive combat operations.

Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects. Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war. Researchers have said that they did not have enough information to link birth defects with exposure to toxic substances.<ref>{{cite document|title=Gulf war syndrome; higher rates of specific birth defects in gulf war veterans' children|year=2003|work=Medical Letter on the CDC & FDA, 14 |id={{ProQuest|211397084}}}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs with Respect to Export Administration published a report entitled, \"U.S. Chemical and Biological Warfare-Related Dual Use Exports to Iraq and their Possible Impact on the Health Consequences of the Gulf War\".  This publication, called the [[Riegle Report]], summarized testimony this committee had received establishing that the US had in the 1980s supplied Saddam Hussein with chemical and biological warfare technology, that Hussein had used such chemical weapons against Iran and his own native Kurds, and possibly against US soldiers as well, plausibly contributing to the [[Gulf War Syndrome]].\n\n===Effects of depleted uranium===\n{{Main|Depleted uranium#Health considerations}}\n[[File:GWI DU map.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Approximate area and major clashes in which DU rounds were used]]\n\nThe US military used [[depleted uranium]] in tank kinetic energy penetrators and 20\u201330&nbsp;mm cannon [[Ammunition|ordnance]].

Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of major health issues in veterans and in surrounding civilian populations, including in birth defects and child cancer rates.

By 2000, [[United Nations Environment Programme]] estimated that 90% of the marshlands had disappeared, causing [[desertification]] of over {{convert|7500|sqmi|km2}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe draining of the Qurna Marshes also called The '''Draining of the Mesopotamian Marshes''' occurred in Iraq and to a smaller degree in Iran between the 1950s and 1990s to clear large areas of the marshes in the [[Tigris-Euphrates river system]]. Formerly covering an area of around 20,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (7,700 sq mi), the large complex of wetlands was 90% drained prior to the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq]]. The marshes are typically divided into three main sub-marshes, the [[Hawizeh Marshes|Hawizeh]], Central, and [[Hammar Marshes]] and all three were drained at different times for different reasons. Initial draining of the Central Marshes was intended to reclaim land for agriculture but later all three marshes would become a tool of war and revenge.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMany international organizations such as the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|UN Human Rights Commission]], the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq]], the [[Wetlands International]], and Middle East Watch have described the project as a political attempt to force the [[Marsh Arabs]] out of the area through water diversion tactics.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/ted/marsh.htm |title=Marsh Arabs |accessdate=1 August 2010 |publisher=[[American University School of International Service]] |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627142037/http://www1.american.edu/ted/marsh.htm |archivedate=27 June 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Oil spill===\n{{Main|Gulf War oil spill}}\nOn 23 January, Iraq dumped {{convert|400|e6USgal|m3}} of [[crude oil]] into the Persian Gulf,{{#tag:Ref|Note: The cited supporting source<ref name=dukemag030403 /> uses the term ''Arabian Gulf'' to name this body of water.

The fires started in January and February 1991, and the last one was extinguished by November.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021028200910/http://earthshots.usgs.gov/Iraq/Iraqtext|archivedate=2002-10-28|title=\"Iraq and Kuwait: 1972, 1990, 1991, 1997.\" Earthshots: Satellite Images of Environmental Change|last=Wellman|first=Robert Campbell|date=14 February 1999|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe resulting fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews. [[Land mines]] had been placed in areas around the oil wells, and a military cleaning of the areas was necessary before the fires could be put out. Somewhere around {{convert|6|Moilbbl|m3|-4}} of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait.<ref>{{cite book|last=Husain |first=T. |title=Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives |year=1995 |publisher=BPC Wheatons Ltd |location=Oxford |page=68}}</ref> By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately 10 months, causing widespread pollution.\n\n==Cost==\nThe cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the US Congress in April 1992 to be $61.1 billion<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~fhoran/gulf/GW_cost/GW_payments.html |title=How much did the Gulf War cost the US? |publisher=People.psych.cornell.edu |date=20 May 1997 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821200403/http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~fhoran/gulf/GW_cost/GW_payments.html |archivedate=21 August 2010}}</ref> (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|61100000000|1992}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}).{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}} About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions). About 25% of Saudi Arabia's contribution was paid in the form of in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> US troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher.\n\n===Effect on developing countries===\nApart from the impact on [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many states. The [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response. A briefing paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended draws on their findings which had two main conclusions: Many developing states were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis, the distribution of assistance was highly selective.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\">{{cite web|title=The Impact of the Gulf Crisis on Developing Countries|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5466&title=gulf-crisis-impact-ldcs|work=ODI Briefing Paper|date=March 1991|accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ODI factored in elements of \"cost\" which included oil imports, remittance flows, re-settlement costs, loss of export earnings and tourism. For Egypt, the cost totaled $1 billion, 3% of GDP. Yemen had a cost of $830 million, 10% of GDP, while it cost Jordan $1.8 billion, 32% of GDP.\n\nInternational response to the crisis on developing states came with the channeling of aid through The Gulf Crisis Financial Co-ordination Group. They were 24 states, comprising most of the OECD countries plus some Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. The members of this group agreed to disperse $14 billion in development assistance.\n\nThe [[World Bank]] responded by speeding up the disbursement of existing project and adjustment loans. The [[International Monetary Fund]] adopted two lending facilities{{snd}}the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Compensatory & Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF). The European Community offered $2 billion{{clarify|date=August 2011}} in assistance.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\" />\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{Main|Media coverage of the Gulf War}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}\nThe war was heavily [[television|televised]]. For the first time, people all over the world were able to watch live pictures of [[missile]]s hitting their targets and fighters departing from aircraft carriers. Allied forces were keen to demonstrate their weapons' accuracy.\n\nIn the United States, the \"big three\" network anchors led the war's [[News broadcasting|network news]] coverage: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Peter Jennings]], [[CBS]]'s [[Dan Rather]], and [[NBC]]'s [[Tom Brokaw]] were anchoring their evening newscasts when air strikes began on 16 January 1991. [[ABC News]] correspondent Gary Shepard, reporting live from Baghdad, told Jennings of the city's quietness. But, moments later, Shepard was back on the air as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground.\n\nOn CBS, viewers were watching a report from correspondent Allen Pizzey, who was also reporting from Baghdad, when the war began. Rather, after the report was finished, announced that there were unconfirmed reports of flashes in Baghdad and heavy [[air traffic]] at bases in Saudi Arabia. On the NBC Nightly News, correspondent [[Mike Boettcher]] reported unusual air activity in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Moments later, Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun.\n\nStill, it was [[CNN]] whose coverage gained the most popularity and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the network's history, ultimately leading to the establishment of [[CNN International]]. CNN correspondents [[John Holliman]] and [[Peter Arnett]] and CNN anchor [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] relayed audio reports from Baghdad's [[Rixos Al Rasheed Baghdad Hotel|Al-Rashid Hotel]] as the air strikes began. The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau. When the telephones of all of the other Western TV correspondents went dead during the bombing, CNN was the only service able to provide live reporting. After the initial bombing, Arnett remained behind and was, for a time, the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[BBC]] devoted the FM portion of its national speech radio station [[BBC Radio 4]] to an 18-hour rolling news format creating [[Radio 4 News FM]]. The station was short lived, ending shortly after President Bush declared the ceasefire and Kuwait's liberation. However, it paved the way for the later introduction of [[Radio Five Live]].\n\nTwo BBC journalists, [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]] and [[Bob Simpson (journalist)|Bob Simpson]] (no relation), defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the war's progress. They were responsible for a report which included an \"infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Obituary : Bob Simpson |author=Peter Ruff |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/31/broadcasting.guardianobituaries |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=4 September 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nNewspapers all over the world also covered the war and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] published a special issue dated 28 January 1991, the headline \"War in the Gulf\" emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began.\n\nUS policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the [[Vietnam War]]. The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled ''[[Annex Foxtrot]]''. Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military. Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers. Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward. This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq. This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war's course. It was not only the limitation of information in the Middle East; media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like [[Ken Jarecke]]'s image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage.<ref name=\"AJR\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=3759 |title=Images of War |publisher=AJR |accessdate=20 July 2007 |last=Lori Robertson |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724001706/http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=3759 |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC.4528745\">{{cite news |ref=harv|date=9 May 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4528745.stm|title=Picture power: Death of an Iraqi soldier|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2010 |last=Ken Jarecke's account to the BBC World Service programme}}</ref><ref name=\"FamousPictures\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.famouspictures.org/iraqi-soldier/|title=Famous Pictures Magazine{{snd}}Iraqi Soldier|publisher=Famous Pictures Magazine|accessdate=23 May 2013 |last=Lucas, Dean}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the war's coverage was new in its instantaneousness. About halfway through the war, Iraq's government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organizations, and US journalists returned en masse to Baghdad. [[NBC News|NBC]]'s [[Tom Aspell]], ABC's Bill Blakemore, and CBS News' Betsy Aaron filed reports, subject to acknowledged Iraqi censorship. Throughout the war, footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately.\n\nA British crew from CBS News, David Green and Andy Thompson, equipped with satellite transmission equipment, traveled with the front line forces and, having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route, arrived the day before the forces in Kuwait City, broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the next day.\n\nAlternative media outlets provided views in opposition to the war. Deep Dish Television compiled segments from independent producers in the US and abroad, and produced a 10-hour series that was distributed internationally, called The Gulf Crisis TV Project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deepdishtv.org/Series/Default.aspx?id=4 |title=Series (The Gulf Crisis TV Project) |date=11 July 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=17 January 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711090755/http://www.deepdishtv.org/Series/Default.aspx?id=4 |archivedate=11 July 2010 }}</ref> The series' first program ''War, Oil and Power''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ddtv_50_war_oil_and_power|title=War, Oil and Power|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> was compiled and released in 1990, before the war broke out.

In San Francisco, Paper Tiger Television West produced a weekly cable television show with highlights of mass demonstrations, artists' actions, lectures, and protests against mainstream media coverage at newspaper offices and television stations. Local media outlets in cities across the USA screened similar oppositional media.\n\nThe organization [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) critically analyzed media coverage during the war in various articles and books, such as the 1991 ''Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship was at Home''.<ref name=\"fair.org.1518\">{{cite web |ref=harv|date=April 1991 |url=https://fair.org/extra/gulf-war-coverage/|title=Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship Was at Home|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR)|accessdate=14 October 2010 |last=Naureckas|first=Jim |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406043739/https://fair.org/extra/gulf-war-coverage/ |archivedate=2016-04-06 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:\n''Gulf War'' and ''Persian Gulf War'' are the most common terms for the conflict used within [[Western world|western countries]], though it may also be called the ''First Gulf War'' (to distinguish it from the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the subsequent [[Iraq War]]).

Terms in other languages include {{lang-fr|la Guerre du Golfe}} and {{lang-de|Golfkrieg}} (''Gulf War''); {{lang-de|Zweiter Golfkrieg}} (''Second Gulf War''); {{lang-fr|Guerre du Kowe\u00eft}} (''War of Kuwait'').\n\n===Operational names===\nMost of the coalition states used various names for their operations and the war's operational phases. These are sometimes incorrectly used as the conflict's overall name, especially the US ''Desert Storm'':\n* ''Operation Desert Shield'' was the US operational name for the US buildup of forces and Saudi Arabia's defense from 2 August 1990, to 16 January 1991.\n* ''Operation Desert Storm'' was the US name of the [[AirLand Battle|airland conflict]] from 17 January 1991, through 28 February 1991.\n** ''Operation Desert Sabre'' (early name ''Operation Desert Sword'') was the US name for the airland offensive against the Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (the \"100-hour war\") from 24\u201328 February 1991, in itself, part of ''Operation Desert Storm''.\n* ''[[Operation Desert Farewell]]'' was the name given to the return of US units and equipment to the US in 1991 after Kuwait's liberation, sometimes referred to as ''Operation Desert Calm''.\n* ''[[Operation Granby]]'' was the British name for British military activities during the operations and conflict.\n* ''[[Op\u00e9ration Daguet]]'' was the French name for French military activities in the conflict.\n* ''[[Operation Friction]]'' was the name of the Canadian operations\n* ''[[Operazione Locusta]]'' (Italian for [[Locust]]) was the Italian name for the operations and conflict.\n\n===Campaign names===\nThe US divided the conflict into three major campaigns:\n* ''Defense of Saudi Arabian country'' for the period 2 August 1990, through 16 January 1991.\n* ''Liberation and Defense of Kuwait'' for the period 17 January 1991, through 11 April 1991.\n* ''Southwest Asia Cease-Fire'' for the period 12 April 1991, through 30 November 1995, including ''[[Operation Provide Comfort]]''.\n\n==Technology==\n{{Further|List of Gulf War military equipment}}\n[[File:Missouri missile BGM-109 Tomahawk.JPG|thumb|[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] launching a [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk missile]].

Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by.\n\nPrecision-guided munitions amounted to approximately 7.4% of all bombs dropped by the coalition. Other bombs included [[cluster bomb]]s, which disperse numerous submunitions,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/cluster.htm |title=Dumb Bombs |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=18 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328110957/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/cluster.htm |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[BLU-82|daisy cutters]], 15,000-pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards.\n\n[[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) units were relatively new at the time and were important in enabling coalition units to easily navigate across the desert. Since military GPS receivers were not available for most troops, many used commercially available units. To permit these to be used to best effect, the \"selective availability\" feature of the GPS system was turned off for the duration of Desert Storm, allowing these commercial receivers to provide the same precision as the military equipment.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVgf41ic6LgC&lpg=PA55&dq=gulf%20war%20gps&pg=PR4#v=onepage&q=gulf%20war%20gps|title=GPS for Dummies|first=Joel|last=McNamara|isbn=9780470199237|date=2007-05-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne Warning and Control System]] (AWACS) and satellite communication systems were also important. Two examples of this are the US Navy's [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] and the US Air Force's [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]]. Both were used in command and control area of operations. These systems provided essential communications links between air, ground, and naval forces. It is one of several reasons coalition forces dominated the air war.\n\nAmerican-made color photocopiers were used to produce some of Iraq's battle plans. Some of the copiers contained concealed high-tech transmitters that revealed their positions to American [[electronic warfare aircraft]], leading to more precise bombings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18527456 |title=Something wrong with our **** chips today |work=The Economist |date=7 April 2011|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Scud and Patriot missiles===\n[[File:Scud downed by Patriot missiles.JPEG|thumb|Military personnel examine the remains of a Scud.]]\nThe role of Iraq's Scud missiles featured prominently in the war. Scud is a tactical [[ballistic missile]] that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed [[Soviet Army]] [[GSFG|divisions]] in [[East Germany]].\n\nScud missiles utilize inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate.

When Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] expelled Abu Nidal to Syria at the US's request in November 1983, the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] sent [[Donald Rumsfeld]] to meet Saddam as a special envoy and to cultivate ties. By the time the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#1987\u201388: Towards a ceasefire|ceasefire with Iran]] was signed in August 1988, Iraq was heavily debt-ridden and tensions within society were rising.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 333.</ref> Most of its debt was owed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

The UK drew the border between the two countries in 1922, making Iraq virtually landlocked.<ref name=\"stork\" /> Kuwait rejected Iraqi attempts to secure further provisions in the region.<ref name=\"simons343344\" />\n\nIraq also accused Kuwait of exceeding its [[OPEC]] quotas for oil production. In order for the cartel to maintain its desired price of $18 a barrel, discipline was required. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were consistently overproducing; the latter at least in part to repair losses caused by Iranian attacks in the Iran\u2013Iraq War and to pay for the losses of an economic scandal. The result was a slump in the oil price{{snd}}as low as $10 a barrel{{snd}}with a resulting loss of $7 billion a year to Iraq, equal to its 1989 [[balance of payments]] deficit.<ref>Simons (2003). pp. 339\u2013340.</ref> Resulting revenues struggled to support the government's basic costs, let alone repair Iraq's damaged infrastructure.

''A History of the Modern Middle East. 2nd Ed'' pg. 464</ref> At the same time, Saddam looked for closer ties with those Arab states that had supported Iraq in the war.

A pact of non-interference and non-aggression was signed between the countries, followed by a Kuwaiti-Iraqi deal for Iraq to supply Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation, although a request for Kuwait to lease Iraq [[Umm Qasr]] was rejected.<ref name=\"Simons334\" /> Saudi-backed development projects were hampered by Iraq's large debts, even with the [[demobilization]] of 200,000 soldiers. Iraq also looked to increase arms production so as to become an exporter, although the success of these projects was also restrained by Iraq's obligations; in Iraq, resentment to OPEC's controls mounted.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 335.</ref>\n\nIraq's relations with its Arab neighbors{{snd}}in particular Egypt{{snd}}were degraded by mounting violence in Iraq against expatriate groups, who were well-employed during the war, by unemployed Iraqis, among them demobilized soldiers. These events drew little notice outside the Arab world because of fast-moving events directly related to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. However, the US did begin to condemn Iraq's human rights record, including the well-known use of torture.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 336.</ref> The UK also condemned the execution of [[Farzad Bazoft]], a journalist working for the British newspaper ''[[Observer (newspaper)|The Observer]]''.<ref name=\"stork\" /> Following Saddam's declaration that \"binary chemical weapons\" would be used on Israel if it used military force against Iraq, Washington halted part of its funding.<ref>Simons (2003). pp. 337\u2013338.</ref> A UN mission to the [[Israeli-occupied territories]], where riots had resulted in Palestinian deaths, was [[veto]]ed by the US, making Iraq deeply skeptical of US foreign policy aims in the region, combined with the reliance of the US on Middle Eastern energy reserves.<ref>Simons (2003). p. 338.</ref>\n\nIn early July 1990, Iraq complained about Kuwait's behavior, such as not respecting their quota, and openly threatened to take military action. On the 23rd, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] reported that Iraq had moved 30,000 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait border, and the US naval fleet in the Persian Gulf was placed on alert. Saddam believed an anti-Iraq conspiracy was developing{{snd}}Kuwait had begun talks with Iran, and Iraq's rival Syria had arranged a visit to Egypt.<ref name=\"simons343\">Simons (2003). p. 343.</ref> Upon review by the Secretary of Defense, it was found that Syria indeed planned a strike against Iraq in the coming days. Saddam immediately used funding to incorporate central intelligence into Syria and ultimately prevented the impending air strike.

The Iran\u2013Iraq war had been going on for five years by that time and there were significant casualties on both sides, reaching into the hundreds of thousands. Within President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents. A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]], to review US options. It was determined that there was a high likelihood that the conflict would spread into Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region. Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy, which was just beginning to gain momentum. On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the [[Oval Office]] by [[William Flynn Martin]] who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study.

The plan was approved by President Reagan and later affirmed by the G-7 leaders headed by the United Kingdom's Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]], in the [[10th G7 summit|London Summit of 1984]]. The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.\n\nWithin hours of the invasion, Kuwait and US delegations requested a meeting of the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]], which passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 660|Resolution 660]], condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops.<ref>Finlan (2003). p. 29.<!--Is it page 29 or 13?--></ref><ref name=UN>{{cite book|title=Report of the Security Council: 16 June 1990{{snd}}15 June 1991|date=1993|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|issn=0082-8238|page=30|type=digital document}}</ref> On 3 August 1990, the [[Arab League]] passed its own resolution, which called for a solution to the conflict from within the league, and warned against outside intervention.

Following Kuwait's conquest, the Iraqi Army was within easy striking distance of Saudi [[oil field]]s. Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, would have given Saddam control over the majority of the world's oil reserves. Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran. The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of [[Shia]] Iran's [[Islamic revolution]] on its own Shia minority. After the war, Saddam felt he should not have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran.\n\nSoon after his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam began verbally attacking the Saudis. He argued that the US-supported Saudi state was an illegitimate and unworthy guardian of the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. He combined the language of the [[Islamist]] groups that had recently fought in Afghanistan with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis.<ref>[[Gilles Kepel]] ''Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam.''</ref>\n[[File:Stinger Crew Operation Desert Shield.jpg|thumb|left|US Army soldiers from the [[11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade (United States)|11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade]] during the Gulf War]]\n\nActing on the [[Carter Doctrine]] policy, and out of fear the Iraqi Army could launch an invasion of Saudi Arabia, US President George H.

A total of 48 US Air Force F-15s from the [[1st Fighter Wing]] at [[Langley Air Force Base]], Virginia, landed in Saudi Arabia and immediately commenced round-the-clock air patrols of the Saudi\u2013Kuwait\u2013Iraq border to discourage further Iraqi military advances. They were joined by 36 F-15 A-Ds from the [[36th Wing|36th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Bitburg, Germany]]. The Bitburg contingent was based at [[Al Kharj Air Base]], approximately an hour south east of Riyadh. The 36th TFW would be responsible for 11 confirmed Iraqi Air Force aircraft shot down during the war. There were also two Air National Guard units stationed at Al Kharj Air Base, the [[South Carolina Air National Guard]]'s 169th Fighter Wing flew bombing missions with 24 F-16s flying 2,000 combat missions and dropping {{convert|4,000,000|lb|kg t|spell=in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of munitions, and the [[New York Air National Guard]]'s 174th Fighter Wing from [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] flew 24 F-16s on bombing missions. Military buildup continued from there, eventually reaching 543,000 troops, twice the number used in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

The first stop was Saudi Arabia, which a month before had already granted permission to the United States to use its facilities. However, Baker believed that Saudi Arabia, an immensely wealthy nation, should assume some of the cost of the military efforts, since one of the most important military objectives was to defend Saudi Arabia. When Baker asked King Fahd for 15 billion dollars, the King readily agreed, with the promise that Baker ask Kuwait for the same amount.\n\nThe next day, 7 September, he did just that, and the [[Emir of Kuwait]], displaced in a Sheraton hotel outside his invaded country, easily agreed. Baker then moved to enter talks with Egypt, whose leadership he considered to be \"the moderate voice of the Middle East\". President Mubarak of Egypt was furious with Saddam for his invasion of Kuwait, and for the fact that Saddam had assured Mubarak that an invasion was not his intention. Egypt received approximately $7 billion in debt forgiveness for its providing of support and troops for the US-led intervention.<ref>New York Times, 10 Apr. 1991, \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/10/business/egypt-s-reward-forgiven-debt.html Egypt's 'Reward': Forgiven Debt]</ref>\n\nAfter stops in Helsinki and Moscow to smooth out Iraqi demands for a Middle-Eastern peace conference with the [[Soviet Union]], Baker traveled to Syria to discuss its role in the crisis with its President [[Hafez al-Assad|Hafez Assad]]. Assad had a deep personal enmity towards Saddam, which was defined by the fact that \"Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years.\" Harboring this animosity and being impressed with Baker's diplomatic initiative to visit Damascus (relations had been severed since the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombings|1983 bombing of US Marine barracks]] in [[Beirut]]), Assad agreed to pledge up to 100,000 Syrian troops to the coalition effort. This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition. In exchange, Washington gave Syrian dictator President [[Hafez al-Assad]] the green light to wipe out forces in opposition to Syria's rule in [[Lebanon]] and arranged for weapons valued at a billion dollars to be provided to Syria, mostly through Gulf states.<ref name=\"newstatesman.com\">''[[New Statesman]]'', 23 September 2002, \"[https://www.newstatesman.com/node/192550 John Pilger Reveals How the Bushes Bribe the World, from Russia to Iran]\"</ref> In exchange for Iran's support for the US-led intervention, the US government promised the Iranian government to end US opposition to [[World Bank]] loans to Iran.

Although [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Germany's constitution]] (which was brokered essentially by the United States) prohibited military involvement in outside nations, Kohl committed a two billion dollar contribution to the coalition's war effort, as well as further economic and military support of coalition ally Turkey, and the transportation of Egyptian soldiers and ships to the Persian Gulf.<ref>Baker, James Addison, and Thomas M.

Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, US Defense Secretary [[Dick Cheney]] made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where [[King Fahd]] requested US military assistance.

After finding no evidence to support it, the organization issued a retraction. President Bush then repeated the incubator allegations on television.\n\nAt the same time, the Iraqi Army committed several well-documented crimes during its occupation of Kuwait, such as the [[summary execution|summary execution without trial]] of three brothers after which their bodies were stacked in a pile and left to decay in a public street.<ref>Makiya 1993, p 40.</ref> Iraqi troops also ransacked and looted private Kuwaiti homes; one residence was repeatedly defecated in.<ref>Makiya 1993, pp 31\u201333</ref> A resident later commented: \"The whole thing was violence for the sake of violence, destruction for the sake of destruction&nbsp;...

The first priority was the destruction of Iraq's Air Force and anti-aircraft facilities. The sorties were launched mostly from Saudi Arabia and the six [[carrier battle group]]s (CVBG) in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Red Sea]].\n\n[[File:Destroyed Iraqi T-54A or Type 59.JPEG|thumb|An Iraqi T-54A or Type 59 tank lies destroyed after a coalition bombing attack during Operation Desert Storm.]]\n\nThe next targets were command and communication facilities. Saddam Hussein had closely [[micromanagement|micromanaged]] Iraqi forces in the Iran\u2013Iraq War, and initiative at lower levels was discouraged. Coalition planners hoped that Iraqi resistance would quickly collapse if deprived of command and control.\n\nThe air campaign's third and largest phase targeted military targets throughout Iraq and Kuwait: [[Scud]] missile launchers, weapons research facilities, and naval forces. About a third of the coalition's air power was devoted to attacking Scuds, some of which were on trucks and therefore difficult to locate. US and British [[special forces|special operations forces]] had been covertly inserted into western Iraq to aid in the search for and destruction of Scuds.\n\nIraqi anti-aircraft defenses, including [[man-portable air-defense systems]], were surprisingly ineffective against enemy aircraft, and the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, 44 due to Iraqi action.

Eleven Americans were killed in two separate [[friendly fire]] incidents, an additional 14 US airmen were killed when their [[AC-130]] gunship was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile, and two US soldiers were captured during the battle. Saudi and Qatari forces had a total of 18 dead. Iraqi forces in Khafji had 60\u2013300 dead and 400 captured.\n\nThe Battle of Khafji was an example of how air power could single-handedly hinder the advance of enemy ground forces. Upon learning of Iraqi troop movements, 140 coalition aircraft were diverted to attack an advancing column consisting of two armored divisions in battalion-sized units. Precision stand-off attacks were conducted during the night and through to the next day. Iraqi vehicle losses included 357 tanks, 147 armored personnel carriers, and 89 mobile artillery pieces. Some crews simply abandoned their vehicles upon realizing that they could be destroyed by guided bombs without warning, stopping the divisions from massing for an organized attack on the town.

On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City. They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields. However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours. Several tank battles took place, but otherwise coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered. The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering. However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft. Meanwhile, forces from Arab states advanced into Kuwait from the east, encountering little resistance and suffering few casualties.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nDespite the successes of coalition forces, it was feared that the Iraqi Republican Guard would escape into Iraq before it could be destroyed. It was decided to send British armored forces into Kuwait 15 hours ahead of schedule, and to send US forces after the Republican Guard. The coalition advance was preceded by a heavy artillery and rocket barrage, after which 150,000 troops and 1,500 tanks began their advance. Iraqi forces in Kuwait counterattacked against US troops, acting on a direct order from Saddam Hussein himself. Despite the intense combat, the Americans repulsed the Iraqis and continued to advance towards Kuwait City.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nKuwaiti forces were tasked with liberating the city. Iraqi troops offered only light resistance. The Kuwaitis quickly liberated the city despite losing one soldier and having one plane shot down. On 27 February, Saddam ordered a retreat from Kuwait, and President Bush declared it liberated. However, an Iraqi unit at [[Kuwait International Airport]] appeared not to have received the message and fiercely resisted. US Marines had to fight for hours before securing the airport, after which Kuwait was declared secure. After four days of fighting, Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait. As part of a [[scorched earth]] policy, they [[Kuwaiti oil fires|set fire to nearly 700 oil wells]] and placed land mines around the wells to make extinguishing the fires more difficult.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Initial moves into Iraq===\n[[File:RemnantsofLAV25.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Destroyed LAV-25]]\n\nThe war's ground phase was officially designated Operation Desert Saber.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/desert_sabre.htm |title=Operation Desert Sabre / Gulf War Ground Campaign |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=18 March 2010}}</ref> The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British [[Special Air Service]]'s B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, [[Bravo Two Zero]], and Bravo Three Zero, in late January.

It was a feint attack, designed to make the Iraqis think that a coalition invasion would take place from the south. The Iraqis fiercely resisted, and the Americans eventually withdrew as planned back into the Wadi Al-Batin. Three US soldiers were killed and nine wounded, with one M2 Bradley IFV turret destroyed, but they had taken 40 prisoners and destroyed five tanks, and successfully deceived the Iraqis. This attack led the way for the XVIII Airborne Corps to sweep around behind the 1st Cav and attack Iraqi forces to the west. On 22 February 1991, Iraq agreed to a Soviet-proposed ceasefire agreement. The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre-invasion positions within six weeks following a total ceasefire, and called for monitoring of the ceasefire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council.\n\nThe coalition rejected the proposal, but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked,{{citation needed|date=February 2009}} and gave 24 hours for Iraq to withdraw its forces. On 23 February, fighting resulted in the capture of 500 Iraqi soldiers.

The movement's right flank was protected by the [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom's 1st Armoured Division]]. Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape. The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug-in positions and stationary vehicles, and even mounted armored charges.\n\nUnlike many previous engagements, the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender. The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles, while US casualties were comparatively low, with a single Bradley knocked out. Coalition forces pressed another 10&nbsp;km into Iraqi territory, and captured their objective within three hours. They took 500 prisoners and inflicted heavy losses, defeating Iraq's 26th Infantry Division. A US soldier was killed by an Iraqi land mine, another five by friendly fire, and 30 wounded during the battle. Meanwhile, British forces attacked Iraq's Medina Division and a major Republican Guard logistics base. In nearly two days of some of the war's most intense fighting, the British destroyed 40 enemy tanks and captured a division commander.\n\nMeanwhile, US forces attacked the village of [[Muthanna Governorate|Al Busayyah]], meeting fierce resistance. The US force destroyed a considerable amount of military hardware and took prisoners, while suffering no casualties.\n\nOn 25 February 1991, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at an American barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. The missile attack killed 28 US military personnel.<ref>''Twentieth Century Battlefields'', \"The Gulf War\".</ref>\n\nThe coalition's advance was much swifter than US generals had expected. On 26 February, Iraqi troops began retreating from Kuwait, after they had set 737 of its oil wells on fire. A long convoy of retreating Iraqi troops formed along the main Iraq\u2013Kuwait highway. Although they were retreating, this convoy was bombed so extensively by coalition air forces that it came to be known as the [[Highway of Death]]. Thousands of Iraqi troops were killed.

The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of \"The Voice of Free Iraq\" on 2 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia.

However, when no US support came, Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|Kurdish uprising]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and Kurdish areas of Iran. These events later resulted in [[no-fly zone]]s being established in northern and southern Iraq. In Kuwait, the Emir was restored, and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed. Eventually, over 400,000 people were expelled from the country, including a large number of [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]], because of [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] support of Saddam. Yasser Arafat didn't apologize for his support of Iraq, but after his death, the Fatah under [[Mahmoud Abbas]]' authority formally apologized in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4089961.stm |work=BBC News |title=Abbas apology to Kuwait over Iraq |date=12 December 2004}}</ref>\n\nThere was some criticism of the Bush administration, as they chose to allow Saddam to remain in power instead of pushing on to capture Baghdad and overthrowing his government. In their co-written 1998 book, ''[[A World Transformed]]'', Bush and [[Brent Scowcroft]] argued that such a course would have fractured the alliance, and would have had many unnecessary political and human costs associated with it.\n\nIn 1992, the US Defense Secretary during the war, Dick Cheney, made the same point:\n\n{{quote|I would guess if we had gone in there, we would still have forces in Baghdad today. We'd be running the country. We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home.\n\nAnd the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties. I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war.\n\nAnd the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam [Hussein] worth? And the answer is, not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/192908_cheney29.html|title=\"Cheney changed his view on Iraq\", by Charles Pope, ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'', 29 September 2004|date=28 September 2004|accessdate=7 January 2005}}</ref>}}\n\nOn 10 March 1991, 540,000 US troops began moving out of the Persian Gulf.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nOn 15 March 1991, the US-led coalition restored to power [[Sheikh]] [[Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah]], the unelected authoritarian ruler of Kuwait.

The Australian Task Force was also placed at great risk with regard to the sea mine threat, with HMAS ''Brisbane'' narrowly avoiding a mine.

Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait.<ref>{{cite book|last=Husain |first=T. |title=Kuwaiti Oil Fires: Regional Environmental Perspectives |year=1995 |publisher=BPC Wheatons Ltd |location=Oxford |page=68}}</ref> By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately 10 months, causing widespread pollution.\n\n==Cost==\nThe cost of the war to the United States was calculated by the US Congress in April 1992 to be $61.1 billion<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~fhoran/gulf/GW_cost/GW_payments.html |title=How much did the Gulf War cost the US? |publisher=People.psych.cornell.edu |date=20 May 1997 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821200403/http://people.psych.cornell.edu/~fhoran/gulf/GW_cost/GW_payments.html |archivedate=21 August 2010}}</ref> (equivalent to ${{Format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|61100000000|1992}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}}).{{Inflation-fn|US-GDP}} About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions). About 25% of Saudi Arabia's contribution was paid in the form of in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> US troops represented about 74% of the combined force, and the global cost was therefore higher.\n\n===Effect on developing countries===\nApart from the impact on [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]], the resulting economic disruptions after the crisis affected many states. The [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response. A briefing paper finalized on the day that the conflict ended draws on their findings which had two main conclusions: Many developing states were severely affected and while there has been a considerable response to the crisis, the distribution of assistance was highly selective.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\">{{cite web|title=The Impact of the Gulf Crisis on Developing Countries|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5466&title=gulf-crisis-impact-ldcs|work=ODI Briefing Paper|date=March 1991|accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe ODI factored in elements of \"cost\" which included oil imports, remittance flows, re-settlement costs, loss of export earnings and tourism. For Egypt, the cost totaled $1 billion, 3% of GDP. Yemen had a cost of $830 million, 10% of GDP, while it cost Jordan $1.8 billion, 32% of GDP.\n\nInternational response to the crisis on developing states came with the channeling of aid through The Gulf Crisis Financial Co-ordination Group. They were 24 states, comprising most of the OECD countries plus some Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait. The members of this group agreed to disperse $14 billion in development assistance.\n\nThe [[World Bank]] responded by speeding up the disbursement of existing project and adjustment loans. The [[International Monetary Fund]] adopted two lending facilities{{snd}}the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Compensatory & Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF). The European Community offered $2 billion{{clarify|date=August 2011}} in assistance.<ref name=\"odi.org.uk\" />\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{Main|Media coverage of the Gulf War}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}\nThe war was heavily [[television|televised]]. For the first time, people all over the world were able to watch live pictures of [[missile]]s hitting their targets and fighters departing from aircraft carriers. Allied forces were keen to demonstrate their weapons' accuracy.\n\nIn the United States, the \"big three\" network anchors led the war's [[News broadcasting|network news]] coverage: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Peter Jennings]], [[CBS]]'s [[Dan Rather]], and [[NBC]]'s [[Tom Brokaw]] were anchoring their evening newscasts when air strikes began on 16 January 1991. [[ABC News]] correspondent Gary Shepard, reporting live from Baghdad, told Jennings of the city's quietness. But, moments later, Shepard was back on the air as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground.\n\nOn CBS, viewers were watching a report from correspondent Allen Pizzey, who was also reporting from Baghdad, when the war began. Rather, after the report was finished, announced that there were unconfirmed reports of flashes in Baghdad and heavy [[air traffic]] at bases in Saudi Arabia. On the NBC Nightly News, correspondent [[Mike Boettcher]] reported unusual air activity in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Moments later, Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun.\n\nStill, it was [[CNN]] whose coverage gained the most popularity and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the network's history, ultimately leading to the establishment of [[CNN International]]. CNN correspondents [[John Holliman]] and [[Peter Arnett]] and CNN anchor [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]] relayed audio reports from Baghdad's [[Rixos Al Rasheed Baghdad Hotel|Al-Rashid Hotel]] as the air strikes began. The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau. When the telephones of all of the other Western TV correspondents went dead during the bombing, CNN was the only service able to provide live reporting. After the initial bombing, Arnett remained behind and was, for a time, the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[BBC]] devoted the FM portion of its national speech radio station [[BBC Radio 4]] to an 18-hour rolling news format creating [[Radio 4 News FM]]. The station was short lived, ending shortly after President Bush declared the ceasefire and Kuwait's liberation. However, it paved the way for the later introduction of [[Radio Five Live]].\n\nTwo BBC journalists, [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]] and [[Bob Simpson (journalist)|Bob Simpson]] (no relation), defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the war's progress. They were responsible for a report which included an \"infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Obituary : Bob Simpson |author=Peter Ruff |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jul/31/broadcasting.guardianobituaries |newspaper=The Guardian |date=31 July 2006 |accessdate=4 September 2011 |location=London}}</ref>\n\nNewspapers all over the world also covered the war and [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] published a special issue dated 28 January 1991, the headline \"War in the Gulf\" emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began.\n\nUS policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the [[Vietnam War]]. The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled ''[[Annex Foxtrot]]''. Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military. Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers. Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward. This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq. This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war's course. It was not only the limitation of information in the Middle East; media were also restricting what was shown about the war with more graphic depictions like [[Ken Jarecke]]'s image of a burnt Iraqi soldier being pulled from the American AP wire whereas in Europe it was given extensive coverage.<ref name=\"AJR\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=3759 |title=Images of War |publisher=AJR |accessdate=20 July 2007 |last=Lori Robertson |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724001706/http://www.ajr.org/article_printable.asp?id=3759 |archivedate=24 July 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC.4528745\">{{cite news |ref=harv|date=9 May 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4528745.stm|title=Picture power: Death of an Iraqi soldier|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2010 |last=Ken Jarecke's account to the BBC World Service programme}}</ref><ref name=\"FamousPictures\">{{cite web |year=2007 |url=http://www.famouspictures.org/iraqi-soldier/|title=Famous Pictures Magazine{{snd}}Iraqi Soldier|publisher=Famous Pictures Magazine|accessdate=23 May 2013 |last=Lucas, Dean}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the war's coverage was new in its instantaneousness. About halfway through the war, Iraq's government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organizations, and US journalists returned en masse to Baghdad. [[NBC News|NBC]]'s [[Tom Aspell]], ABC's Bill Blakemore, and CBS News' Betsy Aaron filed reports, subject to acknowledged Iraqi censorship. Throughout the war, footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately.\n\nA British crew from CBS News, David Green and Andy Thompson, equipped with satellite transmission equipment, traveled with the front line forces and, having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route, arrived the day before the forces in Kuwait City, broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the next day.\n\nAlternative media outlets provided views in opposition to the war. Deep Dish Television compiled segments from independent producers in the US and abroad, and produced a 10-hour series that was distributed internationally, called The Gulf Crisis TV Project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deepdishtv.org/Series/Default.aspx?id=4 |title=Series (The Gulf Crisis TV Project) |date=11 July 2010 |work=archive.org |accessdate=17 January 2017 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711090755/http://www.deepdishtv.org/Series/Default.aspx?id=4 |archivedate=11 July 2010 }}</ref> The series' first program ''War, Oil and Power''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ddtv_50_war_oil_and_power|title=War, Oil and Power|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> was compiled and released in 1990, before the war broke out. ''News World Order''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/ddtv_56_new_world_order|title=News World Order|publisher=|accessdate=17 January 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> was the title of another program in the series; it focused on the media's complicity in promoting the war, as well as Americans' reactions to the media coverage. In San Francisco, Paper Tiger Television West produced a weekly cable television show with highlights of mass demonstrations, artists' actions, lectures, and protests against mainstream media coverage at newspaper offices and television stations. Local media outlets in cities across the USA screened similar oppositional media.\n\nThe organization [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR) critically analyzed media coverage during the war in various articles and books, such as the 1991 ''Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship was at Home''.<ref name=\"fair.org.1518\">{{cite web |ref=harv|date=April 1991 |url=https://fair.org/extra/gulf-war-coverage/|title=Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship Was at Home|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR)|accessdate=14 October 2010 |last=Naureckas|first=Jim |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406043739/https://fair.org/extra/gulf-war-coverage/ |archivedate=2016-04-06 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nThe following names have been used to describe the conflict itself:\n''Gulf War'' and ''Persian Gulf War'' are the most common terms for the conflict used within [[Western world|western countries]], though it may also be called the ''First Gulf War'' (to distinguish it from the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and the subsequent [[Iraq War]]). Some authors have called it the ''Second Gulf War'' to distinguish it from the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref>''Iraq and the Second Gulf War: State Building and Regime Security'', Mohammad-Mahmoud Mohamedou, 1997</ref> ''[[Liberation of Kuwait campaign|Liberation of Kuwait]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u062a\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u064a\u062a}}) (''ta\u1e25r\u012br al-kuwayt'') is the term used by Kuwait and most of the coalition's Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Terms in other languages include {{lang-fr|la Guerre du Golfe}} and {{lang-de|Golfkrieg}} (''Gulf War''); {{lang-de|Zweiter Golfkrieg}} (''Second Gulf War''); {{lang-fr|Guerre du Kowe\u00eft}} (''War of Kuwait'').\n\n===Operational names===\nMost of the coalition states used various names for their operations and the war's operational phases. These are sometimes incorrectly used as the conflict's overall name, especially the US ''Desert Storm'':\n* ''Operation Desert Shield'' was the US operational name for the US buildup of forces and Saudi Arabia's defense from 2 August 1990, to 16 January 1991.\n* ''Operation Desert Storm'' was the US name of the [[AirLand Battle|airland conflict]] from 17 January 1991, through 28 February 1991.\n** ''Operation Desert Sabre'' (early name ''Operation Desert Sword'') was the US name for the airland offensive against the Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (the \"100-hour war\") from 24\u201328 February 1991, in itself, part of ''Operation Desert Storm''.\n* ''[[Operation Desert Farewell]]'' was the name given to the return of US units and equipment to the US in 1991 after Kuwait's liberation, sometimes referred to as ''Operation Desert Calm''.\n* ''[[Operation Granby]]'' was the British name for British military activities during the operations and conflict.\n* ''[[Op\u00e9ration Daguet]]'' was the French name for French military activities in the conflict.\n* ''[[Operation Friction]]'' was the name of the Canadian operations\n* ''[[Operazione Locusta]]'' (Italian for [[Locust]]) was the Italian name for the operations and conflict.\n\n===Campaign names===\nThe US divided the conflict into three major campaigns:\n* ''Defense of Saudi Arabian country'' for the period 2 August 1990, through 16 January 1991.\n* ''Liberation and Defense of Kuwait'' for the period 17 January 1991, through 11 April 1991.\n* ''Southwest Asia Cease-Fire'' for the period 12 April 1991, through 30 November 1995, including ''[[Operation Provide Comfort]]''.\n\n==Technology==\n{{Further|List of Gulf War military equipment}}\n[[File:Missouri missile BGM-109 Tomahawk.JPG|thumb|right|[[USS Missouri (BB-63)|USS ''Missouri'']] launching a [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk missile]]. The Gulf War was the last conflict in which [[battleship]]s were deployed in a combat role ({{as of|2017|lc=y}}).]]\n[[Precision-guided munition]]s were heralded as key in allowing military strikes to be made with a minimum of civilian casualties compared to previous wars, although they were not used as often as more traditional, less accurate bombs. Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by.\n\nPrecision-guided munitions amounted to approximately 7.4% of all bombs dropped by the coalition. Other bombs included [[cluster bomb]]s, which disperse numerous submunitions,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/cluster.htm |title=Dumb Bombs |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=18 March 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328110957/http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/dumb/cluster.htm |archivedate=28 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[BLU-82|daisy cutters]], 15,000-pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards.\n\n[[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) units were relatively new at the time and were important in enabling coalition units to easily navigate across the desert. Since military GPS receivers were not available for most troops, many used commercially available units. To permit these to be used to best effect, the \"selective availability\" feature of the GPS system was turned off for the duration of Desert Storm, allowing these commercial receivers to provide the same precision as the military equipment.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVgf41ic6LgC&lpg=PA55&dq=gulf%20war%20gps&pg=PR4#v=onepage&q=gulf%20war%20gps|title=GPS for Dummies|first=Joel|last=McNamara|isbn=9780470199237|date=2007-05-29}}</ref>\n\n[[Airborne early warning and control|Airborne Warning and Control System]] (AWACS) and satellite communication systems were also important. Two examples of this are the US Navy's [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye]] and the US Air Force's [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]]. Both were used in command and control area of operations. These systems provided essential communications links between air, ground, and naval forces. It is one of several reasons coalition forces dominated the air war.\n\nAmerican-made color photocopiers were used to produce some of Iraq's battle plans. Some of the copiers contained concealed high-tech transmitters that revealed their positions to American [[electronic warfare aircraft]], leading to more precise bombings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18527456 |title=Something wrong with our **** chips today |work=The Economist |date=7 April 2011|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Scud and Patriot missiles===\n[[File:Scud downed by Patriot missiles.JPEG|thumb|right|Military personnel examine the remains of a Scud.]]\nThe role of Iraq's Scud missiles featured prominently in the war. Scud is a tactical [[ballistic missile]] that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed [[Soviet Army]] [[GSFG|divisions]] in [[East Germany]].\n\nScud missiles utilize inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate. Iraq used Scud missiles, launching them into both Saudi Arabia and Israel. Some missiles caused extensive casualties, while others caused little damage.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe US [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile]] was used in combat for the first time.

[[Nuncio]] Ratti was the only foreign diplomat to stay in the Polish capital.

He was asked to go. \u201cWhile he tried honestly to show himself as a friend of Poland, Warsaw forced his departure, after his neutrality in [[Silesia]]n voting was questioned\u201d<ref>Stehle 26</ref> by Germans and Poles.\n\n==Opposition from German nationalists==\nNationalistic Germans objected to a Polish nuncio supervising elections, and Poles were upset because he curtailed agitating clergy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 15\">Schmidlin IV, 15</ref> On November 20, when German Cardinal [[Adolf Bertram]] announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti's expulsion climaxed in Warsaw.<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 15\"/> Two year later, Achille Ratti became [[Pope Pius XI]], shaping Vatican policies towards Poland with [[Pietro Gasparri]] and [[Eugenio Pacelli]] for the following thirty-six years. (1922-1958)\n\n==Church life flourishes==\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922-1939), Church life in Poland flourished: There were some [[anti-clerical]] groups opposing the new role of the Church especially in education,<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 135\">Schmidlin IV, 135</ref> But numerous religious meetings and congresses, [[festival|feast]]s and [[pilgrimage]]s, many of which were accompanied by supportive letters from the Pontiff, took place.<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 135\"/>\n\n==Activities of Cardinal Gasparri==\nUnder the pontificate of Pope Pius XI, his [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] Pietro Gasparri with unusual candour expressed his views on the post-war order and the future of [[Poland]]: He told [[Ludwig von Pastor]], that the [[Peace Treaty of Versailles]] will most certainly end in a new war, maybe even ten wars.<ref>Von Pastor 681</ref> He expressed his pleasure at the outcome of the [[Locarno]] treaty. However, the [[Polish Corridor]] continued to be a dark point in his estimation, requiring compromises.<ref>Von Pastor 833</ref> At the same time, he opined, Poland can only exist, if she works either with her neighbour in the East or West. Since the Soviet Union could not be relied upon, he considered it \u201coutright stupid, to destroy bridges to the West. Poland will have to pay dearly later on, once Germany recuperates\u201d.<ref>Stehle 426</ref>\n\n==Relationship with foreign minister Beck==\nIn the late thirties, Polish foreign minister Beck came to Rome and requested an audience with Pope Pius XI. The Pope refused to see him, because Beck lived in disorderly family relations. Pacelli pointed out, that a foreign minister, not a saint, was applying. The Pope insisted, even when the \u201cBlack Pope, Father General [[Wlodimir Ledochowski]] intervened. He was respectfully told to be quiet.<ref>Tardini</ref> His distaste for some Polish politicians did not extend to the Polish people. Pope Pius XI had received many pilgrims and delegations and was most cordial. He was especially grateful for a Marian gift by the Polish Catholics, which he placed in the private Papal Chapel in [[Castel Gandolfo]].<ref>Pius XI: p</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pietro Gasparri.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] was in charge of Vatican foreign relations from 1914-1929.  He negotiated for [[Pope Pius XI]] the [[Lateran treaty]] of 1929 and numerous concordats.]]\n\n==Concordat with Poland==\nOn February 10, 1925, a [[concordat]] ([[Concordat of 1925]]) was signed between [[Pietro Gasparri]], [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] for the Vatican and [[Stanislaw Grabski]] for Poland.<ref>Joanne M Restrepo Restrepo SJ, Concordata Regnante Sancissimo Domino Pio XI Inita, Pontificia Universitas Gregoriana, Romae, 1932</ref> The concordat has 27 articles, which guarantee the freedom of the Church and the faithful. It regulates the usual points of interests, Catholic instruction in [[primary school]]s and [[secondary school]]s, nomination of [[bishops]], establishment of [[seminary|seminaries]], a permanent [[nuncio]] in [[Warsaw]], who also represents the interests of the [[Holy See]] in [[Gda\u0144sk]].<ref>Concordata, 3</ref><ref name=\"Concordata 8\">Concordata 8</ref> The concordat stipulates, that no part of Polish territory can be placed under the jurisdiction of a bishop outside of Poland.<ref>Concordata 26</ref>\n\n==Full protection of the State==\nThe Church enjoys full protection of the State, and prays for the leaders of Poland during Sunday mass and on May Third.<ref name=\"Concordata 8\"/> Clerics make a solemn oath of allegiance to the Polish State<ref>Concordata 12</ref> If clergy are under accusation, trial documents will be forwarded to ecclesiastical authorities if clergy are accused of crimes. If convicted, they will not serve incarceration in jails but will be handed over to Church authorities for internment in a monastery or convent.<ref>Concordata 22</ref> The concordat extends to the Latin rite in five ecclesiastical provinces of Gniezno and Poznan, Varsovie, Wilno, Lwow and Cracovie. It applies as well to united Catholics of the Greco-Ruthenian rite in Lwow, and Przemysl, and, to the Armenian rite in Lwow.<ref>Concordata 9</ref> for religious celebration in the specific rites, Canon law must be observed.<ref>Concordata 18</ref>\n\n==Catholic instruction mandatory in public schools==\nCatholic instruction is mandatory in all public schools, except universities.<ref>Concordata 13</ref> In Article 24 Church and State recognize each other's property rights seeming in part from the time of partition before 1918. This means, property rights and real estate titles of the Church are respected, a later agreement will define the status of expropriated Church properties, until that time, the State will pay Church dotations for its clergy.\nOn paper the concordat seemed to be a victory for the Church. But Polish bishops felt forced to take measures against early violations, in the area of marriage legislation and property rights. [[Pope Pius XI]] was supportive of this and of episcopal initiatives to have their own plenary meetings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 135\"/>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:History of Catholicism in Poland]]\n[[Category:1920s in Poland]]\n[[Category:1930s in Poland]]\n", "text_old": "The relationship between  '''Pope Pius XI and Poland''' is often considered to have been good, as Church life in Poland flourished during his pontificate.\n\n==Role as nuncio to Poland==\n[[Achille Ratti]], already in Warsaw as his representative, was named papal nuncio by Pope Benedict XV.<ref>Schmidlin III, 306\"</ref> He repeatedly cautioned Polish authorities against persecution against Lithuanian and Ruthenian clergy.<ref name=\"Schmidlin III, 307\">Schmidlin III, 307</ref> During the Bolshevik advance against Warsaw, he asked for worldwide public prayers for Poland.

(1922-1958)\n\n==Church life flourishes==\nDuring the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922-1939), Church life in Poland flourished: There were some [[anti-clerical]] groups opposing the new role of the Church especially in education,<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 135\">Schmidlin IV, 135</ref> But numerous religious meetings and congresses, [[festival|feast]]s and [[pilgrimage]]s, many of which were accompanied by supportive letters from the Pontiff, took place.<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 135\"/>\n\n==Activities of Cardinal Gasparri==\nUnder the pontificate of Pope Pius XI, his [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] Pietro Gasparri with unusual candour expressed his views on the post-war order and the future of [[Poland]]: He told [[Ludwig von Pastor]], that the [[Peace Treaty of Versailles]] will most certainly end in a new war, maybe even ten wars.<ref>Von Pastor 681</ref> He expressed his pleasure at the outcome of the [[Locarno]] treaty. However, the [[Polish Corridor]] continued to be a dark point in his estimation, requiring compromises.<ref>Von Pastor 833</ref> At the same time, he opined, Poland can only exist, if she works either with her neighbour in the East or West. Since the Soviet Union could not be relied upon, he considered it \u201coutright stupid, to destroy bridges to the West. Poland will have to pay dearly later on, once Germany recuperates\u201d.<ref>Stehle 426</ref>\n\n==Relationship with foreign minister Beck==\nIn the late thirties, Polish foreign minister Beck came to Rome and requested an audience with Pope Pius XI. The Pope refused to see him, because Beck lived in disorderly family relations. Pacelli pointed out, that a foreign minister, not a saint, was applying. The Pope insisted, even when the \u201cBlack Pope, Father General [[Wlodimir Ledochowski]] intervened. He was respectfully told to be quiet.<ref>Tardini</ref> His distaste for some Polish politicians did not extend to the Polish people. Pope Pius XI had received many pilgrims and delegations and was most cordial. He was especially grateful for a Marian gift by the Polish Catholics, which he placed in the private Papal Chapel in [[Castel Gandolfo]].<ref>Pius XI: p</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pietro Gasparri.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] was in charge of Vatican foreign relations from 1914-1929.

It regulates the usual points of interests, Catholic instruction in [[primary school]]s and [[secondary school]]s, nomination of [[bishops]], establishment of [[seminary|seminaries]], a permanent [[nuncio]] in [[Warsaw]], who also represents the interests of the [[Holy See]] in [[Gda\u0144sk]].<ref>Concordata, 3</ref><ref name=\"Concordata 8\">Concordata 8</ref> The concordat stipulates, that no part of Polish territory can be placed under the jurisdiction of a bishop outside of Poland.<ref>Concordata 26</ref>\n\n==Full protection of the State==\nThe Church enjoys full protection of the State, and prays for the leaders of Poland during Sunday mass and on May Third.<ref name=\"Concordata 8\"/> Clerics make a solemn oath of allegiance to the Polish State<ref>Concordata 12</ref> If clergy are under accusation, trial documents will be forwarded to ecclesiastical authorities if clergy are accused of crimes. If convicted, they will not serve incarceration in jails but will be handed over to Church authorities for internment in a monastery or convent.<ref>Concordata 22</ref> The concordat extends to the Latin rite in five ecclesiastical provinces of Gniezno and Poznan, Varsovie, Wilno, Lwow and Cracovie. It applies as well to united Catholics of the Greco-Ruthenian rite in Lwow, and Przemysl, and, to the Armenian rite in Lwow.<ref>Concordata 9</ref> for religious celebration in the specific rites, Canon law must be observed.<ref>Concordata 18</ref>\n\n==Catholic instruction mandatory in public schools==\nCatholic instruction is mandatory in all public schools, except universities.<ref>Concordata 13</ref> In Article 24 Church and State recognize each other's property rights seeming in part from the time of partition before 1918. This means, property rights and real estate titles of the Church are respected, a later agreement will define the status of expropriated Church properties, until that time, the State will pay Church dotations for its clergy.\nOn paper the concordat seemed to be a victory for the Church. But Polish bishops felt forced to take measures against early violations, in the area of marriage legislation and property rights. [[Pope Pius XI]] was supportive of this and of episcopal initiatives to have their own plenary meetings.<ref name=\"Schmidlin IV, 135\"/>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:History of Catholicism in Poland]]\n[[Category:1920s in Poland]]\n[[Category:1930s in Poland]]\n", "name_user": "Mn\u00e9m\u00e9", "label": "safe", "comment": "title added", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Pius_XI_and_Poland"}

All food and trade to Samar were cut off, with the intention of starving the revolutionaries and the civilian populace into submission. Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction of land and towns to force inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans out of fear of starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General [[Vicente Lukb\u00e1n]], but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals. The exact number of Filipino civilians killed by US troops will never be known.

As at Wounded Knee, the Moro group included women and children.\nMoro men in the crater who had arms possessed melee weapons. While fighting was limited to ground action on Jolo, use of naval gunfire contributed significantly to the overwhelming firepower brought to bear against the Moros. During the engagement, 750 men and officers, under the command of Colonel J.W. Duncan, assaulted the volcanic crater of [[Bud Dajo]] ([[Tausug language|Taus\u016bg]]: ''B\u016bd Dahu''), which was populated by 800 to 1,000 [[Taus\u016bg people|Tausug]] villagers.<ref name=\"bakbakan1\" /><ref name=lane1978p129>{{harvnb|Lane|1978|p=129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gregg|title=Honor in the Dust: Theodore Roosevelt, War in the Philippines, and the Rise and Fall of America's Imperial Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVooDgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=New American Library|isbn=978-0-451-23918-1|pages=353\u2013354, 420}}</ref> \n\nOn March 2nd, 1906, Wood ordered Colonel J.W.

The assault force consisted of 272 men of the 6th Infantry, 211 dismounted men of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]], 68 men of the 28th Artillery Battery, 51 men of the [[Philippine Constabulary]], 110 men of the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry]] and 6 sailors from the gunboat ''Pampanga''. The battle began on March 5th, as [[mountain guns]] fired 40 rounds of [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] into the crater. During the night, the Americans hauled mountain guns to the crater's edge with [[block and tackle]]. At daybreak, the American guns, both the mountain guns and the guns of the ''Pampanga'', opened fire on the Moros' fortifications in the crater. American forces then placed a \"Machine Gun... in a position where it could sweep the crest of the mountain between us and the cotta,\" murdering all Moros in the crater.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nOne account claims that the Moros, armed with knives and spears, refused to surrender and held their positions. Some of the defenders rushed the Americans and were cut down by artillery fire. The Americans charged the surviving Moros with fixed bayonets, and the Moros fought back with their [[kalis]], [[barung]], improvised [[grenades]] made with [[black powder]] and seashells. Despite the inconsistencies among various accounts of the battle, one in which all occupants of Bud Dajo were gunned down, another in which defenders resisted in fierce hand-to-hand combat, all accounts agree that few, if any, Moros survived.<ref name=\"bakbakan1\" />\n\nIn response to criticism, Wood's explanation of the high number of women and children killed stated that the women of Bud Dajo dressed as men and joined in the combat, and that the men used children as living shields.<ref name=lane1978p129>{{harvnb|Lane|1978|p=129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gregg|title=Honor in the Dust: Theodore Roosevelt, War in the Philippines, and the Rise and Fall of America's Imperial Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVooDgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=New American Library|isbn=978-0-451-23918-1|pages=353\u2013354, 420}}</ref> Hagedorn supports this explanation, by presenting an account of Lieutenant [[Gordon Johnston (soldier)|Gordon Johnston]], who was allegedly severely wounded by a female warrior.<ref name=hagedorn1931p64 /> \n\nA second explanation was given by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], [[Henry Clay Ide]], who reported that the women and children were [[collateral damage]], having been killed during the artillery barrages.<ref name=lane1978p129 /> These conflicting explanations of the high number of women and child casualties brought accusations of a cover-up, further adding fire to the criticism.<ref name=lane1978p129 /> Furthermore, Wood's and Ide's explanation are at odds with Colonel J.W. Duncan's post-action report authored on March 12th, 1906,  describing the placement of a [[machine-gun]] at the edge of the crater to fire upon the occupants. Following Duncan's reports, the high number of non-combatants killed can be explained as the result of indiscriminate machine-gun fire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite President McKinley's proclamation of \"benevolent assimilation\" of the Philippines as a U.S. Territory, American treatment of Philippine soldiers and civilians was far from being benevolent.

An explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. According to an [[Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public.\"<ref name=\"okinawa\"/> Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the U.S. military police. Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have given birth to. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some of those Okinawan women who were raped and did not commit suicide did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives. A large scale effort to determine the possible extent of these crimes has never been conducted. Over five decades after the war had ended, in the late-1990s, the women who were believed to have been raped still overwhelmingly refused to give public statements, instead speaking through relatives and a number of historians and scholars.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nThere is substantial evidence that the U.S. had at least some knowledge of what was going on. Samuel Saxton, a retired captain, explained that the American veterans and witnesses may have intentionally kept the rape a secret, largely out of shame: \"It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our country.\"<ref name=\"okinawa\"/> Military officials formally denied the mass rapes, and all surviving related veterans refused the ''New York Times'' request for an interview. Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened.\"<ref name=\"okinawa\"/> Author George Feifer noted in his book ''Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb'',  that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa.

In interviews with his biographer Charles Brandt, Sheeran recalled his war service with the [[Thunderbird Division]] as the time when he first developed a callousness to the taking of human life.

In his interviews with Brandt, Sheeran divided such massacres into four different categories.\n:1. Revenge killings in the heat of battle. Sheeran told Brandt that, when a German soldier had just killed his close friends and then tried to surrender, he would often \"send him to hell, too.\" He described often witnessing similar behavior by fellow [[GI (military)|GIs]].<ref name=\"Brandt, (2004) p. 50\">Brandt (2004), , ''I Heard You Paint Houses'', p.&nbsp;50</ref>\n:2.

The female cooks were first allowed to leave unmolested, then Sheeran and his fellow GI's \"ate what we wanted and soiled the rest with our waste.\" Then the Wehrmacht mule drivers were given shovels and ordered to \"dig their own shallow graves.\" Sheeran later joked that they did so without complaint, likely hoping that he and his buddies would change their minds.

All food and trade to Samar were cut off, with the intention of starving the revolutionaries and the civilian populace into submission. Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction of land and towns to force inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans out of fear of starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General [[Vicente Lukb\u00e1n]], but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals. The exact number of Filipino civilians killed by US troops will never be known.

For example, the highest estimate of Native Americans killed at the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] is 300 out of 350, a death rate of 85%, whereas in Bud Dajo, there were only six Moro survivors out of a group estimated at 1,000, a death rate of over 99%. As at Wounded Knee, the Moro group included women and children.\nMoro men in the crater who had arms possessed melee weapons. While fighting was limited to ground action on Jolo, use of naval gunfire contributed significantly to the overwhelming firepower brought to bear against the Moros. During the engagement, 750 men and officers, under the command of Colonel J.W. Duncan, assaulted the volcanic crater of [[Bud Dajo]] ([[Tausug language|Taus\u016bg]]: ''B\u016bd Dahu''), which was populated by 800 to 1,000 [[Taus\u016bg people|Tausug]] villagers.<ref name=\"bakbakan1\" /><ref name=lane1978p129>{{harvnb|Lane|1978|p=129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gregg|title=Honor in the Dust: Theodore Roosevelt, War in the Philippines, and the Rise and Fall of America's Imperial Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVooDgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=New American Library|isbn=978-0-451-23918-1|pages=353\u2013354, 420}}</ref> \n\nOn March 2nd, 1906, Wood ordered Colonel J.W. Duncan of the [[6th Infantry Regiment (United States)|6th Infantry Regiment]], which was stationed at [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], the provincial capital, to lead an expedition against Bud Dajo. The assault force consisted of 272 men of the 6th Infantry, 211 dismounted men of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]], 68 men of the 28th Artillery Battery, 51 men of the [[Philippine Constabulary]], 110 men of the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry]] and 6 sailors from the gunboat ''Pampanga''. The battle began on March 5th, as [[mountain guns]] fired 40 rounds of [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] into the crater. During the night, the Americans hauled mountain guns to the crater's edge with [[block and tackle]]. At daybreak, the American guns, both the mountain guns and the guns of the ''Pampanga'', opened fire on the Moros' fortifications in the crater. American forces then placed a \"Machine Gun... in a position where it could sweep the crest of the mountain between us and the cotta,\" murdering all Moros in the crater.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nOne account claims that the Moros, armed with knives and spears, refused to surrender and held their positions. Some of the defenders rushed the Americans and were cut down by artillery fire. The Americans charged the surviving Moros with fixed bayonets, and the Moros fought back with their [[kalis]], [[barung]], improvised [[grenades]] made with [[black powder]] and seashells. Despite the inconsistencies among various accounts of the battle, one in which all occupants of Bud Dajo were gunned down, another in which defenders resisted in fierce hand-to-hand combat, all accounts agree that few, if any, Moros survived.<ref name=\"bakbakan1\" />\n\nIn response to criticism, Wood's explanation of the high number of women and children killed stated that the women of Bud Dajo dressed as men and joined in the combat, and that the men used children as living shields.<ref name=lane1978p129>{{harvnb|Lane|1978|p=129}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Gregg|title=Honor in the Dust: Theodore Roosevelt, War in the Philippines, and the Rise and Fall of America's Imperial Dream|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jVooDgAAQBAJ|year=2013|publisher=New American Library|isbn=978-0-451-23918-1|pages=353\u2013354, 420}}</ref> Hagedorn supports this explanation, by presenting an account of Lieutenant [[Gordon Johnston (soldier)|Gordon Johnston]], who was allegedly severely wounded by a female warrior.<ref name=hagedorn1931p64 /> \n\nA second explanation was given by the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], [[Henry Clay Ide]], who reported that the women and children were [[collateral damage]], having been killed during the artillery barrages.<ref name=lane1978p129 /> These conflicting explanations of the high number of women and child casualties brought accusations of a cover-up, further adding fire to the criticism.<ref name=lane1978p129 /> Furthermore, Wood's and Ide's explanation are at odds with Colonel J.W. Duncan's post-action report authored on March 12th, 1906,  describing the placement of a [[machine-gun]] at the edge of the crater to fire upon the occupants. Following Duncan's reports, the high number of non-combatants killed can be explained as the result of indiscriminate machine-gun fire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite President McKinley's proclamation of \"benevolent assimilation\" of the Philippines as a U.S. Territory, American treatment of Philippine soldiers and civilians was far from being benevolent. General [[Elwell Stephen Otis]] controlled the flow of information by journalists, often through violent methods, in order to maintain American support for the war.

An explanation given for why the US military has no record of any rapes is that few Okinawan women reported abuse, mostly out of fear and embarrassment. According to an [[Okinawa]]n police spokesman: \"Victimized women feel too ashamed to make it public.\"<ref name=\"okinawa\"/> Those who did report them are believed by historians to have been ignored by the U.S. military police. Many people wondered why it never came to light after the inevitable American-Japanese babies the many women must have given birth to. In interviews, historians and Okinawan elders said that some of those Okinawan women who were raped and did not commit suicide did give birth to biracial children, but that many of them were immediately killed or left behind out of shame, disgust or fearful trauma. More often, however, rape victims underwent crude abortions with the help of village midwives. A large scale effort to determine the possible extent of these crimes has never been conducted. Over five decades after the war had ended, in the late-1990s, the women who were believed to have been raped still overwhelmingly refused to give public statements, instead speaking through relatives and a number of historians and scholars.<ref name=\"okinawa\"/>\n\nThere is substantial evidence that the U.S. had at least some knowledge of what was going on. Samuel Saxton, a retired captain, explained that the American veterans and witnesses may have intentionally kept the rape a secret, largely out of shame: \"It would be unfair for the public to get the impression that we were all a bunch of rapists after we worked so hard to serve our country.\"<ref name=\"okinawa\"/> Military officials formally denied the mass rapes, and all surviving related veterans refused the ''New York Times'' request for an interview. Masaie Ishihara, a sociology professor, supports this: \"There is a lot of historical amnesia out there, many people don't want to acknowledge what really happened.\"<ref name=\"okinawa\"/> Author George Feifer noted in his book ''Tennozan: The Battle of Okinawa and the Atomic Bomb'',  that by 1946 there had been fewer than 10 reported cases of rape in Okinawa.

In interviews with his biographer Charles Brandt, Sheeran recalled his war service with the [[Thunderbird Division]] as the time when he first developed a callousness to the taking of human life. By his own admission, Sheeran participated in numerous massacres and summary executions of German POWs, acts which violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] and the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on POWs]]. In his interviews with Brandt, Sheeran divided such massacres into four different categories.\n:1. Revenge killings in the heat of battle. Sheeran told Brandt that, when a German soldier had just killed his close friends and then tried to surrender, he would often \"send him to hell, too.\" He described often witnessing similar behavior by fellow [[GI (military)|GIs]].<ref name=\"Brandt, (2004) p. 50\">Brandt (2004), , ''I Heard You Paint Houses'', p.&nbsp;50</ref>\n:2.

The female cooks were first allowed to leave unmolested, then Sheeran and his fellow GI's \"ate what we wanted and soiled the rest with our waste.\" Then the Wehrmacht mule drivers were given shovels and ordered to \"dig their own shallow graves.\" Sheeran later joked that they did so without complaint, likely hoping that he and his buddies would change their minds.
