Out of 89,000  [[Slovak Jews|Jews]] in the country in 1940, around 69,000 were murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn 1938, Slovakia lost significant territory to Hungary according to the [[First Vienna Award]]; the following year, the ruling [[ethnonationalist]] [[Slovak People's Party]] declared independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] with German protection. Slovak propaganda blamed the Jews for the territorial losses. Jews were targeted for discrimination and harassment, including the [[Aryanization in Slovakia|confiscation of property and businesses]]. The exclusion of Jews from the economy impoverished the community, which encouraged the government to conscript them for forced labor. \n\nIn 1941, the Slovak government negotiated with Nazi Germany for the mass deportation of Jews to [[German-occupied Poland]]. Between March and October 1942, [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|58,000 Jews were deported]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] in German-occupied Poland; only a few hundred survived. The Slovak government organized the transports and paid 500 [[Reichsmarks]] per Jew for the supposed cost of resettlement. The persecution of Jews resumed in August 1944, when [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]] and triggered the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. Another 13,500 Jews were deported and hundreds to thousands were murdered in Slovakia by [[Einsatzgruppe H]] and the [[Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions]].\n\nSurvivors faced [[secondary antisemitism|renewed antisemitism]] and difficulty regaining stolen property; most emigrated. The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|postwar Communist regime]] banned discussion of the Holocaust, the ban was only removed after the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of the Communist regime]] in 1989. The Slovak government's complicity in the Holocaust remains a contentious issue in the country.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{further|History of the Jews in Slovakia}}\n\n[[File:Synagogue Zilina 1931.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New Synagogue (\u017dilina)|New Synagogue]] in [[\u017dilina]] shortly after completion, c. 1931]]\nBefore 1939, Slovakia had never been an independent country.

propaganda poster exhorts readers not to \"be a servant to the Jew\".|upright=1.2]]\n{{The Holocaust sidebar}}\n'''The Holocaust in Slovakia''' was the systematic dispossession, deportation, and murder of Jews in the [[Slovak State]], a [[client state]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. Out of 89,000  [[Slovak Jews|Jews]] in the country in 1940, around 69,000 were murdered during the [[Holocaust]].\n\nIn 1938, Slovakia lost significant territory to Hungary according to the [[First Vienna Award]]; the following year, the ruling [[ethnonationalist]] [[Slovak People's Party]] declared independence from [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] with German protection. Slovak propaganda blamed the Jews for the territorial losses. Jews were targeted for discrimination and harassment, including the [[Aryanization in Slovakia|confiscation of property and businesses]]. The exclusion of Jews from the economy impoverished the community, which encouraged the government to conscript them for forced labor. \n\nIn 1941, the Slovak government negotiated with Nazi Germany for the mass deportation of Jews to [[German-occupied Poland]]. Between March and October 1942, [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|58,000 Jews were deported]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] in German-occupied Poland; only a few hundred survived. The Slovak government organized the transports and paid 500 [[Reichsmarks]] per Jew for the supposed cost of resettlement. The persecution of Jews resumed in August 1944, when [[German occupation of Slovakia|Germany invaded Slovakia]] and triggered the [[Slovak National Uprising]]. Another 13,500 Jews were deported and hundreds to thousands were murdered in Slovakia by [[Einsatzgruppe H]] and the [[Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions]].\n\nSurvivors faced [[secondary antisemitism|renewed antisemitism]] and difficulty regaining stolen property; most emigrated. The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|postwar Communist regime]] banned discussion of the Holocaust, the ban was only removed after the [[Velvet Revolution|fall of the Communist regime]] in 1989.

She was under the command of Captain [[John Thompson (ship captain)|John Thompson]] and carried about 70 people.\n\nThe ship carried several passengers, including ex-convicts who had completed their transportation sentences and four or five New Zealanders who were returning to their homeland. Among the latter was Te Ara, or Tarrah, known to the crew as George, the son of a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] from Whangaroa. Te Ara had spent more than a year on board different vessels that included a sealing expedition to islands in the [[Southern Ocean]].\n\nOn the ''Boyd'' he was expected to work his passage on the ship. Some accounts state that he declined to do so because he was ill or because of his status as a chief's son.<ref name=\"homepages.ihug.co.nz\">{{Cite web |url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~tonyf/loot/boyd.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2003-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609212225/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~tonyf/loot/boyd.html |archive-date=2011-06-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"homepages.ihug.co.nz\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea W.H.G.

Te Ara regained the confidence of the captain and persuaded him to put into Whangaroa Bay, assuring him that it was the best place to secure the timber he desired.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nUpon reaching Whangaroa, Te Ara reported his indignities to his tribe and displayed the whip marks on his back. In accordance with M\u0101ori customs, they formed a plan for ''utu''. Under British law, whipping was the common punishment for minor crimes - A British person could be legally hanged for stealing goods to the value of 5 shillings. In M\u0101ori culture, however, the son of a chief was a privileged figure who did not bow to an outsider's authority. Physical punishment of his son caused the chief to suffer a loss of face (or \"[[mana]]\"), and to M\u0101ori this warranted a violent retribution.\n\n==Killings==\nThree days after the ''Boyd's'' arrival, the M\u0101ori invited Captain Thompson to follow their canoes to find suitable kauri trees. Thompson, his chief officer and three others followed the canoes to the entrance of the [[Kaeo River]].

Other M\u0101ori canoes awaited the signal to attack. The first to die was a ship's officer: the attackers then crept around the deck, stealthily killing all the crew. The passengers were called to the deck and then killed. Five people hid up the mast among the rigging, where they witnessed the dismembering of their friends and colleagues' bodies below.\n\nThe next morning the survivors saw a large canoe carrying chief [[Te Pahi]] from the Bay of Islands enter the harbour. The chief had come to the area to trade with the Whangaroa M\u0101ori. The Europeans called out to Te Pahi's canoe for help. After Te Pahi had gathered the survivors from the ''Boyd'', they headed for shore. But two Whangaroa canoes pursued them. As the survivors fled along the beach, Te Pahi watched as all but one were caught and killed by the pursuers.\n\n==European survivors==\n\nFive people were spared in the [[massacre]]: Ann Morley and her baby, in a cabin; apprentice Thomas Davis (or Davison), hidden in the hold; the second mate; and two-year-old Betsy Broughton, taken by a local chief who put a feather in her hair and kept her for three weeks before rescue.

They spent several days ransacking the ship, tossing flour, salt pork, and bottled wine overboard. The M\u0101ori were interested in a large cache of muskets and gunpowder.\n\nAbout 20 M\u0101ori smashed barrels of gunpowder and attempted to make the muskets functional. Chief Piopio sparked a flint. This ignited the gunpowder, causing a massive explosion that killed him and nine other M\u0101ori instantly. A fire then swept the ship igniting its cargo of whale oil. Soon all that was left of the ''Boyd'' was a burnt-out sunken hull. M\u0101ori declared the hull [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]], sacred or prohibited.\n\n==Rescue==\n\nWhen news of the massacre reached European settlements, Captain [[Alexander Berry]] undertook a rescue mission aboard ''The City of Edinburgh.'' Berry rescued the four survivors: Ann Morley and her baby, Thomas Davis (or Davison), and Betsy Broughton.\n\nThe ''City of Edinburgh'' crew found piles of human bones on the shoreline, with many evincing cannibalism.<ref name=\"McNab10\">McNab quotes Captain Berry saying, \"We had seen the mangled fragments and fresh bones of our countrymen, with the marks even of the teeth remaining on them\".

She was under the command of Captain [[John Thompson (ship captain)|John Thompson]] and carried about 70 people.\n\nThe ship carried several passengers, including ex-convicts who had completed their transportation sentences and four or five New Zealanders who were returning to their homeland. Among the latter was Te Ara, or Tarrah, known to the crew as George, the son of a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] from Whangaroa. Te Ara had spent more than a year on board different vessels that included a sealing expedition to islands in the [[Southern Ocean]].\n\nOn the ''Boyd'' he was expected to work his passage on the ship. Some accounts state that he declined to do so because he was ill or because of his status as a chief's son.<ref name=\"homepages.ihug.co.nz\">{{Cite web |url=http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~tonyf/loot/boyd.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2003-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609212225/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~tonyf/loot/boyd.html |archive-date=2011-06-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"homepages.ihug.co.nz\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Shipwrecks and Disasters at Sea W.H.G.

Te Ara regained the confidence of the captain and persuaded him to put into Whangaroa Bay, assuring him that it was the best place to secure the timber he desired.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nUpon reaching Whangaroa, Te Ara reported his indignities to his tribe and displayed the whip marks on his back. In accordance with M\u0101ori customs, they formed a plan for ''utu''. Under British law, whipping was the common punishment for minor crimes. A British person could be legally hanged for stealing goods to the value of 5 shillings. In M\u0101ori culture the son of a chief was a privileged figure who did not bow to an outsider's authority. Physical punishment of his son caused the chief to suffer a loss of face (or \"[[mana]]\"), and to M\u0101ori this warranted a violent retribution.\n\n==Killings==\nThree days after the ''Boyd's'' arrival, the M\u0101ori invited Captain Thompson to follow their canoes to find suitable kauri trees. Thompson, his chief officer and three others followed the canoes to the entrance of the [[Kaeo River]].

It is produced by [[Laika (company)|Laika]]. It stars the voices of [[Charlize Theron]], [[Art Parkinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[George Takei]], [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]]. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical [[shamisen]] (a Japanese [[stringed instrument]]) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden the Moon King, who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\n''Kubo'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim, but was considered a box-office disappointment, grossing $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first film to be nominated for both.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n\nIn [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and Sariatu cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the \"Sword Unbreakable\" from a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]]. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who first uses its many eyes to entrance its victims by showing them visions of secrets, then eats them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and defeating Karasu.\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Beetle. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Kubo\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Monkey / Sariatu\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Beetle / Hanzo\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Raiden the Moon King\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Karasu and Washi the Sisters\n* [[George Takei]] as Hosato\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Kameyo\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Hashi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]\nAnnounced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika & Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|accessdate=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Laika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the story to Knight as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\".

It is produced by [[Laika (company)|Laika]]. It stars the voices of [[Charlize Theron]], [[Art Parkinson]], [[Ralph Fiennes]], [[George Takei]], [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]], [[Brenda Vaccaro]], [[Rooney Mara]], and [[Matthew McConaughey]]. The film revolves around Kubo, a young boy who wields a magical [[shamisen]] (a Japanese [[stringed instrument]]) and whose left eye was stolen during infancy. Accompanied by an anthropomorphic [[snow monkey]] and [[beetle]], he must subdue his mother's corrupted Sisters and his power-hungry grandfather Raiden the Moon King, who is responsible for stealing his left eye.\n\n''Kubo'' premiered at [[Melbourne International Film Festival]] and was released by [[Focus Features]] in the United States on August 19 to critical acclaim, but was considered a box-office disappointment, grossing $77 million worldwide against a budget of $60 million. The film won the [[BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film]], and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], becoming the second animated film ever to be nominated in the latter category following 1993's ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', and the first film to be nominated for both.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be between 400 and 700 words. Please do not add more detail to this summary. -->\n\nIn [[feudal Japan]], 12-year-old eyepatched Kubo tends to his ill mother Sariatu in a mountain cave near a village. He earns their living by magically manipulating [[origami]] with music from his [[shamisen]] for the village folk, telling the tale of his missing father Hanzo, a [[samurai]] warrior. Kubo is never able to finish his story, as he does not know what happened to Hanzo and Sariatu cannot recall the end due to her deteriorating mental state. Sariatu warns him not to stay out after dark as her Sisters, Karasu and Washi, and his grandfather, the Moon King (who took his eye when he was a baby) will find him and take his remaining eye.\n\nOne day, Kubo learns of the village's [[Bon Festival|Bon festival]] allowing them to speak to deceased loved ones. Kubo attends but is angry that Hanzo does not appear from his lantern, and forgets to return home before sunset. Karasu and Washi quickly find him and attack, but Sariatu suddenly appears and uses her magic to send Kubo far away, telling him to find his father's armor.\n\nKubo wakes up in a distant land to find Monkey, his wooden [[Japanese macaque|snow monkey]] charm, has come alive. Monkey tells him Sariatu is gone and the village destroyed. With help of \"Little Hanzo\", an origami figure based on Kubo's father, they set out to find the armor. Along the way, they meet Beetle, an [[amnesia]]c samurai who was cursed to take the form of a [[stag beetle]]/human hybrid but believes himself to have been Hanzo's apprentice.\n\nKubo, Monkey, and Beetle reclaim the \"Sword Unbreakable\" from a cave guarded by a [[Gashadokuro|giant skeleton]]. They cross the Long Lake in a leaf boat to locate the \"Breastplate Impenetrable\" deep underwater. Kubo and Beetle swim down to retrieve it and encounter a sea monster, the \"Garden of Eyes\", who first uses its many eyes to entrance its victims by showing them visions of secrets, then eats them. Kubo is caught in the creature's sight, but while entranced, comes to realize that Monkey is the reincarnated spirit of his mother. Beetle rescues the unconscious Kubo and obtains the Breastplate, but on returning to the boat, they find that Monkey has been badly wounded fighting and defeating Karasu.\n\nThey go to shore to recover, where Monkey explains that she and her Sisters were ordered by the Moon King to kill Hanzo, but she instead fell in love with him, and the Moon King branded her an enemy. That night, Kubo dreams of meeting Raiden, a blind elderly man, who points him towards the \"Helmet Invulnerable\" in Hanzo's abandoned fortress. They travel there the next day but realize too late it is a trap set by the Moon King and Washi. Washi reveals that Beetle is Hanzo, whom they cursed for taking Sariatu away from them, and kills Beetle. Monkey sacrifices herself, buying Kubo the time to use his shamisen to defeat Washi, breaking two of the three strings on it. Little Hanzo provides insight that the Helmet is actually the bell at the village, and Kubo breaks the last string to quickly travel there.\n\nAt the village, Kubo meets Raiden, who is revealed as the Moon King. He offers to take Kubo's other eye to make him immortal, but Kubo refuses. Raiden transforms into a giant ''[[Dunkleosteus]]''-like dragon, the Moon Beast, and pursues Kubo and the remaining villagers into its cemetery. When Hanzo's armor proves ineffective, Kubo removes it and restrings his shamisen using his mother's hair, his father's bowstring, and his own hair. With the instrument, he summons the spirits of the villagers' loved ones, who show the Moon Beast that memories are the strongest magic of all and can never be destroyed. Kubo and the spirits' magic protect themselves and the villagers from the Moon Beast, stripping him of his powers and leaving him a mortal human without any memories. Spurred on by Kubo's stories, the villagers take compassion and tell Raiden he was a man of many positive traits, accepting him into the village. Kubo is able to speak to his parents' ghosts during the subsequent Bon ceremony, as they watch the deceased villagers' lanterns transform into golden herons and fly to the spirit world.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Art Parkinson]] as Kubo\n* [[Charlize Theron]] as Monkey / Sariatu\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Beetle / Hanzo\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as Raiden the Moon King\n* [[Rooney Mara]] as Karasu and Washi the Sisters\n* [[George Takei]] as Hosato\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Kameyo\n* [[Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa]] as Hashi\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre.jpg|thumb|''[[Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Spectre]]'' by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] inspired the giant skeleton.]]\nAnnounced in December 2014, the project is the directoral debut of Laika's CEO [[Travis Knight]].<ref name=\"Deadline1\">{{cite news|last1=Hammond|first1=Pete|title=Laika & Focus Begin Production On All-Star 'Kubo And The Two Strings' To Kick Off 3-Pic Deal|url=https://deadline.com/2014/12/laika-focus-three-picture-pact-kubo-and-the-two-strings-1201333450/|accessdate=January 15, 2015|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 22, 2014}}</ref> Laika's production designer [[Shannon Tindle]] pitched the story to Knight as a \"stop-motion samurai epic\".

However, they are discovered by the ''Bergens'', large, ugly, miserable creatures who can only feel happy by consuming a Troll. The Bergens imprison the trolls and eat them every year on a special occasion, called \"Trollstice\". The Trolls, led by their king, King Peppy, with his infant daughter, Princess Poppy, escape through tunnels on the day of Trollstice when Prince Gristle Jr. was going to eat his first Troll. Enraged, Gristle Jr.\u2019s father King Gristle Sr. banishes his Chef, who was in charge of preparing for Trollstice. Chef promises to leave and find the Trolls herself.\n\nTwenty years later, the now-adult Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the warnings of the over-cautious and egotistical gray troll, Branch, that loud parties will attract the Bergens. A \"Zen\" troll named Creek arrives and tells Branch to start being happy instead of being grumpy; Branch refuses. At the party, Branch's warnings come true when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Poppy's friends Guy Diamond, Biggie with Mr. Dinkles, Fuzzbert, Smidge, Satin with Chenille, DJ Suki, and Cooper, along with Creek, despite Poppy trying to rescue him and King Peppy. Chef takes the kidnapped Trolls back to Bergen Town while secretly plotting to overthrow its monarchy as revenge for her exile.\n\nMeanwhile, Poppy goes on a rescue mission alone, as no other troll is willing to venture towards Bergen Town. But later on, when Poppy gets into trouble, she is saved by Branch who thinks she will not make it if she goes alone. Once inside the Bergen king's castle, Poppy and Branch witness the now-King Gristle Jr. seemingly eat Creek, but Poppy remains hopeful that Creek survived. Poppy and Branch find the rest of the captured Trolls being guarded by a scullery maid named Bridget. Poppy discovers that Bridget is secretly in love with King Gristle Jr. and offers to help her get a date with the king while trying to confirm if Creek is alive.\n\nWhile setting Bridget up for the date with a musical number, Branch refuses to sing and triggers an argument with Poppy, revealing that, as a child, his grandmother was captured and got eaten while trying to save him, because his singing compromised his location to Chef. Branch's complete guilt over his grandmother's death caused his color to turn from blue to gray.\n\nAfter Poppy comforts him with a hug, Branch decides to help Bridget and the trolls, though he still refuses to sing. Bridget, disguised under the name of \"Lady Glittersparkles\" gets her date with Gristle Jr. at a [[roller rink]] and [[amusement arcade|arcade restaurant]] and Gristle Jr. asks her to be his \"plus one\" at Trollstice. Poppy notices Creek being held captive inside the jewel adorning the king's mantle.\n\nHaving helped Bridget, the Trolls attempt to rescue Creek from Gristle's room and steal his jewel but discover that it is empty. The Trolls are then captured by Chef, and Poppy gets shocked to discover that Creek sold them out to the Bergens to spare himself from being eaten. Creek lures out every troll from Troll Village (via Poppy's cowbell) and they are captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured, thrown into a pot and soon to be eaten, a heartbroken Poppy falls into despair and loses hope as she and all the other Trolls turn gray.\n\nBranch tries to sing \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" for Poppy to cheer her up, confessing his love for her. Poppy, after regaining her colors, returns his feelings, and they restore all the trolls' colors, including Branch's. Bridget saves the trolls, willing to sacrifice herself. Poppy can't bring herself to abandon Bridget and, with Branch and her friends, shows Gristle Jr. and the Bergens that Bridget is Lady Glittersparkles and that it is not necessary to eat Trolls to be happy, and they too, can find happiness within themselves.\n\nThe vengeful Chef refuses to accept the peace and tries to kill the Trolls, but is knocked into a serving cart that is sent rolling out of Bergen Town. Chef is set on fire with Creek, who was still in her pouch. Both species celebrate, bringing new life to the town. Poppy is then declared queen of the Trolls, and Poppy and Branch share a friendly hug.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Chef and Creek's cart stops rolling. Chef prepares to eat Creek herself, but they soon find out they are on top of a monster, who opens his mouth and eats them both.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|direction = horizontal\n|image1    = Anna Kendrick Cannes 2016.jpg\n|width1    = 149\n|alt1      = Anna Kendrick\n|image2    = Justin Timberlake Cannes 2016.jpg\n|width2    = 130\n|alt2      = Justin Timberlake\n|footer    = Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake at the film's preview at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=Richard|last2=Miller|first2=Julie|title=What Happened When Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, and Trolls Came to Cannes|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/anna-kendrick-justin-timberlake-trolls-cannes|accessdate=July 24, 2016|work=Vanity Fair|date=May 12, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Poppy, the princess, and later queen, of the Trolls.   <ref name=DeadlineTimberlake /><ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=119556 |title=Anna Kendrick to Voice DreamWorks Animation's Trolls |publisher=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"twitter1\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AnnaKendrick47/status/684782188907237376 |title=Hair we go!

A sequel, ''[[Trolls World Tour]]'', was released on April 10, 2020.\n\n==Plot==   \n<!-- Please see WP:FILMPLOT before editing. Per key guideline, the plot summary should be within the desired length of 400-700 words. -->\nThe Trolls are small, colorful creatures who live in an almost perpetual state of happiness, singing, dancing, hugging, and having fun all day. However, they are discovered by the ''Bergens'', large, ugly, miserable creatures who can only feel happy by consuming a Troll. The Bergens imprison the trolls and eat them every year on a special occasion, called \"Trollstice\". The Trolls, led by their king, King Peppy, with his infant daughter, Princess Poppy, escape through tunnels on the day of Trollstice when Prince Gristle Jr. was going to eat his first Troll. Enraged, Gristle Jr.\u2019s father King Gristle Sr. banishes his Chef, who was in charge of preparing for Trollstice. Chef promises to leave and find the Trolls herself.\n\nTwenty years later, the now-adult Poppy throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape, despite the warnings of the over-cautious and egotistical gray troll, Branch, that loud parties will attract the Bergens. A \"Zen\" troll named Creek arrives and tells Branch to start being happy instead of being grumpy; Branch refuses. At the party, Branch's warnings come true when Chef sees the fireworks and kidnaps Poppy's friends Guy Diamond, Biggie with Mr. Dinkles, Fuzzbert, Smidge, Satin with Chenille, DJ Suki, and Cooper, along with Creek, despite Poppy trying to rescue him and King Peppy. Chef takes the kidnapped Trolls back to Bergen Town while secretly plotting to overthrow its monarchy as revenge for her exile.\n\nMeanwhile, Poppy goes on a rescue mission alone, as no other troll is willing to venture towards Bergen Town. But later on, when Poppy gets into trouble, she is saved by Branch who thinks she will not make it if she goes alone. Once inside the Bergen king's castle, Poppy and Branch witness the now-King Gristle Jr. seemingly eat Creek, but Poppy remains hopeful that Creek survived. Poppy and Branch find the rest of the captured Trolls being guarded by a scullery maid named Bridget. Poppy discovers that Bridget is secretly in love with King Gristle Jr. and offers to help her get a date with the king while trying to confirm if Creek is alive.\n\nWhile setting Bridget up for the date with a musical number, Branch refuses to sing and triggers an argument with Poppy, revealing that, as a child, his grandmother was captured and got eaten while trying to save him, because his singing compromised his location to Chef. Branch's complete guilt over his grandmother's death caused his color to turn from blue to gray.\n\nAfter Poppy comforts him with a hug, Branch decides to help Bridget and the trolls, though he still refuses to sing. Bridget, disguised under the name of \"Lady Glittersparkles\" gets her date with Gristle Jr. at a [[roller rink]] and [[amusement arcade|arcade restaurant]] and Gristle Jr. asks her to be his \"plus one\" at Trollstice. Poppy notices Creek being held captive inside the jewel adorning the king's mantle.\n\nHaving helped Bridget, the Trolls attempt to rescue Creek from Gristle's room and steal his jewel but discover that it is empty. The Trolls are then captured by Chef, and Poppy gets shocked to discover that Creek sold them out to the Bergens to spare himself from being eaten. Creek lures out every troll from Troll Village (via Poppy's cowbell) and they are captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured, thrown into a pot and soon to be eaten, a heartbroken Poppy falls into despair and loses hope as she and all the other Trolls turn gray.\n\nBranch tries to sing \"[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]\" for Poppy to cheer her up, confessing his love for her. Poppy, after regaining her colors, returns his feelings, and they restore all the trolls' colors, including Branch's. Bridget saves the trolls, willing to sacrifice herself. Poppy can't bring herself to abandon Bridget and, with Branch and her friends, shows Gristle Jr. and the Bergens that Bridget is Lady Glittersparkles and that it is not necessary to eat Trolls to be happy, and they too, can find happiness within themselves.\n\nThe vengeful Chef refuses to accept the peace and tries to kill the Trolls, but is knocked into a serving cart that is sent rolling out of Bergen Town. Chef is set on fire with Creek, who was still in her pouch. Both species celebrate, bringing new life to the town. Poppy is then declared queen of the Trolls, and Poppy and Branch share a friendly hug.\n\nIn a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Chef and Creek's cart stops rolling. Chef prepares to eat Creek herself, but they soon find out they are on top of a monster, who opens his mouth and eats them both.\n\n==Cast==\n{{multiple image\n|direction = horizontal\n|image1    = Anna Kendrick Cannes 2016.jpg\n|width1    = 149\n|alt1      = Anna Kendrick\n|image2    = Justin Timberlake Cannes 2016.jpg\n|width2    = 130\n|alt2      = Justin Timberlake\n|footer    = Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake at the film's preview at the [[2016 Cannes Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=Richard|last2=Miller|first2=Julie|title=What Happened When Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, and Trolls Came to Cannes|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/anna-kendrick-justin-timberlake-trolls-cannes|accessdate=July 24, 2016|work=Vanity Fair|date=May 12, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Poppy, the princess, and later queen, of the Trolls.   <ref name=DeadlineTimberlake /><ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=119556 |title=Anna Kendrick to Voice DreamWorks Animation's Trolls |publisher=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=June 17, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"twitter1\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AnnaKendrick47/status/684782188907237376 |title=Hair we go!

Lake]], who continued to develop the community by adding a grist mill, kiln, and livery stable to the hotel and eating house. He renamed it \"Lake's Crossing\". Most of what is present-day western Nevada was formed as the [[Nevada Territory]] from part of [[Utah Territory]] in 1861.\n\nBy January 1863, the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] (CPRR) had begun laying tracks east from [[Sacramento, California]], eventually connecting with the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah]], to form the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]].

They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the [[Great Basin]]. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.\n\nThe [[Truckee River]] is Reno's primary source of drinking water. It supplies Reno with {{convert|80|e6U.S.gal|lk=out}} of water a day during the summer, and {{convert|40|e6U.S.gal}} of water per day in the winter. Before the water goes to the homes around the Reno area, it must go to one of two [[water treatment]] plants, Chalk Bluff or Glendale Water Treatment Plant. To help save water, golf courses in Reno have been using treated effluent water rather than treated water from one of Reno's water plants.\n\nThe Reno-Sparks [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plant discharges tertiary treated effluent to the Truckee River. In the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30&nbsp;million U.S. gallons (70 to 110&nbsp;million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. Local agencies working with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge.

Annual rainfall averages {{convert|7.48|in|mm|0}}. Reno features a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''BSk)'' due to its low [[evapotranspiration]]. The city experiences cool to cold winters, and hot summers. Annual precipitation has ranged from {{convert|1.55|in|mm|1}} in 1947 to {{convert|13.23|in|mm|1}} in 1983. The most precipitation in one month was {{convert|5.25|in|mm|1}} in December 1955 and the most precipitation in 24 hours was {{convert|2.29|in|mm|1}} on January 21, 1943. Winter has snowfall which is usually light to moderate but can be heavy some days, averaging {{convert|21.5|in|cm|0}} annually. Snowfall varies with the lowest amounts (roughly 19\u201323&nbsp;inches annually) at the lowest part of the valley at and east of the [[Reno\u2013Tahoe International Airport]] at {{convert|4404|ft}}, while the foothills of the [[Carson Range]] to the west ranging from {{convert|4700|to|5600|ft}} in elevation just a few miles west of downtown can receive up to two to three times as much annual snowfall. The mountains of the [[Virginia Range]] to the east can receive more summer thunderstorms and precipitation, and around twice as much annual snowfall above {{convert|5500|ft}}. However, snowfall increases in the Virginia Range are less dramatic as elevation climbs than in the Carson Range to the west, because the Virginia Range is well within the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada and Carson Range. The most snowfall in the city in one year was {{convert|63.8|in|cm|0}} in 1971, and the most snowfall in one month was {{convert|29.0|in|cm|0}} in March 1952.\n[[File:Crepuscular Rays Reno Nevada USA.jpg|left|thumb|[[Crepuscular rays|Crepuscular Rays]] Sunset Reno Nevada USA]]\nMost [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]] occurs in winter and spring. The city has 300 days of sunshine per year. Summer thunderstorms can occur between April and October. The eastern side of town and the mountains east of Reno tend to be prone to thunderstorms more often, and these storms may be severe because an afternoon downslope west wind, called a \"[[Washoe Zephyr]]\", can develop in the Sierra Nevada, causing air to be pulled down in the Sierra Nevada and Reno, destroying or preventing thunderstorms, but the same wind can push air upward against the Virginia Range and other mountain ranges east of Reno, creating powerful thunderstorms.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reno, NV|url=http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106184552/http://www.visitrenotahoe.com/destination/reno|url-status=live|archive-date=January 6, 2009|publisher=Reno Tahoe Visitors website|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=Brian O'Hara|author2=Gary Barbato|author3=John James|author4=Heather Angeloff|author5=Tom Cylke|title=Weather and Climate of the Reno-Carson City-Lake Tahoe Region|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BWgg69xcGsC&pg=PA71|year=2007|publisher=NV Bureau of Mines & Geology|isbn=978-1-888035-11-7|page=71}}</ref>\n\nThe monthly daily average temperature ranges from {{convert|35.3|\u00b0F|1}} in December to {{convert|74.9|\u00b0F|1}} in July, with the [[diurnal temperature variation]] reaching {{convert|40|F-change}} in summer, still lower than much of the high desert to the east.

These larger hotel casinos are the [[Atlantis Casino Resort|Atlantis]], the [[Peppermill Reno|Peppermill]] and the [[Grand Sierra Resort]].

The [[city council]] is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the [[primary election|primary]] by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the citywide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.\n\nThere is an elected [[city attorney]] who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.\n\nThe city's charter calls for a [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government, meaning the council appoints only two positions, the [[city manager]], who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the [[city clerk]]. The city manager is in charge of the budget and workforce for all city programs. The city clerk, who records the proceedings of the council, makes appointments for the council, and makes sure efficient copying and printing services are available.\n\nIn 2010, there was a ballot question asking whether the Reno city government and the Washoe County government should explore the idea of becoming one combined governmental body.<ref>{{cite news |title=Combining local governments is questioned on ballot issue |first=Susan |last=Voyles |date=October 24, 2010 |work=Reno Gazette-Journal |page=10A}}</ref> Fifty-four&nbsp;percent of voters approved of the ballot measure to make an inquiry into consolidating the governments.<ref>{{cite news |title=Election Results: Nevada |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/nevada }}</ref>\n\n===Fire department===\nThe city of Reno is protected by the [[Reno Fire Department]] (RFD) manning 14 fire stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=189 |title=City of Reno : Fire Department |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118012232/https://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=189 |archivedate=January 18, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reno.gov/index.aspx?page=253 |title=City of Reno : Administration |publisher=Reno.gov |date=2013-03-20 |accessdate=2013-05-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119161713/http://reno.gov/index.aspx?page=253 |archivedate=January 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe Reno Fire Department (RFD) provides all-risk emergency service to the City of Reno residents.

This is the highest level of emergency medical care available in the field.\n\nIn addition to responding to fires, whether they occur in structures, vegetation/brush or vehicles, the fire department also provides rescue capabilities for almost any type of emergency situation.\n\nThis includes quick and efficient emergency medical care for the citizens; a hazardous materials team capable of identifying unknown materials and controlling a release disaster; and preparedness and management of large-scale incidents.\n\nMaintaining this level of service requires nearly constant training of personnel. This training maintains both the skills needed to operate safely in emergency environments and the physical fitness necessary to reduce the likelihood and severity of injuries.\n\nThe minimum annual-training requirement to maintain firefighting and medical skills is 240 hours per year.

They act as a natural filter for the solids that come out of the water treatment plant. Plant roots absorb nutrients from the water and naturally filter it. Wetlands are home to over 75% of the species in the [[Great Basin]]. However, the area's wetlands are at risk of being destroyed due to development around the city. While developers build on top of the wetlands they fill them with dirt, destroying the habitat they create for the plants and animals. Washoe County has devised a plan that will help protect these ecosystems: mitigation. In the future, when developers try to build over a wetland, they will be responsible for creating another wetland near Washoe Lake.\n\nThe [[Truckee River]] is Reno's primary source of drinking water. It supplies Reno with {{convert|80|e6U.S.gal|lk=out}} of water a day during the summer, and {{convert|40|e6U.S.gal}} of water per day in the winter. Before the water goes to the homes around the Reno area, it must go to one of two [[water treatment]] plants, Chalk Bluff or Glendale Water Treatment Plant. To help save water, golf courses in Reno have been using treated effluent water rather than treated water from one of Reno's water plants.\n\nThe Reno-Sparks [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]] plant discharges tertiary treated effluent to the Truckee River. In the 1990s this capacity was increased from 20 to 30&nbsp;million U.S. gallons (70 to 110&nbsp;million liters) per day. While treated, the effluent contains suspended solids, [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], aggravating water quality concerns of the river and its receiving waters of [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. Local agencies working with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] have developed several watershed management strategies to accommodate this expanded discharge. To accomplish this successful outcome, the [[DSSAM Model]] was developed and calibrated for the Truckee River to analyze the most cost-effective available management strategy set.<ref>C.

Older casinos were torn down ([[Mapes Hotel]], [[Fitzgeralds Gaming|Fitzgerald's Nevada Club]], Primadonna, Horseshoe Club, [[Harold's Club]], Palace Club), or smaller casinos like the [[Comstock Hotel & Casino|Comstock]], Sundowner, [[The Montage Reno|Golden Phoenix]], Kings Inn, Money Tree, Virginian, and Riverboat were either closed or were converted into condos.\n\nBecause of its location, Reno has traditionally drawn the majority of its California tourists and gamblers from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and Sacramento, while [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]] has historically served more tourists from [[Southern California]] and the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] area.\n\nSeveral local large hotel casinos have shown significant growth and have moved gaming further away from the downtown core. These larger hotel casinos are the [[Atlantis Casino Resort|Atlantis]], the [[Peppermill Reno|Peppermill]] and the [[Grand Sierra Resort]]. The Peppermill was chosen as the most outstanding Reno gaming/hotel property by ''Casino Player'' and ''Nevada'' magazines.

The [[city council]] is the core of the government, with seven members. Five of these council people represent districts of Reno, and are vetted in the [[primary election|primary]] by the citizens of each district. In general, the top two vote earners in each ward make the ballot for the citywide election. The other two council members are the at-large member, who represents the entire city, and the mayor, who is elected by the people of the city. The council has several duties, including setting priorities for the city, promoting communication with the public, planning development, and redevelopment.\n\nThere is an elected [[city attorney]] who is responsible for civil and criminal cases. The City Attorney represents the city government in court, and prosecutes misdemeanors.\n\nThe city's charter calls for a [[council-manager government|council-manager]] form of government, meaning the council appoints only two positions, the [[city manager]], who implements and enforces the policies and programs the council approves, and the [[city clerk]].

This training maintains both the skills needed to operate safely in emergency environments and the physical fitness necessary to reduce the likelihood and severity of injuries.\n\nThe minimum annual-training requirement to maintain firefighting and medical skills is 240 hours per year.
