For the yard, the length of a [[pendulum]] beating [[second]]s at the latitude of Greenwich at [[Mean Sea Level]] ''in vacuo'' was defined as {{val|39.01393}} inches. For the pound, the mass of a cubic inch of distilled water at an [[atmospheric pressure]] of 30 [[inches of mercury]] and a temperature of 62\u00b0 [[Fahrenheit]] was defined as 252.458 grains, with there being 7,000 grains per pound.<ref name=\"google339\" />  Following the destruction of the original prototypes in the [[Burning of Parliament|1834 Houses of Parliament fire]], it proved impossible to recreate the standards from these definitions, and a new [[Weights and Measures Acts of 1878 to 1893|Weights and Measures Act]] (18 & 19 Victoria. Cap. 72) was passed in 1855 which permitted the recreation of the prototypes from recognized [[Standard (metrology)|secondary standards]].<ref name=\"Britain1855\" />\n\n== Relation to other systems ==\n[[File:English Length Units Graph.svg|thumb|English units of length]]\n\nThe imperial system is one of many systems of [[English units]]. Most of the units are defined in more than one system and some subsidiary units were used to a much greater extent, or for different purposes, in one area rather than the other. The distinctions between these systems are often not drawn precisely.\n\nOne such distinction is that between these systems and older British/English units/systems or newer additions. The term ''imperial'' should not be applied to English units that were outlawed in the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]] or earlier, or which had fallen out of use by that time, nor to post-imperial inventions, such as the [[slug (unit)|slug]] or [[poundal]].\n\nThe [[United States customary units|US customary system]] is historically derived from the English units that were in use at the time of settlement. Because the United States was already independent at the time, these units were unaffected by the introduction of the imperial system.\n\n== Current use ==\n[[Image:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|thumb|175px|A baby bottle that measures in three measurement systems\u2014metric, imperial (UK), and US customary.]]\n<!-- United States customary units are covered above. -->\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{see also|Metrication in the United Kingdom}}\nSince the [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]], British law defines base imperial units in terms of their metric equivalent and declares that none may be used \"for trade\" (except that milk, beer and cider may also be sold by the pint).

In writing, derived characters are often used, with an additional {{lang|zh|\u53e3}} (mouth) [[Kangxi radicals|radical]] to the left of the original Chinese character, for writing imperial units. The most commonly used units are the [[mile]] or \"li\" ({{lang|zh|\u54e9}}, ''li<sup>1</sup>''), the [[yard]] or \"ma\" ({{lang|zh|\u78bc}}, ''maa<sup>5</sup>''), the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or \"chek\" ({{lang|zh|\u544e}}, ''cek<sup>3</sup>''), and the [[inch]] or \"tsun\" ({{lang|zh|\u540b}}, ''cyun<sup>3</sup>'').\n\nThe traditional measure of flat area is the square foot ({{lang|zh|\u65b9\u544e, \u5e73\u65b9\u544e}}, ''fong<sup>1</sup> cek<sup>3</sup>, ping<sup>4</sup> fong<sup>1</sup> cek<sup>3</sup>'') of the imperial system, which is still in common use for real estate purposes. The measurement of agricultural plots and fields is traditionally conducted in {{lang|zh|\u755d}} (''mau<sup>5</sup>'') of the Chinese system.\n\nFor the measurement of volume, Hong Kong officially uses the metric system, though the gallon ({{lang|zh|\u52a0\u4f96}}, ''gaa<sup>1</sup> leon<sup>4-2</sup>'') is also occasionally used.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{See also|Metrication in Canada}}\n[[Image:GasCan.jpg|thumb|200px|A one US gallon gas can purchased near the US-Canada border. It shows equivalences in imperial gallons and litres.]]\nDuring the 1970s, the metric system and SI units were introduced in Canada to replace the imperial system. Within the government, efforts to implement the metric system were extensive; almost any agency, institution, or function provided by the government uses SI units exclusively. Imperial units were eliminated from all public road signs and both systems of measurement will still be found on privately owned signs, such as the height warnings at the entrance of a [[Multi-storey car park|parkade]]. In the 1980s, momentum to fully convert to the metric system stalled when the government of [[Brian Mulroney]] was elected. There was heavy opposition to metrication and as a compromise the government maintains legal definitions for and allows use of imperial units as long as metric units are shown as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc:2//en#anchorsc:2 |title=Weights and Measures Act: Canadian units of measure |publisher=Justice Canada |accessdate=14 November 2007 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605042528/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc%3A2//en |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n |chapter-url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch11e.shtml#11.2 \n |title=Guide to Food Labelling and Advertising \n |chapter=11 \n |publisher=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] \n |accessdate=1 December 2007 \n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124081159/http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch11e.shtml \n |archivedate=24 January 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._417/ |title=Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations (C.R.C., c. 417) |accessdate=15 November 2012 |publisher=Justice Canada, Legislative Services Branch}}</ref>\nThe law requires that measured products (such as fuel and meat) be priced in metric units and an imperial price can be shown if a metric price is present.<ref name=\"Canadian compromise\">\n{{cite web |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=1&IDClip=10620&IDCat=345&IDCatPa=261 |title=A Canadian compromise |accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=Jan 30, 1985 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116024023/http://archives.cbc.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=1&IDClip=10620&IDCat=345&IDCatPa=261 |archive-date=2009-01-16 |df=dmy-all}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Livre\">\n{{cite web |url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=0&IDClip=9378&IDCat=216&IDCatPa=151 |title=Les livres et les pieds, toujours pr\u00e9sents (eng:The pounds and feet, always present) |accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=5 sur 5, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 [[Radio-Canada]] |quote= |language=French\n}}</ref> There tends to be leniency in regards to fruits and vegetables being priced in imperial units only.\n[[Environment Canada]] still offers an imperial unit option beside metric units, even though weather is typically measured and reported in metric units in the Canadian media. Some radio stations near the United States border (such as [[CIMX]] and [[CIDR-FM|CIDR]]) primarily use imperial units to report the weather. Railways in Canada also continue to use Imperial units.\n\nImperial units are still used in ordinary conversation. Today, Canadians typically use a mix of metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. The use of the metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. [[Quebec]] has implemented metrication more fully. {{citation needed |date=July 2019}} Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units, though many English-speaking Canadians give their height and weight in imperial. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per [[hundredweight]] (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms.

For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the [[Prairie Provinces]]. In English-speaking Canada commercial and residential spaces are mostly (but not exclusively) constructed using square feet, while in French-speaking Quebec commercial and residential spaces are constructed in metres and advertised using both square metres and square feet as equivalents.

Imperial measures are still used in the description of cartridge types, even when the cartridge is of relatively recent invention (e.g., [[.204 Ruger]], [[.17 HMR]], where the calibre is expressed in decimal fractions of an inch). Ammunition that is already classified in metric is still kept metric (e.g., [[9\u00d719mm]]). In the manufacture of ammunition, bullet and powder weights are expressed in terms of [[grain (measure)|grains]] for both metric and imperial cartridges.\n\nAs in most of the western world, air navigation is based on ''nautical'' units, e.g., the nautical mile, which is neither imperial nor metric, though altitude is still measured in imperial feet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.langleyflyingschool.com/Pages/Canadian%20Aviation%20Regulations.html#Altimeter%20Rules|title=Canadian Aviation Regulations|website=Langley Flying School|at=sec. \"Altimeter Rules\"}}</ref> in keeping with the international standard.\n\n===Australia===\n[[Metrication in Australia]] has largely ended the official use of imperial units, though for particular measurements, international use of imperial units is still followed.

The imperial system remains in limited use \u2013 for sales of beer in pubs (traditionally sold by the pint). All other goods are required by law to be sold in metric units with traditional quantities being retained for goods like butter and sausages, which are sold in 454-gram (1&nbsp;lb) packaging. The majority of cars sold pre-2005 feature speedometers with miles per hour as the primary unit, but with a kilometres per hour display as well. often signs such as those for bridge height can display both metric and imperial units. Imperial measurements continue to be used colloquially by the general population especially with height and distance measurements such as feet, inches, and acres as well as for weight with pounds and stones still in common use among people of all ages. Measurements such as yards have fallen out of favour with younger generations. All of Ireland's railways still operate on imperial measurements and property is usually listed in square feet as well as metres also.\n\n===Other countries===\nSome imperial measurements remain in limited use in [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[South Africa]]. Measurements in feet and inches, especially for a person's height, are frequently encountered in conversation and non-governmental publications.\n\nPrior to metrication, it was a common practice in Malaysia for people to refer to unnamed locations and small settlements along major roads by referring to how many miles the said locations were from the nearest major town. In some cases, these eventually became the official names of the locations; in other cases, such names have been largely or completely superseded by new names. An example of the former is Batu 32 (literally \"Mile 32\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]), which refers to the area surrounding the intersection between [[Malaysia Federal Route 22|Federal Route 22]] (the [[Tamparuli]]-[[Sandakan]] highway) and [[Malaysia Federal Route 13|Federal Route 13]] (the Sandakan-[[Tawau]] highway). The area is so named because it is 32 miles west of Sandakan, the nearest major town.\n\nPetrol is still sold by the imperial gallon in [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Montserrat]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis|St Kitts and Nevis]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The [[United Arab Emirates]] Cabinet in 2009 issued the Decree No. (270 / 3) specifying that, from 1 January 2010, the new unit sale price for petrol will be the litre and not the gallon. This in line with the UAE Cabinet Decision No. 31 of 2006 on the national system of measurement, which mandates the use of International System of units as a basis for the legal units of measurement in the country.<ref name=\"gas7\">{{cite web|url=http://agriculture.gov.gd/newsitem.aspx?nid=375 |publisher=The Ministry of Agriculture, [[Government of Grenada]] |date=2004-11-01 |title=Address by Agriculture Minister Gregory Bowen |accessdate=15 January 2008 |quote=The price of gasoline at the pumps was fixed at EC$7.50 per imperial gallon... |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324183215/http://agriculture.gov.gd/newsitem.aspx?nid=375 |archivedate=24 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mof.gov.bz/faqresults.asp?category=SUPPLIES+CONTROL&question=39 |title=FAQ |website=MoF.gov.bz |accessdate=15 January 2008 |publisher=Belize Ministry of Finance |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123210505/http://mof.gov.bz/faqresults.asp?category=SUPPLIES+CONTROL&question=39 |archivedate=2008-01-23 |quote=\u2022 Kerosene per US Gallon (per Imperial gallon) \u2022 Gasoline (Regular)(per imperial Gallon) \u2022 Gasoline (Premium) (per Imperial Gallon) \u2022 Diesel (per Imperial Gallon) }}</ref><ref name=\"gas5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.antigua-barbuda.com/business_politics/budget_speeches/budget_speech_2001.asp |title=The High Commission Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=15 January 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131213551/http://www.antigua-barbuda.com/business_politics/budget_speeches/budget_speech_2001.asp |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international-fuel-prices.com/downloads/FuelPrices2005.pdf |title=International Fuel Prices 2005 |website=International-Fuel-Prices.com |first=Gerhard P. |last=Metschies  |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=15 January 2008 |page=96 |publisher=German Technical Cooperation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207130929/http://www.international-fuel-prices.com/downloads/FuelPrices2005.pdf |archive-date=2007-02-07}}</ref> Sierra Leone switched to selling fuel by the litre in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Sierra Leone]] Embassy in the United States|url=http://embassyofsierraleone.net/node/54|title=Introduction of the Metric System and the Price of Petroleum Products|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165159/http://embassyofsierraleone.net/node/54|archive-date=29 April 2015|access-date=23 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, the Antigua and Barbuda government announced the re-launch of the Metrication Programme in accordance with the Metrology Act 2007, which established the International System of Units as the legal system of units.

Most of the units are defined in more than one system and some subsidiary units were used to a much greater extent, or for different purposes, in one area rather than the other. The distinctions between these systems are often not drawn precisely.\n\nOne such distinction is that between these systems and older British/English units/systems or newer additions. The term ''imperial'' should not be applied to English units that were outlawed in the [[Weights and Measures Act 1824]] or earlier, or which had fallen out of use by that time, nor to post-imperial inventions, such as the [[slug (unit)|slug]] or [[poundal]].\n\nThe [[United States customary units|US customary system]] is historically derived from the English units that were in use at the time of settlement. Because the United States was already independent at the time, these units were unaffected by the introduction of the imperial system.\n\n== Current use ==\n[[Image:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|thumb|175px|A baby bottle that measures in three measurement systems\u2014metric, imperial (UK), and US customary.]]\n<!-- United States customary units are covered above. -->\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{see also|Metrication in the United Kingdom}}\nSince the [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]], British law defines base imperial units in terms of their metric equivalent and declares that none may be used \"for trade\" (except that milk, beer and cider may also be sold by the pint).

The metric system in weights and measures was adopted by the [[Indian Parliament]] in December 1956 with the ''Standards of Weights and Measures Act'', which took effect beginning 1 October 1958. For the next five years, both the previous and new system were legal.

These units are now rarely used in daily life, the imperial and metric systems being preferred. The imperial equivalents are written with the same basic Chinese characters as the Chinese system. In order to distinguish between the units of the two systems, the units can be prefixed with \"Ying\" ({{lang|zh|\u82f1}}, ''jing<sup>1</sup>'') for the Imperial system and \"Wa\" ({{lang|zh|\u83ef}}, ''waa<sup>4</sup>'') for the Chinese system. In writing, derived characters are often used, with an additional {{lang|zh|\u53e3}} (mouth) [[Kangxi radicals|radical]] to the left of the original Chinese character, for writing imperial units. The most commonly used units are the [[mile]] or \"li\" ({{lang|zh|\u54e9}}, ''li<sup>1</sup>''), the [[yard]] or \"ma\" ({{lang|zh|\u78bc}}, ''maa<sup>5</sup>''), the [[Foot (unit)|foot]] or \"chek\" ({{lang|zh|\u544e}}, ''cek<sup>3</sup>''), and the [[inch]] or \"tsun\" ({{lang|zh|\u540b}}, ''cyun<sup>3</sup>'').\n\nThe traditional measure of flat area is the square foot ({{lang|zh|\u65b9\u544e, \u5e73\u65b9\u544e}}, ''fong<sup>1</sup> cek<sup>3</sup>, ping<sup>4</sup> fong<sup>1</sup> cek<sup>3</sup>'') of the imperial system, which is still in common use for real estate purposes. The measurement of agricultural plots and fields is traditionally conducted in {{lang|zh|\u755d}} (''mau<sup>5</sup>'') of the Chinese system.\n\nFor the measurement of volume, Hong Kong officially uses the metric system, though the gallon ({{lang|zh|\u52a0\u4f96}}, ''gaa<sup>1</sup> leon<sup>4-2</sup>'') is also occasionally used.\n\n=== Canada ===\n{{See also|Metrication in Canada}}\n[[Image:GasCan.jpg|thumb|200px|A one US gallon gas can purchased near the US-Canada border. It shows equivalences in imperial gallons and litres.]]\nDuring the 1970s, the metric system and SI units were introduced in Canada to replace the imperial system. Within the government, efforts to implement the metric system were extensive; almost any agency, institution, or function provided by the government uses SI units exclusively. Imperial units were eliminated from all public road signs and both systems of measurement will still be found on privately owned signs, such as the height warnings at the entrance of a [[Multi-storey car park|parkade]]. In the 1980s, momentum to fully convert to the metric system stalled when the government of [[Brian Mulroney]] was elected. There was heavy opposition to metrication and as a compromise the government maintains legal definitions for and allows use of imperial units as long as metric units are shown as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc:2//en#anchorsc:2 |title=Weights and Measures Act: Canadian units of measure |publisher=Justice Canada |accessdate=14 November 2007 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605042528/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/W-6/sc%3A2//en |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n |chapter-url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch11e.shtml#11.2 \n |title=Guide to Food Labelling and Advertising \n |chapter=11 \n |publisher=[[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] \n |accessdate=1 December 2007 \n |url-status=dead\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124081159/http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/labeti/guide/ch11e.shtml \n |archivedate=24 January 2008 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._417/ |title=Consumer Packaging and Labelling Regulations (C.R.C., c. 417) |accessdate=15 November 2012 |publisher=Justice Canada, Legislative Services Branch}}</ref>\nThe law requires that measured products (such as fuel and meat) be priced in metric units and an imperial price can be shown if a metric price is present.<ref name=\"Canadian compromise\">\n{{cite web |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=1&IDClip=10620&IDCat=345&IDCatPa=261 |title=A Canadian compromise |accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=Jan 30, 1985 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116024023/http://archives.cbc.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=1&IDClip=10620&IDCat=345&IDCatPa=261 |archive-date=2009-01-16 |df=dmy-all}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Livre\">\n{{cite web |url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/clip.asp?page=1&IDLan=0&IDClip=9378&IDCat=216&IDCatPa=151 |title=Les livres et les pieds, toujours pr\u00e9sents (eng:The pounds and feet, always present) |accessdate=11 March 2008 |publisher=5 sur 5, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 [[Radio-Canada]] |quote= |language=French\n}}</ref> There tends to be leniency in regards to fruits and vegetables being priced in imperial units only.\n[[Environment Canada]] still offers an imperial unit option beside metric units, even though weather is typically measured and reported in metric units in the Canadian media. Some radio stations near the United States border (such as [[CIMX]] and [[CIDR-FM|CIDR]]) primarily use imperial units to report the weather. Railways in Canada also continue to use Imperial units.\n\nImperial units are still used in ordinary conversation. Today, Canadians typically use a mix of metric and imperial measurements in their daily lives. The use of the metric and imperial systems varies by age. The older generation mostly uses the imperial system, while the younger generation more often uses the metric system. [[Quebec]] has implemented metrication more fully. {{citation needed |date=July 2019}} Newborns are measured in SI at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units. Drivers' licences use SI units, though many English-speaking Canadians give their height and weight in imperial. In livestock auction markets, cattle are sold in dollars per [[hundredweight]] (short), whereas hogs are sold in dollars per hundred kilograms. Imperial units still dominate in recipes, construction, house renovation and gardening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bwmaonline.com/Imperial%20Origins.htm|title=Imperial Measures - The Origins|publisher=[[British Weights and Measures Association]]|website=BWMAOnline.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/national-post-latest-edition/20110222/283661116291286|title=Crepes worth savouring|work=[[National Post]]|via=PressReader.com|first=Amy|last=Rosen|date=23 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite new|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/national-post-national-edition/20110201/283403418230709|title=Scoring brownie points|work=[[National Post]]|via=PressReader.com|first=Amy|last=Rosen|date=2 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/drinking-school/wcm/f22ca2bc-5ad6-4a50-a8c9-eee40d832521|title=Drinking school|work=[[National Post]]|first=Adam|last=McDowell|date=February 28, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homehardware.ca/en/cat/index.htm/Building-Supplies/Building-Materials/Fence-Products/_/N-nthr4|title=Home Hardware - Building Supplies - Building Materials - Fence Products|publisher=|access-date=5 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629070126/http://www.homehardware.ca/en/cat/index.htm/Building-Supplies/Building-Materials/Fence-Products/_/N-nthr4|archive-date=29 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Land is now surveyed and registered in metric units whist initial surveys used imperial units. For example, partitioning of farm land on the prairies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was done in imperial units; this accounts for imperial units of distance and area retaining wide use in the [[Prairie Provinces]]. In English-speaking Canada commercial and residential spaces are mostly (but not exclusively) constructed using square feet, while in French-speaking Quebec commercial and residential spaces are constructed in metres and advertised using both square metres and square feet as equivalents. Carpet or flooring tile is purchased by the square foot, but less frequently also in square metres.<ref>[https://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g153339-c15311/Canada:Metric.System.html Canada: Metric System]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/vivre/societe/201508/25/01-4895245-systeme-metrique-a-quand-le-virage-final.php|title=Syst\u00e8me m\u00e9trique: \u00e0 quand le virage final?|first=Marie|last=Allard|work=LaPresse.ca|date=2015-08-25|lang=fr}}</ref> Motor-vehicle fuel consumption is reported in both litres per 100&nbsp;km and statute miles per imperial gallon,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oee.nrcan.gc.ca/transportation/tools/fuelratings/ratings-search.cfm?attr=8|title=Fuel Consumption Ratings Search Tool - Conventional Vehicles|first=Government of Canada, Natural Resources|last=Canada|publisher=}}</ref> leading to the erroneous impression that Canadian vehicles are 20% more fuel-efficient than their apparently identical American counterparts for which fuel economy is reported in statute miles per US gallon (neither country specifies which gallon is used).

Imperial measures are still used in the description of cartridge types, even when the cartridge is of relatively recent invention (e.g., [[.204 Ruger]], [[.17 HMR]], where the calibre is expressed in decimal fractions of an inch). Ammunition that is already classified in metric is still kept metric (e.g., [[9\u00d719mm]]). In the manufacture of ammunition, bullet and powder weights are expressed in terms of [[grain (measure)|grains]] for both metric and imperial cartridges.\n\nAs in most of the western world, air navigation is based on ''nautical'' units, e.g., the nautical mile, which is neither imperial nor metric, though altitude is still measured in imperial feet<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.langleyflyingschool.com/Pages/Canadian%20Aviation%20Regulations.html#Altimeter%20Rules|title=Canadian Aviation Regulations|website=Langley Flying School|at=sec. \"Altimeter Rules\"}}</ref> in keeping with the international standard.\n\n===Australia===\n[[Metrication in Australia]] has largely ended the official use of imperial units, though for particular measurements, international use of imperial units is still followed.  In licensed venues, draught beer and cider is sold in glasses and jugs with [[beer in Australia#Sizes|sizes]] based on the imperial fluid ounce, though rounded to the nearest 5&nbsp;mL.\n\nNewborns are measured in metric at hospitals, but the birth weight and length is also announced to family and friends in imperial units.\n\nScreen sizes, are frequently advertised in inches as well as centimetres.\n\nProperty size is frequently advertised in acres, but is mostly as square metres.\n\nNavigation is done in nautical miles, and water-based speed limits are in nautical miles per hour.\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Metrication in New Zealand}}\nIn New Zealand, which completed metrication in the 1970s, a study of university students undertaken in 1992 found a continued use of imperial units for birth weight and human height alongside metric units.<ref>[http://www.psychology.org.nz/cms_show_download.php?id=785 \"Human use of metric measures of length\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209034410/http://www.psychology.org.nz/cms_show_download.php?id=785 |date=9 February 2013 }}.

The imperial system remains in limited use \u2013 for sales of beer in pubs (traditionally sold by the pint). All other goods are required by law to be sold in metric units with traditional quantities being retained for goods like butter and sausages, which are sold in 454-gram (1&nbsp;lb) packaging. The majority of cars sold pre-2005 feature speedometers with miles per hour as the primary unit, but with a kilometres per hour display as well. often signs such as those for bridge height can display both metric and imperial units. Imperial measurements continue to be used colloquially by the general population especially with height and distance measurements such as feet, inches, and acres as well as for weight with pounds and stones still in common use among people of all ages. Measurements such as yards have fallen out of favour with younger generations. All of Ireland's railways still operate on imperial measurements and property is usually listed in square feet as well as metres also.\n\n===Other countries===\nSome imperial measurements remain in limited use in [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[South Africa]]. Measurements in feet and inches, especially for a person's height, are frequently encountered in conversation and non-governmental publications.\n\nPrior to metrication, it was a common practice in Malaysia for people to refer to unnamed locations and small settlements along major roads by referring to how many miles the said locations were from the nearest major town. In some cases, these eventually became the official names of the locations; in other cases, such names have been largely or completely superseded by new names. An example of the former is Batu 32 (literally \"Mile 32\" in [[Malay language|Malay]]), which refers to the area surrounding the intersection between [[Malaysia Federal Route 22|Federal Route 22]] (the [[Tamparuli]]-[[Sandakan]] highway) and [[Malaysia Federal Route 13|Federal Route 13]] (the Sandakan-[[Tawau]] highway). The area is so named because it is 32 miles west of Sandakan, the nearest major town.\n\nPetrol is still sold by the imperial gallon in [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Belize]], [[Myanmar]], the [[Cayman Islands]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Montserrat]], [[St. Kitts and Nevis|St Kitts and Nevis]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The [[United Arab Emirates]] Cabinet in 2009 issued the Decree No. (270 / 3) specifying that, from 1 January 2010, the new unit sale price for petrol will be the litre and not the gallon. This in line with the UAE Cabinet Decision No. 31 of 2006 on the national system of measurement, which mandates the use of International System of units as a basis for the legal units of measurement in the country.<ref name=\"gas7\">{{cite web|url=http://agriculture.gov.gd/newsitem.aspx?nid=375 |publisher=The Ministry of Agriculture, [[Government of Grenada]] |date=2004-11-01 |title=Address by Agriculture Minister Gregory Bowen |accessdate=15 January 2008 |quote=The price of gasoline at the pumps was fixed at EC$7.50 per imperial gallon... |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324183215/http://agriculture.gov.gd/newsitem.aspx?nid=375 |archivedate=24 March 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mof.gov.bz/faqresults.asp?category=SUPPLIES+CONTROL&question=39 |title=FAQ |website=MoF.gov.bz |accessdate=15 January 2008 |publisher=Belize Ministry of Finance |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123210505/http://mof.gov.bz/faqresults.asp?category=SUPPLIES+CONTROL&question=39 |archivedate=2008-01-23 |quote=\u2022 Kerosene per US Gallon (per Imperial gallon) \u2022 Gasoline (Regular)(per imperial Gallon) \u2022 Gasoline (Premium) (per Imperial Gallon) \u2022 Diesel (per Imperial Gallon) }}</ref><ref name=\"gas5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.antigua-barbuda.com/business_politics/budget_speeches/budget_speech_2001.asp |title=The High Commission Antigua and Barbuda |accessdate=15 January 2008 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131213551/http://www.antigua-barbuda.com/business_politics/budget_speeches/budget_speech_2001.asp |archivedate=31 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.international-fuel-prices.com/downloads/FuelPrices2005.pdf |title=International Fuel Prices 2005 |website=International-Fuel-Prices.com |first=Gerhard P. |last=Metschies  |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=15 January 2008 |page=96 |publisher=German Technical Cooperation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207130929/http://www.international-fuel-prices.com/downloads/FuelPrices2005.pdf |archive-date=2007-02-07}}</ref> Sierra Leone switched to selling fuel by the litre in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Sierra Leone]] Embassy in the United States|url=http://embassyofsierraleone.net/node/54|title=Introduction of the Metric System and the Price of Petroleum Products|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429165159/http://embassyofsierraleone.net/node/54|archive-date=29 April 2015|access-date=23 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011, the Antigua and Barbuda government announced the re-launch of the Metrication Programme in accordance with the Metrology Act 2007, which established the International System of Units as the legal system of units.

{"title_page": "2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\nThe '''bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups''' was the process by which the [[FIFA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) selected locations for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition.  By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]], [[Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Russia]], a joint bid from [[Belgium\u2013Netherlands 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Belgium and Netherlands]], and a joint bid from [[Portugal\u2013Spain 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Portugal and Spain]]. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Australia]], [[Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Japan]], [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar]], [[South Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|South Korea]], and the [[United States 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|United States]]. [[Indonesian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Indonesia's bid]] was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.\n\nOn 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were selected as the locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups respectively.\n\nThe selection process involved several controversies. Two members of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] had their voting rights suspended following allegations that they would accept money in exchange for votes. More allegations of vote buying arose after Qatar's win was announced. Eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments have been fined, suspended, banned for life or [[2015 FIFA corruption case|prosecuted]] for corruption.\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 2007, FIFA ended its continental rotation policy. Instead countries that are members of the same confederation as either of the last two tournament hosts are ineligible, leaving [[Confederation of African Football|Africa]] ineligible for 2018 and [[CONMEBOL|South America]] ineligible for both 2018 and 2022.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm |work=BBC News |date= 29 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2007|title= Fifa abandons World Cup rotation | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071030043406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm| archivedate= 30 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Other factors in the selection process include the number of suitable stadiums, and their location across candidate nations. Voting is done using a multiple round [[exhaustive ballot]] system whereby the candidate receiving the fewest votes in each round is eliminated until a single candidate is chosen by the majority.\n\n=== Rotation policy ===\n[[File:World Map FIFA2.svg|thumb|FIFA's confederations]]\n\nFollowing the selection of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] hosts, FIFA had decided on a policy for determining the hosts of future editions. The six world confederations\u2014roughly corresponding to continents\u2014would rotate in their turn of providing bids, for a specific edition, from within their member national associations. This system was used only for the selection of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] (South Africa) and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] (Brazil) hosts, open only to [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] and [[CONMEBOL]] members, respectively.\n\nIn September 2007, the rotation system came under review, and a new system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm |title= New rotation proposal |work=BBC Sport |date= 25 September 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011155608/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm| archivedate= 11 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in [[Zurich]], Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid could have come from [[CONCACAF]], [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[UEFA]], or [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]], as Africa and South America are ineligible.<ref name=iht>{{cite news |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title= Australia can host World Cup |first= Matthew |last= Hall |date= 18 September 2005|accessdate=22 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071022203403/http://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html| archivedate= 22 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Likewise, no CONMEBOL member could have made a 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.\n\nThe United States, the last non-European candidate in the 2018 bidding cycle, withdrew its bid for that year; hence the 2018 tournament will have to be held in UEFA. This in turn meant that CONMBEBOL and UEFA were ineligible for 2022.\n\n== Voting procedure ==\nFor both the 2018 and 2022 editions of the World Cup, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] voted to decide which candidate should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system was used to determine the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote.

The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition.  By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]], [[Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Russia]], a joint bid from [[Belgium\u2013Netherlands 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Belgium and Netherlands]], and a joint bid from [[Portugal\u2013Spain 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Portugal and Spain]]. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Australia]], [[Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Japan]], [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar]], [[South Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|South Korea]], and the [[United States 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|United States]]. [[Indonesian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Indonesia's bid]] was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.\n\nOn 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were selected as the locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups respectively.\n\nThe selection process involved several controversies. Two members of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] had their voting rights suspended following allegations that they would accept money in exchange for votes. More allegations of vote buying arose after Qatar's win was announced. Eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments have been fined, suspended, banned for life or [[2015 FIFA corruption case|prosecuted]] for corruption.\n\n== Background ==\nIn October 2007, FIFA ended its continental rotation policy. Instead countries that are members of the same confederation as either of the last two tournament hosts are ineligible, leaving [[Confederation of African Football|Africa]] ineligible for 2018 and [[CONMEBOL|South America]] ineligible for both 2018 and 2022.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm |work=BBC News |date= 29 October 2007 |accessdate=29 October 2007|title= Fifa abandons World Cup rotation | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071030043406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm| archivedate= 30 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Other factors in the selection process include the number of suitable stadiums, and their location across candidate nations.

The six world confederations\u2014roughly corresponding to continents\u2014would rotate in their turn of providing bids, for a specific edition, from within their member national associations. This system was used only for the selection of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] (South Africa) and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] (Brazil) hosts, open only to [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] and [[CONMEBOL]] members, respectively.\n\nIn September 2007, the rotation system came under review, and a new system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm |title= New rotation proposal |work=BBC Sport |date= 25 September 2007 |accessdate=22 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011155608/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm| archivedate= 11 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in [[Zurich]], Switzerland by FIFA's Executive Committee.

This in turn meant that CONMBEBOL and UEFA were ineligible for 2022.\n\n== Voting procedure ==\nFor both the 2018 and 2022 editions of the World Cup, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] voted to decide which candidate should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system was used to determine the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote. The candidate country that received the fewest votes in each round was eliminated until a single candidate was chosen by the majority.

Knopf]] in 1992. Set in [[New England]], it tells the story of a closely knit group of six [[classics]] students at Hampden College, a small, elite [[Vermont]] college based upon [[Bennington College]], where Tartt was a student between 1982 and 1986.\n\n''The Secret History'' is an [[inverted detective story]] narrated by one of the students, Richard Papen, who reflects years later on the situation that led to a murder\u2014this having been confessed to at the outset, but with all other events being revealed sequentially. The novel explores the circumstances and lasting effects of Bunny's death on the academically and socially isolated group of Classics students of which he was a part.\n\nA 75,000 print order was made for the first edition (as opposed to the usual 10,000 order for a [[debut novel]]), and the book became a bestseller. It was originally titled ''The God of Illusions'',<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/16/business/the-media-business-the-marketing-of-a-cause-celebre.html \"THE MEDIA BUSINESS; The Marketing of a Cause Celebre\" (November 16, 1992) ''The New York Times'']</ref> and its first-edition hardcover was designed by [[Chip Kidd]] and Barbara de Wilde.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f26dc6fc-2fe3-11e0-a7c6-00144feabdc0|title=Book cover: The Secret History|date=2011-02-07|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nRichard Papen leaves his hometown of Plano, California for Hampden College in Vermont. He is accepted into the class of [[Classics]] professor Julian Morrow, who limits enrolment to a hand-picked clique: charming but secretive [[fraternal twins]] Charles and Camilla Macaulay; Francis Abernathy, whose secluded country home becomes a sanctuary for the group; Henry Winter, an intellectual with a passion for the [[Pali canon]], [[Homer]], and [[Plato]]; and Edmund \"Bunny\" Corcoran, a bigoted jokester.\n\nHenry appears to have a strained friendship with Bunny, but they spend a winter break together in Rome. Richard takes a low-paying campus job and spends winter break in an unheated warehouse. He nearly dies from hypothermia and pneumonia, but is rescued and taken to the hospital by Henry, who returns early from Italy.\n\nAfter winter break, tensions between Bunny and the group worsen. Richard learns the truth from Henry and Francis: during a [[bacchanal]] from which both Richard and Bunny were excluded, Henry accidentally killed a farmer near Francis's country estate. During the trip to Italy, Bunny discovered the truth by reading Henry's diary, and has been blackmailing the group since. No longer able to meet Bunny's demands, and fearing that he will expose them, the group resolves to kill Bunny. They confront Bunny while he is hiking and Henry pushes him into a ravine to his death.\n\nThe group struggles to maintain their cover, joining search parties for Bunny and attending his funeral. Richard learns more about the bacchanal murder from Camilla; when they killed the stranger in plaid, his stomach was cut open, suggesting that it was not accident.\n\nCharles develops a [[drinking problem]] and becomes increasingly abusive towards Camilla. In response, Henry arranges for her to move into a nearby hotel. Francis confirms to Richard that the twins are in a sexual relationship, and admits he has slept with Charles on a number of occasions and suffers from panic attacks. Julian discovers a letter sent to him by Bunny, imploring him to help; instead of reporting the crime, he leaves the faculty and never returns.\n\nHenry begins living with Camilla, which drives Charles further into alcoholism. When Charles is arrested in a [[drunk-driving]] incident with Henry's car, Henry fears Charles will let slip their secret to the police, while Charles fears that Henry may kill him to keep his silence. Charles barges into Camilla and Henry's hotel room and tries to kill Henry with Francis' gun. In the struggle, Henry gets hold of the gun and Charles accidentally shoots Richard in the abdomen. The innkeeper, hearing the commotion and gunshot, forces his way into the room. Henry kisses Camilla farewell and commits suicide with the gun. The police report concludes that, in a suicidal fit, Henry inadvertently shot Richard.\n\nWith Henry's death, the group disintegrates. Francis, living in [[Boston]], attempts suicide and, though homosexual, is forced by his rich grandfather to marry a woman he despises; Camilla, caring for her grandmother, becomes increasingly isolated; Charles runs away from rehab to [[Texas]] with a married woman and no longer speaks to Camilla; and Richard, after recovering from his wounds, becomes a lonely academic with an unrequited love for Camilla.

Knopf]] in 1992. Set in [[New England]], it tells the story of a closely knit group of six [[classics]] students at Hampden College, a small, elite [[Vermont]] college based upon [[Bennington College]], where Tartt was a student between 1982 and 1986.\n\n''The Secret History'' is an [[inverted detective story]] narrated by one of the students, Richard Papen, who reflects years later on the situation that led to a murder\u2014this having been confessed to at the outset, but with all other events being revealed sequentially. The novel explores the circumstances and lasting effects of Bunny's death on the academically and socially isolated group of Classics students of which he was a part.\n\nA 75,000 print order was made for the first edition (as opposed to the usual 10,000 order for a [[debut novel]]), and the book became a bestseller. It was originally titled ''The God of Illusions'',<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/16/business/the-media-business-the-marketing-of-a-cause-celebre.html \"THE MEDIA BUSINESS; The Marketing of a Cause Celebre\" (November 16, 1992) ''The New York Times'']</ref> and its first-edition hardcover was designed by [[Chip Kidd]] and Barbara de Wilde.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f26dc6fc-2fe3-11e0-a7c6-00144feabdc0|title=Book cover: The Secret History|date=2011-02-07|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-02-11}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nRichard Papen leaves his hometown of Plano, California for Hampden College in Vermont. He is accepted into the class of [[Classics]] professor Julian Morrow, who limits enrolment to a hand-picked clique: charming but secretive [[fraternal twins]] Charles and Camilla Macaulay; Francis Abernathy, whose secluded country home becomes a sanctuary for the group; Henry Winter, an intellectual with a passion for the [[Pali canon]], [[Homer]], and [[Plato]]; and Edmund \"Bunny\" Corcoran, a bigoted jokester.\n\nHenry appears to have a strained friendship with Bunny, but they spend a winter break together in Rome. Richard takes a low-paying campus job and spends winter break in an unheated warehouse. He nearly dies from hypothermia and pneumonia, but is rescued and taken to the hospital by Henry, who returns early from Italy.\n\nAfter winter break, tensions between Bunny and the group worsen. Richard learns the truth from Henry and Francis: during a [[bacchanal]] from which both Richard and Bunny were excluded, Henry accidentally killed a farmer near Francis's country estate. During the trip to Italy, Bunny discovered the truth by reading Henry's diary, and has been blackmailing the group since. No longer able to meet Bunny's demands, and fearing that he will expose them, the group resolves to kill Bunny. They confront Bunny while he is hiking and Henry pushes him into a ravine to his death.\n\nThe group struggles to maintain their cover, joining search parties for Bunny. Richard learns more about the bacchanal murder from Camilla; when they killed the stranger in plaid, his stomach was cut open, suggesting that it was not accident.\n\nCharles develops a [[drinking problem]] and becomes increasingly abusive towards Camilla. In response, Henry arranges for her to move into a nearby hotel. Francis confirms to Richard that the twins are in a sexual relationship, and admits he has slept with Charles on a number of occasions and suffers from panic attacks. Julian discovers a letter sent to him by Bunny, imploring him to help; instead of reporting the crime, he leaves the faculty.\n\nHenry begins living with Camilla, which drives Charles further into alcoholism. When Charles is arrested in a [[drunk-driving]] incident with Henry's car, Henry fears Charles will let slip their secret to the police. Charles barges into Camilla and Henry's hotel room and tries to kill Henry with Francis' gun. In the struggle, Henry gets hold of the gun and Charles accidentally shoots Richard in the abdomen. The innkeeper, hearing the commotion and gunshot, forces his way into the room. Henry kisses Camilla farewell and commits suicide with the gun. The police report concludes that, in a suicidal fit, Henry shot Richard.\n\nWith Henry's death, the group disintegrates. Francis, living in [[Boston]], attempts suicide and, though gay, is forced by his rich grandfather to marry a woman he despises; Camilla, caring for her grandmother, becomes increasingly isolated; Charles runs away from rehab to [[Texas]] with a married woman and no longer speaks to Camilla; and Richard, after recovering from his wounds, becomes a lonely academic with an unrequited love for Camilla. Richard sees Henry's death as having cut the cord that bound them, setting them all adrift. He meets Henry in a dream, and asks him if he is happy there. Henry replies: \"Not particularly. But you're not very happy where you are, either.\"\n\n==Themes==\nAccording to [[Michiko Kakutani]], some aspects of the novel are reflective of [[Nietzsche]]'s model of [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] expression in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]''.

She was a prisoner during the Holocaust at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[concentration camp]], where she died from [[starvation]].\n\n==Biography ==\n\n===Family===\nShe met [[Otto Frank]] in 1924 and they married on his 36th birthday, 12 May 1925, at Aachen's [[synagogue]].  They had two daughters born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Margot Frank|Margot]], born 16 February 1926, followed by [[Anne Frank|Anne]], born 12 June 1929.\n\n===Immigration===\nThe rise of [[Antisemitism]] and the introduction of discriminatory laws in Germany forced the family to emigrate to [[Amsterdam]] in 1933, where Otto established a branch of his spice and [[pectin]] distribution company. Edith found emigration to the Netherlands difficult. The family lived in confined conditions and she struggled with the new language. She remained in contact with her family and friends in Germany, but also made new friends in Amsterdam, most of them German refugees. Edith was an open-minded woman who educated her daughters in a modern way. Her older brothers Walter (1897\u20131968) and Julius (1894\u20131967) escaped to the [[United States]] after 1938, and Rosa Holl\u00e4nder-Stern left Aachen in 1939 to join the Frank family in Amsterdam, where she passed in January 1942.\n\nAnne Frank's cousin [[Buddy Elias|Bernhard (\"Buddy\") Elias]] has said that \"Edith never felt well in Holland. Edith was ''German'', and she missed Germany. She did not learn Dutch very well. She did not feel at home in Amsterdam.\"<ref>{{YouTube|id=9Jp0XDpxd3Y|title= Diary of Anne Frank \u2013 Interview with Buddy Elias}}. IMG Entertainment. Originally broadcast on BBC in 1996.</ref>\n\n===Persecution and death===\n[[File:EdithFrankStolpersteinAachen 8223.jpg|thumb|A [[Stolperstein]] for Frank at the Pastorplatz in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]]]]\nIn 1940, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] invaded the [[Netherlands]] and began their persecution of the country's Jews. Edith's children were removed from their schools, and her husband had to turn over his business to his Dutch colleagues [[Johannes Kleiman]] and [[Victor Kugler]], who helped the family when they went into hiding at the company premises in 1942.\n\nThe two-year period the Frank family spent in hiding with four other people (their neighbours [[Hermann van Pels]], his wife Auguste Van Pels and his son Peter Van Pels, and [[Miep Gies]]'s dentist [[Fritz Pfeffer]]) was famously chronicled in Anne Frank's posthumously published [[The Diary of a Young Girl|diary]]. In her diary, the adolescent Anne frequently writes about the disagreements, conflicts, mutual lack of understanding, and the pessimism of her mother, which she wants to disassociate herself from. However, she repeatedly also describes her mother as an understanding and loyal woman who stands up for her daughters and protects them against verbal attacks from the other inhabitants. The diary ended three days before they were anonymously betrayed and arrested on 4 August 1944. After detainment in the [[Gestapo]] headquarters on the Euterpestraat and three days in prison on the Amstelveenweg, Edith and those with whom she had been in hiding were transported to the [[Westerbork concentration camp]]. From there, they were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] on 3 September 1944, on the last train to be dispatched from Westerbork to Auschwitz.\n\nEdith and her daughters were separated from Otto upon arrival, and they never saw him again.  Edith looked for ways of keeping her children alive. Survivors later described them as an inseparable trio. On 30 October, another selection separated Edith from Anne and Margot. Edith was selected for the gas chambers, and her daughters were transported to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Edith escaped with a friend to another section of the camp, where she remained through the winter. While here she hid every scrap of food she got and saved it for her daughters. Because she refused to eat any of the food she was saving for her daughters, she died from starvation on 6 January 1945, three weeks before the [[Red Army]] liberated the camp and 10 days before her 45th birthday. Her daughters outlived her by one month.<ref name=\"Prose\">{{cite book|last=Prose|first=Francine |title=Anne Frank: The Book, the Life, the Afterlife  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLX4PY4L7-YC&pg=PA56&dq=%22edith+frank%22+auschwitz&hl=en&ei=Kg6ITeSGDYHQgAen7eXQDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22edith%20frank%22%20auschwitz&f=false|year=2010|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-143080-0|page=56}}</ref>\n\n==Her Daughter's Diary ==\nWhen Otto Frank decided to edit his daughter's diary for publication, he was sure that his wife had come in for particular criticism because of her often difficult relationship with Anne, and he deleted some of the more heated comments out of respect for his wife and other residents of the Secret Annex. Nevertheless, Anne's portrait of an unsympathetic and sarcastic mother was duplicated in the dramatizations of the book. Anne's portrayal of her mother was countered by the memories of those who had known her as a modest, distant woman who tried to treat her adolescent children as her equals. Anne died of [[typhus]] a few months before the Second World War ended.\n\nIn 1999, the discovery of previously unknown pages excised by Otto showed that Anne had discerned that, although Edith very much loved Otto, Otto \u2014 though very devoted to Edith \u2014 was not ''in love'' with her; and that this understanding was leading Anne to develop a new sense of empathy for her mother's situation. By the time Edith and her daughters were in Auschwitz, [[Bloeme Evers-Emden]], an Auschwitz survivor interviewed by [[Willy Lindwer]] in ''The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank'' (page 129), observed that \"they were always together, mother and daughters. It is certain that they gave each other a great deal of support. All the things a teenager might think of her mother were no longer of any significance.\"\n\nAfter their arrest and transfer to camp [[Westerbork]] the relationship between Anne and her mother improved as can be seen from a letter sent by Otto Frank to his cousin Milly on 16 November 1945:\n{{cquote |It does not grieve me what she writes (about her mother) and I know quite well that there are several things she did not see and she would have changed her ideas.

She was a prisoner during the Holocaust at [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] [[concentration camp]], where she died from [[starvation]].\n\n==Biography ==\n\n===Early life ===\nEdith was the youngest of four children, having been born into a German [[Jewish]] family in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]]. Her father, Abraham Holl\u00e4nder (1860&ndash;1928) was a successful businessman in industrial equipment who was prominent in the Aachen Jewish community together with Edith's mother, Rosa Stern (1866\u20131942). The ancestors of the Holl\u00e4nder family lived in [[Amsterdam]] at the start of the 18th century, emigrating from the [[Netherlands]] to Germany around 1800. Edith's last name, ''Holl\u00e4nder'', is [[German language|German]] for \"Dutchman\" (literally: \"[[Holland]]er\").<ref>[http://www.annefrank.org/en/Museum/Exhibitions/Temporary-Exhibitions/Edith/Edith-Frank-Hollander-Annes-mother/ Edith Frank-Holl\u00e4nder, Anne's mother], ''[[Anne Frank House]]''</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Pressler | first = Mirjam | title = Treasures from the attic : the extraordinary story of Anne Frank's family | url = https://archive.org/details/treasuresfromatt00pres_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = Doubleday | location = New York | page = [https://archive.org/details/treasuresfromatt00pres_0/page/115 115-116] |year = 2011 | isbn = 038553387X }}</ref>  Edith had two older brothers, Julius and Walter, and an older sister, Bettina. Bettina died at the age of 16 due to [[appendicitis]] when Edith was just 14. Both Julius and Walter made it to the United States, surviving afterwards. The Holl\u00e4nder family adhered to Jewish dietary laws and was considered to be religious. Nevertheless, Edith attended the Evangelical Higher Girls\u2019 School and passed her school-leaving exams (Abitur) in 1916. Afterwards, she worked for the family company. In her free time, she read copiously, played tennis, went swimming and had a large circle of friends.\n\n===Family===\nShe met [[Otto Frank]] in 1924 and they married on his 36th birthday, 12 May 1925, at Aachen's [[synagogue]].  They had two daughters born in [[Frankfurt]], [[Margot Frank|Margot]], born 16 February 1926, followed by [[Anne Frank|Anne]], born 12 June 1929.\n\n===Immigration===\nThe rise of [[Antisemitism]] and the introduction of discriminatory laws in Germany forced the family to emigrate to [[Amsterdam]] in 1933, where Otto established a branch of his spice and [[pectin]] distribution company. Edith found emigration to the Netherlands difficult. The family lived in confined conditions and she struggled with the new language. She remained in contact with her family and friends in Germany, but also made new friends in Amsterdam, most of them German refugees. Edith was an open-minded woman who educated her daughters in a modern way. Her older brothers Walter (1897\u20131968) and Julius (1894\u20131967) escaped to the [[United States]] after 1938, and Rosa Holl\u00e4nder-Stern left Aachen in 1939 to join the Frank family in Amsterdam, where she passed in January 1942.\n\nAnne Frank's cousin [[Buddy Elias|Bernhard (\"Buddy\") Elias]] has said that \"Edith never felt well in Holland. Edith was ''German'', and she missed Germany. She did not learn Dutch very well. She did not feel at home in Amsterdam.\"<ref>{{YouTube|id=9Jp0XDpxd3Y|title= Diary of Anne Frank \u2013 Interview with Buddy Elias}}. IMG Entertainment. Originally broadcast on BBC in 1996.</ref>\n\n===Persecution and death===\n[[File:EdithFrankStolpersteinAachen 8223.jpg|thumb|A [[Stolperstein]] for Frank at the Pastorplatz in [[Aachen]], [[Germany]]]]\nIn 1940, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] invaded the [[Netherlands]] and began their persecution of the country's Jews. Edith's children were removed from their schools, and her husband had to turn over his business to his Dutch colleagues [[Johannes Kleiman]] and [[Victor Kugler]], who helped the family when they went into hiding at the company premises in 1942.\n\nThe two-year period the Frank family spent in hiding with four other people (their neighbours [[Hermann van Pels]], his wife Auguste Van Pels and his son Peter Van Pels, and [[Miep Gies]]'s dentist [[Fritz Pfeffer]]) was famously chronicled in Anne Frank's posthumously published [[The Diary of a Young Girl|diary]]. In her diary, the adolescent Anne frequently writes about the disagreements, conflicts, mutual lack of understanding, and the pessimism of her mother, which she wants to disassociate herself from. However, she repeatedly also describes her mother as an understanding and loyal woman who stands up for her daughters and protects them against verbal attacks from the other inhabitants. The diary ended three days before they were anonymously betrayed and arrested on 4 August 1944. After detainment in the [[Gestapo]] headquarters on the Euterpestraat and three days in prison on the Amstelveenweg, Edith and those with whom she had been in hiding were transported to the [[Westerbork concentration camp]]. From there, they were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] on 3 September 1944, on the last train to be dispatched from Westerbork to Auschwitz.\n\nEdith and her daughters were separated from Otto upon arrival, and they never saw him again.  Edith looked for ways of keeping her children alive. Survivors later described them as an inseparable trio. On 30 October, another selection separated Edith from Anne and Margot. Edith was selected for the gas chambers, and her daughters were transported to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]]. Edith escaped with a friend to another section of the camp, where she remained through the winter. While here she hid every scrap of food she got and saved it for her daughters. Because she refused to eat any of the food she was saving for her daughters, she died from starvation on 6 January 1945, three weeks before the [[Red Army]] liberated the camp and 10 days before her 45th birthday. Her daughters outlived her by one month.<ref name=\"Prose\">{{cite book|last=Prose|first=Francine |title=Anne Frank: The Book, the Life, the Afterlife  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jLX4PY4L7-YC&pg=PA56&dq=%22edith+frank%22+auschwitz&hl=en&ei=Kg6ITeSGDYHQgAen7eXQDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22edith%20frank%22%20auschwitz&f=false|year=2010|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-06-143080-0|page=56}}</ref>\n\n==Her Daughter's Diary ==\nWhen Otto Frank decided to edit his daughter's diary for publication, he was sure that his wife had come in for particular criticism because of her often difficult relationship with Anne, and he deleted some of the more heated comments out of respect for his wife and other residents of the Secret Annex. Nevertheless, Anne's portrait of an unsympathetic and sarcastic mother was duplicated in the dramatizations of the book. Anne's portrayal of her mother was countered by the memories of those who had known her as a modest, distant woman who tried to treat her adolescent children as her equals. Anne died of [[typhus]] a few months before the Second World War ended.\n\nIn 1999, the discovery of previously unknown pages excised by Otto showed that Anne had discerned that, although Edith very much loved Otto, Otto \u2014 though very devoted to Edith \u2014 was not ''in love'' with her; and that this understanding was leading Anne to develop a new sense of empathy for her mother's situation. By the time Edith and her daughters were in Auschwitz, [[Bloeme Evers-Emden]], an Auschwitz survivor interviewed by [[Willy Lindwer]] in ''The Last Seven Months of Anne Frank'' (page 129), observed that \"they were always together, mother and daughters. It is certain that they gave each other a great deal of support. All the things a teenager might think of her mother were no longer of any significance.\"\n\nAfter their arrest and transfer to camp [[Westerbork]] the relationship between Anne and her mother improved as can be seen from a letter sent by Otto Frank to his cousin Milly on 16 November 1945:\n{{cquote |It does not grieve me what she writes (about her mother) and I know quite well that there are several things she did not see and she would have changed her ideas. In fact she was on very good terms with her mother at the camp (Westerbork) later.<ref>''The Hidden Life of Otto Frank'', Page 203</ref>}}\n\n==Further reading ==\n* ''The Diary of Anne Frank: The Revised Critical Edition'', Anne Frank, edited by David Barnouw and Gerrold Van der Stroom, translated by [[Arnold J.

Adam Kok II, a [[Griqua people|Griqua]] leader, settled here with his people in 1826 and became the protector of the mission station. Kok II and some of his followers moved to Philippolis from Griquatown (about 200&nbsp;km away) after there had been factional disputes in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mohamed|first=Adhikari|title=Genocide on settler frontiers: when hunter-gatherers and commercial stock farmers clash|publisher=UCT Press|date=2014|place=Cape Town|page=95}}</ref> When Adam Kok II was given possession of the mission station it was on condition that he promised to protect the [[San people|San]] against the aggression of the [[Boers]] and the LMS hoped that the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] would promote peace in the region.<ref>{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=History of the emigrant Boer in South Africa: Or the wanderings and wars of the emigrant farmers from their leaving cape Colony to the acknowledgement of their independence by Great Britain|publisher=Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey & Co.|date=1888|place=London|page=216}}</ref> However, Philippolis became a base from which a number of deadly commandos against the [[San people|San]] people were organised within a year of the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] arrival.

the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] province of [[South Africa]]. The writer and intellectual [[Laurens van der Post|Sir Laurens van der Post]] was born here. It is regarded as one of the first colonial period settlements in the Free State.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.philippolisinfo.co.za/historical.htm|title=Philippolis 1822: The first settlement in the Free State|website=Philippolis|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS) founded Philippolis in 1823 as a [[mission (station)|mission station]] for the local [[Griqua people]]. At first, the area was referred to as Southern Transorangia.<ref>{{cite book|title=New History of South Africa|last1=Giliomee|first1=Hermann|last2=Mbenga|first2=Bernard|publisher=Tafelberg|place=Cape Town|year=2007|page=143|isbn=9780624043591}}</ref>  The town takes its name from Dr [[John Philip (missionary)|John Philip]], who was the superintendent of the LMS from 1819 to 1849. Adam Kok II, a [[Griqua people|Griqua]] leader, settled here with his people in 1826 and became the protector of the mission station. Kok II and some of his followers moved to Philippolis from Griquatown (about 200&nbsp;km away) after there had been factional disputes in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mohamed|first=Adhikari|title=Genocide on settler frontiers: when hunter-gatherers and commercial stock farmers clash|publisher=UCT Press|date=2014|place=Cape Town|page=95}}</ref> When Adam Kok II was given possession of the mission station it was on condition that he promised to protect the [[San people|San]] against the aggression of the [[Boers]] and the LMS hoped that the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] would promote peace in the region.<ref>{{cite book|last=Theal|first=George McCall|title=History of the emigrant Boer in South Africa: Or the wanderings and wars of the emigrant farmers from their leaving cape Colony to the acknowledgement of their independence by Great Britain|publisher=Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey & Co.|date=1888|place=London|page=216}}</ref> However, Philippolis became a base from which a number of deadly commandos against the [[San people|San]] people were organised within a year of the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] arrival. This violated the agreement made between the LMS and Adam Kok II{{sfn|Mohamed|2014|p=100}} and eventually the [[San people|San]] were driven out of the area. Kok's son, [[Adam Kok III]] and his followers later migrated across the [[Drakensberg]] mountains to settle in [[Kokstad, KwaZulu-Natal|Kokstad]] in [[Griqualand East]].\n\n==Monuments and tourist attractions==\nThe town has a number of declared heritage sites including an historical jail<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.openafrica.org/experiences/participant/2363-philippolis-old-jail|title=Philippolis Old Jail {{!}} Participant {{!}} Open Africa - Do Travel Differently|last=info@codelikeclockwork.com|first=Code Like Clockwork (Pty) Ltd|website=www.openafrica.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-01}}</ref> that has been turned into a bed and breakfast guest house.\n\n===Cannons=== \nTwo naval cannons stand on top of a small hill which were presented by the Cape colonial government in 1840 to [[Adam Kok III]] who was the [[Griqua people|Griqua]] chief at that time. The cannons are fired during the town\u2019s [[Witblits]] festival held in April. These cannons may have been used during the various wars between the [[Griqua people|Griqua]], [[Basotho]] and the [[Boers]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.philippolisinfo.co.za/historical.htm|title=Philippolis 1822: The first settlement in the Free State|website=Philippolis|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Emily Hobhouse memorial===\n[[File: Hobhouse_garden_of_Remembrance.jpeg|thumb|right|Emily Hobhouse garden of remembrance Philippolis.]]\nThis memorial commemorates [[Emily Hobhouse]] who helped improve the lives of the [[Boers]] during the South African War.

It was subsequently converted into a police station and several changes were made such as the repurposing of jail cells into charge offices. The [[South African Defence Force|SADF]] (South African Defence Force) used the jail as an army barracks from 1972 to 1982.
