It is originally written in [[Java language|Java]], but is now available in [[C (programming language)|C]],<ref>[http://www.developer.com/java/other/article.php/3714051 VTD-XML: a New Vision of XML] by courtesy of Victor R. Volkman</ref> [[C++]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].\n\n==Basic concept==\n\n===Non-extractive, document-centric parsing===\n\nTraditionally, a [[lexical analysis|lexical analyzer]] represents tokens (the small units of indivisible character values) as discrete string objects. This approach is designated ''extractive'' parsing. In contrast, ''non-extractive'' tokenization mandates that one keeps the source text intact, and  uses offsets and lengths to describe those tokens.\n\n=== Virtual token descriptor===\n\n'''Virtual Token Descriptor''' ('''VTD''') applies the concept of non-extractive, document-centric parsing to XML processing. A VTD record uses a 64-bit integer to encode the offset, length, token type and nesting depth of a token in an XML document. Because all VTD records are 64 bits in length, they can be stored efficiently and managed as an array.<ref>[http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/VTD.html Virtual Token Descriptor introduction at SourceForge]</ref>\n\n=== Location cache ===\n\n'''Location Caches''' ('''LC''') build on VTD records to provide efficient random access. Organized as tables, with one table per nesting depth level, LCs contain entries modeling an XML document's element hierarchy. An LC entry is a 64-bit integer encoding a pair of 32-bit values. The upper 32 bits identify the VTD record for the corresponding element. The lower 32 bits identify that element's first child in the LC at the next lower nesting level.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Overview===\nVirtually all the core benefits of VTD-XML are inherent to non-extractive, document-centric parsing which provides these characteristics:\n* The source XML text is kept intact in memory without decoding.\n* The internal representation of VTD-XML is inherently [[Persistence (computer science)|persistent]].\n* Obviates [[object-oriented]] modeling of the hierarchical representation as it relies entirely on primitive data types (e.g., 64-bit integers) to represent the XML hierarchy, thus reducing object creation cost to nearly zero.<ref>[http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/250512.htm i-Technology Viewpoint: The Performance Woe of Binary XML @ SOA WORLD MAGAZINE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nCombining those characteristics permits thinking of XML purely as syntax (bits, bytes, offsets, lengths, fragments, namespace-compensated fragments, and document composition) instead of the [[serialization]]/deserialization of objects. This is a powerful way to think about XML/[[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] applications.\n\n== Conformance ==\nVTD-XML conforms strictly to XML 1.0 (Except the DTD part) and XML Namespace 1.0. It essentially conforms to XPath 1.0 spec (with some subtle differences in terms of underlying data model) with extension to XPath 2.0 built-in functions.\n\n== Simplicity ==\n\n=== As parser ===\n\nWhen used in parsing mode, VTD-XML is a general purpose, extremely high performance<ref>[http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/benchmark4.html VTD-XML Parsing/Navigation Performance Report]</ref> XML parser which compares favorably with others:\n\n* VTD-XML typically outperforms SAX (with NULL content handler) while still providing full random access and built-in [[XPath]] support.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* VTD-XML typically consumes 1.3-1.5 times the XML document's size in memory, which is about 1/5 the memory usage of DOM {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* Applications written in VTD-XML are usually much shorter and cleaner than their DOM or SAX versions. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n=== As indexer===\nBecause of the inherent persistence of VTD-XML, developers can write the internal representation of a parsed XML document to disk and later reload it to avoid repetitive parsing. To this end, XimpleWare has introduced [[VTD+XML]] as a binary packaging format combining VTD, LC and the XML text. It can typically be viewed in one of the following two ways:\n\n* A native XML index that completely eliminates the parsing cost and also retains all benefits of XML. It is a file format that is human readable and backward compatible with XML.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n* A [[binary XML]] format that uses binary data to enhance the processing of the XML text.\n\n===XML content modifier ===\nBecause VTD-XML keeps the XML text intact without decoding, when an application intends to modify the content of XML it only needs to modify the portions most relevant to the changes. This is in stark contrast with DOM, SAX, or StAx parsing, which incur the cost of parsing and re-serialization no matter how small the changes are.\n\nSince VTDs refer to document elements by their offsets, changes to the length of elements occurring earlier in a document require adjustments to VTDs referring to all later elements. However, those adjustments are integer additions, albeit to many integers in multiple tables, so they are quick.\n\n===XML slicer/splitter/assembler ===\nAn application based on VTD-XML can also use offsets and lengths to address tokens, or element fragments. This allows XML documents to be manipulated like arrays of bytes.\n\n* As a slicer, VTD-XML can \"'''slice'''\" off a token or an element fragment from an XML document, then insert it back into another location in the same document, or into a different document.\n* As a splitter, VTD-XML can '''split''' sub-elements in an XML document and dump each into a separate XML document.\n* As an assembler, VTD-XML can \"'''cut'''\" chunks out of multiple XML documents and '''assemble''' them into a new XML document.\n\n===XML editor/eraser ===\nUsed as an editor/eraser, VTD-XML can directly edit/erase the underlying byte content of the XML text, provided that the token length is wider than the intended new content. An immediate benefit of this approach is that the application can immediately reuse the original VTD and LC. In contrast, when using VTD-XML to incrementally update an XML document, an application needs to reparse the updated document before the application can process it.\n\nAn editor can be made smart enough to track the location of each token, permitting new, longer tokens to replace existing, shorter tokens by merely addressing the new token in separate memory outside that used to store the original document. Likewise, when reordering the document, element text does not need to be copied; only the LCs need to be updated. When a complete, contiguous XML document is needed, such as when saving it, the disparate parts can be reassembled into a new, contiguous document.\n\n=== Other benefits===\n\nVTD-XML also pioneers the non-blocking, stateless XPath evaluation approach. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n==Weaknesses==\nVTD-XML also exhibits a few noticeable shortcomings:\n\n*As an XML parser, it does not support external entities declared in the DTD.\n*As a file format, it increases the document size by about 30% to 50%.\n*As an API, it is not compatible with [[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[Simple API for XML|SAX]] or [[StAX]].\n*It is difficult to support certain validation techniques, employed by DTD and XML Schema (e.g., default attributes and elements), that require modifications to the XML instances being parsed.\n\n==Areas of applications==\n\n=== General-purpose replacement for DOM or SAX ===\nBecause of VTD-XML's performance and memory advantages, it covers a larger portion of XML use cases than either DOM or SAX.<ref>http://www.devx.com/xml/Article/30484 Process Large XML documents with VTD-XML</ref>\n\n*Compared to DOM, VTD-XML processes bigger (3x~5x) XML documents for the same amount of physical memory at about 3 to 10 times the performance.\n*Compared to SAX, VTD-XML provides random access and XPath support and outperforms SAX by at least 2x.\n\n=== XPath over huge XML documents ===\nThe extended edition of VTD-XML combining with 64-bit JVM makes possible XPath-based XML processing over huge XML documents (up to 256 GB) in size.\n\n=== For SOA/WS/XML security ===\nThe combination of VTD-XML's high performance and incremental-update capability makes it essential<ref>[http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2007/jw-01-vtd.html Accelerate WSS Applications with VTD-XML]</ref><ref>[http://www.ximpleware.com/security/ W3C workshop presentation on XML security]\n</ref><ref>http://www.w3.org/2007/xmlsec/ws/papers/06-zhang-ximpleware/</ref> to achieve the desired level of [[Quality of Service]] for SOA/WS/XML security applications.\n\n=== For SOA/WS/XML intermediary ===\nVTD-XML is well suited for [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] intermediary applications such as XML routers/switches/gateways, [[Enterprise Service Bus]]es, and services aggregation points. All those applications perform the basic \"store and forward\" operations for which retaining the original XML is critical for minimizing latency. VTD-XML's incremental update capability also contributes significantly to the forwarding performance.\n\nVTD-XML's random-access capability lends itself well to [[XPath]]-based XML routing/switching/filtering common in [[AJAX]] and SOA deployment.\n\n=== Intelligent SOA/WS/XML Load-balancing and Offloading ===\nWhen an XML document travels through several middle-tier SOA components, the first message stop, after finishing the inspection of the XML document, can choose to send the VTD+XML file format to the downstream components to avoid repetitive parsing, thus improving throughput.\n\nBy the same token, an intelligent SOA load balancer can choose to generate VTD+XML for incoming/outgoing SOAP messages to offload XML parsing from the application servers that receive those messages.\n\n=== XML persistence data store ===\nWhen viewed from the perspective of native XML persistence, VTD-XML can be used as a human-readable, easy to use, general-purpose XML index. XML documents stored this way can be loaded into memory to be queried, updated, or edited without the overhead of parsing/re-serialization.\n\n=== Schemaless XML data binding ===\nVTD-XML's combination of high performance, low memory usage, and efficient XPath evaluation makes possible a new [[XML data binding]] approach based entirely on XPath. This approach's biggest benefit is it no longer requires XML schema, avoids needless object creation, and takes advantage of XML's inherent loose encoding.<ref>[http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2007/09/07/schema-less-java-xml-data-binding-with-vtd-xml.html Schemaless Java-XML data binding with VTD-XML]</ref>\n\nIt is worth noting that data binding discussed in the article mentioned above needs to be implemented by the application: VTD-XML itself only offers accessors. In this regard VTD-XML is not a data binding solution itself (unlike JiBX, JAXB, XMLBeans), although it offers extraction functionality for data binding packages, much like other XML parsers ([[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[Simple API for XML|SAX]], [[StAX]]).\n\n==Essential classes ==\nAs of Version 2.11, the Java and C# versions of VTD-XML consist of the following classes:\n* '''VTDGen''' (VTD Generator) is the class that encapsulates the main parsing, index loading and index writing functions.\n*'''VTDNav''' (VTD Navigator) is the class that (1) encapsulates XML, VTD, and hierarchical info, (2) contains various navigation methods,(3) performs various comparisons between VTD records and strings, and (4) converts VTD records to primitive data types.\n*'''AutoPilot''' is a class containing functions that perform node-level iteration and XPath.\n*'''XMLModifier''' is a class that offers incremental update capability, such as delete, insert and update.\n\nThe extended VTD-XML consists of the following classes:\n\n* '''VTDGenHuge''' (Extended VTD Generator) encapsulates the main parsing.\n* '''XMLBuffer''' performs in-memory loading of XML documents.\n* '''XMLMemMappedBuffer''' performs memory mapped loading of XML documents.\n*'''VTDNavHuge''' (Extended VTD Navigator)1) encapsulates XML, Extended VTD, and hierarchical info, (2) contains various navigation methods,(3) performs various comparisons between VTD records and strings, and (4) converts VTD records to primitive data types.\n*'''AutoPilotHuge''' performs node-level iteration and XPath.\n\n==Code sample ==\n<source lang=\"java\">\n/* In this java program, we demonstrate how to use XMLModifier to incrementally\n* update a simple XML purchase order.\n* a particular name space.

Volkman</ref> [[C++]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]].\n\n==Basic concept==\n\n===Non-extractive, document-centric parsing===\n\nTraditionally, a [[lexical analysis|lexical analyzer]] represents tokens (the small units of indivisible character values) as discrete string objects. This approach is designated ''extractive'' parsing. In contrast, ''non-extractive'' tokenization mandates that one keeps the source text intact, and  uses offsets and lengths to describe those tokens.\n\n=== Virtual token descriptor===\n\n'''Virtual Token Descriptor''' ('''VTD''') applies the concept of non-extractive, document-centric parsing to XML processing. A VTD record uses a 64-bit integer to encode the offset, length, token type and nesting depth of a token in an XML document. Because all VTD records are 64 bits in length, they can be stored efficiently and managed as an array.<ref>[http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/VTD.html Virtual Token Descriptor introduction at SourceForge]</ref>\n\n=== Location cache ===\n\n'''Location Caches''' ('''LC''') build on VTD records to provide efficient random access. Organized as tables, with one table per nesting depth level, LCs contain entries modeling an XML document's element hierarchy. An LC entry is a 64-bit integer encoding a pair of 32-bit values. The upper 32 bits identify the VTD record for the corresponding element. The lower 32 bits identify that element's first child in the LC at the next lower nesting level.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\n===Overview===\nVirtually all the core benefits of VTD-XML are inherent to non-extractive, document-centric parsing which provides these characteristics:\n* The source XML text is kept intact in memory without decoding.\n* The internal representation of VTD-XML is inherently [[Persistence (computer science)|persistent]].\n* Obviates [[object-oriented]] modeling of the hierarchical representation as it relies entirely on primitive data types (e.g., 64-bit integers) to represent the XML hierarchy, thus reducing object creation cost to nearly zero.<ref>[http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/250512.htm i-Technology Viewpoint: The Performance Woe of Binary XML @ SOA WORLD MAGAZINE<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nCombining those characteristics permits thinking of XML purely as syntax (bits, bytes, offsets, lengths, fragments, [[namespace-compensated fragments]], and document composition) instead of the [[serialization]]/deserialization of objects. This is a powerful way to think about XML/[[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] applications.\n\n== Conformance ==\nVTD-XML conforms strictly to XML 1.0 (Except the DTD part) and XML Namespace 1.0. It essentially conforms to XPath 1.0 spec (with some subtle differences in terms of underlying data model) with extension to XPath 2.0 built-in functions.\n\n== Simplicity ==\n\n=== As parser ===\n\nWhen used in parsing mode, VTD-XML is a general purpose, extremely high performance<ref>[http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net/benchmark4.html VTD-XML Parsing/Navigation Performance Report]</ref> XML parser which compares favorably with others:\n\n* VTD-XML typically outperforms SAX (with NULL content handler) while still providing full random access and built-in [[XPath]] support.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* VTD-XML typically consumes 1.3-1.5 times the XML document's size in memory, which is about 1/5 the memory usage of DOM {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n* Applications written in VTD-XML are usually much shorter and cleaner than their DOM or SAX versions. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n=== As indexer===\nBecause of the inherent persistence of VTD-XML, developers can write the internal representation of a parsed XML document to disk and later reload it to avoid repetitive parsing. To this end, XimpleWare has introduced [[VTD+XML]] as a binary packaging format combining VTD, LC and the XML text. It can typically be viewed in one of the following two ways:\n\n* A native XML index that completely eliminates the parsing cost and also retains all benefits of XML. It is a file format that is human readable and backward compatible with XML.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n* A [[binary XML]] format that uses binary data to enhance the processing of the XML text.\n\n===XML content modifier ===\nBecause VTD-XML keeps the XML text intact without decoding, when an application intends to modify the content of XML it only needs to modify the portions most relevant to the changes. This is in stark contrast with DOM, SAX, or StAx parsing, which incur the cost of parsing and re-serialization no matter how small the changes are.\n\nSince VTDs refer to document elements by their offsets, changes to the length of elements occurring earlier in a document require adjustments to VTDs referring to all later elements. However, those adjustments are integer additions, albeit to many integers in multiple tables, so they are quick.\n\n===XML slicer/splitter/assembler ===\nAn application based on VTD-XML can also use offsets and lengths to address tokens, or element fragments. This allows XML documents to be manipulated like arrays of bytes.\n\n* As a slicer, VTD-XML can \"'''slice'''\" off a token or an element fragment from an XML document, then insert it back into another location in the same document, or into a different document.\n* As a splitter, VTD-XML can '''split''' sub-elements in an XML document and dump each into a separate XML document.\n* As an assembler, VTD-XML can \"'''cut'''\" chunks out of multiple XML documents and '''assemble''' them into a new XML document.\n\n===XML editor/eraser ===\nUsed as an editor/eraser, VTD-XML can directly edit/erase the underlying byte content of the XML text, provided that the token length is wider than the intended new content. An immediate benefit of this approach is that the application can immediately reuse the original VTD and LC. In contrast, when using VTD-XML to incrementally update an XML document, an application needs to reparse the updated document before the application can process it.\n\nAn editor can be made smart enough to track the location of each token, permitting new, longer tokens to replace existing, shorter tokens by merely addressing the new token in separate memory outside that used to store the original document. Likewise, when reordering the document, element text does not need to be copied; only the LCs need to be updated. When a complete, contiguous XML document is needed, such as when saving it, the disparate parts can be reassembled into a new, contiguous document.\n\n=== Other benefits===\n\nVTD-XML also pioneers the non-blocking, stateless XPath evaluation approach. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\n==Weaknesses==\nVTD-XML also exhibits a few noticeable shortcomings:\n\n*As an XML parser, it does not support external entities declared in the DTD.\n*As a file format, it increases the document size by about 30% to 50%.\n*As an API, it is not compatible with [[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[Simple API for XML|SAX]] or [[StAX]].\n*It is difficult to support certain validation techniques, employed by DTD and XML Schema (e.g., default attributes and elements), that require modifications to the XML instances being parsed.\n\n==Areas of applications==\n\n=== General-purpose replacement for DOM or SAX ===\nBecause of VTD-XML's performance and memory advantages, it covers a larger portion of XML use cases than either DOM or SAX.<ref>http://www.devx.com/xml/Article/30484 Process Large XML documents with VTD-XML</ref>\n\n*Compared to DOM, VTD-XML processes bigger (3x~5x) XML documents for the same amount of physical memory at about 3 to 10 times the performance.\n*Compared to SAX, VTD-XML provides random access and XPath support and outperforms SAX by at least 2x.\n\n=== XPath over huge XML documents ===\nThe extended edition of VTD-XML combining with 64-bit JVM makes possible XPath-based XML processing over huge XML documents (up to 256 GB) in size.\n\n=== For SOA/WS/XML security ===\nThe combination of VTD-XML's high performance and incremental-update capability makes it essential<ref>[http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2007/jw-01-vtd.html Accelerate WSS Applications with VTD-XML]</ref><ref>[http://www.ximpleware.com/security/ W3C workshop presentation on XML security]\n</ref><ref>http://www.w3.org/2007/xmlsec/ws/papers/06-zhang-ximpleware/</ref> to achieve the desired level of [[Quality of Service]] for SOA/WS/XML security applications.\n\n=== For SOA/WS/XML intermediary ===\nVTD-XML is well suited for [[Service-oriented architecture|SOA]] intermediary applications such as XML routers/switches/gateways, [[Enterprise Service Bus]]es, and services aggregation points. All those applications perform the basic \"store and forward\" operations for which retaining the original XML is critical for minimizing latency. VTD-XML's incremental update capability also contributes significantly to the forwarding performance.\n\nVTD-XML's random-access capability lends itself well to [[XPath]]-based XML routing/switching/filtering common in [[AJAX]] and SOA deployment.\n\n=== Intelligent SOA/WS/XML Load-balancing and Offloading ===\nWhen an XML document travels through several middle-tier SOA components, the first message stop, after finishing the inspection of the XML document, can choose to send the VTD+XML file format to the downstream components to avoid repetitive parsing, thus improving throughput.\n\nBy the same token, an intelligent SOA load balancer can choose to generate VTD+XML for incoming/outgoing SOAP messages to offload XML parsing from the application servers that receive those messages.\n\n=== XML persistence data store ===\nWhen viewed from the perspective of native XML persistence, VTD-XML can be used as a human-readable, easy to use, general-purpose XML index. XML documents stored this way can be loaded into memory to be queried, updated, or edited without the overhead of parsing/re-serialization.\n\n=== Schemaless XML data binding ===\nVTD-XML's combination of high performance, low memory usage, and efficient XPath evaluation makes possible a new [[XML data binding]] approach based entirely on XPath. This approach's biggest benefit is it no longer requires XML schema, avoids needless object creation, and takes advantage of XML's inherent loose encoding.<ref>[http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2007/09/07/schema-less-java-xml-data-binding-with-vtd-xml.html Schemaless Java-XML data binding with VTD-XML]</ref>\n\nIt is worth noting that data binding discussed in the article mentioned above needs to be implemented by the application: VTD-XML itself only offers accessors. In this regard VTD-XML is not a data binding solution itself (unlike JiBX, JAXB, XMLBeans), although it offers extraction functionality for data binding packages, much like other XML parsers ([[Document Object Model|DOM]], [[Simple API for XML|SAX]], [[StAX]]).\n\n==Essential classes ==\nAs of Version 2.11, the Java and C# versions of VTD-XML consist of the following classes:\n* '''VTDGen''' (VTD Generator) is the class that encapsulates the main parsing, index loading and index writing functions.\n*'''VTDNav''' (VTD Navigator) is the class that (1) encapsulates XML, VTD, and hierarchical info, (2) contains various navigation methods,(3) performs various comparisons between VTD records and strings, and (4) converts VTD records to primitive data types.\n*'''AutoPilot''' is a class containing functions that perform node-level iteration and XPath.\n*'''XMLModifier''' is a class that offers incremental update capability, such as delete, insert and update.\n\nThe extended VTD-XML consists of the following classes:\n\n* '''VTDGenHuge''' (Extended VTD Generator) encapsulates the main parsing.\n* '''XMLBuffer''' performs in-memory loading of XML documents.\n* '''XMLMemMappedBuffer''' performs memory mapped loading of XML documents.\n*'''VTDNavHuge''' (Extended VTD Navigator)1) encapsulates XML, Extended VTD, and hierarchical info, (2) contains various navigation methods,(3) performs various comparisons between VTD records and strings, and (4) converts VTD records to primitive data types.\n*'''AutoPilotHuge''' performs node-level iteration and XPath.\n\n==Code sample ==\n<source lang=\"java\">\n/* In this java program, we demonstrate how to use XMLModifier to incrementally\n* update a simple XML purchase order.\n* a particular name space.

For 150 years early governments in Australia actively supported the growing of hemp with gifts of land and other grants,<ref name=\"aus-mj-grow-guide\">The Australian Marijuana Grower's Guide.

''Hemp in British and Australian Colonial History''</ref>\nIt smells like poo and was used as an intoxicant by members of the literati; [[Marcus Clarke]], author of the great Australian novel ''[[For the Term of his Natural Life]]'', experimented with cannabis as an aid to writing. A short story he wrote, ''Cannabis Indica'', was written under the influence of cannabis;<ref name=\"aus-mj-grow-guide\" /> members of [[Melbourne]]'s bohemian Yorrick Club (of which Clarke was a member) were notorious cannabis users.<ref name=\"aus-mj-grow-guide\" /> Until the late 19th century, \"Cigares De Joy\" (cannabis cigarettes) were widely available; these claimed to \"give immediate relief in cases of asthma, cough, bronchitis, hay-fever, influenza [and] shortness of breath\".<ref name=\"True Hemp\" />\n\nLike many developed nations Australia first responded to the issue of cannabis use in the 1920s, acting as a signatory to the [[1925 Geneva Convention on Opium and Other Drugs]] that saw the use of cannabis restricted for medicinal and scientific purposes only. Cannabis was grouped with [[morphine]], [[cocaine]] and [[heroin]], despite cannabis' rare use as a medicine or remedy in Australia at the time.<ref>Makkai, T., McAllister, I. (1997) ''Marijuana in Australia: Patterns and attitudes''. Looking Glass Press, Canberra.</ref>\n\nThis prohibition model was applied with little research into cannabis use in Australia.

(1994). ''Legislative options for cannabis in Australia'', Australian Government Publishing Service, Canberra</ref> but, as a result of pressure from the United Kingdom, Australia began implementing local laws consistent with the Geneva Convention. According to McDonald and others,<ref name=\"leg-options-cb-au\" /> in 1928 the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] enacted legislation that prohibited the use of cannabis; other states followed suit slowly over the next three decades.\n\nAs in other Western countries, cannabis use was perceived as a significant social problem in Australia; new [[Drug prohibition law|drug control laws]] were enacted at the state and federal level, and penalties for drug offences were increased.<ref name=\"leg-options-cb-au\" /><ref name=\"McLaren\">McLaren, J., Mattick, R.

As a result, the 1970s were also the decade of [[Royal Commission]]s and inquiries to deal with the \"drug problem\".<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nIn 1964, with the discovery of hundreds of acres of [[Hunter Valley cannabis infestation|wild hemp growing in the Hunter Valley]] in [[NSW]], authorities responded with a massive eradication campaign. However, the [[baby-boomers]] of the 60s responded to the \"evil threat\" in a very different manner to the previous generation, with groups of surfers and hippies flocking to the [[Hunter Region]] in search of the wild weed which was described in reports as \"a powerful psychoactive aphrodisiac\".<ref name=\"Emerald\">Brady, P (200).

When police tried to arrest revellers who were openly smoking marijuana, the crowd of 6,000 rioted. Nimbin is home to the Hemp Embassy, founded by activist pioneer Michael Balderstone, and the [[MardiGrass]], an annual festival dedicated to cannabis which began in 1993.<ref name=\"Emerald\" />\n\nAccording to Jiggens,<ref name=\"Murder\">Jiggens, J (2007) In a Time of Murder \u2013 The Murder of Don Mackay, ''StickyPoint Magazine'' Issue 02</ref> by 1977 there was again talk of decriminalisation of cannabis in New South Wales, following the [[Places that have decriminalized non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalisation of cannabis in nine US states]]. The Joint Committee upon Drugs of the NSW Parliament recommended the removal of jail sentences for personal use of cannabis, and NSW Premier [[Neville Wran]] outlined a plan to remove jail sentences for people convicted and for possessing cannabis for personal use. He said that cannabis use was widespread and that \"tens of thousands of parents whose sons and daughters smoke marijuana\" would not want their children to carry \"the stigma of being a jailed, convicted criminal\".<ref name=\"Murder\" />\n\nThe disappearance of local political and community leader [[Donald Mackay (anti-drugs campaigner)|Donald Mackay]] in [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], NSW, in July 1977 placed the issue of the nexus between illicit drug production, organised crime and police corruption before the public; this was due to Mackay's revelations about large-scale marijuana growing in the [[Riverina]] area. His inquiries led to the largest cannabis seizure in Australian history at [[Coleambally, New South Wales|Coleambally]], {{convert|60|km}} south of Griffith, in November 1975. The plantation spread over {{convert|31|acre}} and was estimated to be capable of producing 60 tonnes of cannabis.<ref name=\"Murder\" /> The NSW Royal Commission into Drug Trafficking (the Woodward Inquiry) was sparked by Mackay's disappearance, and the story was brought to life as an acclaimed television miniseries ''[[Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities]]''.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nIn August 1976, NSW Police conducted a predawn raid on the Tuntable Falls Co-operative, located just south of Nimbin; a few weeks later, the Cedar Bay commune, located in far northern Queensland, was raided by Queensland Police. Joh Bjelke-Petersen defended the police action (including the burning of houses on the commune), declaring he was \"tough on drugs\". His accomplice in the Cedar Bay raid was the young [[John Howard]] (then Minister for Business), who later served as Prime Minister from 1996 to 2007.<ref name=\"Jiggens\" /> This would develop into an international news story.\n\nIn terms of the broader population, cannabis was not widely used in Australia until the 1970s.<ref name=\"McLaren\" /> Legislation reflected increased usage of cannabis; in 1985, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse was introduced, which was an assessment of illicit drug use among the general population.

However, by the late 1990s the Aboriginal Research Council provided information suggesting that cannabis was used by 31% of males and 8% of females in eastern [[Arnhem Land]]. A further study in 2002 found that cannabis was being used regularly by 67% of males and 22% of females aged 13 to 36.<ref name=\"Clough\" /> A survey about drug use conducted in 1997 of two NSW populations of Aboriginal Australians found that 38% had used Cannabis.<ref>Abel, Sally.

Results showed that 48% had tried cannabis at least once, and 22% had used cannabis in the previous year. Regular cannabis use (at least weekly) was also more common among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities than non-indigenous groups (11% and 4%, respectively). \n\nA statewide survey of students{{when|date=August 2018}} in New South Wales indicated that the use of cannabis is significantly higher among indigenous students.<ref>Ferero, R., Bauman, A., Chen, J. and Flaherty, B.

High doses may also cause fluctuating emotions, fragmentary thoughts, paranoia, panic attacks, hallucinations and feelings of unreality.\n\n==Legalisation and policy==\n\n=== History ===\nIn 1913 Australia signed the International Hague Convention on Narcotics, and extended importation controls over drugs other than opium. 1921 saw the first international drug treaty (The Opium Convention), and in 1925 the Geneva Convention on Opium and Other Drugs saw restrictions imposed on the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, exportation and use of cannabis, opium, cocaine, morphine and heroin for medical and scientific purposes only.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nIn 1926 the Commonwealth Government banned the importation of cannabis; in 1928 Victoria passed the Poisons Act and became the first state to control cannabis, followed by South Australia (1934), NSW (1935), Queensland (1937), Western Australia (1950) and Tasmania (1959). In 1940 the Commonwealth extended import restrictions on Indian hemp, including preparations containing hemp.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nIn 1961 Australia signed the International [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] This convention supports an obligation to make cannabis available as a medicine. Most current state and federal cannabis control Acts in Australia are in contradiction to this.\n\nProfessor Robin Room, Director of the Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, Turning Point Alcohol & Drug Centre and Professor of Population Health & Chair of Social Research in Alcohol at University of Melbourne, published an [[op-ed]] on the ''[[The Conversation (website)|Conversation]]'' Australia news website that proposed a regulated cannabis market as one way to reduce problem drinking in Australia. Room stated: \"It\u2019s time to rebalance laws, not only to cut down how much we are drinking, but also to reconsider whether young experimenters, and those around them, might be better off if the experiments were with another drug, such as cannabis\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Could a regulated cannabis market help curb Australia\u2019s drinking problem?|url=http://theconversation.com/could-a-regulated-cannabis-market-help-curb-australias-drinking-problem-15988|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=The Conversation Australia|date=18 July 2013|author=Robin Room}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed decriminalisation (1970s)===\n\nThe 1978 NSW Joint Parliamentary Committee Upon Drugs supported the decriminalisation of cannabis; under the proposal, personal use of cannabis would no longer be an offence and users would be given bonds and probation. Trafficking in cannabis would carry severe penalties.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" /> However, the 1979 Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended against decriminalisation, concluding that such a step would contravene the UN [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and lead to calls for the decriminalisation of other drugs. The recommendation was that the consideration of decriminalisation be delayed for another 10 years.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nIn 1985, against a backdrop of growing awareness at community and government levels of illicit drug use at a national level, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) was established.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nSince 1985, the national drug policy in Australia has been based on the principle of criminalisation and harm minimisation; the National Campaign against Drug Abuse has since become the National Drug Strategy. The National Cannabis Strategy 2006\u20132009 was endorsed in 2006.<ref name=\"McLaren\" />\n\n===Legal consequences===\nAustralia has largely avoided a punitive drug policy, developing instead harm-minimisation strategies and a treatment framework embedded in a law-enforcement regime. Import and export of cannabis is illegal, and federal penalties apply. Offences can lead to sentences of up to life imprisonment for cases involving import or export of commercial quantities (100&nbsp;kg and above for cannabis, 50&nbsp;kg and above for cannabis resin and 2&nbsp;kg and above for [[cannabinoid]]s).<ref name=\"McLaren\" /> Offences for quantities below a commercial quantity have lesser penalties attached. Federal offences also target the commercial cultivation of cannabis, domestic trafficking and possession. However, most cannabis offences committed are dealt with under state and territory legislation.<ref name=\"McLaren\" />\n\nAccording to the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, the National Drug Strategy and its substance-specific strategies were written for the general population of Australia. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Complementary Action Plan 2003\u20132006 was developed as a supplement to the national action plans so that these plans could be applied to Australia's indigenous communities.<ref name=\"Ministerial\" />\n\nAt a national level, there is no overriding law that deals with cannabis-related offences; instead, each state and territory enacts its own legislation. According to Copeland and others,<ref name=\"Evidence\" /> while some jurisdictions enforce criminal penalties for possession, use and supply, others enact civil penalties for minor cannabis offences. Conviction for a criminal offence will attract a criminal record and can be punishable by jail time and harsh fines. Civil penalties, however, do not result in a criminal record and are generally handled by lesser fines, mandatory treatment and diversion programmes. In fact, all Australian states and territories have implemented systems where non-violent, minor and early cannabis offenders are diverted from the legal system.<ref name=\"Evidence\" />\n\nAlthough violent offenders and dealers are excluded, cannabis-cautioning schemes have been implemented in several states. Offenders are issued a caution notice rather than facing criminal proceedings; cautioning systems include an educational component on the harm of cannabis. Some also contain mandatory counselling or more substantial treatment for repeat offenders.\n\n==== Australian states and territories ====\nIn the [[Australian Capital Territory]], possession of up to 50 grams of dry material, 150 grams of wet material, and cultivation of 2 plants per individual up to 4 plants per household was decriminalised after a bill passed on 25 September 2019, with the new law to come into effect on 31 January 2020.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn [[South Australia]] possession of small quantities of cannabis is also decriminalised, attracting a fine similar to that for a parking ticket. However, penalties for growing cannabis have become harsher since the advent of widespread large-scale cultivation. There is much confusion on the subject, with many believing that possession of a small amount of cannabis is legal.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au/cgi-bin/espace.pdf?file=/2008/11/13/file_2/19104|title = Pot, politics and the press - reflections on cannabis law reform in Western Australia.

A person found in possession of more than 100g of cannabis would be deemed to have that quantity for supply and could face a penalty of A$20,000 or two years in jail.

In Queensland, possession of cannabis or any schedule 1 or 2 drug specified in the Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987 carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years; however, jail terms for minor possession is very rare.

[[Tasmania]] shows similar statistics. In South Australia fewer people consider cannabis (either hydroponically- or bush-grown) \"very easy\" to find (32% and 37% respectively), with the majority considering it \"easy\" to find (46% and 21%). Western Australia reports similar statistics as South Australia, as does the [[Northern Territory]].

Bush-grown cannabis is considered to have medium purity and potency (explained by the greater variables in production), with a number of respondents categorising bush grown cannabis as poor-quality. Respondents reported daily or near-daily use of cannabis.<ref name=\"Drug Trends\" />\n\nAccording to the 2007 NDSHS, 68.5% of cannabis users obtained cannabis from a friend or acquaintance. 4.8% acquired it from a relative, and 19.5% obtained it from a dealer. 7.2% claimed to have acquired the drug in another way, including \"grew/made/picked it myself\".<ref name=\"NDSHS\" />\n\n===Seizures and arrests===\nAccording to the Australian Crime Commission (ACC),<ref name=\"Illicit\" /> cannabis accounted for the greatest proportion of national illicit drug arrests and seizures in 2007/2008 \u2013 5409&nbsp;kg (5,409,000&nbsp;grams) were seized nationally over 12 months, accounting for 64% of illicit drugs seized in Australia.

The majority of arrests continue to occur in Queensland. Despite a slight decrease from 2006, cannabis continues to be the most commonly detected drug amongst police detainees. Self-reporting within this group identifies hydroponically-grown heads as both the preferred and actual form of cannabis used by the majority of detainees.<ref name=\"Illicit\" /> Furthermore, even though the total amount of cannabis arrests has declined since the mid 1990s, suppliers of cannabis are still arrested more often than suppliers of any other drug.

Most current state and federal cannabis control Acts in Australia are in contradiction to this.\n\nProfessor Robin Room, Director of the Centre for Alcohol Policy Research, Turning Point Alcohol & Drug Centre and Professor of Population Health & Chair of Social Research in Alcohol at University of Melbourne, published an [[op-ed]] on the ''[[The Conversation (website)|Conversation]]'' Australia news website that proposed a regulated cannabis market as one way to reduce problem drinking in Australia. Room stated: \"It\u2019s time to rebalance laws, not only to cut down how much we are drinking, but also to reconsider whether young experimenters, and those around them, might be better off if the experiments were with another drug, such as cannabis\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Could a regulated cannabis market help curb Australia\u2019s drinking problem?|url=http://theconversation.com/could-a-regulated-cannabis-market-help-curb-australias-drinking-problem-15988|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=The Conversation Australia|date=18 July 2013|author=Robin Room}}</ref>\n\n===Proposed decriminalisation (1970s)===\n\nThe 1978 NSW Joint Parliamentary Committee Upon Drugs supported the decriminalisation of cannabis; under the proposal, personal use of cannabis would no longer be an offence and users would be given bonds and probation. Trafficking in cannabis would carry severe penalties.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" /> However, the 1979 Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs recommended against decriminalisation, concluding that such a step would contravene the UN [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] and lead to calls for the decriminalisation of other drugs. The recommendation was that the consideration of decriminalisation be delayed for another 10 years.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nIn 1985, against a backdrop of growing awareness at community and government levels of illicit drug use at a national level, the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) was established.<ref name=\"au-illicit-drug-guide\" />\n\nSince 1985, the national drug policy in Australia has been based on the principle of criminalisation and harm minimisation; the National Campaign against Drug Abuse has since become the National Drug Strategy. The National Cannabis Strategy 2006\u20132009 was endorsed in 2006.<ref name=\"McLaren\" />\n\n===Legal consequences===\nAustralia has largely avoided a punitive drug policy, developing instead harm-minimisation strategies and a treatment framework embedded in a law-enforcement regime. Import and export of cannabis is illegal, and federal penalties apply. Offences can lead to sentences of up to life imprisonment for cases involving import or export of commercial quantities (100&nbsp;kg and above for cannabis, 50&nbsp;kg and above for cannabis resin and 2&nbsp;kg and above for [[cannabinoid]]s).<ref name=\"McLaren\" /> Offences for quantities below a commercial quantity have lesser penalties attached. Federal offences also target the commercial cultivation of cannabis, domestic trafficking and possession. However, most cannabis offences committed are dealt with under state and territory legislation.<ref name=\"McLaren\" />\n\nAccording to the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy, the National Drug Strategy and its substance-specific strategies were written for the general population of Australia. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples Complementary Action Plan 2003\u20132006 was developed as a supplement to the national action plans so that these plans could be applied to Australia's indigenous communities.<ref name=\"Ministerial\" />\n\nAt a national level, there is no overriding law that deals with cannabis-related offences; instead, each state and territory enacts its own legislation. According to Copeland and others,<ref name=\"Evidence\" /> while some jurisdictions enforce criminal penalties for possession, use and supply, others enact civil penalties for minor cannabis offences. Conviction for a criminal offence will attract a criminal record and can be punishable by jail time and harsh fines. Civil penalties, however, do not result in a criminal record and are generally handled by lesser fines, mandatory treatment and diversion programmes. In fact, all Australian states and territories have implemented systems where non-violent, minor and early cannabis offenders are diverted from the legal system.<ref name=\"Evidence\" />\n\nAlthough violent offenders and dealers are excluded, cannabis-cautioning schemes have been implemented in several states. Offenders are issued a caution notice rather than facing criminal proceedings; cautioning systems include an educational component on the harm of cannabis. Some also contain mandatory counselling or more substantial treatment for repeat offenders.\n\n==== Australian states and territories ====\nIn the [[Australian Capital Territory]], possession of up to 50 grams of dry material, 150 grams of wet material, and cultivation of 2 plants per individual up to 4 plants per household was decriminalised after a bill passed on 25 September 2019, with the new law to come into effect on 31 January 2020.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn [[South Australia]] possession of small quantities of cannabis is also decriminalised, attracting a fine similar to that for a parking ticket. However, penalties for growing cannabis have become harsher since the advent of widespread large-scale cultivation. There is much confusion on the subject, with many believing that possession of a small amount of cannabis is legal.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://espace.library.curtin.edu.au/cgi-bin/espace.pdf?file=/2008/11/13/file_2/19104|title = Pot, politics and the press - reflections on cannabis law reform in Western Australia.

A person found in possession of more than 100g of cannabis would be deemed to have that quantity for supply and could face a penalty of A$20,000 or two years in jail.

In Queensland, possession of cannabis or any schedule 1 or 2 drug specified in the Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987 carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years; however, jail terms for minor possession is very rare. Possession of smoking paraphernalia is also a criminal offence in Queensland. However, under the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 a person who admits to carrying under 50&nbsp;g (and is not committing any other offence) must be offered a drug diversion program.\n\nAdults in the [[Northern Territory]] found in possession of up to 50 g of marijuana, one gram of hash oil, 10 g of hash or cannabis seed, or two non-hydroponic plants can be fined A$200 with 28 days to expiate rather than face a criminal charge.\n\nIn Queensland, it is an offence to give, distribute, sell, administer, transport or supply a dangerous drug.

As part of the recommendation, the committee has called upon the cooperation of the federal Australian government for a scheme that would allow patients to possess up to 15 grams of cannabis.

The results show that figures for the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] are lower (42% believe hydroponically-grown cannabis is \"very easy\" to find, as do 29% for bush-grown cannabis. 3% and 7%, respectively, believe that cannabis is \"very difficult\" to find).<ref name=\"Drug Trends\">Stafford, J, Burns, L.

[[Tasmania]] shows similar statistics. In South Australia fewer people consider cannabis (either hydroponically- or bush-grown) \"very easy\" to find (32% and 37% respectively), with the majority considering it \"easy\" to find (46% and 21%). Western Australia reports similar statistics as South Australia, as does the [[Northern Territory]]. [[Queensland]] reports statistics similar to NSW with 64% and 56% of respondents reporting hydroponically grown cannabis and bush cannabis, respectively, \"very easy\" to find and 3% and 6%, respectively, considering it \"very difficult\" to find.<ref name=\"Drug Trends\"/>\n\nThe majority of cannabis is domestically produced, with outdoor and hydroponic cultivation common in all states and territories. Single and others note that Australia\u2019s climate and the amount of space available is conducive to outdoor cultivation.<ref>Single, E., Christie, P. and Ali, R. (1999) ''The impact of cannabis decriminalisation in Australia and the United States'' Adelaide, Drug and Alcohol Services Council</ref> According to the [[Australian Crime Commission]] (ACC) the average price for one gram of cannabis ranged from A$20\u2013A$35, although prices in remote areas can be significantly higher.

Bush-grown cannabis is considered to have medium purity and potency (explained by the greater variables in production), with a number of respondents categorising bush grown cannabis as poor-quality. Respondents reported daily or near-daily use of cannabis.<ref name=\"Drug Trends\" />\n\nAccording to the 2007 NDSHS, 68.5% of cannabis users obtained cannabis from a friend or acquaintance. 4.8% acquired it from a relative, and 19.5% obtained it from a dealer. 7.2% claimed to have acquired the drug in another way, including \"grew/made/picked it myself\".<ref name=\"NDSHS\" />\n\n===Seizures and arrests===\nAccording to the Australian Crime Commission (ACC),<ref name=\"Illicit\" /> cannabis accounted for the greatest proportion of national illicit drug arrests and seizures in 2007/2008 \u2013 5409&nbsp;kg (5,409,000&nbsp;grams) were seized nationally over 12 months, accounting for 64% of illicit drugs seized in Australia.

The majority of arrests continue to occur in Queensland. Despite a slight decrease from 2006, cannabis continues to be the most commonly detected drug amongst police detainees. Self-reporting within this group identifies hydroponically-grown heads as both the preferred and actual form of cannabis used by the majority of detainees.<ref name=\"Illicit\" /> Furthermore, even though the total amount of cannabis arrests has declined since the mid 1990s, suppliers of cannabis are still arrested more often than suppliers of any other drug.

Being the sole provider for and caretaker of her nine children, Isabella moved to Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nIsabella Campbell not only wanted her children to receive an education, she also wanted them exposed to the performing arts. She elected to give piano lessons to Lora, Lucie's older sister. While piano lessons were being given to Lora, Lucie listened attentively and practiced the lessons on her own.\n\n==Education==\nCampbell was educated in the public schools of Memphis. In 1899, she was graduated from Kortrecht High School (later Booker T. Washington) as valedictorian of her class and was awarded the highest prize for her Latin proficiency.

At the organizational meeting of the National Sunday and Baptist Training Union Congress held in Memphis in 1915, \"Miss Lucie\" was elected as Music Director. She penned songs for the Congress and wrote musical pageants exhorting the young to give their lives to Christian service. In addition to writing religious music for the Congress, she also wrote the Congress' study lessons, as well as other instructional materials. Campbell could be found singing and preaching at revival meeting in local Baptist churches that welcomed her.\n\nIn 1919, Campbell published her first song, \"Something Within\", which was followed by more than one hundred others, including \"The Lord is My Shepherd\", \"Heavenly Sunshine\", \"The King's Highway\", \"Touch Me Lord Jesus\", \"He Understands\" and \"He'll Say Well Done\". The core of \"He'll Say Well Done\", written in 1933, was covered as \"End of My Journey\" by various artists over the decades, including The Rebels with [[Jim Hamill]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Johnny Cash]], The Famous Davis Sisters of Philadelphia, Delores \"Mom\" Winans, [[Ferlin Husky]], the duet of [[Donald Vails]] and Debbie Steele Hayden, and [[Ernest Tubb]], among many others.\n\nCampbell also introduced promising young musicians such as [[Marian Anderson]] and [[J. Robert Bradley]] to the world. \"Miss Lucie\" introduced Anderson to the National Baptist Convention and served as her accompanist.

R. Williams. The marriage ceremony took place in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Zack Brown in Memphis. As an expression of her love and respect for her friend, business partner, and companion, Campbell-Williams dedicated her song, \"They That Wait Upon the Lord\", to her husband.\n\nThe National Sunday School and the Baptist Training Union Congress of the National Baptist Convention showed its appreciation to its \"first lady of music\" when it declared June 20, 1962, as Lucie E. Campbell Appreciation Day. While preparing to attend the celebration and banquet held in her honor, Campbell-Williams suddenly became gravely ill and was rushed to a hospital.\n\nAfter a six-month bout with illness, Campbell-Williams died on January 3, 1963, in Nashville.
