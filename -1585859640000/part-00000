Many Old Persian texts include the Samarkand Observatory and the great Ulugh Beg.\n\nHe invited skillful mathematicians and astronomers to help build this observatory and also a madrassa in Samarkand. Among those he invited were Gh\u012by\u0101th al-D\u012bn Jamshid al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji<ref name=\":6\" />. Over 60 mathematicians and astronomers were invited to the observatory. Jamshid Al-Kashi was appointed as the first director of the observatory. After al-Kashi\u2019s death Qada Zada became the director of the observatory. After the death of Qadi Zada, Qushji led the observatory as the last and final director. The Samarkand Observatory was a place for astronomers and mathematician to work together in finding new discoveries.\n\nUlugh Beg\u2019s observatory was built according to the plans of the Maragha observatory, which was designed by Nasir al-din al-Tusi<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Juhel|first=Alain|date=2007|title=Prince of Samarqand Stars|url=|journal=The Mathematical Tourist|volume=|pages=44\u201350|via=}}</ref>. Ulugh Beg\u2019s observatory included the largest quadrant principle device. The building was not tall but was allowed a maximal size for the arc of the circle. This device was carefully oriented, and the arc was scaled very accurately. This device was very versatile. It could accurately measure the sun from the horizon, the altitude of a star and other planets. The duration of the year, period of planets, and eclipses were measured by this device. Ulugh Beg\u2019s measurements of planets closely relate to today\u2019s measurement, showing us the phenomenal accuracy of the device<ref name=\":7\" />.\n\nPeople visiting Ulugh Beg's observatory today, can only see the foundations and the buried part of the marble quadrant<ref name=\":7\" />.

Having received an invitation from Ulugh Beg, Al-Kashi left his native land of Kashan in north central Iran and went to Samarkand. A letter that Al-Kashi wrote to his father during his stay in Samarkand has been translated by Kennedy (1960) and Say\u0131l\u0131 (1960). This letter, written in Persian, has shaped the modern view of Samarkand activities substantially despite its lack of information about scientific activities that were taking place at the observatory. However, a new letter written by Al-Kashi to his father has been found in Iran, and the translation of this letter by Bagheri sheds more light on the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand in particular and reduces the ambiguity of certain elements in the first letter by virtue of their overlapping parts.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|last1=A Letter of Jamsh\u0131d al-Kash\u0131 to His Father: Scientific Research and Personalities at a Fifteenth Century Court, Orientalia 29 (1960), 191\u2013213; reprinted in Edward S.

The Fakhr\u0131 sextant, stood on top of a rock into which some of it was carved, so the edifice would not be tall given the soft bricks of the area. Al-Kashi compares this to Maragha, saying that the sextant is positioned higher there but also notes the flat roof present in Samarkand should facilitate scientific improvement given the fact that \u201cinstruments may be placed on it\u201d.<ref name=\":02\" /> This information, about the sextants in Maragha is contradictory to other sources that state there were no sextants at Maragha.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ayd\u0131n Say\u0131l\u0131, Ulug\u02c7 Bey ve Semerkanddeki I\u02c6lim Faal\u0131yeti Hakk\u0131nda G\u0131yasu\u00a8ddin-i Ka\u02c6s\u00b8\u0131\u2019nin Mektubu: Ghiyath al-D\u0131n al-Kash\u0131\u2019s Letter on Ulugh Bey and the Scientific Activity in Samarqand, Ankara: Tu\u00a8rk Tarih Kurumu Bas\u0131mevi, 1960.)

The lack of awareness and strict adherence to prior methods by Ulugh Beg himself reveals the perhaps provincial nature of their studies. However, this perceived closed-mindedness was alleviated by the increasing diversity of scientists and students that were invited to the observatory.

Many Old Persian texts include the Samarkand Observatory and the great Ulugh Beg.\n\nHe invited skillful mathematicians and astronomers to help build this observatory and also a madrassa in Samarkand. Among those he invited were Gh\u012by\u0101th al-D\u012bn Jamshid al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Mu\u2019in al-Din al-Kashi, Salah al-Din Qadi Zada Rumi, and Ali Qushiji<ref name=\":6\" />. Over 60 mathematicians and astronomers were invited to the observatory. Jamshid Al-Kashi was appointed as the first director of the observatory. After al-Kashi\u2019s death Qada Zada became the director of the observatory. After the death of Qadi Zada, Qushji led the observatory as the last and final director. The Samarkand Observatory was a place for astronomers and mathematician to work together in finding new discoveries.\n\nUlugh Beg\u2019s observatory was built according to the plans of the Maragha observatory, which was designed by Nasir al-din al-Tusi<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Juhel|first=Alain|date=2007|title=Prince of Samarqand Stars|url=|journal=The Mathematical Tourist|volume=|pages=44\u201350|via=}}</ref>. Ulugh Beg\u2019s observatory included the largest quadrant principle device. The building was not tall but was allowed a maximal size for the arc of the circle. This device was carefully oriented, and the arc was scaled very accurately. This device was very versatile. It could accurately measure the sun from the horizon, the altitude of a star and other planets. The duration of the year, period of planets, and eclipses were measured by this device. Ulugh Beg\u2019s measurements of planets closely relate to today\u2019s measurement, showing us the phenomenal accuracy of the device<ref name=\":7\" />.\n\nPeople visiting Ulugh Beg's observatory today, can only see the foundations and the buried part of the marble quadrant<ref name=\":7\" />. Those are the only original vestiges from the observatory. Much of the decline of the observatory could be contributed to Ulugh Beg's death.\n\nNot much is known about the decline of the observatory. However, Ulugh Beg's assassination by his son, Abd al Latif, in around 1449, may have the major factor.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ulugh-beg-observatory|title=Ulugh Beg Observatory|website=Atlas Obscura|access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref> Ulugh Beg's death caused chaos within the observatory. The observatory was destroyed and dozens of talented astronomers and mathematicians were driven away.<ref name=\":3\" /> In 1908, the Russian archaeologist Vassily Vyatkin uncovered the remains of the observatory.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''<big>Scientific Atmosphere</big>'''\n\nJamshid [[Al-Kashi]], a 15th century astronomer and mathematician, is known to have relocated to Samarkand to interact with the scientific processes taking place there. Having received an invitation from Ulugh Beg, Al-Kashi left his native land of Kashan in north central Iran and went to Samarkand. A letter that Al-Kashi wrote to his father during his stay in Samarkand has been translated by Kennedy (1960) and Say\u0131l\u0131 (1960). This letter, written in Persian, has shaped the modern view of Samarkand activities substantially despite its lack of information about scientific activities that were taking place at the observatory. However, a new letter written by Al-Kashi to his father has been found in Iran, and the translation of this letter by Bagheri sheds more light on the scientific atmosphere of Samarkand in particular and reduces the ambiguity of certain elements in the first letter by virtue of their overlapping parts.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal|last1=A Letter of Jamsh\u0131d al-Kash\u0131 to His Father: Scientific Research and Personalities at a Fifteenth Century Court, Orientalia 29 (1960), 191\u2013213; reprinted in Edward S.

The Fakhr\u0131 sextant, stood on top of a rock into which some of it was carved, so the edifice would not be tall given the soft bricks of the area. Al-Kashi compares this to Maragha, saying that the sextant is positioned higher there but also notes the flat roof present in Samarkand should facilitate scientific improvement given the fact that \u201cinstruments may be placed on it\u201d.<ref name=\":02\" /> This information, about the sextants in Maragha is contradictory to other sources that state there were no sextants at Maragha.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ayd\u0131n Say\u0131l\u0131, Ulug\u02c7 Bey ve Semerkanddeki I\u02c6lim Faal\u0131yeti Hakk\u0131nda G\u0131yasu\u00a8ddin-i Ka\u02c6s\u00b8\u0131\u2019nin Mektubu: Ghiyath al-D\u0131n al-Kash\u0131\u2019s Letter on Ulugh Bey and the Scientific Activity in Samarqand, Ankara: Tu\u00a8rk Tarih Kurumu Bas\u0131mevi, 1960.)

The lack of awareness and strict adherence to prior methods by Ulugh Beg himself reveals the perhaps provincial nature of their studies. However, this perceived closed-mindedness was alleviated by the increasing diversity of scientists and students that were invited to the observatory. An evaluation of the errors made in Ptolemy at Samarkand by Shevchenko further confirms the effects of Samarkand\u2019s initial isolated nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shevchenko|first=M.|date=1990-05-01|title=An Analysis of Errors in the Star Catalogues of Ptolemy and Ulugh Beg|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=21|issue=2|pages=187\u2013201|doi=10.1177/002182869002100202|issn=0021-8286|bibcode=1990JHA....21..187S}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bageri\u2019s translation of Al-Kashi\u2019s letter, a lot of teaching was going on there strictly from memory by teachers who had learned from astronomers in Herat.<ref name=\":02\" /> Moreover, at the time Al-Kashi wrote the letter, three of the teachers were well versed in Islamic jurisprudence: Qaz\u0131zada, Maulana Muhammad Khan\u0131, and Maulana Abu\u2019l-Fath.<ref name=\":02\" /> The letter also states that Ulugh Beg did not show up to teach class often.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nMaulana Abu\u2019l-Fath stated that he was intellectually underneath Maulana Muhammad Khan\u0131, who was only occasionally present in the court meetings or observatory meetings, and Qaz\u0131zada, who was always practicing his craft.

{"title_page": "Pierre Guyotat", "text_new": "{{short description|French writer}}\n'''Pierre Guyotat''' (9 January 1940 \u2013 7 February 2020) was a French writer.\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in [[Bourg-Argental]], [[Loire]], Guyotat wrote his first novel, ''[[Sur un cheval]]'', in 1960.  He was called to [[Algeria]] in the same year. In 1962 he was found guilty of desertion and publishing forbidden material.  After three months in jail he was transferred to a disciplinary centre.  Back in Paris, he got involved in journalism, writing first for [[France Observateur]], then for [[Nouvel Observateur]].  In 1964, Guyotat published his second novel ''[[Ashby, novel|Ashby]]''.\n\nIn 1967, he published ''[[Tombeau pour cinq cent mille soldats]]'' (later released in English as ''Tomb for 500,000 Soldiers''). Based on Guyotat's ordeal as a soldier in the [[Algerian War]], the book earned a cult reputation and became the subject of various controversies, mostly because of its omnipresent sexual obsessions and homoeroticism.\n\nIn 1968, Guyotat became a member of the French Communist Party, which he left in 1971.\n\n''Eden, Eden, Eden'' came out in 1970 with a preface by [[Michel Leiris]], [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Philippe Sollers]] (Michel Foucault's text was received late and therefore didn't appear as a preface<ref>Catherine Brun, ''Pierre Guyotat. Essai biographique'', Paris: L\u00e9o Scheer, 2005, p. 220-221.</ref>). This book was banned from being publicized or sold to minors. A petition of international support was signed (notably by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Pierre Dac]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Joseph Kessel]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Jacques Monod]], and [[Nathalie Sarraute]]). [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], and [[Georges Pompidou]] tried to get the ban lifted but failed. [[Claude Simon]] (who won the Nobel Prize in 1985) resigned from the jury of the [[Prix M\u00e9dicis]] after the prize wasn't awarded to ''Eden, Eden, Eden''.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1975, Pierre Guyotat travelled extensively in the Sahara. In July 1967, he was invited to Cuba, along with other writers, where he travelled to the Sierra Maestra with Fidel Castro.\n\nIn 1973, Guyotat's play ''[[Bond en avant]]'' (\"Leap Forward\") was performed. During the 1970s Guyotat was involved in various diverse protests: for soldiers, immigrants, and prostitutes. One of those cases was of great importance for him: he personally helped Mohamed La\u00efd Moussa, a 24 years old Algerian ex-teacher who was accused and then found guilty of unintentional murder in Marseilles. One week after he came out of jail, Mohamed La\u00efd Moussa was murdered by a masked man; the event had a profound impact on Pierre Guyotat.\n\nIn 1975 his novel ''Prostitution'' came out (which incorporated ''Bond en avant'' as the final monologue). From this point on, Guyotat's novels deal with a new kind of illegibility and obscenity. The fictions still explore the unthinkable possibility of worlds structured by sexual slavery and transgression of fundamental taboos. But the French language is now unrecognizable, estranged by an extreme grammatical, syntactic and lexical creativity. Ellipses of letters or words, neologisms and phonetic transcriptions of Arabic speaking utterances make it difficult to understand. In the 1987 re-edition of ''Prostitution'', a 120 pages appendix - r\u00e9sum\u00e9, glossary, \"grammar\" and translations - is added to the actual fiction to help the disoriented reader.\n\nIn 1977, while working on ''Le Livre'' (1984) and ''Histoire de Samora Machel'' (yet unpublished), he suffered a psychiatric illness. The depression and the deterioration of his physical and mental state culminated, in December 1981, in a coma. \n \nFollowing the election of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Francois Mitterrand]], France's first socialist president, in 1981, the ban on ''Eden, Eden, Eden'' was lifted.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986, Guyotat gave a series of readings and performances of his work all over Europe.\n\nIn January 2000 he was involved in the reopening of the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] at Beaubourg, contributing a reading of the first pages of ''[[Prog\u00e9nitures]]''. The book was published shortly after, in 2000 (Gallimard), and ''[[Explications]]'' (\u00e9ditions Leo Scheer). In 2005, ''Sur un cheval'' was reedited and in April 2005 it was read on Radio France under [[Alain Ollivier]]'s direction. The ''Carnets de bord'' (vol. 1, 1962-1969) were published the same year, as well as Pierre Guyotat's first biography by Catherine Brun, ''Pierre Guyotat, essai biographique'' (\u00e9d. L\u00e9o Scheer)\n\nBetween 2005 and 2010, Pierre Guyotat wrote and published three autobiographical books: ''[[Coma]]'' (prix D\u00e9cembre 2006), ''Formation'' (2007) and ''Arri\u00e8re-fond'' (2010). In 2011, Pierre Guyotat wrote ''Independence'' about his experience of the war, published for the centenary of the [[Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise]]. The classes he gave at the University of Paris 8, between 2001 and 2004, were published in 2011 under the title ''Le\u00e7ons sur la langue fran\u00e7aise'' (\u00e9d.

He was called to [[Algeria]] in the same year. In 1962 he was found guilty of desertion and publishing forbidden material.  After three months in jail he was transferred to a disciplinary centre.  Back in Paris, he got involved in journalism, writing first for [[France Observateur]], then for [[Nouvel Observateur]].  In 1964, Guyotat published his second novel ''[[Ashby, novel|Ashby]]''.\n\nIn 1967, he published ''[[Tombeau pour cinq cent mille soldats]]'' (later released in English as ''Tomb for 500,000 Soldiers''). Based on Guyotat's ordeal as a soldier in the [[Algerian War]], the book earned a cult reputation and became the subject of various controversies, mostly because of its omnipresent sexual obsessions and homoeroticism.\n\nIn 1968, Guyotat became a member of the French Communist Party, which he left in 1971.\n\n''Eden, Eden, Eden'' came out in 1970 with a preface by [[Michel Leiris]], [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Philippe Sollers]] (Michel Foucault's text was received late and therefore didn't appear as a preface<ref>Catherine Brun, ''Pierre Guyotat. Essai biographique'', Paris: L\u00e9o Scheer, 2005, p. 220-221.</ref>). This book was banned from being publicized or sold to minors. A petition of international support was signed (notably by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Pierre Dac]], [[Jean Genet]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Joseph Kessel]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[Jacques Monod]], and [[Nathalie Sarraute]]). [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], and [[Georges Pompidou]] tried to get the ban lifted but failed. [[Claude Simon]] (who won the Nobel Prize in 1985) resigned from the jury of the [[Prix M\u00e9dicis]] after the prize wasn't awarded to ''Eden, Eden, Eden''.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1975, Pierre Guyotat travelled extensively in the Sahara. In July 1967, he was invited to Cuba, along with other writers, where he travelled to the Sierra Maestra with Fidel Castro.\n\nIn 1973, Guyotat's play ''[[Bond en avant]]'' (\"Leap Forward\") was performed. During the 1970s Guyotat was involved in various diverse protests: for soldiers, immigrants, and prostitutes. One of those cases was of great importance for him: he personally helped Mohamed La\u00efd Moussa, a 24 years old Algerian ex-teacher who was accused and then found guilty of unintentional murder in Marseilles. One week after he came out of jail, Mohamed La\u00efd Moussa was murdered by a masked man; the event had a profound impact on Pierre Guyotat.\n\nIn 1975 his novel ''Prostitution'' came out (which incorporated ''Bond en avant'' as the final monologue). From this point on, Guyotat's novels deal with a new kind of illegibility and obscenity. The fictions still explore the unthinkable possibility of worlds structured by sexual slavery and transgression of fundamental taboos. But the French language is now unrecognizable, estranged by an extreme grammatical, syntactic and lexical creativity. Ellipses of letters or words, neologisms and phonetic transcriptions of Arabic speaking utterances make it difficult to understand. In the 1987 re-edition of ''Prostitution'', a 120 pages appendix - r\u00e9sum\u00e9, glossary, \"grammar\" and translations - is added to the actual fiction to help the disoriented reader.\n\nIn 1977, while working on ''Le Livre'' (1984) and ''Histoire de Samora Machel'' (yet unpublished), he suffered a psychiatric illness. The depression and the deterioration of his physical and mental state culminated, in December 1981, in a coma. \n \nFollowing the election of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Francois Mitterrand]], France\u2019s first socialist president, in 1981, the ban on ''Eden, Eden, Eden'' was lifted.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1986, Guyotat gave a series of readings and performances of his work all over Europe.\n\nIn January 2000 he was involved in the reopening of the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] at Beaubourg, contributing a reading of the first pages of ''[[Prog\u00e9nitures]]''. The book was published shortly after, in 2000 (Gallimard), and ''[[Explications]]'' (\u00e9ditions Leo Scheer). In 2005, ''Sur un cheval'' was reedited and in April 2005 it was read on Radio France under [[Alain Ollivier]]'s direction. The ''Carnets de bord'' (vol. 1, 1962-1969) were published the same year, as well as Pierre Guyotat's first biography by Catherine Brun, ''Pierre Guyotat, essai biographique'' (\u00e9d. L\u00e9o Scheer)\n\nBetween 2005 and 2010, Pierre Guyotat wrote and published three autobiographical books: ''[[Coma]]'' (prix D\u00e9cembre 2006), ''Formation'' (2007) and ''Arri\u00e8re-fond'' (2010). In 2011, Pierre Guyotat wrote ''Independence'' about his experience of the war, published for the centenary of the [[Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise]]. The classes he gave at the University of Paris 8, between 2001 and 2004, were published in 2011 under the title ''Le\u00e7ons sur la langue fran\u00e7aise'' (\u00e9d. L\u00e9o Scheer).\n\nIn 2014 he published ''Joyeux animaux de la mis\u00e8re'' (Gallimard). An excerpt of the book was read at the Ircam by actor and director [[Stanislas Nordey]] who brought the text to the stage in 2016.

This included both [[fascist]]s (including Canadians such as [[Adrien Arcand]] who had negotiated with [[Hitler]] to obtain positions in the government of Canada once Canada was conquered), [[Montreal]] mayor [[Camillien Houde]] (for denouncing [[conscription]]) and [[trade union|union]] organizers and other people deemed to be dangerous [[Communist]]s. Such internment was made legal by the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], passed 3 September 1939. Section 21 of which read:\n\n:The Minister of Justice, if satisfied that, with a view to preventing any particular person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the safety of the State, it is necessary to do so, may, notwithstanding anything in these regulations, make an order [...] directing that he be detained by virtue of an order made under this paragraph, be deemed to be in legal custody.\n\n===Internment of Jewish refugees===\nEuropean refugees who had managed to escape the Nazis and made it to Britain, were rounded up as \"enemy aliens\" in 1940. Many were interned on the [[Isle of Man]], and 2,300 were sent to Canada, mostly Jews.

The internees were given a chance by authorities to defend themselves; according to the transcripts of the appeal tribunals, internees and state officials debated conflicting concepts of citizenship.\n\nMany German Canadians interned in [[Camp Petawawa]] were from a migration in 1876. They had arrived in a small area a year after a Polish migration landed in [[Wilno]], Ontario. Their hamlet, made up of farmers primarily, was called Germanicus, and is in the bush less than {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} from [[Eganville]], [[Ontario]]. Their farms (homesteads originally) were expropriated by the federal government for no compensation, and the men were imprisoned behind barbed wire in the [[AOAT]] camp. (The [[Foymount]] Air Force Base near [[Cormac]] and Eganville was built on this expropriated land.) Notable was that not one of these homesteaders from 1876 or their descendants had ever visited Germany again after 1876, yet they were accused of being German [[Nazi]] agents.\n\n756 German sailors, mostly captured in [[East Asia]] were sent from camps in India to Canada in June 1941 (''Camp 33).<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\nBy 19 April 1941, 61 prisoners had made a break for liberty from Canadian internment camps. The escapees included 28 German prisoners who escaped from the internment camp east of [[Port Arthur, Ontario]] in April 1941.<ref>{{cite web|title=28 Nazis escape from Canadian Prison Camp Nashua Telegraph |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OAlAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=q6QMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5764%2C1534515}}</ref>\n\n===Italian Canadian internment===\n{{main|Italian Canadian internment}}\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy joined the war on the axis side. After that, [[Italian Canadians]] were heavily scrutinized. Openly fascist organizations were deemed illegal while individuals with fascist inclinations were arrested most often without warrants. Organizations seen as openly fascist also had properties confiscated without warrants as well. A provision in the Canadian War Measures Act was immediately enacted by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie|King]]. Named the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], it allowed government authorities to take the needed measures to protect the country from internal threats and enemies. The same afternoon which Italy joined the axis powers, Italian consular and embassy officials were asked to leave as soon as physically possible. Canada, which was heavily involved in the war effort on the allies' side, saw the Italian communities as a breeding ground of likely internal threats and a haven of conceivable spy networks helping the fascist axis nations of Italy and Germany. Though many Italians were anti-fascist and no longer politically involved with their homeland, this did not stop 600-700 Italians from being sent to internment camps throughout Canada.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\">Massa, Evelyn Weinfield, Morton: WE NEEDED TO PROVE WE WERE GOOD CANADIANS: CONTRASTING PARADIGMS FOR SUSPECT MINORITIES, pp. 17\u201319 Canadian Issues Spring 2009.</ref><ref>Carbone, Stanisla\u00f2: The Street Were Not Paved with Gold: A Social History of Italians in Winnipeg, pp. 70\u201373 Manitoba History, Number 29, Spring 1995.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiancanadianww2.ca|title=Italian Canadians as Enemy Aliens: Memories of World War II|website=www.italiancanadianww2.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pier21.ca/culture-trunks/italy/history|title=History - Pier 21|website=www.pier21.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe first of these Italian prisoners were sent to Camp Petawawa situated in the Ottawa River Valley. By October 1940 the round up had already been completed. Italian Canadian Montrealer, Mario Duliani wrote, \"The City Without Women\" about his life in the internment camp Petawawa during World War II which describes a personal account of the struggles of the time. Throughout the country Italians were investigated by [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] officials who had a compiled list of Italian persons who were politically involved and deeply connected in the Italian communities. Most of the arrested individuals were from the Montreal and Toronto areas and pronounced [[enemy aliens]].<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\">[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, pp. 21\u201323 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, resentment and suspicion still lingered upon the Italian communities. Laval Fortier, commissioner for overseas immigration after the war wrote \"The Italian South Peasant is not the type we are looking for in Canada. His standard of living, his way of life, even his civilization seem so different that I doubt if he could ever become an asset to our country\".<ref>[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, p. 22 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref> Such remarks embedded a large proportion of the country that had negative views upon the Italian communities. A gallop poll released in 1946 showed 73 percent of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois were against immigration with 25 percent stating Italians were the group of people most wanted kept out. Such a stance upon the Italian people was evident even though years prior to the war had proven Italians were an asset to the Canadian economy and industry, for they accomplished critical jobs that were seen as very unappealing such as laying track across rural and dangerous landscapes and the construction of infrastructure in urban areas.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\"/>\n\n===Japanese Canadian internment and relocation centres===\n{{Main|Internment of Japanese Canadians}}\nDuring World War II, Canada interned residents of Japanese ancestry. Over 75% were Canadian nationals and they were vital in key areas of the economy, notably the fishery and also logging and berry farming. Exile took two forms: relocation centres for families and relatively well-off individuals who were a low security threat, and internment camps (often called concentration camps in contemporary accounts, but controversially so) which were for single men, the less well-off, and those deemed to be a security risk. After the war, many did not return to the Coast because of bitter feelings as to their treatment, and fears of further hostility from non-Japanese citizens; of those that returned only about 25% regained confiscated property and businesses. Most remained in other parts of Canada, notably certain parts of the [[British Columbia]] Interior and in the neighbouring province of Alberta.\n\n====Camps and relocation centres in the West Kootenay and Boundary regions====\nInternment camps, called \"relocation centres\", were at [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]], [[Kaslo, British Columbia|Kaslo]], [[Lemon Creek, British Columbia|Lemon Creek]], [[New Denver, British Columbia|New Denver]], [[Rosebery, British Columbia|Rosebery]], [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]], [[Slocan City, British Columbia|Slocan City]], and [[Tashme, British Columbia|Tashme]]. Some were nearly-empty [[ghost towns]] when the internment began, others, like Kaslo and Greenwood, while less populous than in their boom years, were substantial communities.\n\n====Self-supporting centres in the Lillooet-Fraser Canyon region====\nA different kind of camp, known as a self-supporting centre, was found in other regions. [[Shalalth|Bridge River]], [[Minto City]], [[McGillivray, British Columbia|McGillivray Falls]], [[Lillooet, British Columbia|East Lillooet]], Taylor Lake were in the [[Lillooet Country]] or nearby<!--Taylor Lake I'm not sure where it was, up by Green Lake/70 Mile maybe-->. Other than Taylor Lake, these were all called \"Self-supporting centres\", not internment camps. The first three listed were all in a mountainous area so physically isolated that fences and guards were not required as the only egress from that region was by rail or water. McGillivray Falls and [[Tashme]], on the [[Crowsnest Highway]] east of [[Hope, British Columbia]], were just over the minimum 100 miles from the Coast required by the deportation order, though Tashme had direct road access over that distance, unlike McGillivray. Because of the isolation of the country immediately coast-wards from McGillivray, men from that camp were hired to work at a sawmill in what has since been named [[Devine, British Columbia|Devine]], after the mill's owner, which is within the 100-mile quarantine zone. Many of those in the East Lillooet camp were hired to work in town, or on farms nearby, particularly at [[Fountain, British Columbia|Fountain]], while those at Minto and Minto Mine and those at Bridge River worked for the railway or the hydro company.<ref>[''My Sixty Years in Canada'', Masajiro Miyazaki, self publ.]</ref><ref>''Short Portage to Lillooet'', Irene Edwards, self-publ.

Split]]\n\n==Cuba==\n{{Main|Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed}}\nAfter [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez Campos|Marshal Campos]] had failed to pacify the [[Spanish\u2013American War#Cuban struggle for independence|Cuban rebellion]], the Conservative government of [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] sent out [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed|Valeriano Weyler]]. This selection met the approval of most Spaniards, who thought him the proper man to crush the rebellion. While serving as a Spanish general, he was called \"Butcher Weyler\" because hundreds of thousands of people died in his [[concentration camp]]s.\n\nHe was made [[governor]] of Cuba with full powers to suppress the insurgency (rebellion was widespread in Cuba) and restore the island to political order and its sugar production to greater profitability. Initially, Weyler was greatly frustrated by the same factors that had made victory difficult for all generals of traditional standing armies fighting against an insurgency. While the Spanish troops marched in regulation and required substantial supplies, their opponents practiced hit-and-run tactics and lived off the land, blending in with the non-combatant population. He came to the same conclusions as his predecessors as well\u2014that to win Cuba back for Spain, he would have to separate the rebels from the civilians by putting the latter in safe havens, protected by loyal Spanish troops. By the end of 1897, General Weyler had relocated more than 300,000 into such \"reconcentration camps.\" Weyler learned this tactic from the [[American Civil War]] campaign of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] while assigned to the post of military attach\u00e9 in the Spanish Embassy in Washington D.C.. However, many mistakenly believe him to be to the origin of such tactics after it was later used by the British in the [[Second Boer War]] and later evolved into a designation to describe the [[concentration camps]] of the 20th century regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Although he was successful moving vast numbers of people, he failed to provide for them adequately. Consequently, these areas became cesspools of hunger and disease, where many hundreds of thousands died.\n\nWeyler's \"reconcentration\" policy had another important effect. Although it made Weyler's military objectives easier to accomplish, it had devastating political consequences. Although the Spanish Conservative government supported Weyler's tactics wholeheartedly, the Liberals denounced them vigorously for their toll on the Cuban civilian population. In the propaganda war waged in the United States, Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s made much of Weyler's inhumanity to their countrymen and won the sympathy of broad groups of the U.S. population to their cause. He was nicknamed \"the Butcher\" Weyler by journalists like [[William Randolph Hearst]].\n\nWeyler's strategy also backfired militarily due to the rebellion in the [[Philippines]] that required the redeployment by 1897 of some troops already in Cuba. When Prime Minister [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] was assassinated in June, Weyler lost his principal supporter in Spain. He resigned his post in late 1897 and returned to Europe. He was replaced in Cuba by the more conciliatory [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco y Erenas]].\n\n{{Main|Military Units to Aid Production}}\n{{See also|Human rights in Cuba}}\n[[Military Units to Aid Production]] were [[forced labor]] [[concentration camp]]s established by [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Communism|communist]] government, from November 1965 to July 1968.\n\nThey were a way to eliminate alleged \"[[bourgeois]]\" and \"[[counter-revolutionary]]\" values in the Cuban population. First, people were thrown into overcrowded cells at police stations and later taken to secret police facilities, cinemas, stadia, warehouses, and similar locations.

Once the White terror subsided, a few thousand including mainly small children and women, were set free, leaving 74,000\u201376,000 prisoners. The largest [[List of concentration and internment camps#Finland|prison camps]] were [[Suomenlinna]], an island facing Helsinki, [[H\u00e4meenlinna]], [[Lahti]], [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]], [[Riihim\u00e4ki]] and [[Tampere]]. The Senate made the decision to keep these prisoners detained until each person's guilt could be examined. A law for a ''Tribunal of Treason'' was enacted on 29 May after a long dispute between the White army and the Senate of the proper trial method to adopt. The start of the heavy and slow process of trials was delayed further until 18 June 1918. The Tribunal did not meet all the standards of neutral justice, due to the mental atmosphere of White Finland after the war. Approximately 70,000 Reds were convicted, mainly for complicity to treason. Most of the sentences were lenient, however, and many got out on parole. 555 persons were sentenced to death, of whom 113 were executed. The trials revealed also that some innocent persons had been imprisoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Kekkonen|1991}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|1992|pp=140, 142}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil\u00e4|Nevakivi|1999|p=112}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=161\u201378}}, Uta.fi/Suomi80/Yhteiskunta/Valtiorikosoikeudet</ref>\n\nCombined with the severe food shortage, the mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by a mentality of punishment, anger and indifference on the part of the victors. Many prisoners felt that they were abandoned also by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The condition of the prisoners had weakened rapidly during May, after food supplies had been disrupted during the Red Guards' retreat in April, and a high number of prisoners had been captured already during the first half of April in Tampere and Helsinki. As a consequence, 2,900 starved to death or died in June as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition and [[Spanish flu]], 5,000 in July, 2,200 in August, and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]] camp at 34%, while in the others the rate varied between 5% and 20%. In total, between 11,000 and 13,500 Finns perished.

This camp became the model for all later [[Nazi concentration camps]]. It was quickly followed by [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen]] which became a facility for the training of [[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde|SS-Death's Head]] officers in the operation of concentration camps.\n\n[[Theodor Eicke]], commandant of the Dachau camp, was appointed Inspector of Concentration Camps by [[Heinrich Himmler]] on 4 July 1934. By 1934 there were eight major institutions. This started the second phase of development. All smaller detention camps were consolidated into six major camps: Dachau, Sachsenhausen, [[Buchenwald]], [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp|Flossenburg]], and after the [[Anschluss|annexation]] of Austria in 1938, [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]; finally in 1939 [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] (for women). The pajama type blue-striped uniforms were introduced for inmates as well as the practice of tattooing the prisoner's number on his fore-arm. Eicke started the practice of farming out prisoners as slave-labor in German industry, with sub-camps or ''[[Arbeitskommando]]s'' to house them. The use of common criminals as [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]], to brutalize and assist in the handling of prisoners, was instituted at this time. In November 1938 the massive arrests of German Jews started, with most of them being immediately sent to the concentration camps, where they were separated from other prisoners and subjected to even harsher treatment.\n\nThe third phase started after the occupation of Poland in 1939. In the first few months Polish intellectuals were detained, including nearly the entire staff of [[Cracow University]] arrested in November 1939.<ref>{{cite book | title= History of Poland | isbn= 0-88029-858-8 | first= Oscar | last= Halecki | page= [https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 313] | date= June 1992 | url-access= registration | url= https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 }}</ref> [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-I]] and [[Stutthof concentration camp]] were built to house them and other political prisoners. Large numbers were executed or died from the brutal treatment and disease. After the occupation of Belgium, France and Netherlands in 1940, [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], [[Gross Rosen]] and [[Fort Breendonk]], in addition to a number of smaller camps, were set up to house intellectuals and political prisoners from those countries who had not already been executed.<ref>''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 957.</ref> Many of these intellectuals were held first in [[Gestapo]] prisons, and those who were not executed immediately after interrogation were sent on to the concentration camps.\n\nInitially, Jews in the occupied countries were interned either in other KZ, but predominantly in [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|Ghettos]] that were walled off parts of cities. All the Jews in western Poland (annexed into the Reich) were transported to ghettos in the [[General Government]]. Jews were used for labour in industries, but usually transported to work then returned to the KZ or the ghetto at night. Although these ghettoes were not intended to be extermination camps, and there was no official policy to kill people, thousands died due to hunger, disease and extreme conditions. During the German advance into Russia in 1941 and 1942 Jewish soldiers and civilians were systematically executed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' of the S.S. that followed the front-line troops. At the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942 the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was decreed to exterminate all of the remaining Jews in Europe, [[Heydrich]] stated that there were still 11 million to be eliminated.<ref>\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" pp. 959\u201365</ref> To accomplish this special ''Vernichtungslager'' ('''extermination camps''') were organized. The first was [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp|Che\u0142mno]] in which 152,000, mainly from the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] ghetto, were killed. The method for carrying out mass murder was tested and perfected here. During 1942 and 1943 further camps [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau II]], part of [[Majdanek]], [[Treblinka]], [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp|Be\u0142\u017cec]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] were built for this purpose. Jews from other concentration camps, and from the ghettos, were transported to them from all over occupied Europe. In these six camps alone, an estimated 3.1 million Jews were killed in gas chambers and the bodies burned in massive crematoria. The Nazis realized that this was a criminal act {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the action was shrouded in secrecy. The extermination camps were destroyed in 1944 and early 1945 and buried. However the Soviet armies overran Auschwitz and Majdanek before the evidence could be totally destroyed.\n[[File:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] views the bodies of prisoners at a liberated [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in April 1945]]\n\nAnother category of internment camp in Nazi Germany was the '''[[Labor camp]]''' (''[[Arbeitslager]]''). They housed civilians from the occupied countries that were being used to work in industry, on the farms, in quarries, in mines and on the railroads. Approximately 12,000,000 forced laborers, most of whom were [[Eastern Europe]]ans, were enslaved in the German war economy inside the [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html|title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |date= 27 October 2005|website=DW.COM|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 }}</ref> The workers were mostly young and taken from the occupied countries, predominantly eastern Europe, but also many French and Italian. They were sometimes taken willingly, more frequently as a result of ''[[lapanka]]'' in Polish, or ''rafle'' in French language, in which people were collected on the street or in their home by police drives. However, for often very minor infractions of the rules, workers were imprisoned in special ''Arbeitserziehungslager'', [[German language|German]] for '''worker re-education camp''' (abbreviated to AEL and sometimes referred to as ''Straflager'').<ref>de:Arbeiterserziehungslager</ref> These punishment camps were operated by the [[Gestapo]] and many of the inmates were executed or died from the brutal treatment.\n\nFinally there was one category of internment camp, called [[Ilag]] in which Allied (mainly British and American) civilians were held. These civilians had been caught behind front lines by the rapid advance of the German armies, or the sudden entry of the United States into the war. In these camps the Germans abided by the rules of the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. Deaths resulted from sickness or simply old age.\n\nAfter World War II, internment camps were used by the Allied occupying forces to hold suspected Nazis, usually using the facilities of previous Nazi camps. They were all closed down by 1949. In [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] the communist government used prison camps to hold political prisoners, opponents of the communist regime or suspected Nazi collaborators.\n* [[Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre]]\n\n{{See also|Nazi concentration camp badges|List of concentration camps of Nazi Germany|List of concentration camps for Poles|Extermination of Soviet prisoners of war by Nazi Germany|Ilag}}\n\n==Hong Kong==\nDuring the Second World War the Japanese, during their occupation of Hong Kong, interned enemy nationals (mostly British, Canadian, American and Dutch), in several internment camps in Hong Kong. Camps existed at:\n\n* [[Sham Shui Po]] \u2013 A concentration camp was maintained here for most of the duration of the Second World War.\n* Stanley Internment Camp \u2013 Located primarily on the grounds of [[St. Stephen's College, Hong Kong|St. Stephen's College]]. Shortly after surrendering, the Imperial Japanese Army broke into the St. Stephen's (which had served as a military hospital during the battle) and murdered the wounded soldiers of the Allied forces. The Japanese later merged the College with part of Stanley Prison to form the full Stanley Internment Camp.\n* Stanley Prison \u2013 Located primarily in the Officer's housing blocks at the prison. During the Japanese occupation, the grounds of the prison were used as part of Stanley Internment Camp. Nearly 600 prisoners of war and civilians, killed by the Japanese during the occupation, are buried in the nearby Stanley War Cemetery (which is NOT part of the prison itself but adjacent to it).\n\n== India, British ==\nDuring both World Wars the British interned enemy nationals (mostly Germans).

By March 1942 many civilians, particularly westerners in the region's European colonies, found themselves behind enemy lines and were subsequently interned by the Japanese.\n\nThe nature of civilian internment varied from region to region. Some civilians were interned soon after invasion; in other areas the process occurred over many months. In total, approximately 130,000 Allied civilians were interned by the Japanese during this period of occupation. The exact number of internees will never be known as records were often lost, destroyed, or simply not kept.\n[[File:73-Japanse kampen in Nederlands-Indi\u00eb.jpg|thumb|Liberated Dutch prisoners in Indonesia (Dutch East Indies) in 1945]]\nThe backgrounds of the internees were diverse. There was a large proportion of Dutch from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but they also included Americans, British, and Australians. They included missionaries and their families, colonial administrators, and business people. Many had been living in the colonies for decades. Single women had often been nuns, missionaries, doctors, teachers and nurses.\n\nCivilians interned by the Japanese were treated marginally better than the prisoners of war, but their death rates were the same. Although they had to work to run their own camps, few were made to labour on construction projects. The Japanese devised no consistent policies or guidelines to regulate the treatment of the civilians. Camp conditions and the treatment of internees varied from camp to camp. The general experience, however, was one of malnutrition, disease, and varying degrees of harsh discipline and brutality from the Japanese guards. Some [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women were forced into [[sexual slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324104443/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |archivedate=24 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/abe-ignores-evidence-say-australias-comfort-women/2007/03/02/1172338881441.html|title=Abe ignores evidence, say Australia's 'comfort women' |website=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe camps varied in size from four people held at Pangkalpinang in Sumatra to the 14,000 held in [[Tjihapit]] in Java. Some were segregated according to gender or race, there were also many camps of mixed gender. Some internees were held at the same camp for the duration of the war, and others were moved about. The buildings used to house internees were generally whatever was available, including schools, warehouses, universities, hospitals, and prisons.\n[[File:Jean-marie-and-private-tanner.jpg|thumb|left|Jean-Marie Faggiano receives a doll from [[Private First Class]] Theo Tanner of the U.S. First Cavalry. Tanner had just removed the doll from a dead Japanese soldier, killed during the liberation of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila, Philippines in February 1945]]\n\nOrganisation of the internment camps varied by location. The Japanese administered some camps directly; others were administered by local authorities under Japanese control. Korean POWs of the Japanese were also used as camp guards. Some of the camps were left for the internees to self-govern. In the mixed and male camps, management often fell to the men who were experienced in administration before their internment. In the women's camps the leaders tended to be the women who had held a profession prior to internment. Boys over the age of ten were generally considered to be men by the Japanese and were often separated from their mothers to live and work in male camps.\n\nOne of the most famous concentration camps operated by the Japanese during World War II was at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila]], the Philippines, the [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]]. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] university was expropriated by the Japanese at the beginning of the occupation, and was used to house mostly American civilians, but also British subjects, for the duration of the war. There, men, women and children suffered from malnutrition and poor sanitation. The camp was liberated in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of the camps was not a uniform process. Many camps were liberated as the forces were recapturing territory. For other internees, freedom occurred many months after the surrender of the Japanese, and in the Dutch East Indies, liberated internees faced the uncertainty of the [[Indonesian War of Independence]].\n\nCivilian internees were generally disregarded in official histories, and few received formal recognition. Ironically, however, civilian internees have become the subject of several influential books and films. [[Agnes Newton Keith]]'s account of internment on [[Berhala Island, Sabah|Berhala Island]] in [[Sandakan|Sandakan Harbour]] and [[Batu Lintang camp]], Kuching, ''[[Three Came Home]]'' (1947), was one of the first of the memoirs. More recent publications include Jeanne Tuttle and Jolanthe Zelling's \"Mammie's Journal of My Childhood\" (2005); (Shirley Fenton-Huie's ''The Forgotten Ones'' (1992) and Jan Ruff O'Herne's ''Fifty Years of Silence'' (1997). Nevil Shute's novel ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'' was filmed in 1956, and J. G. Ballard's ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' in 1987. Other films and television dramas have included ''[[Tenko (TV series)|Tenko]]'' and ''[[Paradise Road (1997 film)|Paradise Road]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/Encyclopedia/pow/ww2/civilian_internees.htm |title=Prisoners of the Japanese: Civilian internees, Pacific and South-East Asia &#124; Australian War Memorial |publisher=Awm.gov.au |date= |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://166.122.164.43/archive/2004/june/06-22-17.htm |title=Guam Survivor Recalls WWII Forced |date=22 June 2004 |publisher=166.122.164.43 |accessdate=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707160612/http://166.122.164.43/archive/2004/june/06-22-17.htm |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.kuam.com/news/10206.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223804/http://www.kuam.com/news/10206.aspx|date=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Korea, Republic of==\nDuring the 1980s, [[South Korea]] had multiple internment camps, including the [[Brothers Home]], which housed thousands of prisoners in [[Busan]].<ref name=\"THK\">{{cite news|last1=Tong-Hyung|first1=Kim|last2=Klug|first2=Foster|title=AP: S.

From 1922 to 1928, Italian forces under General [[Pietro Badoglio]] waged a punitive pacification campaign. Badoglio's successor in the field, Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]] (known as 'The Butcher of Fezzan'), accepted the commission from Mussolini on the condition that he be allowed to crush the Libyan resistance unencumbered by the restraints of either Italian or international law. Reportedly, Mussolini immediately agreed and Graziani intensified the [[oppression]]. The Libyans continued to defend themselves, with the strongest voices of dissent coming from the Cyrenaica. [[Omar Mukhtar]], a [[Senussi]] sheikh, became the leader of the uprising.\n\nSoon afterwards, the colonial administration began the wholesale deportation of the people of Cyrenaica to deny the rebels the support of the local population. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in concentration camps in Suluq- ALa byer and [[El Agheila|Al Agheila]] where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions. It is estimated (by Arab historians) that the number of Libyans who died \u2013 killed either through combat or mainly through starvation, execution and disease \u2013 is at a minimum of 80,000 or even up to one third of the Cyrenaican population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&pg=PA309|title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing|last=Mann|first=Michael|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521538541|location=|page=309|language=}}</ref>\n\n==Montenegro==\n\nThe fort on the island of [[Mamula (island)|Mamula]] was converted into a [[concentration camp]] by the [[Italian fascism|fascist]] forces of [[Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini's]] [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nDuring the 1991 to 1995 [[Croatian War of Independence]], the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] organized the [[Morinj camp]] near [[Kotor]], [[Montenegro]].\n\n==Netherlands==\nDuring WWI, all foreign soldiers and ship crews that illegally entered the neutral Netherlands were interned in a specific camp based on their nationality (to avoid conflict). By far the largest camp was the one for British sailors and soldiers in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Unlike the [[Prisoners of War|PoWs]] at the time in the neighbouring countries, Dutch prisoners had plenty of food, and tradesmen often came to the camp with a wide range of goods. The interned were paid a certain amount of compensation money by the Dutch authorities on top of any British aid that got channeled to them through the Dutch government. One prisoner later commented: \"... we were quite well off, and the local people were very good to us.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwar.nl/index.html|title=British sailors in Groningen camp|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a revolt in 1926 in the [[Dutch East Indies]], a concentration camp for political prisoners was set up in what then was called [[Netherlands New Guinea]], in the very remote jungle at [[Boven-Digoel]] (Upper-Digul).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr L. de Jong, ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'' ('' The Kingdom of the Netherlands during WWII''), Amsterdam, RIOD, 1966</ref>\n\nJust before World War II engulfed the Netherlands, a camp was built in 1939 at [[Westerbork (village)|Westerbork]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government for interning Jewish refugees who had fled [[Nazi Germany]]. During the German occupation [[Westerbork transit camp|this camp]] was used as a transit camp for Dutch Jews eventually deported to [[extermination camp]]s in the East. [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] (1941\u20131945) (in German: ''Polizeiliches Durchgangslager'') was also a transit camp. The [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]] camp (1943\u20131944, known as ''[[Kamp Vught]]'' because of its location in that town) was a concentration camp, the only one in Western Europe outside Germany set up as well as run by the [[SS]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOther camps were [[Kamp Schoorl|camp Schoorl]] near Schoorl and [[Kamp Erika|camp Erika]] near Ommen. Before the [[Shoah]] began, some two dozen labor camps for Jewish men were operated fulfilling an order of the German occupiers. In the Dutch East Indies, after the occupation of the Netherlands by the Germans in Europe started on 15 May 1940, Germans living in the Indies were rounded up and interned there. Almost all camps also had field offices for forced labor. In the case of Vught as well as Amersfoort work details for [[Philips]] factories existed, often under relatively favourable circumstances. Also, the huge construction activities for the 30 German airfields in the Netherlands relied partly upon labour from camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter the war, the Dutch government launched the [[Operation Black Tulip]] and started to gather civil population of German background to concentration camps near the German border, especially [[Nijmegen]], in order to deport them from the country. In total around 15% of the German population in the Netherlands was deported.\n\nNumerous improvised and official camps were set up after the war, to keep Dutch who were suspected of collaboration with the Germans. Kamp Westerbork at one point housed some Jews as well as suspected collaborators and Germans. In these camps, a history of maltreatment by the guards, sometimes leading to death, has been collected.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==New Zealand==\nIn World War I German civilians living in New Zealand were interned in camps on [[Motuihe Island|Motuihe]] and [[Somes Island|Somes]] Islands.

Additional camps were later established in the late 1950s and 60s in order to incarcerate the political victims of power struggles along with their families as well as overseas Koreans who migrated to the North. Later, the number of camps saw a marked increase with the cementing of the [[Kim Il Sung]] dictatorship and the [[Kim Jong-il]] succession.

Known as [[New Village]]s, these camps were intended to become permanent settlements. As attacks by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] declined, the curfews were lifted, fences removed, and the camps gradually ceased to be internment camps. To this day many villages founded in this way are known as New Villages and remain ethnically Chinese.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\n{{Main|Operation Demetrius}}\nOne of the most famous example of modern ''internment'' (and one which made world headlines) occurred in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1971, when hundreds of [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] and [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republicans]] were arrested by the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] on the orders of then [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Brian Faulkner]], with the backing of the [[British government]]. Historians generally view that period of internment as inflaming [[sectarian]] tensions in Northern Ireland while failing in its stated aim of arresting members of the paramilitary [[Provisional IRA]]. Many of the people arrested were completely unconnected with the Provisional IRA but, through bungling and incompetence, had their names appear on the list of those to be interned,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} while over 100 IRA men escaped arrest. The backlash against internment and its bungled application contributed to the decision of the British government under Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] to suspend the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Stormont governmental]] system in Northern Ireland and replace it with ''[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct rule]]'' from London, under the authority of a British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].\n\nFrom 1971 internment began, beginning with the arrest of 342 suspected republican guerrillas and paramilitary members on 9 August. They were held at [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|HM Prison]] [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze]] then called [[Long Kesh Detention Centre]]. By 1972, 924 men were interned. Serious rioting ensued, and 23 people died in three days. The [[British government]] attempted to show some balance by arresting some [[loyalist]] paramilitaries later, but out of the 1,981 men interned,<ref name=\"joint2005p110\" /> only 107 were loyalists. Internment was ended in 1975, but had resulted in increased support for the IRA and created political tensions which culminated in the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]] and the death of [[Bobby Sands]], member of British Parliament ([[Anti H-Block|Anti H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner]] Party.)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/events/hunger_strike.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Hunger Strike |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/rwby1981a.htm |title=CAIN: Politics: Elections: Westminster By-election (NI) Thursday 9 April 1981 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=9 April 1981 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> His death resulted in a new surge of IRA recruitment and activity.

However non-jury [[Diplock court]]s tried paramilitary-related trials, to prevent [[Perverting the course of justice|jury intimidation]].\n\nMany of those interned were held in a detention facility located at [[RAF Long Kesh]] military base, later known as [[RAF Long Kesh|Long Kesh Detention Centre]] and eventually becoming [[HM Prison Maze|Her Majesty's Prison Maze]], outside [[Belfast]]. Internment had previously been used as a means of repressing the [[Irish Republican Army]]. It was used between 1939\u20131945 and 1956\u20131962.

Locations as identified by the historian Simon Webb include [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothesay]] on the [[Isle of Bute]], and [[Tighnabruaich]] on the Scottish mainland. Rothesay was used to house the political enemies of the leader of the Polish Government in Exile, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], as well as Poles considered by Sikorski's Government in Exile of being morally dubious. [[Tighnabruaich]] held criminals under the jurisdiction of the Polish Government in Exile. Webb claims the Poles were later allowed to open further camps at [[Kingledoors]], [[Auchterarder]] and [[Inverkeithing]] near [[Edinburgh]]. Although deaths, and claims of torture and privations were made by numerous British [[Members of Parliament]] against the internment camps, the camps treated as sovereign Polish territory and local Scottish police forces were unable to investigate what happened in them. Webb also suggests that being [[Jewish]] or a suspected [[Communist]] was often enough to lead to Polish citizens under the jurisdiction of the Polish Government in Exile being sent to one of the internment camps.<ref>Simon Webb, ''British Concentration Camps: A Brief History from 1900 - 1975'' (London: Pen & Sword Books, 2016), chapter 5</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\n[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|[[Lizzie van Zyl]], shortly before her death in [[Bloemfontein]] Concentration Camp]]\nThe term '''concentration camp''' was first used by the British military during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899\u20131902).

Called \"emigration depots\", the three main ones were located at Ross's Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]), [[Fort Payne, Alabama]], and [[Fort Cass]] ([[Charleston, Tennessee]]).

Such internment was made legal by the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], passed 3 September 1939. Section 21 of which read:\n\n:The Minister of Justice, if satisfied that, with a view to preventing any particular person from acting in a manner prejudicial to the public safety or the safety of the State, it is necessary to do so, may, notwithstanding anything in these regulations, make an order [...] directing that he be detained by virtue of an order made under this paragraph, be deemed to be in legal custody.\n\n===Internment of Jewish refugees===\nEuropean refugees who had managed to escape the Nazis and made it to Britain, were rounded up as \"enemy aliens\" in 1940.

The internees were given a chance by authorities to defend themselves; according to the transcripts of the appeal tribunals, internees and state officials debated conflicting concepts of citizenship.\n\nMany German Canadians interned in [[Camp Petawawa]] were from a migration in 1876. They had arrived in a small area a year after a Polish migration landed in [[Wilno]], Ontario. Their hamlet, made up of farmers primarily, was called Germanicus, and is in the bush less than {{Convert|10|mi|km|abbr=}} from [[Eganville]], [[Ontario]]. Their farms (homesteads originally) were expropriated by the federal government for no compensation, and the men were imprisoned behind barbed wire in the [[AOAT]] camp. (The [[Foymount]] Air Force Base near [[Cormac]] and Eganville was built on this expropriated land.) Notable was that not one of these homesteaders from 1876 or their descendants had ever visited Germany again after 1876, yet they were accused of being German [[Nazi]] agents.\n\n756 German sailors, mostly captured in [[East Asia]] were sent from camps in India to Canada in June 1941 (''Camp 33).<ref name=\"AA\" />\n\nBy 19 April 1941, 61 prisoners had made a break for liberty from Canadian internment camps.

After that, [[Italian Canadians]] were heavily scrutinized. Openly fascist organizations were deemed illegal while individuals with fascist inclinations were arrested most often without warrants. Organizations seen as openly fascist also had properties confiscated without warrants as well. A provision in the Canadian War Measures Act was immediately enacted by Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie|King]]. Named the [[Defence of Canada Regulations]], it allowed government authorities to take the needed measures to protect the country from internal threats and enemies. The same afternoon which Italy joined the axis powers, Italian consular and embassy officials were asked to leave as soon as physically possible. Canada, which was heavily involved in the war effort on the allies' side, saw the Italian communities as a breeding ground of likely internal threats and a haven of conceivable spy networks helping the fascist axis nations of Italy and Germany. Though many Italians were anti-fascist and no longer politically involved with their homeland, this did not stop 600-700 Italians from being sent to internment camps throughout Canada.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\">Massa, Evelyn Weinfield, Morton: WE NEEDED TO PROVE WE WERE GOOD CANADIANS: CONTRASTING PARADIGMS FOR SUSPECT MINORITIES, pp. 17\u201319 Canadian Issues Spring 2009.</ref><ref>Carbone, Stanisla\u00f2: The Street Were Not Paved with Gold: A Social History of Italians in Winnipeg, pp. 70\u201373 Manitoba History, Number 29, Spring 1995.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiancanadianww2.ca|title=Italian Canadians as Enemy Aliens: Memories of World War II|website=www.italiancanadianww2.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pier21.ca/culture-trunks/italy/history|title=History - Pier 21|website=www.pier21.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe first of these Italian prisoners were sent to Camp Petawawa situated in the Ottawa River Valley. By October 1940 the round up had already been completed. Italian Canadian Montrealer, Mario Duliani wrote, \"The City Without Women\" about his life in the internment camp Petawawa during World War II which describes a personal account of the struggles of the time. Throughout the country Italians were investigated by [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] officials who had a compiled list of Italian persons who were politically involved and deeply connected in the Italian communities. Most of the arrested individuals were from the Montreal and Toronto areas and pronounced [[enemy aliens]].<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\">[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, pp. 21\u201323 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the war, resentment and suspicion still lingered upon the Italian communities. Laval Fortier, commissioner for overseas immigration after the war wrote \"The Italian South Peasant is not the type we are looking for in Canada. His standard of living, his way of life, even his civilization seem so different that I doubt if he could ever become an asset to our country\".<ref>[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]]: Such Hardworking People, p. 22 McGill-Queen's University Press.</ref> Such remarks embedded a large proportion of the country that had negative views upon the Italian communities. A gallop poll released in 1946 showed 73 percent of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois were against immigration with 25 percent stating Italians were the group of people most wanted kept out. Such a stance upon the Italian people was evident even though years prior to the war had proven Italians were an asset to the Canadian economy and industry, for they accomplished critical jobs that were seen as very unappealing such as laying track across rural and dangerous landscapes and the construction of infrastructure in urban areas.<ref name=\"Massa, Evelyn Weinfield Pg 17-19\"/><ref name=\"[[Franca Iacovetta|Iacovetta, Franca]] Pg 21-22\"/>\n\n===Japanese Canadian internment and relocation centres===\n{{Main|Internment of Japanese Canadians}}\nDuring World War II, Canada interned residents of Japanese ancestry. Over 75% were Canadian nationals and they were vital in key areas of the economy, notably the fishery and also logging and berry farming. Exile took two forms: relocation centres for families and relatively well-off individuals who were a low security threat, and internment camps (often called concentration camps in contemporary accounts, but controversially so) which were for single men, the less well-off, and those deemed to be a security risk. After the war, many did not return to the Coast because of bitter feelings as to their treatment, and fears of further hostility from non-Japanese citizens; of those that returned only about 25% regained confiscated property and businesses. Most remained in other parts of Canada, notably certain parts of the [[British Columbia]] Interior and in the neighbouring province of Alberta.\n\n====Camps and relocation centres in the West Kootenay and Boundary regions====\nInternment camps, called \"relocation centres\", were at [[Greenwood, British Columbia|Greenwood]], [[Kaslo, British Columbia|Kaslo]], [[Lemon Creek, British Columbia|Lemon Creek]], [[New Denver, British Columbia|New Denver]], [[Rosebery, British Columbia|Rosebery]], [[Sandon, British Columbia|Sandon]], [[Slocan City, British Columbia|Slocan City]], and [[Tashme, British Columbia|Tashme]]. Some were nearly-empty [[ghost towns]] when the internment began, others, like Kaslo and Greenwood, while less populous than in their boom years, were substantial communities.\n\n====Self-supporting centres in the Lillooet-Fraser Canyon region====\nA different kind of camp, known as a self-supporting centre, was found in other regions. [[Shalalth|Bridge River]], [[Minto City]], [[McGillivray, British Columbia|McGillivray Falls]], [[Lillooet, British Columbia|East Lillooet]], Taylor Lake were in the [[Lillooet Country]] or nearby<!--Taylor Lake I'm not sure where it was, up by Green Lake/70 Mile maybe-->. Other than Taylor Lake, these were all called \"Self-supporting centres\", not internment camps. The first three listed were all in a mountainous area so physically isolated that fences and guards were not required as the only egress from that region was by rail or water. McGillivray Falls and [[Tashme]], on the [[Crowsnest Highway]] east of [[Hope, British Columbia]], were just over the minimum 100 miles from the Coast required by the deportation order, though Tashme had direct road access over that distance, unlike McGillivray. Because of the isolation of the country immediately coast-wards from McGillivray, men from that camp were hired to work at a sawmill in what has since been named [[Devine, British Columbia|Devine]], after the mill's owner, which is within the 100-mile quarantine zone. Many of those in the East Lillooet camp were hired to work in town, or on farms nearby, particularly at [[Fountain, British Columbia|Fountain]], while those at Minto and Minto Mine and those at Bridge River worked for the railway or the hydro company.<ref>[''My Sixty Years in Canada'', Masajiro Miyazaki, self publ.]</ref><ref>''Short Portage to Lillooet'', Irene Edwards, self-publ.

Split]]\n\n==Cuba==\n{{Main|Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed}}\nAfter [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez Campos|Marshal Campos]] had failed to pacify the [[Spanish\u2013American War#Cuban struggle for independence|Cuban rebellion]], the Conservative government of [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] sent out [[Valeriano Weyler, 1st Duke of Rub\u00ed|Valeriano Weyler]]. This selection met the approval of most Spaniards, who thought him the proper man to crush the rebellion. While serving as a Spanish general, he was called \"Butcher Weyler\" because hundreds of thousands of people died in his [[concentration camp]]s.\n\nHe was made [[governor]] of Cuba with full powers to suppress the insurgency (rebellion was widespread in Cuba) and restore the island to political order and its sugar production to greater profitability. Initially, Weyler was greatly frustrated by the same factors that had made victory difficult for all generals of traditional standing armies fighting against an insurgency. While the Spanish troops marched in regulation and required substantial supplies, their opponents practiced hit-and-run tactics and lived off the land, blending in with the non-combatant population. He came to the same conclusions as his predecessors as well\u2014that to win Cuba back for Spain, he would have to separate the rebels from the civilians by putting the latter in safe havens, protected by loyal Spanish troops. By the end of 1897, General Weyler had relocated more than 300,000 into such \"reconcentration camps.\" Weyler learned this tactic from the [[American Civil War]] campaign of [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]] while assigned to the post of military attach\u00e9 in the Spanish Embassy in Washington D.C.. However, many mistakenly believe him to be to the origin of such tactics after it was later used by the British in the [[Second Boer War]] and later evolved into a designation to describe the [[concentration camps]] of the 20th century regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Although he was successful moving vast numbers of people, he failed to provide for them adequately. Consequently, these areas became cesspools of hunger and disease, where many hundreds of thousands died.\n\nWeyler's \"reconcentration\" policy had another important effect. Although it made Weyler's military objectives easier to accomplish, it had devastating political consequences. Although the Spanish Conservative government supported Weyler's tactics wholeheartedly, the Liberals denounced them vigorously for their toll on the Cuban civilian population. In the propaganda war waged in the United States, Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s made much of Weyler's inhumanity to their countrymen and won the sympathy of broad groups of the U.S. population to their cause. He was nicknamed \"the Butcher\" Weyler by journalists like [[William Randolph Hearst]].\n\nWeyler's strategy also backfired militarily due to the rebellion in the [[Philippines]] that required the redeployment by 1897 of some troops already in Cuba. When Prime Minister [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] was assassinated in June, Weyler lost his principal supporter in Spain. He resigned his post in late 1897 and returned to Europe. He was replaced in Cuba by the more conciliatory [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco y Erenas]].\n\n{{Main|Military Units to Aid Production}}\n{{See also|Human rights in Cuba}}\n[[Military Units to Aid Production]] were [[forced labor]] [[concentration camp]]s established by [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[Communism|communist]] government, from November 1965 to July 1968.\n\nThey were a way to eliminate alleged \"[[bourgeois]]\" and \"[[counter-revolutionary]]\" values in the Cuban population. First, people were thrown into overcrowded cells at police stations and later taken to secret police facilities, cinemas, stadia, warehouses, and similar locations.

Once the White terror subsided, a few thousand including mainly small children and women, were set free, leaving 74,000\u201376,000 prisoners. The largest [[List of concentration and internment camps#Finland|prison camps]] were [[Suomenlinna]], an island facing Helsinki, [[H\u00e4meenlinna]], [[Lahti]], [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]], [[Riihim\u00e4ki]] and [[Tampere]]. The Senate made the decision to keep these prisoners detained until each person's guilt could be examined. A law for a ''Tribunal of Treason'' was enacted on 29 May after a long dispute between the White army and the Senate of the proper trial method to adopt. The start of the heavy and slow process of trials was delayed further until 18 June 1918. The Tribunal did not meet all the standards of neutral justice, due to the mental atmosphere of White Finland after the war. Approximately 70,000 Reds were convicted, mainly for complicity to treason. Most of the sentences were lenient, however, and many got out on parole. 555 persons were sentenced to death, of whom 113 were executed. The trials revealed also that some innocent persons had been imprisoned.<ref>{{Harvnb|Paavolainen|1971}}, {{Harvnb|Kekkonen|1991}}, {{Harvnb|Ker\u00e4nen|1992|pp=140, 142}}, {{Harvnb|Jussila|Hentil\u00e4|Nevakivi|1999|p=112}}, {{Harvnb|Tikka|2006|pp=161\u201378}}, Uta.fi/Suomi80/Yhteiskunta/Valtiorikosoikeudet</ref>\n\nCombined with the severe food shortage, the mass imprisonment led to high mortality rates in the camps, and the catastrophe was compounded by a mentality of punishment, anger and indifference on the part of the victors. Many prisoners felt that they were abandoned also by their own leaders, who had fled to Russia. The condition of the prisoners had weakened rapidly during May, after food supplies had been disrupted during the Red Guards' retreat in April, and a high number of prisoners had been captured already during the first half of April in Tampere and Helsinki. As a consequence, 2,900 starved to death or died in June as a result of diseases caused by malnutrition and [[Spanish flu]], 5,000 in July, 2,200 in August, and 1,000 in September. The mortality rate was highest in the [[Eken\u00e4s, Finland|Eken\u00e4s]] camp at 34%, while in the others the rate varied between 5% and 20%. In total, between 11,000 and 13,500 Finns perished.

The 17,000 refugees housed in Gurs were divided into four categories ([[Brigadist]]s, pilots, ''[[Euzko Gudarostea|Gudari]]s'' and ordinary Spaniards). The ''Gudaris'' (Basques) and the pilots easily found local backers and jobs, and were allowed to quit the camp, but the farmers and ordinary people, who could not find relations in France, were encouraged by the Third Republic, in agreement with the Francoist government, to return to Spain. The great majority did so and were turned over to the Francoist authorities in [[Ir\u00fan]]. From there they were transferred to the [[Miranda de Ebro]] camp for \"purification\".\n\nAfter the proclamation by Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] of the [[Vichy regime]], the refugees became political prisoners, and the [[French police]] attempted to round-up those who had been liberated from the camp. Along with other \"undesirables\", they were sent to the [[Drancy internment camp]] before being deported to [[Nazi Germany]]. About 5,000 Spaniards thus died in [[Mauthausen concentration camp]]<ref name=Cite>[http://www.histoire-immigration.fr/index.php?lg=fr&nav=20&flash=0 Film documentary] on the website of the ''[[Cit\u00e9 nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration]]'' {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\n===Vichy France===\nDuring [[World War II]], The French [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government ran what were called \"detention camps\" such as the one at [[Drancy deportation camp|Drancy]]. Camps also existed in the [[Pyrenees]] on the border with pro-Nazi Spain, among them [[Camp de Rivesaltes]], [[Camp Gurs]] and [[Camp Vernet]]. From these, the French cooperated in deporting about 73,000 Jews to [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nIn addition, in areas which Germany formally annexed from France, such as [[Alsace-Lorraine]], concentration camps were built, the largest being [[Natzweiler-Struthof]].\n\nThe Vichy French also ran camps in North and West Africa, and possibly [[French Somaliland]] and [[Madagascar]]. The following are the locations of concentration camps, POW camps, and internment camps in (Vichy) West and (Vichy) North Africa:\n\nThe camps were located at:\n\nWest Africa:\n* [[Conakry]]\n* [[Timbuctoo]]\n* [[Kankan]]\n* [[Mali|Koulikorro, Mali]]\n* [[Dakar]]\n\nNorth Africa:\n* [[Sfax]]\n* [[El Kef]]\n* [[Laghouat prison camp|Laghouat]]\n* Geryville.\n\nAlso camps connected to the ''Laconia'' incident:\n* [[Mediouna, Morocco|Mediouna]] (near [[Casablanca]])\n* [[Morocco|Qued-Zen, Morocco]] (near Casablanca)\n* [[Morocco|Sidi-el-Avachi, Morocco]] (near Azemmour)\n\nThe following camps which are under investigation:\n* Taza\n* Fes\n* Oujda\n* Sidi-bel-Abbes\n* Berguent\n* Settat\n* Sidi-el-Ayachi\n* Qued Zem\n* Mecheria\n\nThe camps at [[Conakry]], [[Timbuktu|Timbuctoo]], and [[Kankan]] had no running water, no electricity, no gas, no electric light no sewers, no toilets, and no baths.

This camp became the model for all later [[Nazi concentration camps]]. It was quickly followed by [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen]] which became a facility for the training of [[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde|SS-Death's Head]] officers in the operation of concentration camps.\n\n[[Theodor Eicke]], commandant of the Dachau camp, was appointed Inspector of Concentration Camps by [[Heinrich Himmler]] on 4 July 1934. By 1934 there were eight major institutions. This started the second phase of development. All smaller detention camps were consolidated into six major camps: Dachau, Sachsenhausen, [[Buchenwald]], [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp|Flossenburg]], and after the [[Anschluss|annexation]] of Austria in 1938, [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]]; finally in 1939 [[Ravensbr\u00fcck]] (for women). The pajama type blue-striped uniforms were introduced for inmates as well as the practice of tattooing the prisoner's number on his fore-arm. Eicke started the practice of farming out prisoners as slave-labor in German industry, with sub-camps or ''[[Arbeitskommando]]s'' to house them. The use of common criminals as [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]], to brutalize and assist in the handling of prisoners, was instituted at this time. In November 1938 the massive arrests of German Jews started, with most of them being immediately sent to the concentration camps, where they were separated from other prisoners and subjected to even harsher treatment.\n\nThe third phase started after the occupation of Poland in 1939. In the first few months Polish intellectuals were detained, including nearly the entire staff of [[Cracow University]] arrested in November 1939.<ref>{{cite book | title= History of Poland | isbn= 0-88029-858-8 | first= Oscar | last= Halecki | page= [https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 313] | date= June 1992 | url-access= registration | url= https://archive.org/details/historyofpoland0000hale/page/313 }}</ref> [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-I]] and [[Stutthof concentration camp]] were built to house them and other political prisoners. Large numbers were executed or died from the brutal treatment and disease. After the occupation of Belgium, France and Netherlands in 1940, [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], [[Gross Rosen]] and [[Fort Breendonk]], in addition to a number of smaller camps, were set up to house intellectuals and political prisoners from those countries who had not already been executed.<ref>''Rise and Fall of the Third Reich'', p. 957.</ref> Many of these intellectuals were held first in [[Gestapo]] prisons, and those who were not executed immediately after interrogation were sent on to the concentration camps.\n\nInitially, Jews in the occupied countries were interned either in other KZ, but predominantly in [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939-1944|Ghettos]] that were walled off parts of cities. All the Jews in western Poland (annexed into the Reich) were transported to ghettos in the [[General Government]]. Jews were used for labour in industries, but usually transported to work then returned to the KZ or the ghetto at night. Although these ghettoes were not intended to be extermination camps, and there was no official policy to kill people, thousands died due to hunger, disease and extreme conditions. During the German advance into Russia in 1941 and 1942 Jewish soldiers and civilians were systematically executed by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' of the S.S. that followed the front-line troops. At the [[Wannsee Conference]] on 20 January 1942 the \"[[Final Solution]]\" was decreed to exterminate all of the remaining Jews in Europe, [[Heydrich]] stated that there were still 11 million to be eliminated.<ref>\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" pp. 959\u201365</ref> To accomplish this special ''Vernichtungslager'' ('''extermination camps''') were organized. The first was [[Che\u0142mno extermination camp|Che\u0142mno]] in which 152,000, mainly from the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] ghetto, were killed. The method for carrying out mass murder was tested and perfected here. During 1942 and 1943 further camps [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau II]], part of [[Majdanek]], [[Treblinka]], [[Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp|Be\u0142\u017cec]] and [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibor]] were built for this purpose. Jews from other concentration camps, and from the ghettos, were transported to them from all over occupied Europe. In these six camps alone, an estimated 3.1 million Jews were killed in gas chambers and the bodies burned in massive crematoria. The Nazis realized that this was a criminal act {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the action was shrouded in secrecy. The extermination camps were destroyed in 1944 and early 1945 and buried. However the Soviet armies overran Auschwitz and Majdanek before the evidence could be totally destroyed.\n[[File:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]] views the bodies of prisoners at a liberated [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] in April 1945]]\n\nAnother category of internment camp in Nazi Germany was the '''[[Labor camp]]''' (''[[Arbeitslager]]''). They housed civilians from the occupied countries that were being used to work in industry, on the farms, in quarries, in mines and on the railroads. Approximately 12,000,000 forced laborers, most of whom were [[Eastern Europe]]ans, were enslaved in the German war economy inside the [[Nazi Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1757323,00.html|title=Final Compensation Pending for Former Nazi Forced Laborers |date= 27 October 2005|website=DW.COM|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |title=Forced Labor at Ford Werke AG during the Second World War |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014235036/http://summeroftruth.org/enemy/barracks.html |archivedate=14 October 2007 }}</ref> The workers were mostly young and taken from the occupied countries, predominantly eastern Europe, but also many French and Italian. They were sometimes taken willingly, more frequently as a result of ''[[lapanka]]'' in Polish, or ''rafle'' in French language, in which people were collected on the street or in their home by police drives. However, for often very minor infractions of the rules, workers were imprisoned in special ''Arbeitserziehungslager'', [[German language|German]] for '''worker re-education camp''' (abbreviated to AEL and sometimes referred to as ''Straflager'').<ref>de:Arbeiterserziehungslager</ref> These punishment camps were operated by the [[Gestapo]] and many of the inmates were executed or died from the brutal treatment.\n\nFinally there was one category of internment camp, called [[Ilag]] in which Allied (mainly British and American) civilians were held. These civilians had been caught behind front lines by the rapid advance of the German armies, or the sudden entry of the United States into the war. In these camps the Germans abided by the rules of the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. Deaths resulted from sickness or simply old age.\n\nAfter World War II, internment camps were used by the Allied occupying forces to hold suspected Nazis, usually using the facilities of previous Nazi camps. They were all closed down by 1949. In [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]] the communist government used prison camps to hold political prisoners, opponents of the communist regime or suspected Nazi collaborators.\n* [[Bad Nenndorf interrogation centre]]\n\n{{See also|Nazi concentration camp badges|List of concentration camps of Nazi Germany|List of concentration camps for Poles|Extermination of Soviet prisoners of war by Nazi Germany|Ilag}}\n\n==Hong Kong==\nDuring the Second World War the Japanese, during their occupation of Hong Kong, interned enemy nationals (mostly British, Canadian, American and Dutch), in several internment camps in Hong Kong. Camps existed at:\n\n* [[Sham Shui Po]] \u2013 A concentration camp was maintained here for most of the duration of the Second World War.\n* Stanley Internment Camp \u2013 Located primarily on the grounds of [[St. Stephen's College, Hong Kong|St. Stephen's College]]. Shortly after surrendering, the Imperial Japanese Army broke into the St. Stephen's (which had served as a military hospital during the battle) and murdered the wounded soldiers of the Allied forces. The Japanese later merged the College with part of Stanley Prison to form the full Stanley Internment Camp.\n* Stanley Prison \u2013 Located primarily in the Officer's housing blocks at the prison. During the Japanese occupation, the grounds of the prison were used as part of Stanley Internment Camp. Nearly 600 prisoners of war and civilians, killed by the Japanese during the occupation, are buried in the nearby Stanley War Cemetery (which is NOT part of the prison itself but adjacent to it).\n\n== India, British ==\nDuring both World Wars the British interned enemy nationals (mostly Germans). In 1939 this also included refugees from the Nazis as well as Germans who had acquired British citizenship, in India.

By March 1942 many civilians, particularly westerners in the region's European colonies, found themselves behind enemy lines and were subsequently interned by the Japanese.\n\nThe nature of civilian internment varied from region to region. Some civilians were interned soon after invasion; in other areas the process occurred over many months. In total, approximately 130,000 Allied civilians were interned by the Japanese during this period of occupation. The exact number of internees will never be known as records were often lost, destroyed, or simply not kept.\n[[File:73-Japanse kampen in Nederlands-Indi\u00eb.jpg|thumb|Liberated Dutch prisoners in Indonesia (Dutch East Indies) in 1945]]\nThe backgrounds of the internees were diverse. There was a large proportion of Dutch from the [[Dutch East Indies]], but they also included Americans, British, and Australians. They included missionaries and their families, colonial administrators, and business people. Many had been living in the colonies for decades. Single women had often been nuns, missionaries, doctors, teachers and nurses.\n\nCivilians interned by the Japanese were treated marginally better than the prisoners of war, but their death rates were the same. Although they had to work to run their own camps, few were made to labour on construction projects. The Japanese devised no consistent policies or guidelines to regulate the treatment of the civilians. Camp conditions and the treatment of internees varied from camp to camp. The general experience, however, was one of malnutrition, disease, and varying degrees of harsh discipline and brutality from the Japanese guards. Some [[Dutch people|Dutch]] women were forced into [[sexual slavery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan |accessdate=12 May 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324104443/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html |archivedate=24 March 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/abe-ignores-evidence-say-australias-comfort-women/2007/03/02/1172338881441.html|title=Abe ignores evidence, say Australia's 'comfort women' |website=www.theage.com.au|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe camps varied in size from four people held at Pangkalpinang in Sumatra to the 14,000 held in [[Tjihapit]] in Java. Some were segregated according to gender or race, there were also many camps of mixed gender. Some internees were held at the same camp for the duration of the war, and others were moved about. The buildings used to house internees were generally whatever was available, including schools, warehouses, universities, hospitals, and prisons.\n[[File:Jean-marie-and-private-tanner.jpg|thumb|left|Jean-Marie Faggiano receives a doll from [[Private First Class]] Theo Tanner of the U.S. First Cavalry. Tanner had just removed the doll from a dead Japanese soldier, killed during the liberation of the Santo Tomas Internment Camp in Manila, Philippines in February 1945]]\n\nOrganisation of the internment camps varied by location. The Japanese administered some camps directly; others were administered by local authorities under Japanese control. Korean POWs of the Japanese were also used as camp guards. Some of the camps were left for the internees to self-govern. In the mixed and male camps, management often fell to the men who were experienced in administration before their internment. In the women's camps the leaders tended to be the women who had held a profession prior to internment. Boys over the age of ten were generally considered to be men by the Japanese and were often separated from their mothers to live and work in male camps.\n\nOne of the most famous concentration camps operated by the Japanese during World War II was at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] in [[Manila]], the Philippines, the [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]]. The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] university was expropriated by the Japanese at the beginning of the occupation, and was used to house mostly American civilians, but also British subjects, for the duration of the war. There, men, women and children suffered from malnutrition and poor sanitation. The camp was liberated in 1945.\n\nThe liberation of the camps was not a uniform process. Many camps were liberated as the forces were recapturing territory. For other internees, freedom occurred many months after the surrender of the Japanese, and in the Dutch East Indies, liberated internees faced the uncertainty of the [[Indonesian War of Independence]].\n\nCivilian internees were generally disregarded in official histories, and few received formal recognition. Ironically, however, civilian internees have become the subject of several influential books and films. [[Agnes Newton Keith]]'s account of internment on [[Berhala Island, Sabah|Berhala Island]] in [[Sandakan|Sandakan Harbour]] and [[Batu Lintang camp]], Kuching, ''[[Three Came Home]]'' (1947), was one of the first of the memoirs. More recent publications include Jeanne Tuttle and Jolanthe Zelling's \"Mammie's Journal of My Childhood\" (2005); (Shirley Fenton-Huie's ''The Forgotten Ones'' (1992) and Jan Ruff O'Herne's ''Fifty Years of Silence'' (1997). Nevil Shute's novel ''[[A Town Like Alice]]'' was filmed in 1956, and J. G. Ballard's ''[[Empire of the Sun]]'' in 1987. Other films and television dramas have included ''[[Tenko (TV series)|Tenko]]'' and ''[[Paradise Road (1997 film)|Paradise Road]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/Encyclopedia/pow/ww2/civilian_internees.htm |title=Prisoners of the Japanese: Civilian internees, Pacific and South-East Asia &#124; Australian War Memorial |publisher=Awm.gov.au |date= |accessdate=8 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://166.122.164.43/archive/2004/june/06-22-17.htm |title=Guam Survivor Recalls WWII Forced |date=22 June 2004 |publisher=166.122.164.43 |accessdate=8 November 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707160612/http://166.122.164.43/archive/2004/june/06-22-17.htm |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.kuam.com/news/10206.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223804/http://www.kuam.com/news/10206.aspx|date=27 September 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Korea, Republic of==\nDuring the 1980s, [[South Korea]] had multiple internment camps, including the [[Brothers Home]], which housed thousands of prisoners in [[Busan]].<ref name=\"THK\">{{cite news|last1=Tong-Hyung|first1=Kim|last2=Klug|first2=Foster|title=AP: S.

From 1922 to 1928, Italian forces under General [[Pietro Badoglio]] waged a punitive pacification campaign. Badoglio's successor in the field, Marshal [[Rodolfo Graziani]] (known as 'The Butcher of Fezzan'), accepted the commission from Mussolini on the condition that he be allowed to crush the Libyan resistance unencumbered by the restraints of either Italian or international law. Reportedly, Mussolini immediately agreed and Graziani intensified the [[oppression]]. The Libyans continued to defend themselves, with the strongest voices of dissent coming from the Cyrenaica. [[Omar Mukhtar]], a [[Senussi]] sheikh, became the leader of the uprising.\n\nSoon afterwards, the colonial administration began the wholesale deportation of the people of Cyrenaica to deny the rebels the support of the local population. The forced migration of more than 100,000 people ended in concentration camps in Suluq- ALa byer and [[El Agheila|Al Agheila]] where tens of thousands died in squalid conditions. It is estimated (by Arab historians) that the number of Libyans who died \u2013 killed either through combat or mainly through starvation, execution and disease \u2013 is at a minimum of 80,000 or even up to one third of the Cyrenaican population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cGHGPgj1_tIC&pg=PA309|title=The Dark Side of Democracy: Explaining Ethnic Cleansing|last=Mann|first=Michael|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521538541|location=|page=309|language=}}</ref>\n\n==Montenegro==\n\nThe fort on the island of [[Mamula (island)|Mamula]] was converted into a [[concentration camp]] by the [[Italian fascism|fascist]] forces of [[Benito Mussolini|Benito Mussolini's]] [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nDuring the 1991 to 1995 [[Croatian War of Independence]], the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] organized the [[Morinj camp]] near [[Kotor]], [[Montenegro]].\n\n==Netherlands==\nDuring WWI, all foreign soldiers and ship crews that illegally entered the neutral Netherlands were interned in a specific camp based on their nationality (to avoid conflict). By far the largest camp was the one for British sailors and soldiers in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]. Unlike the [[Prisoners of War|PoWs]] at the time in the neighbouring countries, Dutch prisoners had plenty of food, and tradesmen often came to the camp with a wide range of goods. The interned were paid a certain amount of compensation money by the Dutch authorities on top of any British aid that got channeled to them through the Dutch government. One prisoner later commented: \"... we were quite well off, and the local people were very good to us.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwar.nl/index.html|title=British sailors in Groningen camp|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a revolt in 1926 in the [[Dutch East Indies]], a concentration camp for political prisoners was set up in what then was called [[Netherlands New Guinea]], in the very remote jungle at [[Boven-Digoel]] (Upper-Digul).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Dr L. de Jong, ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'' ('' The Kingdom of the Netherlands during WWII''), Amsterdam, RIOD, 1966</ref>\n\nJust before World War II engulfed the Netherlands, a camp was built in 1939 at [[Westerbork (village)|Westerbork]] by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government for interning Jewish refugees who had fled [[Nazi Germany]]. During the German occupation [[Westerbork transit camp|this camp]] was used as a transit camp for Dutch Jews eventually deported to [[extermination camp]]s in the East. [[Amersfoort concentration camp|Amersfoort]] (1941\u20131945) (in German: ''Polizeiliches Durchgangslager'') was also a transit camp. The [[Herzogenbusch concentration camp|Herzogenbusch]] camp (1943\u20131944, known as ''[[Kamp Vught]]'' because of its location in that town) was a concentration camp, the only one in Western Europe outside Germany set up as well as run by the [[SS]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOther camps were [[Kamp Schoorl|camp Schoorl]] near Schoorl and [[Kamp Erika|camp Erika]] near Ommen. Before the [[Shoah]] began, some two dozen labor camps for Jewish men were operated fulfilling an order of the German occupiers. In the Dutch East Indies, after the occupation of the Netherlands by the Germans in Europe started on 15 May 1940, Germans living in the Indies were rounded up and interned there. Almost all camps also had field offices for forced labor. In the case of Vught as well as Amersfoort work details for [[Philips]] factories existed, often under relatively favourable circumstances. Also, the huge construction activities for the 30 German airfields in the Netherlands relied partly upon labour from camps.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAfter the war, the Dutch government launched the [[Operation Black Tulip]] and started to gather civil population of German background to concentration camps near the German border, especially [[Nijmegen]], in order to deport them from the country. In total around 15% of the German population in the Netherlands was deported.\n\nNumerous improvised and official camps were set up after the war, to keep Dutch who were suspected of collaboration with the Germans. Kamp Westerbork at one point housed some Jews as well as suspected collaborators and Germans. In these camps, a history of maltreatment by the guards, sometimes leading to death, has been collected.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==New Zealand==\nIn World War I German civilians living in New Zealand were interned in camps on [[Motuihe Island|Motuihe]] and [[Somes Island|Somes]] Islands.

Those persons considered \"adversary class forces\", such as landholders, Japanese collaborators, religious devotees and the families of people who migrated to the [[South Korea|South]], were rounded up and detained in large facilities. Additional camps were later established in the late 1950s and 60s in order to incarcerate the political victims of power struggles along with their families as well as overseas Koreans who migrated to the North. Later, the number of camps saw a marked increase with the cementing of the [[Kim Il Sung]] dictatorship and the [[Kim Jong-il]] succession. About a dozen concentration camps were in operation until the early 1990s, but some of them were closed and merged into the remaining six camps for the purpose of maintaining better secrecy and control.<ref>{{cite web |title=White paper on human rights in North Korea 2009 (pp. 117\u201343)|publisher=Korea Institute for National Unification|url=http://www.kinu.or.kr/2009/0727/white2009_e.pdf |accessdate=9 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nNorth Korea is known to operate six concentration camps, currently accommodating around 200,000 prisoners.

(In the [[Russian language]], the term is used to denote the whole system, rather than individual camps.)\n\nIn addition to what is sometimes referred to as the GULAG proper (consisting of the \"corrective labor camps\") there were \"corrective labor colonies\", originally intended for prisoners with short sentences, and \"special resettlements\" of deported peasants.

Initially they were shipped overseas, but that was halted when a German [[U-boat]] sank the SS ''[[Arandora Star]]'' in July 1940 with the loss of 800 internees, though this was not the first loss that had occurred. The last internees were released late in 1945, though many were released in 1942. In Britain, internees were housed in camps and prisons. Some camps had tents rather than buildings with internees sleeping directly on the ground. Men and women were separated and most contact with the outside world was denied.

Known as [[New Village]]s, these camps were intended to become permanent settlements. As attacks by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] declined, the curfews were lifted, fences removed, and the camps gradually ceased to be internment camps. To this day many villages founded in this way are known as New Villages and remain ethnically Chinese.\n\n===Northern Ireland===\n{{Main|Operation Demetrius}}\nOne of the most famous example of modern ''internment'' (and one which made world headlines) occurred in [[Northern Ireland]] in 1971, when hundreds of [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] and [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republicans]] were arrested by the [[British Army]] and the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] on the orders of then [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Brian Faulkner]], with the backing of the [[British government]]. Historians generally view that period of internment as inflaming [[sectarian]] tensions in Northern Ireland while failing in its stated aim of arresting members of the paramilitary [[Provisional IRA]]. Many of the people arrested were completely unconnected with the Provisional IRA but, through bungling and incompetence, had their names appear on the list of those to be interned,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} while over 100 IRA men escaped arrest. The backlash against internment and its bungled application contributed to the decision of the British government under Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]] to suspend the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Stormont governmental]] system in Northern Ireland and replace it with ''[[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|Direct rule]]'' from London, under the authority of a British [[Secretary of State for Northern Ireland]].\n\nFrom 1971 internment began, beginning with the arrest of 342 suspected republican guerrillas and paramilitary members on 9 August. They were held at [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|HM Prison]] [[Maze (HM Prison)|Maze]] then called [[Long Kesh Detention Centre]]. By 1972, 924 men were interned. Serious rioting ensued, and 23 people died in three days. The [[British government]] attempted to show some balance by arresting some [[loyalist]] paramilitaries later, but out of the 1,981 men interned,<ref name=\"joint2005p110\" /> only 107 were loyalists. Internment was ended in 1975, but had resulted in increased support for the IRA and created political tensions which culminated in the [[1981 Irish Hunger Strike]] and the death of [[Bobby Sands]], member of British Parliament ([[Anti H-Block|Anti H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner]] Party.)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/events/hunger_strike.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Hunger Strike |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/rwby1981a.htm |title=CAIN: Politics: Elections: Westminster By-election (NI) Thursday 9 April 1981 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=9 April 1981 |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> His death resulted in a new surge of IRA recruitment and activity.

Internment had previously been used as a means of repressing the [[Irish Republican Army]]. It was used between 1939\u20131945 and 1956\u20131962.

Locations as identified by the historian Simon Webb include [[Rothesay, Bute|Rothesay]] on the [[Isle of Bute]], and [[Tighnabruaich]] on the Scottish mainland. Rothesay was used to house the political enemies of the leader of the Polish Government in Exile, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], as well as Poles considered by Sikorski's Government in Exile of being morally dubious. [[Tighnabruaich]] held criminals under the jurisdiction of the Polish Government in Exile. Webb claims the Poles were later allowed to open further camps at [[Kingledoors]], [[Auchterarder]] and [[Inverkeithing]] near [[Edinburgh]]. Although deaths, and claims of torture and privations were made by numerous British [[Members of Parliament]] against the internment camps, the camps treated as sovereign Polish territory and local Scottish police forces were unable to investigate what happened in them. Webb also suggests that being [[Jewish]] or a suspected [[Communist]] was often enough to lead to Polish citizens under the jurisdiction of the Polish Government in Exile being sent to one of the internment camps.<ref>Simon Webb, ''British Concentration Camps: A Brief History from 1900 - 1975'' (London: Pen & Sword Books, 2016), chapter 5</ref>\n\n===South Africa===\n[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|[[Lizzie van Zyl]], shortly before her death in [[Bloemfontein]] Concentration Camp]]\nThe term '''concentration camp''' was first used by the British military during the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899\u20131902).

It is set in the world of ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and uses a strict interpretation of the ''[[Editions of Dungeons & Dragons#Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition|Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition]]'' rule set.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the campaign storyline, players lead a party of adventurers on their quest to investigate an ancient being, about which little beyond the name is initially known. The plot is eventually revealed to be an epic contest between two [[dragon]]s competing for godhood. The player can choose the path of good or evil, with different quests available depending on which is preferred, although the distinction between the two is not always clear. The game is divided up into a number of distinct battles or missions (30+), with the player able to access the majority of these during a given campaign, since several of the scenarios are mutually exclusive. Scenarios cannot be re-played once successfully completed.\n\nThe campaign revolves around a single lead character, with the other characters playing a supporting role. At the start of each scenario or battle, players select which additional adventurers to take along (up to a total of five such auxiliary characters after the first few scenarios). While this technically allows one to have more than six adventurers, only characters who actually participate in a given battle earn experience, so attempting to field a larger stable of cohorts serves to dilute earned [[experience level]]s.\n\nThe game features the core [[Character class (Dungeons & Dragons)|character classes]] from the 3.5 ''[[Player's Handbook]]'': the [[Barbarian (Dungeons & Dragons)|Barbarian]], [[Bard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Bard]], [[Cleric (Dungeons & Dragons)|Cleric]], [[Druid (Dungeons & Dragons)|Druid]], [[Fighter (Dungeons & Dragons)|Fighter]], [[Monk (Dungeons & Dragons)|Monk]], [[Paladin (Dungeons & Dragons)|Paladin]], [[Ranger (Dungeons & Dragons)|Ranger]], [[Rogue (Dungeons & Dragons)|Rogue]], [[Sorcerer (Dungeons & Dragons)|Sorcerer]], and [[Wizard (Dungeons & Dragons)|Wizard]], as well as two non-core classes, the Psion and Psychic Warrior. A full set of character generation rules permit players to create their own characters, or use pre-generated characters selected from a \"character library\".\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Dungeons & Dragons Tactics'' makes use of a simple overworld map between battles. The map shows key locations of interest, with the party's current location depicted by a flag icon. While a few cutscenes are triggered upon entering certain locations, in general, the party is free to move to any known location. There is no notion of time associated with movement, and there are no random encounters. At some locations, players can buy additional goods, and can always trade items between characters or adjust character equipment. When a battle or mission is available at a given location, the \"Adventure\" action is presented, allowing players to undertake the indicated scenario.\n\nOnce a scenario begins, the player forms a party from the available characters, and the game then switches to adventuring mode. In this mode, the party and surroundings are displayed using a zoomed-in [[bird's eye view]]. The camera can be rotated using the left [[analog stick]] and the map scrolled as desired, although only features (e.g. monsters) which characters can currently see are shown. In dimly lit environments, torches or the use of [[darkvision (Dungeons & Dragons)|darkvision]] are required to achieve full visibility.\n\nThe game uses a menu-based action system, where a character is selected and his or her actions are then selected from a series of branching menu options. In \"exploration mode\", where no monsters are currently nearby, characters can take turns in any order, with the same character able to act again and again if desired. The party can also rest in this mode, restoring all spells and hitpoints. However, once a monster is observed or becomes aware of the party, the game switches to a standard [[Initiative (role-playing games)|initiative-based]] ''Dungeons & Dragons'' turn system. After all such enemies are defeated, the game returns to exploration mode. This cycle continues until either the party leader is defeated, or the completion conditions for the scenario are fulfilled.\n\nWhile a few magical items are awarded for completing certain scenarios, most such treasure is stored in chests discovered during scenarios. These chests must be opened and their contents removed during the course of a mission if the characters are to make use of them. If a scenario is completed before such chests are open, their contents are lost forever. As characters cannot easily trade items amongst themselves during an adventure, weaker characters can easily become overloaded if they pick up a sufficiently heavy quantity of equipment.  Items can be dropped on the ground and picked up by any other characters in your party if you wish to trade items during an adventure.  This process can be time-consuming and is generally not recommended while in combat.\n\n===Multiplayer===\n''Dungeons & Dragons Tactics'' supports several different multiplayer modes via the PlayStation Portable wireless connection.  These include multiplayer [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] and co-operative modes supporting up to five players. Regardless of mode, only the pre-generated characters can be used; those from single player campaigns are not available in multiplayer.\n\nIn deathmatch mode, five different maps are available, while in the co-operative mode, players can choose from three.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| GR = 59%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/psp/932656-dungeons-and-dragons-tactics/index.html |title=Dungeons & Dragons Tactics for PSP |website=[[GameRankings]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n| MC = 58/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/psp/dungeons-dragons-tactics |title=Dungeons & Dragons Tactics for PSP Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n| 1UP = 6.5 of 10\n| GSpot = 5 of 10\n| GSpy = 1.5 of 5\n| IGN = 6.5 of 10\n}}\n\n''Dungeons & Dragons Tactics'' suffered at the hands of most reviewers, who complained of numerous issues with the game.

''Mod\u00e9r\u00e9, un peu vif''<br>A \"curtain raiser\" introducing the \"statue theme\" and the \"flower theme\", followed by the body of the movement, which superimposes two ''ostinato'' groups with rhythmic punctuations. A reprise of the \"statue\" theme closes the introduction.\n|Chant d\u2019amour (Love song) 1. ''Mod\u00e9r\u00e9, lourd''<br>After an atonal introduction, this movement is built on an alternation of a fast and passionate theme dominated by the trumpets, and a soft and gentle theme for the strings and ondes.\n|Turangal\u00eela 1. ''Presque lent, r\u00eaveur''<br> Three themes are stated: one starting with a solo clarinet, the second for low brass and strings, and the third a sinuous theme on the woodwinds. The movement then develops and, later, overlaps the themes, with the addition of a new rhythm in the percussion.\n|Chant d\u2019amour 2. ''Bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> Introduced by a ''scherzo'' for piccolo and bassoon, this movement is in nine sections, some of which recall and develop music heard earlier. A calm coda in A major brings it to a close.\n|Joie du sang des \u00e9toiles (Joy of the Blood of the Stars). ''Vif, passionn\u00e9 avec joie''<br> A frenetic dance whose main theme is a fast variant of the \"statue theme\". For Messiaen, it represented the union of two lovers seen as a transformation on a cosmic scale. The dance is interrupted by a shattering piano cadenza before a brief orchestral coda.\n|Jardin du sommeil d\u2019amour (Garden of Love\u2019s Sleep). ''Tr\u00e8s mod\u00e9r\u00e9, tr\u00e8s tendre''<br> The first full rendition of the \"love\" theme in the strings and ondes is accompanied by idealized birdsong played by the piano, and by other orchestral coloristic effects. According to Messiaen, \"The two lovers are enclosed in love's sleep. A landscape comes out from them...\"\n|Turangal\u00eela 2. ''Un peu vif, bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> A completely atonal movement that is intended to invoke terror, with a predominant role for the percussion ensemble.\n|D\u00e9veloppement d\u2019amour (Development of Love). ''Bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> For Messiaen, the title can be considered in two ways. For the lovers, it is terrible: united by the love potion, they are trapped in a passion growing to the infinite. Musically, this is the work's [[musical development|development]] section.\n|Turangal\u00eela 3. ''Bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> A theme is introduced by the woodwind. A five-part percussion ensemble introduces a rhythmic [[Serialism|series]] that then sustains a set of superimposed variations on the woodwind theme.\n|Final. ''Mod\u00e9r\u00e9, presque vif, avec une grande joie''<br> The movement is in sonata form: A brass fanfare, coupled with a fast variation of the \"love theme\", is developed and leads to a long coda, a final version of the \"love\" theme played ''fortissimo'' by the entire orchestra. The work ends on an enormous F{{Music|sharp}} major chord. In Messiaen's words, \"glory and joy are without end\".\n}}\n\nThe composer's initial plan was for a symphony in the conventional four movements, which eventually became numbers 1, 4, 6, and 10. Next, he added the three ''Turangal\u00eela'' movements, which he originally called ''[[Tala (music)|t\u00e2las]]'', a reference to the use of rhythm in [[Indian classical music]]. Finally, the 2nd, 5th, and 8th movements were inserted.{{sfn|Hill|2005|p=171}} Early on, Messiaen authorized separate performance of movements 3, 4, and 5, as ''Three t\u00e2las'' (not to be confused with the original use of the term for the three Turangal\u00eela movements), but later came to disapprove of the performance of extracts.\n==Recordings==\n[[File:Maurice Le Roux 3.jpg|thumb|252x252px|[[Maurice Le Roux]] conducting the ''Turangalila-Symphonie'']]\n\n*'''[[Roger D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re]]''', Orchestre National de la Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise, [[Yvonne Loriod]] (piano) and Ginette Martenot (ondes martenot) \u2013 INA 1950 live (European premiere, at Aix-en-Provence Festival on 25 July 1950){{Full|date=October 2012}}<!--Format, label, place, and catalog number needed.-->\n*'''[[Hans Rosbaud]]''', SWF-Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden, Yvonne Loriod (piano) and Ginette Martenot (ondes martenot) \u2013 Wergo 1951{{Full|date=October 2012}}<!--Format and catalog number needed, and an explanation of how Wergo, which was only founded in 1962, could have released this in 1951.-->\n*'''[[Maurice Le Roux]]''', Orchestre National de la RTF, Yvonne Loriod (piano) and Jeanne Loriod (ondes martenot) \u2013  (supervised by Messiaen, 1961).

''Mod\u00e9r\u00e9, un peu vif''<br>A \"curtain raiser\" introducing the \"statue theme\" and the \"flower theme\", followed by the body of the movement, which superimposes two ''ostinato'' groups with rhythmic punctuations. A reprise of the \"statue\" theme closes the introduction.\n|Chant d\u2019amour (Love song) 1. ''Mod\u00e9r\u00e9, lourd''<br>After an atonal introduction, this movement is built on an alternation of a fast and passionate theme dominated by the trumpets, and a soft and gentle theme for the strings and ondes.\n|Turangal\u00eela 1. ''Presque lent, r\u00eaveur''<br> Three themes are stated: one starting with a solo clarinet, the second for low brass and strings, and the third a sinuous theme on the woodwinds. The movement then develops and, later, overlaps the themes, with the addition of a new rhythm in the percussion.\n|Chant d\u2019amour 2. ''Bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> Introduced by a ''scherzo'' for piccolo and bassoon, this movement is in nine sections, some of which recall and develop music heard earlier. A calm coda in A major brings it to a close.\n|Joie du sang des \u00e9toiles (Joy of the Blood of the Stars). ''Vif, passionn\u00e9 avec joie''<br> A frenetic dance whose main theme is a fast variant of the \"statue theme\". For Messiaen, it represented the union of two lovers seen as a transformation on a cosmic scale. The dance is interrupted by a shattering piano cadenza before a brief orchestral coda.\n|Jardin du sommeil d\u2019amour (Garden of Love\u2019s Sleep). ''Tr\u00e8s mod\u00e9r\u00e9, tr\u00e8s tendre''<br> The first full rendition of the \"love\" theme in the strings and ondes is accompanied by idealized birdsong played by the piano, and by other orchestral coloristic effects. According to Messiaen, \"The two lovers are enclosed in love's sleep. A landscape comes out from them...\"\n|Turangal\u00eela 2. ''Un peu vif, bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> A completely atonal movement that is intended to invoke terror, with a predominant role for the percussion ensemble.\n|D\u00e9veloppement d\u2019amour (Development of Love). ''Bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> For Messiaen, the title can be considered in two ways. For the lovers, it is terrible: united by the love potion, they are trapped in a passion growing to the infinite. Musically, this is the work's [[musical development|development]] section.\n|Turangal\u00eela 3. ''Bien mod\u00e9r\u00e9''<br> A theme is introduced by the woodwind. A five-part percussion ensemble introduces a rhythmic [[Serialism|series]] that then sustains a set of superimposed variations on the woodwind theme.\n|Final. ''Mod\u00e9r\u00e9, presque vif, avec une grande joie''<br> The movement is in sonata form: A brass fanfare, coupled with a fast variation of the \"love theme\", is developed and leads to a long coda, a final version of the \"love\" theme played ''fortissimo'' by the entire orchestra. The work ends on an enormous F{{Music|sharp}} major chord. In Messiaen's words, \"glory and joy are without end\".\n}}\n\nThe composer's initial plan was for a symphony in the conventional four movements, which eventually became numbers 1, 4, 6, and 10. Next, he added the three ''Turangal\u00eela'' movements, which he originally called ''[[Tala (music)|t\u00e2las]]'', a reference to the use of rhythm in [[Indian classical music]]. Finally, the 2nd, 5th, and 8th movements were inserted.{{sfn|Hill|2005|p=171}} Early on, Messiaen authorized separate performance of movements 3, 4, and 5, as ''Three t\u00e2las'' (not to be confused with the original use of the term for the three Turangal\u00eela movements), but later came to disapprove of the performance of extracts.\n==Recordings==\n[[File:Maurice Le Roux 3.jpg|thumb|252x252px|[[Maurice Le Roux]] conducting the ''Turangalila-Symphonie'']]\n\n*'''[[Roger D\u00e9sormi\u00e8re]]''', Orchestre National de la Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise, [[Yvonne Loriod]] (piano) and Ginette Martenot (ondes martenot) \u2013 INA 1950 live (European premiere, at Aix-en-Provence Festival on 25 July 1950){{Full|date=October 2012}}<!--Format, label, place, and catalog number needed.-->\n*'''[[Hans Rosbaud]]''', SWF-Sinfonieorchester Baden-Baden, Yvonne Loriod (piano) and Ginette Martenot (ondes martenot) \u2013 Wergo 1951{{Full|date=October 2012}}<!--Format and catalog number needed, and an explanation of how Wergo, which was only founded in 1962, could have released this in 1951.-->\n*'''[[Maurice Le Roux]]''', Orchestre National de la RTF, Yvonne Loriod (piano) and Jeanne Loriod (ondes martenot) \u2013  (supervised by Messiaen, 1961).

Hall cycled through a number of business partners and company names in the earliest years prior to incorporating and establishing Hall\u2019s Safe & Lock Co.\n\n''E. & J. L. Hall (1846-1850), E. Hall & Co. (1850-1851)'' : Joseph L. Hall first began in business with his father Edward H. Hall in a small and largely inconsequential way in Pittsburgh, PA in 1846 before moving the business to Cincinnati in 1848.\n\n''Hall & Dodds (1852-1854), Hall, Dodds, & Co (1854-1856)'': William B. Dodds bought Edward Hall\u2019s interest and partnered with Joseph L. Hall in 1851 to form the firm Hall & Dodds. They employed 15 people and produced two safes per week.\n\n''Hall & Carroll (1856-1858), Hall, Carroll, & Co. (1858-1862):'' William Carroll and Charles Carroll partnered with Joseph L. Hall under the name Hall, Carroll & Co. Around 1862 the factory was moved to  the southwest corner of Pearl and Plum streets in Cincinnati, Ohio were it would remain and grow.\n\n''Joseph L. Hall & Co. (1862-1867):'' During the [[American Civil War|civil war]] demand for safes waned. As always, Joseph L. Hall adapted to the times and took a government contract to alter and rifle five thousand Austrian muskets. Having no machinery or experience he managed to deliver in the requisite thirty days. This success would lead to other government contracts during those years.\n\n''Hall's Safe & Lock Co. 1867-1892:'' In 1867, Joseph L. Hall incorporated the Hall\u2019s Safe & Lock Co. and become its President and Treasurer, O.Y. Cone became  Vice President, and J.B. Marling became Secretary.\n\n=== Laying the Foundation 1867-1870 ===\nAt this time the factory was only \"100 feet square and two stories high\"<ref name=\"court\">Records and Briefs of the United States Supreme Court, Volume 208</ref> and in 1868, Joseph L. Hall\u2019s eldest son Edward C. Hall, Sr. would enter full time employment in the firm as a clerk.\n\nOne of the firms earliest employees was Henry Gross and in 1869 he was granted a patent for a combination lock that would become known as the Hall Premier. This well-positioned Hall for competition against the leading lock manufacturers of the time Yale & Town Mfg. Co. and Sargent & Greenleaf. And he was up to the task as seen in a series of correspondence and news articles between Hall's and Sargent in regards to a lock-picking challenge instigated by [[James Sargent]] in 1870.\n\n=== Expanding the Company 1871-1880 ===\nFollowing the great Chicago fires of October 1871, Hall\u2019s safes were the only ones \u201cproven to be secure\u201d,<ref name=\"great\" /> protecting their contents inside through fires that lasted for as much as ten days. Hundreds of customer testimonials surfaced which Hall would use to his advantage in advertisements far and wide. As a result, the company began to grow immensely in both reputation and size and was known to be four times the capacity of similar factories<ref>\nCincinnati past and present, or, Its industrial history as exhibited in the life-labors of its leading men</ref>. By 1872 the firm had grown to 460 employees and produced between 20-25 safes per day.<ref>Whig and tribune. 3/2/1872</ref> And as of 1874 20% of new banks in the United states were using Hall\u2019s safes and \u2154 of bankers in Chicago were using Hall\u2019s Safes.<ref>Chicago Tribune March 11, 1874</ref>[[File:Factory---Burglar-Room-Cut.jpg|thumb|Cut of Burglar Room. Hall's Safe & Lock Co. Factory circa 1878]]\n\nIn 1874, Joseph L. Hall's third son, William H. Hall, would begin working for the firm in the Lock Department. By 1878 he would be in charge of the shipping department.\n\nDue to increasing litigation surrounding the safe and lock industry, Hall hired Milton Dalton in 1873 \"to pursue what must be one of the boldest and broadest acts of corporate espionage ever.\"<ref>American Genius: Nineteenth Century Bank Locks and Time Locks</ref> He set out to interview every active safe maker in the United States and Europe and managed to gather evidence detailing the development and progress of the industry in detail. The evidence in this book would help to prove that Hall held a patent for the use of conical bolts in safe manufacture that pre-dated safe maker MacNeale & Urban as detailed in a court case that began in 1875 and was decided in Hall's favor in 1883.\n\n[[File:Hall's Safe Mercantile Building Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|Hall's Safe & Lock Safe - Mercantile Building, Cincinnati, Ohio]]\n\nAccording to [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant's]] papers, in 1875, Joseph L. Hall was in correspondence to acquire the President\u2019s farm in St. Louis as a possible new location for the factory. Though these talks bore no fruit and the seriousness of Joseph L. Hall\u2019s true interest in moving the factory is in doubt.<ref>The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant</ref>\n\nIn 1875 Hall\u2019s Safe & Lock Co. entered the nascent time lock business.\n\n=== Dominating the Industry 1880 - 1889 ===\nIn 1880, Joseph L. Hall created the Consolidated Time Lock company to house the time lock portion of his business. That same year the Berkshire Savings bank was sued by Yale for using a Consolidated time lock which Yale claimed infringed on its patent. In an unprecedented move at the time, Joseph L. Hall, knowing that Consolidated was the \"real party in interest\", petitioned the court to have Consolidated substituted as the defendant in the case. The case would eventually end up in the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1883 rumors again circulated that Hall\u2019s factory was going to move from Cincinnati. Joseph L.

Hall cycled through a number of business partners and company names in the earliest years prior to incorporating and establishing Hall\u2019s Safe & Lock Co.\n\n''E. & J. L. Hall (1846-1850), E. Hall & Co. (1850-1851)'' : Joseph L. Hall first began in business with his father Edward H. Hall in a small and largely inconsequential way in Pittsburgh, PA in 1846 before moving the business to Cincinnati in 1848.\n\n''Hall & Dodds (1852-1854), Hall, Dodds, & Co (1854-1856)'': William B. Dodds bought Edward Hall\u2019s interest and partnered with Joseph L. Hall in 1851 to form the firm Hall & Dodds. They employed 15 people and produced two safes per week.\n\n''Hall & Carroll (1856-1858), Hall, Carroll, & Co. (1858-1862):'' William Carroll and Charles Carroll partnered with Joseph L. Hall under the name Hall, Carroll & Co. Around 1862 the factory was moved to  the southwest corner of Pearl and Plum streets in Cincinnati, Ohio were it would remain and grow.\n\n''Joseph L. Hall & Co. (1862-1867):'' During the [[American Civil War|civil war]] demand for safes waned. As always, Joseph L. Hall adapted to the times and took a government contract to alter and rifle five thousand Austrian muskets. Having no machinery or experience he managed to deliver in the requisite thirty days. This success would lead to other government contracts during those years.\n\n''Hall's Safe & Lock Co. 1867-1892:'' In 1867, Joseph L. Hall incorporated the Hall\u2019s Safe & Lock Co. and become its President and Treasurer, O.Y. Cone became  Vice President, and J.B. Marling became Secretary.\n\n=== Laying the Foundation 1867-1870 ===\nAt this time the factory was only \"100 feet square and two stories high\"<ref name=\"court\">Records and Briefs of the United States Supreme Court, Volume 208</ref> and in 1868, Joseph L. Hall\u2019s eldest son Edward C. Hall, Sr. would enter full time employment in the firm as a clerk.\n\nOne of the firms earliest employees was Henry Gross and in 1869 he was granted a patent for a combination lock that would become known as the Hall Premier. This well-positioned Hall for competition against the leading lock manufacturers of the time Yale & Town Mfg. Co. and Sargent & Greenleaf. And he was up to the task as seen in a series of correspondence and news articles between Hall's and Sargent in regards to a lock-picking challenge instigated by [[James Sargent]] in 1870.\n\n=== Expanding the Company 1871-1880 ===\nFollowing the great Chicago fires of October 1871, Hall\u2019s safes were the only ones \u201cproven to be secure\u201d,<ref name=\"great\" /> protecting their contents inside through fires that lasted for as much as ten days. Hundreds of customer testimonials surfaced which Hall would use to his advantage in advertisements far and wide. As a result, the company began to grow immensely in both reputation and size and was known to be four times the capacity of similar factories<ref>\nCincinnati past and present, or, Its industrial history as exhibited in the life-labors of its leading men</ref>. By 1872 the firm had grown to 460 employees and produced between 20-25 safes per day.<ref>Whig and tribune. 3/2/1872</ref> And as of 1874 20% of new banks in the United states were using Hall\u2019s safes and \u2154 of bankers in Chicago were using Hall\u2019s Safes.<ref>Chicago Tribune March 11, 1874</ref>[[File:Factory---Burglar-Room-Cut.jpg|thumb|Cut of Burglar Room. Hall's Safe & Lock Co. Factory circa 1878]]\n\nIn 1874, Joseph L. Hall's third son, William H. Hall, would begin working for the firm in the Lock Department. By 1878 he would be in charge of the shipping department.\n\nDue to increasing litigation surrounding the safe and lock industry, Hall hired Milton Dalton in 1873 \"to pursue what must be one of the boldest and broadest acts of corporate espionage ever.\"<ref>American Genius: Nineteenth Century Bank Locks and Time Locks</ref> He set out to interview every active safe maker in the United States and Europe and managed to gather evidence detailing the development and progress of the industry in detail. The evidence in this book would help to prove that Hall held a patent for the use of conical bolts in safe manufacture that pre-dated safe maker MacNeale & Urban as detailed in a court case that began in 1875 and was decided in Hall's favor in 1883.\n\n[[File:Hall's Safe Mercantile Building Cincinnati.jpg|thumb|Hall's Safe & Lock Safe - Mercantile Building, Cincinnati, Ohio]]\n\nAccording to [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Ulysses S. Grant's]] papers, in 1875, Joseph L. Hall was in correspondence to acquire the President\u2019s farm in St. Louis as a possible new location for the factory. Though these talks bore no fruit and the seriousness of Joseph L. Hall\u2019s true interest in moving the factory is in doubt.<ref>The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant</ref>\n\nIn 1875 Hall\u2019s Safe & Lock Co. entered the nascent time lock business.\n\n=== Dominating the Industry 1880 - 1889 ===\nIn 1880, Joseph L. Hall created the Consolidated Time Lock company to house the time lock portion of his business. That same year the Berkshire Savings bank was sued by Yale for using a Consolidated time lock which Yale claimed infringed on its patent. In an unprecedented move at the time, Joseph L. Hall, knowing that Consolidated was the \"real party in interest\", petitioned the court to have Consolidated substituted as the defendant in the case. The case would eventually end up in the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1883 rumors again circulated that Hall\u2019s factory was going to move from Cincinnati. Joseph L. Hall dismissed these rumors stating that he never intended to move but always found the press about them tobe favorable advertisement.<ref>The Daily City News Jan 25, 1883</ref>\n\nThe Hall's Safe & Lock Co. factory continueto grow to over 8 acres.
