He made a number of appearances in dramatic roles, mainly recreations for radio of his own film roles, on programs like ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'' and ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]''. For six months in 1942, Wayne starred in his own radio adventure series, ''Three Sheets to the Wind'', produced by film director [[Tay Garnett]]. In the series, an international spy/detective show, Wayne played Dan O'Brien, a detective who used alcoholism as a mask for his investigatory endeavors. The show was intended by Garnett to be a pilot of sorts for a film version, though the motion picture never came to fruition. No episodes of the series featuring Wayne seem to have survived, though a demonstration episode with [[Brian Donlevy]] in the leading role does exist.

They conceived it as a Western that would bring the final curtain down on Hollywood Westerns. Stewart and Fonda both agreed to appear in it, but after long consideration, Wayne turned it down, citing his feeling that his character was more underdeveloped and uninteresting than those of his co-stars, which was largely based on John Ford's recommendation after perusing the script. The project was shelved for some twenty years, until McMurtry rewrote and expanded the original screenplay co-written with Bogdanovich to make the novel and subsequent TV miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in Wayne's role and [[Robert Duvall]] playing the part originally written for Stewart in the extremely popular miniseries.\n* [[Mel Brooks]] offered Wayne the role of the Waco Kid (eventually played by [[Gene Wilder]]) in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974). After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was \"too dirty\" for his family image, but told Brooks that he would be \"first in line\" to see the movie.<ref>Interview: [[Mel Brooks]].

Spielberg recalled, \"[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it.

While both men began performing on screen at the same time, the height of Gable's celebrity preceded Wayne's by approximately fifteen years.\n\n==Missed roles==\n* Wayne rebuffed the lead role in the 1952 film ''[[High Noon]]'' because he felt the film's story was an allegory against [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]], which he actively supported. In a 1971 interview, Wayne said he considered ''High Noon'' \"the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life\", and that he would \"never regret having helped run screenwriter [[Carl Foreman]], [who was later blacklisted] out of the country\".<ref name=davis/>{{rp|142}}\n* An urban legend has it that in 1955, Wayne turned down the role of Matt Dillon in the long-running television series ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' and recommended [[James Arness]] instead.

They conceived it as a Western that would bring the final curtain down on Hollywood Westerns. Stewart and Fonda both agreed to appear in it, but after long consideration, Wayne turned it down, citing his feeling that his character was more underdeveloped and uninteresting than those of his co-stars, which was largely based on John Ford's recommendation after perusing the script. The project was shelved for some twenty years, until McMurtry rewrote and expanded the original screenplay co-written with Bogdanovich to make the novel and subsequent TV miniseries ''[[Lonesome Dove]]'', with [[Tommy Lee Jones]] in Wayne's role and [[Robert Duvall]] playing the part originally written for Stewart in the extremely popular miniseries.\n* [[Mel Brooks]] offered Wayne the role of the Waco Kid (eventually played by [[Gene Wilder]]) in ''[[Blazing Saddles]]'' (1974). After reading the script Wayne declined, fearing the dialogue was \"too dirty\" for his family image, but told Brooks that he would be \"first in line\" to see the movie.<ref>Interview: [[Mel Brooks]].

After reading the script, Wayne decided not to participate due to ill health, but also urged Spielberg not to pursue the project. Both Wayne and Heston felt the film was unpatriotic. Spielberg recalled, \"[Wayne] was really curious and so I sent him the script. He called me the next day and said he felt it was a very un-American movie, and I shouldn't waste my time making it. He said, 'You know, that was an important war, and you're making fun of a war that cost thousands of lives at Pearl Harbor.

{"title_page": "Liar paradox", "text_new": "In [[philosophy]] and [[logic]], the classical '''liar paradox''' or '''liar's paradox''' or '''antinomy of the liar''' is the statement of a liar that he or she is lying: for instance, declaring that \"I am lying\". If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is telling the truth, which means the liar just lied. In \"this sentence is a lie\" the [[paradox]] is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the \"liar paradox\" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar making the statement. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary [[truth value]] leads to a [[contradiction]].\n\nIf \"this sentence is false\" is true, then it is false, but the sentence states that it is false, and if it is false, then it must be true, and so on. \n\n== History ==\nThe [[Epimenides paradox]] (circa 600 BC) has been suggested as an example of the liar paradox, but they are not logically equivalent. The semi-mythical [[Divination|seer]] [[Epimenides]], a [[Crete|Cretan]], reportedly stated that \"All Cretans are liars.\"<ref name=\"PaulTarsus\">Epimenides paradox has \"All Cretans are liars.\" {{bibleverse|Titus|1:12}}</ref> However, Epimenides' statement that all Cretans are liars can be resolved as false, given that he knows of at least one other Cretan who does not lie. It is precisely in order to avoid uncertainties deriving from the human factor and from fuzzy concepts that modern logicians proposed a \"strengthened\" liar such as the sentence \"this sentence is false\".{{cn|date=November 2018}} \n\nThe paradox's name translates as ''pseud\u00f3menos l\u00f3gos'' (\u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) in [[Ancient Greek]]. One version of the liar paradox is attributed to the [[history of Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Eubulides of Miletus]] who lived in the 4th century BC. Eubulides reportedly asked, \"A man says that he is lying. Is what he says true or false?\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://philosophy.about.com/od/Philosophical-Questions-Puzzle/a/Paradoxes-Of-Eubulides.htm |title=Paradoxes of Eubulides |publisher=About.com (New York Times)  |author=Andrea Borghini |accessdate=2012-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe paradox was once discussed by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] in a sermon:\n\n{{quote |\"[[Psalm 116|I said in my alarm, Every man is a liar!]]\" Is [[David]] telling the truth or is he lying? If it is true that every man is a liar, and David's statement, \"Every man is a liar\" is true, then David also is lying; he, too, is a man. But if he, too, is lying, his statement that \"Every man is a liar\", consequently is not true. Whatever way you turn the proposition, the conclusion is a contradiction. Since David himself is a man, it follows that he also is lying; but if he is lying because every man is a liar, his lying is of a different sort.<ref>St. Jerome, Homily on Psalm 115 (116B), translated by Sr. Marie Liguori Ewald, IHM, in The Homilies of Saint Jerome, Volume I (1-59 On the Psalms), The Fathers of the Church 48 (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1964), 294</ref>}}\n\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher [[Bhartrhari]] (late fifth century AD) was well aware of a liar paradox which he formulated as \"everything I am saying is false\" (sarvam mithy\u0101 brav\u012bmi). He analyzes this statement together with the paradox of \"unsignifiability\" and explores the boundary between statements that are unproblematic in daily life and paradoxes.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jan E.M.

Sentences can be constructed that cannot consistently be assigned a truth value even though they are completely in accord with [[grammar]] and [[semantic]] rules.\n\nThe simplest version of the paradox is the sentence:\n\n{{block indent |A: This statement (A) is false.}}\n\nIf (A) is true, then \"This statement is false\" is true. Therefore, (A) must be false. The hypothesis that (A) is true leads to the conclusion that (A) is false, a contradiction.\n\nIf (A) is false, then \"This statement is false\" is false. Therefore, (A) must be true. The hypothesis that (A) is false leads to the conclusion that (A) is true, another contradiction. Either way, (A) is both true and false, which is a paradox.\n\nHowever, that the liar sentence can be shown to be true if it is false and false if it is true has led some to conclude that it is \"neither true nor false\".<ref name=\"Andrew Irvine 1992\">Andrew Irvine, \"Gaps, Gluts, and Paradox\", ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'', supplementary vol. 18 [''Return of the A priori''] (1992), 273\u2013299</ref> This response to the paradox is, in effect, the rejection of the claim that every statement has to be either true or false, also known as the [[principle of bivalence]], a concept related to the [[law of the excluded middle]].\n\nThe proposal that the statement is neither true nor false has given rise to the following, strengthened version of the paradox:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is not true. (B)}}\n\nIf (B) is neither '''true''' nor false, then it must be not '''true'''. Since this is what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be '''true'''. Since initially (B) was not '''true''' and is now true, another paradox arises.\n\nAnother reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as [[Graham Priest]] has, that the statement is both true and false. Nevertheless, even Priest's analysis is susceptible to the following version of the liar:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is only false. (C)}}\n\nIf (C) is both '''true''' and false, then (C) is only false. But then, it is not '''true'''. Since initially (C) was '''true''' and is now not '''true''', it is a paradox. However, it has been argued that by adopting a [[Bivalent logic|two-valued]] relational semantics (as opposed to [[Truth function|functional semantics]]), the dialetheic approach can overcome this version of the Liar.<ref>{{cite journal|title=What is an Inconsistent Truth Table?|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=94 |issue=3 |page=7 |author=Zach Weber, Guillermo Badia and Patrick Girard |year=2015 |isbn= |doi=10.1080/00048402.2015.1093010 }}</ref>\n\nThere are also multi-sentence versions of the liar paradox. The following is the two-sentence version:\n\n{{block indent |The following statement is true. (D1)}}\n{{block indent |The preceding statement is false. (D2)}}\n\nAssume (D1) is true. Then (D2) is true. This would mean that (D1) is false. Therefore, (D1) is both true and false.\n\nAssume (D1) is false. Then (D2) is false. This would mean that (D1) is true. Thus (D1) is both true and false. Either way, (D1) is both true and false \u2013 the same paradox as (A) above.\n\nThe multi-sentence version of the liar paradox generalizes to any circular sequence of such statements (wherein the last statement asserts the truth/falsity of the first statement), provided there are an odd number of statements asserting the falsity of their successor; the following is a three-sentence version, with each statement asserting the falsity of its successor:\n\n{{block indent |E2 is false. (E1)}}\n{{block indent |E3 is false. (E2)}}\n{{block indent |E1 is false. (E3)}}\n\nAssume (E1) is true. Then (E2) is false, which means (E3) is true, and hence (E1) is false, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAssume (E1) is false. Then (E2) is true, which means (E3) is false, and hence (E1) is true. Either way, (E1) is both true and false \u2013 the same paradox as with (A) and (D1).\n\nThere are many other variants, and many complements, possible. In normal sentence construction, the simplest version of the complement is the sentence:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is true. (F)}}\n\nIf F is assumed to bear a truth value, then it presents the problem of determining the object of that value. But, a simpler version is possible, by assuming that the single word 'true' bears a truth value. The analogue to the paradox is to assume that the single word 'false' likewise bears a truth value, namely that it is false. This reveals that the paradox can be reduced to the mental act of assuming that the very idea of fallacy bears a truth value, namely that the very idea of fallacy is false: an act of misrepresentation. So, the symmetrical version of the paradox would be:\n\n{{block indent |The following statement is false. (G1)}}\n{{block indent |The preceding statement is false. (G2)}}\n\n==Possible resolutions==\n\n===Alfred Tarski===\n[[Alfred Tarski]] diagnosed the paradox as arising only in languages that are \"semantically closed\", by which he meant a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate truth (or falsehood) of another sentence in the same language (or even of itself). To avoid self-contradiction, it is necessary when discussing truth values to envision levels of languages, each of which can predicate truth (or falsehood) only of languages at a lower level. So, when one sentence refers to the truth-value of another, it is semantically higher. The sentence referred to is part of the \"object language\", while the referring sentence is considered to be a part of a \"meta-language\" with respect to the object language. It is legitimate for sentences in \"languages\" higher on the semantic hierarchy to refer to sentences lower in the \"language\" hierarchy, but not the other way around. This prevents a system from becoming self-referential.\n\nHowever, this system is incomplete. One would like to be able to make statements such as \"For every statement in level ''\u03b1'' of the hierarchy, there is a statement at level ''\u03b1''+1 which asserts that the first statement is false.\" This is a true, meaningful statement about the hierarchy that Tarski defines, but it refers to statements at every level of the hierarchy, so it must be above every level of the hierarchy, and is therefore not possible within the hierarchy (although bounded versions of the sentence are possible).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Arthur Prior===\n[[Arthur Prior]] asserts that there is nothing paradoxical about the liar paradox. His claim (which he attributes to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[John Buridan]]) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth. Thus, for example, the statement \"It is true that two plus two equals four\" contains no more information than the statement \"two plus two equals four\", because the phrase \"it is true that...\" is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase \"it is true that...\" is equivalent to \"this whole statement is true and ...\".\n\nThus the following two statements are equivalent:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is false.}}\n{{block indent |This statement is true and this statement is false.}}\n\nThe latter is a simple contradiction of the form \"A and not A\", and hence is false. There is therefore no paradox because the claim that this two-conjunct Liar is false does not lead to a contradiction. Eugene Mills<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mills | first1 = Eugene | year = 1998 | title = A simple solution to the Liar | url = | journal = Philosophical Studies | volume = 89 | issue = | pages = 197\u2013212 }}</ref> presents a similar answer. \n\n===Saul Kripke===\n[[Saul Kripke]] argued that whether a sentence is paradoxical or not can depend upon contingent facts.<ref name=\"Kripke1975\">{{cite journal |first=Saul |last=Kripke |author-link=Saul Kripke |year=1975 |title=An Outline of a Theory of Truth |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=72 |issue=19 |pages=690\u2013716 |doi=10.2307/2024634|jstor=2024634 }}</ref><ref name=\"Barwise1989\"/>{{rp|6}} If the only thing Smith says about Jones is\n\n{{block indent |A majority of what Jones says about me is false.}}\n\nand Jones says only these three things about Smith:\n\n{{block indent |Smith is a big spender.}}\n{{block indent |Smith is soft on crime.}}\n{{block indent |Everything Smith says about me is true.}}\n\nIf Smith really is a big spender but is ''not'' soft on crime, then both Smith's remark about Jones and Jones's last remark about Smith are paradoxical.\n\nKripke proposes a solution in the following manner. If a statement's truth value is ultimately tied up in some evaluable fact about the world, that statement is \"grounded\". If not, that statement is \"ungrounded\". Ungrounded statements do not have a truth value. Liar statements and liar-like statements are ungrounded, and therefore have no truth value.\n\n===Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy===\n[[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] propose that the liar sentence (which they interpret as synonymous with the Strengthened Liar) is ambiguous. They base this conclusion on a distinction they make between a \"denial\" and a \"negation\". If the liar means, \"It is not the case that this statement is true\", then it is denying itself. If it means, \"This statement is not true\", then it is negating itself. They go on to argue, based on [[situation semantics]], that the \"denial liar\" can be true without contradiction while the \"negation liar\" can be false without contradiction. Their 1987 book makes heavy use of [[non-well-founded set theory]].<ref name=\"Barwise1989\"/>\n\n===Dialetheism===\n[[Graham Priest]] and other logicians, including J. C. Beall and Bradley Armour-Garb, have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as [[dialetheism]]. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized [[principle of explosion]], which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism \u2013 the view that ''all'' propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle. Logics that reject it are called ''[[paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent]]''.\n\n===Non-cognitivism===\n[[Andrew David Irvine|Andrew Irvine]] has argued in favour of a non-cognitivist solution to the paradox, suggesting that some apparently well-formed sentences will turn out to be neither true nor false and that \"formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient\" for resolving the paradox.<ref name=\"Andrew Irvine 1992\"/>\n\n===Bhartrhari's perspectivism===\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher [[Bhartrhari]] (late fifth century AD) dealt with paradoxes such as the liar in a section of one of the chapters of his magnum opus the V\u0101kyapad\u012bya. Although chronologically he precedes all modern treatments of the problem of the liar paradox, it has only very recently become possible for those who cannot read the original Sanskrit sources to confront his views and analyses with those of modern logicians and philosophers because sufficiently reliable editions and translations of his work have only started becoming available since the second half of the 20th century. Bhartrhari's solution fits into his general approach to language, thought and reality, which has been characterized by some as \"relativistic\", \"non-committal\" or \"perspectivistic\".<ref>Jan E. M. Houben, \"Bhartrhari's Perspectivism (1)\" in ''Beyond Orientalism'' ed. by Eli Franco and Karin Preisendanz, Amsterdam \u2013 Atlanta: Rodopi, 1997; [[Madeleine Biardeau]] recognized that Bhartrhari \"wants to rise at once above all controversies by showing the conditions of possibility of any system of interpretation, rather than to prove the truth of a certain particular system\" (Th\u00e9orie de la connaissance et philosophie de la parole dans le brahmanisme classique, Paris \u2013 La Haye: Mouton, 1964, p. 263)</ref> With regard to the liar paradox (''sarvam mithy\u0101 bhav\u0101mi'' \"everything I am saying is false\") Bhartrhari identifies a hidden parameter which can change unproblematic situations in daily communication into a stubborn paradox. Bhartrhari's solution can be understood in terms of the solution proposed in 1992 by Julian Roberts: \"Paradoxes consume themselves. But we can keep apart the warring sides of the contradiction by the simple expedient of temporal contextualisation: what is 'true' with respect to one point in time need not be so in another ... The overall force of the 'Austinian' argument is not merely that 'things change', but that rationality is essentially temporal in that we need time in order to reconcile and manage what would otherwise be mutually destructive states.\"<ref>Roberts, Julian. 1992. ''The Logic of Reflection. German Philosophy in the Twentieth Century''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 43.</ref> According to Robert's suggestion, it is the factor \"time\" which allows us to reconcile the separated \"parts of the world\" that play a crucial role in the solution of Barwise and Etchemendy.<ref name=\"Barwise1989\"/>{{rp|188}} The capacity of time to prevent a direct confrontation of the two \"parts of the world\" is here external to the \"liar\". In the light of Bhartrhari's analysis, however, the extension in time which separates two perspectives on the world or two \"parts of the world\" \u2013 the part before and the part after the function accomplishes its task \u2013 is inherent in any \"function\": also the function to signify which underlies each statement, including the \"liar\".<ref name=JEMH2001/> The unsolvable paradox \u2013 a situation in which we have either contradiction (''virodha'') or infinite regress (''anavasth\u0101'') \u2013 arises, in case of the liar and other paradoxes such as the unsignifiability paradox ('''[[Bhartrhari's paradox]]'''), when abstraction is made from this function (''vy\u0101p\u0101ra'') and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (''apara vy\u0101p\u0101ra'') undoing the previous one.\n\n==Logical structure==\nFor a better understanding of the liar paradox, it is useful to write it down in a more formal way. If \"this statement is false\" is denoted by A and its truth value is being sought, it is necessary to find a condition that restricts the choice of possible truth values of A. Because A is [[Self-reference|self-referential]] it is possible to give the condition by an equation.\n\nIf some statement, B, is assumed to be false, one writes, \"B = false\". The statement (C) that the statement B is false would be written as \"C = 'B = false{{'\"}}. Now, the liar paradox can be expressed as the statement A, that A is false:\n\n{{block indent|1=A = \"A = false\"}}\n\nThis is an equation from which the truth value of A = \"this statement is false\" could hopefully be obtained. In the [[boolean domain]] \"A = false\" is equivalent to \"not A\" and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both \"true\" and \"false\". Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; [[Arthur Prior]] claims that the equation should be \"A = 'A = false and A = true{{'\"}} and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, \"I hear what he says; he says what I don't hear\", where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Yang | first = T.|title = Computational verb systems: The paradox of the liar | journal = International Journal of Intelligent Systems | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 1053\u20131067 | date = Sep 2001 | doi=10.1002/int.1049}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem===\n\n[[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] are two fundamental theorems of [[mathematical logic]] which state inherent limitations of sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems for mathematics. The theorems were proven by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] in 1931, and are important in the philosophy of mathematics. Roughly speaking, in proving the [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|first incompleteness theorem]], G\u00f6del used a modified version of the liar paradox, replacing \"this sentence is false\"  with \"this sentence is not provable\", called the \"G\u00f6del sentence G\". His proof showed that for any sufficiently powerful theory T, G is true, but not provable in T. The analysis of the truth and provability of G is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=978-0-19-888087-5 | pages=52\u201353 }}</ref>\n\nTo prove the first incompleteness theorem, G\u00f6del represented [[G\u00f6del numbering|statements by numbers]]. Then the theory at hand, which is assumed to prove certain facts about numbers, also proves facts about its own statements. Questions about the provability of statements are represented as questions about the properties of numbers, which would be decidable by the theory if it were complete. In these terms, the G\u00f6del sentence states that no natural number exists with a certain, strange property. A number with this property would encode a proof of the inconsistency of the theory. If there were such a number then the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to the consistency hypothesis. So, under the assumption that the theory is consistent, there is no such number.\n\nIt is not possible to replace \"not provable\" with \"false\" in a G\u00f6del sentence because the predicate \"Q is the G\u00f6del number of a false formula\" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], was discovered independently by G\u00f6del (when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem) and by [[Alfred Tarski]].\n\n[[George Boolos]] has since sketched an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses [[Berry's paradox]] rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe liar paradox is occasionally used in fiction to shut down artificial intelligences, who are presented as being unable to process the sentence. In ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[I, Mudd]]\", the liar paradox is used by [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Harry Mudd]] to confuse and ultimately disable an android holding them captive. In the 1973 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Green Death]]'', the Doctor temporarily stumps the insane computer BOSS by asking it \"If I were to tell you that the next thing I say would be true, but the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?\" However BOSS eventually decides the question is irrelevant and summons security.\n\nIn the 2011 videogame ''[[Portal 2]]'', [[GLaDOS]] attempts to use the \"this sentence is false\" paradox to defeat the na\u00efve artificial intelligence [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]], but, lacking the intelligence to realize the statement a paradox, he simply responds, \"Um, true. I'll go with true. There, that was easy.\" and is unaffected.\n\nIn the seventh episode of ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'' titled \"Access Denied\" the main character Jesse and his friends are captured by a supercomputer named PAMA. After PAMA controls two of Jesse's friends, Jesse learns that PAMA stalls when processing and uses a paradox to confuse him and escape with his last friend. One of the paradoxes the player can make him say is the liar paradox.\n\nIn [[Douglas Adams]] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', chapter 21 he describes a solitary old man inhabiting a small asteroid in the spatial coordinates where it should have been a whole planet dedicated to Biro ([[ballpoint pen]]) life forms.

The song is widely believed to be written as part of Keen's feud with Toby Keith, who is presumably the \"liar\" Keen refers to.<ref>\"Fightin' Words: Robert Earl Keen v.

If the liar is indeed lying, then the liar is telling the truth, which means the liar just lied. In \"this sentence is a lie\" the [[paradox]] is strengthened in order to make it amenable to more rigorous logical analysis. It is still generally called the \"liar paradox\" although abstraction is made precisely from the liar making the statement. Trying to assign to this statement, the strengthened liar, a classical binary [[truth value]] leads to a [[contradiction]].\n\nIf \"this sentence is false\" is true, then it is false, but the sentence states that it is false, and if it is false, then it must be true, and so on. \n\n== History ==\nThe [[Epimenides paradox]] (circa 600 BC) has been suggested as an example of the liar paradox, but they are not logically equivalent. The semi-mythical [[Divination|seer]] [[Epimenides]], a [[Crete|Cretan]], reportedly stated that \"All Cretans are liars.\"<ref name=\"PaulTarsus\">Epimenides paradox has \"All Cretans are liars.\" {{bibleverse|Titus|1:12}}</ref> However, Epimenides' statement that all Cretans are liars can be resolved as false, given that he knows of at least one other Cretan who does not lie. It is precisely in order to avoid uncertainties deriving from the human factor and from fuzzy concepts that modern logicians proposed a \"strengthened\" liar such as the sentence \"this sentence is false\".{{cn|date=November 2018}} \n\nThe paradox's name translates as ''pseud\u00f3menos l\u00f3gos'' (\u03c8\u03b5\u03c5\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2) in [[Ancient Greek]]. One version of the liar paradox is attributed to the [[history of Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Eubulides of Miletus]] who lived in the 4th century BC. Eubulides reportedly asked, \"A man says that he is lying. Is what he says true or false?\"<ref>{{cite web| url=http://philosophy.about.com/od/Philosophical-Questions-Puzzle/a/Paradoxes-Of-Eubulides.htm |title=Paradoxes of Eubulides |publisher=About.com (New York Times)  |author=Andrea Borghini |accessdate=2012-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe paradox was once discussed by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] in a sermon:\n\n{{quote |\"[[Psalm 116|I said in my alarm, Every man is a liar!]]\" Is [[David]] telling the truth or is he lying? If it is true that every man is a liar, and David's statement, \"Every man is a liar\" is true, then David also is lying; he, too, is a man. But if he, too, is lying, his statement that \"Every man is a liar\", consequently is not true. Whatever way you turn the proposition, the conclusion is a contradiction. Since David himself is a man, it follows that he also is lying; but if he is lying because every man is a liar, his lying is of a different sort.<ref>St. Jerome, Homily on Psalm 115 (116B), translated by Sr. Marie Liguori Ewald, IHM, in The Homilies of Saint Jerome, Volume I (1-59 On the Psalms), The Fathers of the Church 48 (Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1964), 294</ref>}}\n\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher [[Bhartrhari]] (late fifth century AD) was well aware of a liar paradox which he formulated as \"everything I am saying is false\" (sarvam mithy\u0101 brav\u012bmi).

Sentences can be constructed that cannot consistently be assigned a truth value even though they are completely in accord with [[grammar]] and [[semantic]] rules.\n\nThe simplest version of the paradox is the sentence:\n\n{{block indent |A: This statement (A) is false.}}\n\nIf (A) is true, then \"This statement is false\" is true. Therefore, (A) must be false. The hypothesis that (A) is true leads to the conclusion that (A) is false, a contradiction.\n\nIf (A) is false, then \"This statement is false\" is false. Therefore, (A) must be true. The hypothesis that (A) is false leads to the conclusion that (A) is true, another contradiction. Either way, (A) is both true and false, which is a paradox.\n\nHowever, that the liar sentence can be shown to be true if it is false and false if it is true has led some to conclude that it is \"neither true nor false\".<ref name=\"Andrew Irvine 1992\">Andrew Irvine, \"Gaps, Gluts, and Paradox\", ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'', supplementary vol. 18 [''Return of the A priori''] (1992), 273\u2013299</ref> This response to the paradox is, in effect, the rejection of the claim that every statement has to be either true or false, also known as the [[principle of bivalence]], a concept related to the [[law of the excluded middle]].\n\nThe proposal that the statement is neither true nor false has given rise to the following, strengthened version of the paradox:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is not true. (B)}}\n\nIf (B) is neither '''true''' nor false, then it must be not '''true'''. Since this is what (B) itself states, it means that (B) must be '''true'''. Since initially (B) was not '''true''' and is now true, another paradox arises.\n\nAnother reaction to the paradox of (A) is to posit, as [[Graham Priest]] has, that the statement is both true and false. Nevertheless, even Priest's analysis is susceptible to the following version of the liar:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is only false. (C)}}\n\nIf (C) is both '''true''' and false, then (C) is only false. But then, it is not '''true'''. Since initially (C) was '''true''' and is now not '''true''', it is a paradox. However, it has been argued that by adopting a [[Bivalent logic|two-valued]] relational semantics (as opposed to [[Truth function|functional semantics]]), the dialetheic approach can overcome this version of the Liar.<ref>{{cite journal|title=What is an Inconsistent Truth Table?|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy |volume=94 |issue=3 |page=7 |author=Zach Weber, Guillermo Badia and Patrick Girard |year=2015 |isbn= |doi=10.1080/00048402.2015.1093010 }}</ref>\n\nThere are also multi-sentence versions of the liar paradox. The following is the two-sentence version:\n\n{{block indent |The following statement is true. (D1)}}\n{{block indent |The preceding statement is false. (D2)}}\n\nAssume (D1) is true. Then (D2) is true. This would mean that (D1) is false. Therefore, (D1) is both true and false.\n\nAssume (D1) is false. Then (D2) is false. This would mean that (D1) is true. Thus (D1) is both true and false. Either way, (D1) is both true and false \u2013 the same paradox as (A) above.\n\nThe multi-sentence version of the liar paradox generalizes to any circular sequence of such statements (wherein the last statement asserts the truth/falsity of the first statement), provided there are an odd number of statements asserting the falsity of their successor; the following is a three-sentence version, with each statement asserting the falsity of its successor:\n\n{{block indent |E2 is false. (E1)}}\n{{block indent |E3 is false. (E2)}}\n{{block indent |E1 is false. (E3)}}\n\nAssume (E1) is true. Then (E2) is false, which means (E3) is true, and hence (E1) is false, leading to a contradiction.\n\nAssume (E1) is false. Then (E2) is true, which means (E3) is false, and hence (E1) is true. Either way, (E1) is both true and false \u2013 the same paradox as with (A) and (D1).\n\nThere are many other variants, and many complements, possible. In normal sentence construction, the simplest version of the complement is the sentence:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is true. (F)}}\n\nIf F is assumed to bear a truth value, then it presents the problem of determining the object of that value. But, a simpler version is possible, by assuming that the single word 'true' bears a truth value. The analogue to the paradox is to assume that the single word 'false' likewise bears a truth value, namely that it is false. This reveals that the paradox can be reduced to the mental act of assuming that the very idea of fallacy bears a truth value, namely that the very idea of fallacy is false: an act of misrepresentation. So, the symmetrical version of the paradox would be:\n\n{{block indent |The following statement is false. (G1)}}\n{{block indent |The preceding statement is false. (G2)}}\n\n==Possible resolutions==\n\n===Alfred Tarski===\n[[Alfred Tarski]] diagnosed the paradox as arising only in languages that are \"semantically closed\", by which he meant a language in which it is possible for one sentence to predicate truth (or falsehood) of another sentence in the same language (or even of itself). To avoid self-contradiction, it is necessary when discussing truth values to envision levels of languages, each of which can predicate truth (or falsehood) only of languages at a lower level. So, when one sentence refers to the truth-value of another, it is semantically higher. The sentence referred to is part of the \"object language\", while the referring sentence is considered to be a part of a \"meta-language\" with respect to the object language. It is legitimate for sentences in \"languages\" higher on the semantic hierarchy to refer to sentences lower in the \"language\" hierarchy, but not the other way around. This prevents a system from becoming self-referential.\n\nHowever, this system is incomplete. One would like to be able to make statements such as \"For every statement in level ''\u03b1'' of the hierarchy, there is a statement at level ''\u03b1''+1 which asserts that the first statement is false.\" This is a true, meaningful statement about the hierarchy that Tarski defines, but it refers to statements at every level of the hierarchy, so it must be above every level of the hierarchy, and is therefore not possible within the hierarchy (although bounded versions of the sentence are possible).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Arthur Prior===\n[[Arthur Prior]] asserts that there is nothing paradoxical about the liar paradox. His claim (which he attributes to [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[John Buridan]]) is that every statement includes an implicit assertion of its own truth. Thus, for example, the statement \"It is true that two plus two equals four\" contains no more information than the statement \"two plus two equals four\", because the phrase \"it is true that...\" is always implicitly there. And in the self-referential spirit of the Liar Paradox, the phrase \"it is true that...\" is equivalent to \"this whole statement is true and ...\".\n\nThus the following two statements are equivalent:\n\n{{block indent |This statement is false.}}\n{{block indent |This statement is true and this statement is false.}}\n\nThe latter is a simple contradiction of the form \"A and not A\", and hence is false. There is therefore no paradox because the claim that this two-conjunct Liar is false does not lead to a contradiction. Eugene Mills<ref>Mills, Eugene (1998). \"A simple solution to the Liar\". ''Philosophical Studies'' 89: 197\u2013212.</ref> presents a similar answer. \n\n===Saul Kripke===\n[[Saul Kripke]] argued that whether a sentence is paradoxical or not can depend upon contingent facts.<ref name=\"Kripke1975\">{{cite journal |first=Saul |last=Kripke |author-link=Saul Kripke |year=1975 |title=An Outline of a Theory of Truth |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=72 |issue=19 |pages=690\u2013716 |doi=10.2307/2024634|jstor=2024634 }}</ref><ref name=\"Barwise1989\"/>{{rp|6}} If the only thing Smith says about Jones is\n\n{{block indent |A majority of what Jones says about me is false.}}\n\nand Jones says only these three things about Smith:\n\n{{block indent |Smith is a big spender.}}\n{{block indent |Smith is soft on crime.}}\n{{block indent |Everything Smith says about me is true.}}\n\nIf Smith really is a big spender but is ''not'' soft on crime, then both Smith's remark about Jones and Jones's last remark about Smith are paradoxical.\n\nKripke proposes a solution in the following manner. If a statement's truth value is ultimately tied up in some evaluable fact about the world, that statement is \"grounded\". If not, that statement is \"ungrounded\". Ungrounded statements do not have a truth value. Liar statements and liar-like statements are ungrounded, and therefore have no truth value.\n\n===Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy===\n[[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] propose that the liar sentence (which they interpret as synonymous with the Strengthened Liar) is ambiguous. They base this conclusion on a distinction they make between a \"denial\" and a \"negation\". If the liar means, \"It is not the case that this statement is true\", then it is denying itself. If it means, \"This statement is not true\", then it is negating itself. They go on to argue, based on [[situation semantics]], that the \"denial liar\" can be true without contradiction while the \"negation liar\" can be false without contradiction. Their 1987 book makes heavy use of [[non-well-founded set theory]].<ref name=\"Barwise1989\"/>\n\n===Dialetheism===\n[[Graham Priest]] and other logicians, including J. C. Beall and Bradley Armour-Garb, have proposed that the liar sentence should be considered to be both true and false, a point of view known as [[dialetheism]]. Dialetheism is the view that there are true contradictions. Dialetheism raises its own problems. Chief among these is that since dialetheism recognizes the liar paradox, an intrinsic contradiction, as being true, it must discard the long-recognized [[principle of explosion]], which asserts that any proposition can be deduced from a contradiction, unless the dialetheist is willing to accept trivialism \u2013 the view that ''all'' propositions are true. Since trivialism is an intuitively false view, dialetheists nearly always reject the explosion principle. Logics that reject it are called ''[[paraconsistent logic|paraconsistent]]''.\n\n===Non-cognitivism===\n[[Andrew David Irvine|Andrew Irvine]] has argued in favour of a non-cognitivist solution to the paradox, suggesting that some apparently well-formed sentences will turn out to be neither true nor false and that \"formal criteria alone will inevitably prove insufficient\" for resolving the paradox.<ref name=\"Andrew Irvine 1992\"/>\n\n===Bhartrhari's perspectivism===\nThe Indian grammarian-philosopher [[Bhartrhari]] (late fifth century AD) dealt with paradoxes such as the liar in a section of one of the chapters of his magnum opus the V\u0101kyapad\u012bya. Although chronologically he precedes all modern treatments of the problem of the liar paradox, it has only very recently become possible for those who cannot read the original Sanskrit sources to confront his views and analyses with those of modern logicians and philosophers because sufficiently reliable editions and translations of his work have only started becoming available since the second half of the 20th century. Bhartrhari's solution fits into his general approach to language, thought and reality, which has been characterized by some as \"relativistic\", \"non-committal\" or \"perspectivistic\".<ref>Jan E. M. Houben, \"Bhartrhari's Perspectivism (1)\" in ''Beyond Orientalism'' ed. by Eli Franco and Karin Preisendanz, Amsterdam \u2013 Atlanta: Rodopi, 1997; [[Madeleine Biardeau]] recognized that Bhartrhari \"wants to rise at once above all controversies by showing the conditions of possibility of any system of interpretation, rather than to prove the truth of a certain particular system\" (Th\u00e9orie de la connaissance et philosophie de la parole dans le brahmanisme classique, Paris \u2013 La Haye: Mouton, 1964, p. 263)</ref> With regard to the liar paradox (''sarvam mithy\u0101 bhav\u0101mi'' \"everything I am saying is false\") Bhartrhari identifies a hidden parameter which can change unproblematic situations in daily communication into a stubborn paradox. Bhartrhari's solution can be understood in terms of the solution proposed in 1992 by Julian Roberts: \"Paradoxes consume themselves. But we can keep apart the warring sides of the contradiction by the simple expedient of temporal contextualisation: what is 'true' with respect to one point in time need not be so in another ... The overall force of the 'Austinian' argument is not merely that 'things change', but that rationality is essentially temporal in that we need time in order to reconcile and manage what would otherwise be mutually destructive states.\"<ref>Roberts, Julian. 1992. ''The Logic of Reflection. German Philosophy in the Twentieth Century''. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. p. 43.</ref> According to Robert's suggestion, it is the factor \"time\" which allows us to reconcile the separated \"parts of the world\" that play a crucial role in the solution of Barwise and Etchemendy.<ref name=\"Barwise1989\"/>{{rp|188}} The capacity of time to prevent a direct confrontation of the two \"parts of the world\" is here external to the \"liar\". In the light of Bhartrhari's analysis, however, the extension in time which separates two perspectives on the world or two \"parts of the world\" \u2013 the part before and the part after the function accomplishes its task \u2013 is inherent in any \"function\": also the function to signify which underlies each statement, including the \"liar\".<ref name=JEMH2001/> The unsolvable paradox \u2013 a situation in which we have either contradiction (''virodha'') or infinite regress (''anavasth\u0101'') \u2013 arises, in case of the liar and other paradoxes such as the unsignifiability paradox ('''[[Bhartrhari's paradox]]'''), when abstraction is made from this function (''vy\u0101p\u0101ra'') and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (''apara vy\u0101p\u0101ra'') undoing the previous one.\n\n==Logical structure==\nFor a better understanding of the liar paradox, it is useful to write it down in a more formal way. If \"this statement is false\" is denoted by A and its truth value is being sought, it is necessary to find a condition that restricts the choice of possible truth values of A. Because A is [[Self-reference|self-referential]] it is possible to give the condition by an equation.\n\nIf some statement, B, is assumed to be false, one writes, \"B = false\". The statement (C) that the statement B is false would be written as \"C = 'B = false{{'\"}}. Now, the liar paradox can be expressed as the statement A, that A is false:\n\n{{block indent|1=A = \"A = false\"}}\n\nThis is an equation from which the truth value of A = \"this statement is false\" could hopefully be obtained. In the [[boolean domain]] \"A = false\" is equivalent to \"not A\" and therefore the equation is not solvable. This is the motivation for reinterpretation of A. The simplest logical approach to make the equation solvable is the dialetheistic approach, in which case the solution is A being both \"true\" and \"false\". Other resolutions mostly include some modifications of the equation; [[Arthur Prior]] claims that the equation should be \"A = 'A = false and A = true{{'\"}} and therefore A is false. In computational verb logic, the liar paradox is extended to statements like, \"I hear what he says; he says what I don't hear\", where verb logic must be used to resolve the paradox.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Yang | first = T.|title = Computational verb systems: The paradox of the liar | journal = International Journal of Intelligent Systems | volume = 16 | issue = 9 | pages = 1053\u20131067 | date = Sep 2001 | doi=10.1002/int.1049}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem===\n\n[[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]] are two fundamental theorems of [[mathematical logic]] which state inherent limitations of sufficiently powerful axiomatic systems for mathematics. The theorems were proven by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] in 1931, and are important in the philosophy of mathematics. Roughly speaking, in proving the [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems|first incompleteness theorem]], G\u00f6del used a modified version of the liar paradox, replacing \"this sentence is false\"  with \"this sentence is not provable\", called the \"G\u00f6del sentence G\". His proof showed that for any sufficiently powerful theory T, G is true, but not provable in T. The analysis of the truth and provability of G is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=978-0-19-888087-5 | pages=52\u201353 }}</ref>\n\nTo prove the first incompleteness theorem, G\u00f6del represented [[G\u00f6del numbering|statements by numbers]]. Then the theory at hand, which is assumed to prove certain facts about numbers, also proves facts about its own statements. Questions about the provability of statements are represented as questions about the properties of numbers, which would be decidable by the theory if it were complete. In these terms, the G\u00f6del sentence states that no natural number exists with a certain, strange property. A number with this property would encode a proof of the inconsistency of the theory. If there were such a number then the theory would be inconsistent, contrary to the consistency hypothesis. So, under the assumption that the theory is consistent, there is no such number.\n\nIt is not possible to replace \"not provable\" with \"false\" in a G\u00f6del sentence because the predicate \"Q is the G\u00f6del number of a false formula\" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as [[Tarski's undefinability theorem]], was discovered independently by G\u00f6del (when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem) and by [[Alfred Tarski]].\n\n[[George Boolos]] has since sketched an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses [[Berry's paradox]] rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula.\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe liar paradox is occasionally used in fiction to shut down artificial intelligences, who are presented as being unable to process the sentence. In ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[I, Mudd]]\", the liar paradox is used by [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Harry Mudd]] to confuse and ultimately disable an android holding them captive. In the 1973 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Green Death]]'', the Doctor temporarily stumps the insane computer BOSS by asking it \"If I were to tell you that the next thing I say would be true, but the last thing I said was a lie, would you believe me?\" However BOSS eventually decides the question is irrelevant and summons security.\n\nIn the 2011 videogame ''[[Portal 2]]'', [[GLaDOS]] attempts to use the \"this sentence is false\" paradox to defeat the na\u00efve artificial intelligence [[Wheatley (Portal)|Wheatley]], but, lacking the intelligence to realize the statement a paradox, he simply responds, \"Um, true. I'll go with true. There, that was easy.\" and is unaffected.\n\nIn the seventh episode of ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]'' titled \"Access Denied\" the main character Jesse and his friends are captured by a supercomputer named PAMA. After PAMA controls two of Jesse's friends, Jesse learns that PAMA stalls when processing and uses a paradox to confuse him and escape with his last friend. One of the paradoxes the player can make him say is the liar paradox.\n\nIn [[Douglas Adams]] ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (novel)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', chapter 21 he describes a solitary old man inhabiting a small asteroid in the spatial coordinates where it should have been a whole planet dedicated to Biro ([[ballpoint pen]]) life forms. This old man repeatedly claimed that nothing was true, though he was later discovered to be lying.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Ggalaxy |last=Adams |first=Douglas |isbn=978-0517542095 |edition=1st American |location=New York |oclc=6251440 |year=1980 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/hitchhikersguide00doug_0 }}</ref>\n\n[[Rollins Band]]'s 1994 song \"[[Liar (Rollins Band song)|Liar]]\" alluded to the paradox when the narrator ends the song by stating \"I'll lie again and again and I'll keep lying, I promise\".\n\nRobert Earl Keen's song \"The Road Goes On and On\" alludes to the paradox. The song is widely believed to be written as part of Keen's feud with Toby Keith, who is presumably the \"liar\" Keen refers to.<ref>\"Fightin' Words: Robert Earl Keen v.

In the 1959\u201360 season, he appeared as Robertson in the [[NBC]] espionage series ''[[Five Fingers (TV series)|Five Fingers]],'' starring with [[David Hedison]].\n\nAfter ''Five Fingers'' Burke was cast in the lead role of the police show ''Naked City,'' in which he appeared as Adam Flint from 1960 to 1963. Burke then appeared in the starring role of Captain (later Maj., then Col.) Joe Gallagher on ''12 O'Clock High'' between 1964 and 1967, during which time he met his wife, Lyn. The ''12 O'Clock High'' role was Burke's last lead television role.\n\nIn 1967, Burke starred in the film ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]'' as Lyon Burke, the young lawyer who befriended all three female stars and had a tempestuous relationship with Anne Welles. He also played a police officer who pursued a bank thief played by [[Steve McQueen]] in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]''.<ref name=burke/>\n\nDuring the 1970s he appeared in three episodes each of ABC's ''[[The Love Boat]]'' and [[CBS]]'s ''[[Medical Center (TV series)|Medical Center]].''

Travel agencies can provide [[outdoor recreation]] activities, [[airline]]s, [[car rental]]s, [[cruise line]]s, [[hotel]]s, [[Rail transport|railways]], [[travel insurance]], [[package tour]]s, [[insurance]], [[guide book]]s, [[public transport timetable]]s, [[car rental]]s, and [[bureau de change]] services. Travel agencies can also serve as [[General sales agent (airlines)|general sales agent]]s for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency's main function is to act as an [[agent (law)|agent]], selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier.
