It was officially designated the 638th Infantry Regiment (''Infanterieregiment 638''). \n\nCreated in July 1941, the LVF gathered various French collaborationist parties including [[Marcel Bucard]]'s ''[[Mouvement Franciste]]'', [[Marcel D\u00e9at]]'s [[National Popular Rally]], [[Jacques Doriot]]'s [[French Popular Party]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Deloncle]]'s [[Social Revolutionary Movement]], [[Pierre Cl\u00e9menti (politician)|Pierre Cl\u00e9menti]]'s [[French National-Collectivist Party]] and [[Pierre Costantini]]'s [[French League]].

It became part of the [[Waffen-SS]] in July 1944 and was officially disbanded in September 1944 by which time [[Liberation of France|most of France had been Liberated by the Western Allies]]. It was replaced by a short-lived [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)|SS \"Charlemagne\" Waffen-Grenadier Brigade]].\n\n== Formation ==\n===Vichy, collaborationism and the German occupation===\nAlong with the United Kingdom, [[French Third Republic|France]] declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939. It was invaded and occupied in May\u2013June 1940 after [[Battle of France|a disastrous military campaign]] which pre-war critics of the country's republican regime attributed to the failure of [[democracy]] and the corrupting influence of [[communism]], [[freemasonry]] and [[Jews]]. These were the organising principles of the \"[[National Revolution]]\" declared by the authoritarian [[Vichy France|Vichy administration]] under Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]]. However, the Vichy regime could not control large parts of France under [[German occupation of France during World War II|France under direct German occupation]] and was challenged by more extreme right-wing political factions (''groupuscules'') which often shared a more explicitly [[Nazism|Nazi]] and pro-German ideology than Vichy. The three main factions which emerged as leading proponents of [[Collaboration with Axis Powers|collaborationism]] were [[Marcel D\u00e9at]]'s [[National Popular Rally]], [[Jacques Doriot]]'s [[French Popular Party]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Deloncle]]'s [[Social Revolutionary Movement]].{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=29}} These groups looked to German support for their influence.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=31}} \n\nThe Vichy regime, though a [[puppet state]], considered itself to be [[neutral]] and not part of an alliance with Germany. However, German overtures to collaborationist factions placed great pressure on Vichy to change this stance and encouraged deep suspicion in P\u00e9tain's entourage.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=31}} The [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] began in June 1941 and had great political significance in France, especially for the collaborationist groups who sought an opportunity to consolidate German support.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=32}}\n\n===Origins of the LVF===\nThe exact origins of the Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism (LVF) are unclear. However, it is generally believed that Doriot was first to suggest a French unit for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] within days of the invasion.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=32}} Permission was sought both from the Vichy authorities and the German ambassador [[Otto Abetz]]. The Nazi authorities approved the unit's creation in July 1941 but limited its size to 10,000 men which was much smaller than the 30,000 that Doriot and his supporters had proposed. The historian Owen Anthony Davey argued that the reason for this was that \"the prospect of 30,000 armed French fanatics must have been frightening even to the Germans\".{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=33}} Doriot, D\u00e9at,and Deloncle as well as [[Pierre Costantini]]'s [[French League]] and [[Jean Boissel]]'s Frankish Front agreed to work together to find recruits for the unit and a structure was created for the LVF to recruit and advertise its existence.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=33}} Respected figures from France's intelligentsia and [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]] were brought in to provide more respectability.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=34}} However, the Vichy regime opposed the idea and hindered recruitment in the \"[[Zone libre|free zone]]\" it controlled.\n\n===Recruitment and training===\nBy July 1941, the LVF was recruiting and fundraising actively in France. Its propaganda emphasised the LVF's role in a European \"crusade\" against communism, drawing from France's medieval history and making little mention of Germany. In some cases, its recruitment offices were stationed in expropriated Jewish houses.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=36}} However, recruitment remained poor and struggled to recruit more than 3,000 men in its initial phase.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=37}} Attempts were made to recruit former soldiers from the [[French prisoners of war in World War II|large numbers of prisoners of war in Germany]], though the Germans also attempted to limit recruitment to ensure more pressure was kept on Vichy.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=38}} As Davey noted:\n{{quote|Such organizations were to serve the diplomatic interests of the Reich, not the interests of a nationalist revival in France. If the Legion had ever become truly popular, German support would in all probability have waned or been withdrawn. The limitation on the size of the Legion was an early indication of the restrictive German attitude towards the growth of collaborationist power. No collaborationist leader would ever receive German support for a nationalist movement in France. The LVF, like all their other enterprises, was destined for failure at the moment of birth.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=40}}}}\n\nThe first contingent of recruits was assembled for a public parade on 27 August 1941. At the ceremonies, P\u00e9tain's deputy [[Pierre Laval]] and D\u00e9at were shot and wounded in an attempted assassination by a follower of Deloncle.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=40}} The following day, German Army doctors rejected almost half of the LVF's recruits on medical grounds.{{sfn|Davey|1971|p=41}} The recruits had been promised that they would fight in French uniforms but, amid continuing Vichy hostility, were folded into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] (''Wehrmacht''). Its soldiers wore standard ''Wehrmacht'' uniform with an LVF shield on the right upper arm with the colors of the French flag with the word \"France\" or LVF.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|pp=146, 147}} It was designated the 638th Infantry Regiment (''Infanterieregiment 638'') and was created as an [[infantry]] unit. It was given basic training near [[Warsaw]] in the [[General Government]] in October 1941.\n\n== Operational history ==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-141-1258-08, Russland-Mitte, Soldaten der franz\u00f6sischen Legion, Hans G\u00fcnter v. Kluge.jpg|thumb|left|Field Marshal [[Hans G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] visits the regiment in November 1941]]\nBy October 1941, there were two battalions of 2,271 men which had 181 officers and an additional staff of 35 German officers. They fought in [[Soviet Union]] as part of the foreign contingent of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. They were sent into combat near [[Battle of Moscow|Moscow in November 1941]] as part of the 7th Infantry Division. The LVF lost half their men in action or through frostbite.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|p=149}} In 1942 the men were assigned to ''[[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung]]'' (so-called \"bandit-fighting\" against partisans, their supporters and killing Jews) in [[German occupation of Byelorussia during World War II|German-occupied Byelorussia]] (modern-day [[Belarus]]). At the same time, another unit was formed in France, ''La L\u00e9gion Tricolore'' (Tricolor Legion) but this unit was absorbed into the LVF six months later.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|pp=149, 150, 155\u2013157}}\n\nDuring the spring of 1942, the LVF was reorganized with only the 1st and 3rd battalions. The LVF's French commander, Colonel Roger Labonne, was relieved in mid-1942, and the unit was attached to various German divisions until June 1943 when Colonel [[Edgar Puaud]] took command.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|pp=149, 157}} The two independent battalions were again united in a single regiment and continued fighting partisans, killing partisan supporters and Jews in [[Ukraine]]. Historian Jeff Rutherford claims that \"Whilst the Wehrmacht focused on the Red Army, SD and other SS formations would combat any resistance movements in the rear. In effect, the German Army willingly ensnared itself in the Nazi machinery of annihilation and extermination by working with the SS to systematically suppress partisan movements and other forms of perceived resistance.\"{{sfn|Rutherford|2010|p=61}} Historian Timothy Snyder asserts that by the second half of 1942, \"German anti-partisan operations were all but indistinguishable from the mass murder of the Jews.\"{{sfn|Snyder|2010|p=240}} In early 1944, the unit again took part in rear-security operations. In June 1944, as [[Army Group Centre]]'s front collapsed under the [[Red Army]]'s [[Operation Bagration|summer offensive]], the LVF was attached to the [[4th SS Police Regiment]] and fought in a delaying action.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|p=157}}\n\nA new recruiting drive in [[Vichy France]] attracted 3,000 applicants, mostly members of the ''[[Milice]]'' and university students.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|p=159}} The new formation was known as the 8th ''SS Volunteer Sturmbrigade France''. On 1 September 1944, the Legion of French Volunteers was officially disbanded. A new unit, the ''Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade der SS \"Charlemagne\"'', was formed out of the remnants of the LVF and French ''Sturmbrigade'', which was also disbanded. In February 1945, the ''Waffen-Grenadier-Brigade'' was officially upgraded to a [[division (military)|division]] and became the [[33rd Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Charlemagne (1st French)]]. At that time it had a strength of 7,340 men.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|pp=170, 172}} SS Division Charlemagne members participated in the [[Battle in Berlin]].{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|p=173}} Reduced to approximately thirty men, most French SS men surrendered near the Potsdamer rail station to the Red Army.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=330}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Giolitto, Pierre (2007).

At that time it had a strength of 7,340 men.{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|pp=170, 172}} SS Division Charlemagne members participated in the [[Battle in Berlin]].{{sfn|Littlejohn|1987|p=173}} Reduced to approximately thirty men, most French SS men surrendered near the Potsdamer rail station to the Red Army.{{sfn|McNab|2013|p=330}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Giolitto, Pierre (2007).

Several near-identical ride designs are also produced by other companies; '''Musik Express''' by Italian company [[Bertazzon]] and US Majestic Rides, '''Himalaya''' by American company Wisdom Rides,\nGerman company Mack, and French company Reverchon, and '''Silver Streak''' by Wisdom Rides. This ride is a modern adaption of the famous [[Harry Traver]] [[Caterpillar ride]]s.\n\n==Design and operation==\nThe ride features twenty 3-passenger cars connected in a circle. These cars rotate on a track with alternating sloped and flat sections. Rotation is possible in both a backward and forward direction, as the ride is manually operated. The ride is powered by 4 DC motors, and can reach a maximum speed of 12 revolutions per minute. (Certain older models have a hydraulic tire/rim drive and they have a tendency to go faster).\n\nThe riders in each car are restrained by a single solid lap bar that is locked across the body of the car, making the ride unsuitable for young children or people of short stature. The bar must be manually locked or unlocked, and only locks in one position. Lights and music are also controlled by the operator, which (as the name suggests) contribute heavily to the ride experience. After a certain amount of rotations or minutes, the ride operator will be alerted by the control box that the speed is going to increase, usually by a light on the box. At that time the operator will speak on a microphone asking the riders if they would like to go faster. Sometimes the ride operator can do this earlier than the alert light to build suspense. After a minute or two of faster speed, the ride will then slow down, and the operator can then ask the riders if they would like to go backwards. The speed up element is then repeated again only done in reverse. The Most parks and carnivals require all riders to be at least 42&nbsp;inches or even taller, depending on circumstances and ride design.\n\nMost Musik Expresses are built with a backdrop dividing the rear third of the ride from the front two-thirds. This backdrop, normally covered in artwork and lights, and providing a mild [[Headchopper (coaster element)|headchopper]]-like effect as the riders enter and exit the rear section. As this blocks lines of sight, additional staff are required to safely supervise this ride in operation.\n\nMore common in Europe than the US, some Music Express rides have a canopy that the operator can cover the ride while in operation, very much like the old caterpillar rides.\n\nAt [[Kennywood Park]]'s and [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]]'s Musik Express, written above are the words \"Mit Musik Geht Alles Besser\", which translated from [[German language|German]] reads, \"With Music Everything Goes Better.\"\n\nThe variant used in fairs across [[Hawaii]] feature [[mural]]s of several famous artists, such as [[The Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Elvis Presley]], the logo of [[The Rolling Stones]], and several other musicians.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Cedar Point Super Himalaya (4778).ogv|thumb|Video of Super Himalaya at [[Cedar Point]], a Mack Rides variation]]\n; ''[[Bertazzon]]'' Musik Express: No major variations from Mack Rides version.\n; ''Majestic Manufacturing'' Musik Express: 14 cars, hydraulic locking system, increased top RPM.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.majesticrides.com/musikexppg2.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906114556/http://www.majesticrides.com/musikexppg2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-06 |title=Majestic Mfg. \u2013 Musik Express Specifications |accessdate=2007-01-28 |work= }}</ref>\n; ''Wisdom Rides'' Himalaya: 22 cars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop/flypage&product_id=32&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |title=Wisdom Rides \u2013 Midsize Himalaya |accessdate=2007-01-28 |format= |work= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312102805/http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop%2Fflypage&product_id=32&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |archivedate=2007-03-12}}</ref>\n; ''Mack Rides'' Himalaya: Music Express, Diskothek\n\n; ''Reverchon'' Himalaya: Original Himalaya ride design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/revehimi|title=Home|website=May's Himalaya Fan Website|access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\n; ''Wisdom Rides'' Silver Streak: 16 cars, smaller height difference, multiple lap bar positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop/flypage&product_id=31&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |title=Wisdom Rides \u2013 Silver Streak |accessdate=2007-01-28 |format= |work= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312102704/http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop%2Fflypage&product_id=31&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |archivedate=2007-03-12}}</ref>\n\n; ''SDC'' Amor Express: Billed as \"The Love Machine\", circa late 70s, with hydraulic drive and canopy, very much like the original [[Caterpillar (ride)|caterpillar rides]].

As this blocks lines of sight, additional staff are required to safely supervise this ride in operation.\n\nMore common in Europe than the US, some Music Express rides have a canopy that the operator can cover the ride while in operation, very much like the old caterpillar rides.\n\nAt [[Kennywood Park]]'s and [[Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom]]'s Musik Express, written above are the words \"Mit Musik Geht Alles Besser\", which translated from [[German language|German]] reads, \"With Music Everything Goes Better.\"\n\nThe variant used in fairs across [[Hawaii]] feature [[mural]]s of several famous artists, such as [[The Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[Elvis Presley]], the logo of [[The Rolling Stones]], and several other musicians.\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Cedar Point Super Himalaya (4778).ogv|thumb|Video of Super Himalaya at [[Cedar Point]], a Mack Rides variation]]\n; ''[[Bertazzon]]'' Musik Express: No major variations from Mack Rides version.\n; ''Majestic Manufacturing'' Musik Express: 14 cars, hydraulic locking system, increased top RPM.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.majesticrides.com/musikexppg2.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120906114556/http://www.majesticrides.com/musikexppg2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-06 |title=Majestic Mfg. \u2013 Musik Express Specifications |accessdate=2007-01-28 |work= }}</ref>\n; ''Wisdom Rides'' Himalaya: 22 cars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop/flypage&product_id=32&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |title=Wisdom Rides \u2013 Midsize Himalaya |accessdate=2007-01-28 |format= |work= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312102805/http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop%2Fflypage&product_id=32&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |archivedate=2007-03-12}}</ref>\n; ''Mack Rides'' Himalaya: Music Express, Diskothek\n\n; ''Reverchon'' Himalaya: Original Himalaya ride design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/revehimi|title=Home|website=May's Himalaya Fan Website|access-date=2016-09-16}}</ref>\n\n; ''Wisdom Rides'' Silver Streak: 16 cars, smaller height difference, multiple lap bar positions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop/flypage&product_id=31&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |title=Wisdom Rides \u2013 Silver Streak |accessdate=2007-01-28 |format= |work= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312102704/http://www.wisdomrides.com/catalog/?page=shop%2Fflypage&product_id=31&category_id=aca9b7c5a977d68d96c097558144d1e2 |archivedate=2007-03-12}}</ref>\n\n; ''SDC'' Amor Express: Billed as \"The Love Machine\", circa late 70s, with hydraulic drive and canopy, very much like the original [[Caterpillar (ride)|caterpillar rides]].

The recommendations eventually led to the introduction of literacy tests (in 1917 Congress overrode the second veto by Woodrow Wilson), the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 and [[Immigration Act of 1924|Johnson Reed Act]] of 1924.<ref name=\":0\" /> It therefore placed immigration policy firmly in the hands of the federal government, as opposed to the previous state level of enforcement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cannato|first=Vincent J.|date=2019-06-01|title=Katherine Benton-Cohen.

It was established in November 1867 at the confluence of the [[Concho River]]s near no fewer than five major trails such as the [[Butterfield Overland Mail in Texas|Butterfield Overland Mail Route]] and [[Goodnight\u2013Loving Trail]]. At its height, Fort Concho consisted of 40 buildings on {{convert|40|acre|ha|lk=on}} of land leased by the US Army. The fort was abandoned June 1889 and fell into civilian hands. Over the next twenty years, its buildings were used as residences or recycled for their material in the nearby town of San Angelo. Beginning in the late 1920s, a serious effort has been made to preserve and restore Fort Concho by its eponymous museum organization, founded in 1929. The property has been owned and operated by the city of San Angelo since 1935. It was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 4 July 1961. Fort Concho is one of the best-preserved examples of the [[Forts of Texas|military installations built by the US Army]] in the state of [[Texas]] during the [[American Indian Wars]].\n\nOver its 22-year long career as a US Army base, Fort Concho housed elements of fifteen [[US Cavalry]] and [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry]] [[regiment]]s, most prominently the \"[[Buffalo Soldiers]]\" of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]] and [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th Infantry]] regiments. From its establishment in 1867 until 1875, Fort Concho was the principal base of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]] and then of the 10th Cavalry from 1875 to 1882. The fort was of crucial importance during the late American Indian Wars in Texas; it was the headquarters of the short-lived [[District of the Pecos]] from 1878 to 1881 and contributed troops to [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]]'s 1872 summer campaign, the [[Red River War]] in 1874, and the [[Victorio's War|Victorio Campaign]] of 1879\u20131880.\n\n==Operation by the US military==\n[[File:Cattle-trails.jpg|thumb|left|alt=This is a map of the late 19th century Western cattle trails running from Texas in the south to the railroads in the Great Plains.

The [[Goodnight-Loving Trail]] is the farthest west of these and runs through the Concho valley and Fort Concho.]]\n\n[[American Indian Wars|Conflict in the Texas region]] between Native American tribes and white settlers spanned over 300 years, beginning in the early 16th century with Spanish missionaries and soldiers and ending with the cessation of organized resistance to the government of the [[United States of America]] in the 1870s.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|p=32}} In the area that is now [[Concho Valley]], the [[Jumano people]] established a village on the [[North Concho River]] sometime before 1534, when [[Cabeza de Vaca]] stayed there. [[Franciscan]] friars established a [[Mission (station)|mission]] in their village from 1629 to 1632 and were joined in the 1650s by traders from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. In the 1690s, the Jumanos were driven out of the region by the [[Apache]], who themselves were pushed southwest by the [[Comanche]] in the mid-18th century.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=1}} With America's victory over Mexico in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[California Gold Rush|1849 discovery of gold]] in [[California]], American colonists began crossing [[Comancheria]]. The native Comanche, [[Kiowa]], and [[Kickapoo people]]s fiercely resisted them. To protect its citizens, the [[United States Army]] (US Army)'s [[Department of Texas]] surveyed the frontier by 1851 and built a string of forts along its principal routes of travel.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|pp=32, 35}}\n\nIn March 1852, American troops established a camp on the North Concho that was abandoned with the establishment, in October 1852, of [[Fort Chadbourne]] on a tributary of the nearby [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. Patrols launched from the fort still covered the Concho valley and the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] route, established in 1858.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=2}} This phase of frontier history ended just three years later with the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|p=32}} Fort Chadbourne, like the other Texas forts, was abandoned by Federal troops until the surrender of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=2}} During this time, the frontier receded to the east and the Comanche were emboldened into increased raiding.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|p=33}} With the establishment in 1866 of the [[Goodnight-Loving Trail]], which followed the [[Concho River|Middle Concho]] west, there came a need to protect cattlemen and settlers traveling around the Concho valley. To this end, the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]], commanded by [[Major]] [[John P. Hatch]], reoccupied Fort Chadbourne in May 1867. This was soon followed up by plans to locate an outpost on the Concho. There, for US troops and citizens would have a reliable and inexhaustible supply of water.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=2}} A fort on the Concho would simultaneously deny its usage to hostile Native Americans.{{sfn|Gibson|1971|p=4}}\n\nIn the summer of 1867, Hatch ordered [[Lieutenant]] [[Peter M. Boehm]] to establish a camp on the Middle Concho, fifty miles south of Fort Chadbourne. [[Captain (military rank)|Captain]] Michael J. Kelly and 50 troops established this camp that same summer, but on the North Concho, and remained there for the duration of the summer. A committee of officers including Hatch surveyed the North and Middle Concho rivers in September 1867 and chose a [[plateau]] at the junction of the three Conchos for its grazing grounds, the abundance of nearby [[limestone]], and inexhaustible supply of fresh water. On 28 November 1867, the 4th Cavalry's H [[Company (military unit)|Company]] departed from Fort Chadbourne for the site to establish the planned permanent outpost. H Company's commander, Captain George G. Huntt, named the site \"Camp Hatch\", but changed it to \"Camp Kelly\" in January 1868 at Hatch's request to honor Kelly, who had died of [[typhoid fever]] on 13 August 1867. Fort Concho, then under construction north of Camp Kelly, received its name in March 1868 from [[Edward M. Stanton]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War for the United States]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=3\u20134}} The land Fort Concho was built on was not bought by the US government, but leased.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}}<!-- But from whom? -->\n\n===Construction===\nConstruction of Fort Concho was assigned on 10 December 1867 to Captain David W. Porter, assistant quartermaster of the Department of Texas. He brought in civilian stonemasons and carpenters to construct first temporary storehouses{{when|date=February 2019}} and then a permanent [[commissary]] in January 1868. Porter, also responsible for constructing Forts [[Fort Griffin|Griffin]] and [[Fort Richardson (Texas)|Richardson]], was replaced by Major George C. Cram,{{when|date=February 2019}} built a temporary [[guardhouse]]. Construction was slow, as direction had been poor under Cram and his predecessor, who was rarely at Fort Concho. By Spring 1868, the only permanent building on-site was a [[sutler]]'s store, constructed from pickets and pecan rafters. The soldiers lived in tents heated by fireplaces and sometimes stoves or in timber huts. As at other forts, they also built temporary timber frame or picket buildings lined with [[canvas]] insulation in the lull of construction. At this time, Cram began a dispute with Major [[Ben Ficklin]], the regional mail line superintendent, over Ficklin's use of government resources. When Cram had Ficklin arrested, the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] soon became involved and by August Cram was reassigned out of the Concho valley. He was replaced with Major George A. Gordon, who handed Fort Concho's construction to Captain Joseph Rendlebrock, the 4th Cavalry's [[quartermaster]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=3, 4, 5, 7}}\n\nBy the end of 1868, Rendlebrock had completed the Commissary, Quartermaster's Storehouse, and a wing of the Hospital. Like Porter, Rendlebrock employed civilian masons and carpenters \u2013 they made up 90% of the fort's workforce from 1869 to 1871 \u2013 mostly German immigrants from [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]]. Aided by soldiers, who provided unskilled labor, five of the officer's residences and the first regimental barracks 1869. Officers and their families moved into those residences while single officers were housed on the hospital's second floor. The same manner of frame or picket buildings that housed the [[non-commissioned officers]], baker, [[Drum major (military)|drum major]], and chief musician supplied these buildings with kitchens. In October 1869, a timber frame building was put up for the post adjutant and quartermaster on the parade ground. Over 1870, two more officer's residences and another barracks were built, as well as a permanent guardhouse and [[stables]]. Hatch pushed for the completion of the fort through 1870\u201371, directing the building of a quartermaster's corral, a wagon shed, and a failed attempt at producing [[adobe bricks]] that earned him the moniker \"Dobe\". Construction was again slowed in February 1872 with the discharging of most of the civilian workforce, but by the end of the year Fort Concho consisted of four barracks, eight officers' residences, the hospital, a [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]], stone guardhouse, bakery, several storehouses, workshops, and stables.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=6\u201310}}\n\nIn 1875, the parade ground was cleared and a flagstaff placed in its center. In the process, the adjutant's office was moved to the Command Row. It was replaced in short order with a stone command structure, the Headquarters building, built in 1876. Another officers' residence was built in 1877, as were the foundations for another that was completed in February 1879 as the Schoolhouse and chapel. It was the final permanent structure completed at Fort Concho.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=10\u201312, 51}} By 1879, the fort was an eight-company installation of entirely limestone-built structures with a parade ground {{convert|1000|ft|m|sp=us}} by {{convert|500|ft|m|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}} Construction had, by May 1877, cost the US Army 1 million [[US dollar|dollars]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=12}}\n\n===Base of the 4th Cavalry===\n[[File:Fort concho plaque.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of the Texas State Historical Survey Committee plaque describing the service history of Fort Concho in metal type.

The first act undertaken by the 4th Cavalry when establishing the fort was to build a wagon road to the [[San Saba River]] to secure a supply route from [[Fort Mason (Texas)|Fort Mason]]. When not on construction details, soldiers patrolled, scouted, and escorted wagon trains on the Butterfield Overland Trail and [[San Antonio\u2013El Paso Road]] and cattle herds. Despite the frequency of these actions, Fort Concho's garrison rarely encountered Native Americans.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=3, 13}}\n\nOn 25 February 1871, Colonel [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]] took command of the 4th Cavalry. He moved the regimental headquarters to Fort Richardson a month later,{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Mackenzie, Ranald Slidell}} but kept a few companies at Fort Concho.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fourth United States Cavalry}} In May 1871, the 4th Cavalry contingent left at Fort Concho participated in a campaign against the Kiowa in retaliation for the [[Warren Wagon Train raid]] with troops from Forts Griffin and [[Fort Sill|Sill]]. Six [[troops]] of 4th Cavalry's I Company, commanded by Captain [[Napoleon B. McLaughlen]], joined the rest of the regiment at the [[Little Wichita River]] in pursuit of the Kiowa but turned back for Fort Concho in September after the raiders escaped. Comanche and Kiowa raids increased in number over early 1873, prompting a number of expeditions that again rarely saw Natives Americans. A notable exception was a patrol carried out by Sergeant [[William Wilson (Medal of Honor)|William Wilson]] from 26 to 29 March 1872. On 28 March, his patrol fought a group of [[Comanchero]]s, half-Native and Hispanic traders, and captured one of their number. The captured man, Apalonio Ortiz, revealed that there was water in the [[Staked Plains]] and the location of a large Comanche settlement and base of trade for the Comancheros at [[Mushaway Peak]]. Hatch,{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=13\u201315}} in charge of Fort Concho while Mackenzie was in the field,{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Hatch, John Porter}} reported Wilson's findings to the latter man and to the Departments of Texas and [[Department of New Mexico|New Mexico]]. McLaughlen set out again{{when|date=February 2019}} with two companies of the 4th Cavalry and one of the [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|11th Infantry]] to verify Ortiz's information and confirmed it. His expedition, which had also mapped some of the Staked Plains, returned on 13 May.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nAfter meeting with Hatch and Mackenzie, General [[Christopher C. Augur]], Commander of the Department of Texas issued orders on 31 May 1872. Mackenzie and McLaughlen, commanding Companies D and I, departed from their respective installations on 17 June. Over the following summer months, the 4th Cavalry explored the [[South Plains]] and fought the Comanche at the [[Battle of the North Fork of the Red River]] on 29 September. As a result of the battle, the 4th Cavalry captured 124 women and children and most of the horses of the involved Comanche warriors. The following night, the Comanche stole back some of their horses and escaped, but left their women and children as prisoners. Companies D and I returned to Fort Concho on 21 October with 116 of the noncombatants, who were interned in the quartermaster's corral. They remained in captivity at the fort over the winter of 1872\u201373 as hostages until the Comanche returned all their white captives. When this was accomplished, the Department of Texas ordered the release of the Comanche hostages on 14 April 1873. They departed Fort Concho on 24 May under escort from the 11th Infantry and arrived safely at Fort Sill on 10 June.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=16\u201319}}\n\nIn March 1873, Mackenzie moved the 4th Cavalry's command from Fort Concho to Fort Clark. That year, he embarked on another campaign, this time against the Kickapoo based across the [[Rio Grande]] in [[Mexico]]. Company I and McLaughlen again joined Mackenzie in the field for [[El Remolino Raid|his attack]] into [[Coahuila]], Mexico on 18 May 1873. On 27 June 1874, more than 200 Comanche warriors [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls|attacked a group of buffalo hunters camped at Adobe Walls]], beginning the [[Red River War]]. In response, Augur ordered Mackenzie and the 4th Cavalry back to Fort Concho in July. When the US Army asked for permission to follow the Comanche and their allies onto reservations, the War Secretary granted it. By August,{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=19\u201321}} General [[Philip H.

Over the course of the war, Mackenzie chased the Comanche until he found their base of operations in the [[Palo Duro Canyon]] and [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon|destroyed it on 28 September]]. His force continued to patrol the area over the winter, preventing the Comanche from rebuilding their supplies and cementing the American victory in the Red River War.

Grierson and his \"[[Buffalo Soldiers]]\" arrived at Fort Concho on 17 April 1875 and established the regimental headquarters there. The 10th Cavalry took up the duties the 4th Cavalry previously held, patrolling the frontier, escorting wagons and settlers, and mounting expeditions. One of these was Captain [[Nicholas M.

This was placed under Grierson's command and therefore was based at Fort Concho. Over the next two years, Grierson established outposts like [[Grierson Spring]] across West Texas. In October 1879, Grierson received word that a war party of Ojo Caliente and Mescalero Apache under Chief [[Victorio]] entered the [[Trans-Pecos]]. He left Fort Concho on 23 March 1880 at the head of five companies of the 10th Cavalry and some of the [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th Infantry]] to destroy Victorio's source of supply, believed to be the [[Fort Stanton]] reservation. Grierson's soldiers fought with Apache raiders over early April, then reached Fort Stanton on 12 April. The disarmament was delayed until 16 April because of rains, and resulted in failure when the Mescalero Apache escaped with most of their arms. Grierson returned to Fort Concho on 16 May but left the 10th Cavalry's M Company at the head of the North Concho in case the Apache appeared in the area.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=26\u201328, 29\u201330}}\n\nGrierson, after convincing Sheridan not to send the 10th Cavalry back to New Mexico, began patrolling the springs of West Texas. For this purpose, he recalled Nolan and the [[battalion]] under his command at Fort Sill, which arrived at Fort Concho on 17 June 1880. Ten days later, Grierson issued the order for the patrols and himself set on from Fort Concho on 10 July.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=31}} Over the summer Grierson harried Victorio until the former man defeated the latter at Rattlesnake Springs and drove Victorio into Mexico.

In August 1882, the 10th Cavalry was replaced at Fort Concho by the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry]], commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alfred L. Hough. Ten days before Hough and the regimental headquarters arrived at the fort, a massive flood of the Concho wiped Ben Ficklin off the map and badly damaged San Angelo. As a result, the 16th Infantry spent its first week on-site rendering humanitarian aid. After recovering, San Angelo began to prosper while, conversely, Fort Concho declined from poor maintenance.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=57}} From 1882 until the fort's final closure, it served primarily as a base for troops awaiting transfer elsewhere in Texas.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}} When [[Fort McKavett]] was abandoned by the US Army in June 1883, its garrison moved to Fort Concho.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nBy the mid-1880s, the ranches that now enclosed the surrounding plains via barbed wire fencing reduced the soldiers, barred by law from cutting the wire, to patrolling the roads. Many of the frontier forts, such as Forts Davis and Griffin, had either been abandoned or were on the chopping block. After the 16th Infantry left Fort Concho for [[Fort Bliss]] in February 1887, it was believed locally that Fort Concho would also be abandoned as soon as the railroad reached the town. In early 1888, the 8th Cavalry gathered at Fort Concho from around Texas and then left for [[Fort Meade (South Dakota)|Fort Meade]], in [[South Dakota]], in June. With their departure, only the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry]]'s K Company were garrisoned at Fort Concho. Later that same year, on 17 September, the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] reached San Angelo. Interested locals appealed in vain to the Federal government to make Fort Concho a permanent installation.

DeWitt borrowed $1500 from Marcus Koenigheim, a San Antomio-based investor and used it to buy a half-[[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] of land on the opposite side of the Concho River of Fort Concho in 1870. He divided the area into plots to build a town, which he named Saint Angela (changed to San Angelo in 1881) after his wife, Carolina Angela de la Garza. The township was not a profitable venture. When [[Ben Ficklin, Texas|Ben Ficklin]] beat out San Angelo as the seat for [[Tom Green County, Texas|Tom Green County]], Koenigheim asked for payment of the balance and interest of DeWitt's loan in full. When he was unable to pay, Koenigheim sued him in 1875 and was awarded the {{convert|372|acres|ha}} of land that constituted the town. By then, San Angelo was a collection of [[bar|saloons]] and [[brothels]] and had a reputation befitting that.{{sfn|Gibson|1971|pp=6, 15\u201316, 26\u201327}}{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: San Angelo, TX}}\n\nRelations between the town and Fort Concho's garrison, who called San Angelo \"the town over the river\", were tentative. The enlisted men spent much of their time \u2013 and money \u2013 in the town, but its inhabitants were not appreciative of the garrison's black soldiers. When one of the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry was murdered on 31 January 1881, an entire company of the 16th Infantry and the slain man's comrades arrested the [[sheriff]] on 2 February and demanded the murderer. He was not given up, but the soldiers returned to the fort without incident. Two days later, and acting on rumors that the murderer had been released, the soldiers returned and shot up the Nimitz Hotel, where he was rumored to be staying.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=43\u201344}} The [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] arrived to help calm the situation and did this by issuing threats to attack the fort and to shoot any soldier that crossed the Concho River in a ten-day period.{{sfn|Gibson|1971|p=16}} Tension existed between the civilians and Fort Concho until after the 10th Cavalry left in 1882 and was replaced by the 16th Infantry.

The presence of its garrison attracted traders and settlers and allowed a wide diversification of the town's economy.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: San Angelo, TX}} Some of the [[sutler]]s that supplied Fort Concho's troops were William S. Veck, one of the organizers of Tom Green County and owner of San Angelo's first bank, and James L.

Its [[chaplains]] were some of the first preachers and educators in the town. The medical staff, chiefly surgeon William Notson, treated not just the garrison but also civilian townsfolk and ranchers. One of Notson's civilian assistants, Samuel L.S.

Broome formed the Fort Concho Realty Company in 1905 to sell off his land in San Angelo and at Fort Concho, implored the city to buy the fort for $15,000 without success. The eastern third of the fort grounds, which had remained clear of adulteration, was given over to the city by the Santa Fe Railroad Company in 1913. A decade later, the local chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] tried and failed to raise funds to preserve the fort.

When funding for construction was slashed, it was decided that instead a schoolhouse and chapel would be built instead for the education of the garrison's black soldiers and religious ceremonies. Both of these had been held in various places around the fort. Chaplain Badger had requested, fruitlessly, the construction of a permanent chapel and for want of such a building built a picket and sod chapel. Badger died at the fort on 3 June 1876 and was succeeded by George W. Ward, who dedicated the chapel upon its completion on 22 February 1879. After the US Army left, the building continued functioning as a schoolhouse and, at one point, a private home. The Fort Concho Museum acquired the Schoolhouse in 1946 and restored it. Since 1976, it has housed a living history event to teach local elementary schoolers about life in 1880s Texas.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=11, 48\u201349, 51}}\n\n{{Panorama|image=File:Fort Concho, Barracks 2, Interior.jpg|height=250px|caption=Interior of Barracks 2, containing wagon coaches and artillery pieces from the 19th century.}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|National Register of Historic Places|Texas}}\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Tom Green County, Texas]]\n* [[Texas Forts Trail]]\n* [[Forts of Texas]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Utley|first2=Dan K.|title=Faded Glory: A Century of Forgotten Texas Military Sites, Then and Now|year=2012|publisher=[[Texas A&M University]] [[Texas A&M University Press|Press]]|isbn=978-1-60344-699-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Bluthardt|first=Robert|title=Through the Centuries at Old Fort Concho|url=http://newweb.ranchmagazine.com/index.php/item/140-through-the-centuries-at-fort-concho|year=2010|journal=Ranch and Rural Living|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Joe A.|title=Old Angelo|year=1971|publisher=The Minuteman Press|isbn=|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Matthews|first=James T.|title=Fort Concho|year=2005|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|isbn=0-87611-205-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Prestiano|first=Robert|title=Oscar Ruffini: The Early Years|journal=Fort Concho Report|volume=16|issue=Summer 1984|ref={{sfnref|Prestiano|1984}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n;News publications\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite news|title=FLDS kids may overload Texas' troubled foster care|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8859784|publisher=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=9 April 2008|accessdate=11 April 2008|url-status=dead|ref={{sfnref|''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 11 April 2008a}}|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412090459/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8859784|archive-date=12 April 2008}}\n* {{cite news|last=Smart|first=Christopher|title=FLDS children to stay in care of Texas officials pending court hearing|url=http://www.sltrib.com/News/ci_8893463|publisher=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=11 April 2008|accessdate=11 April 2008|ref={{sfnref|''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 11 April 2008b}}|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413050003/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8893463|archive-date=13 April 2008|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite news|title=Polygamist parents, children begin reunions|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24931622/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/polygamist-parents-children-begin-reunions/|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=2 June 2008|accessdate=11 February 2019|ref={{sfnref|''Associated Press'', 2 June 2008}}}}\n* {{cite news|last=McDaniel|first=Matthew|title=Fort Concho looking forward to big things in its 151st year|url=https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/local/2017/11/28/fort-concho-looking-forward-big-things-its-151-year/869227001/|work=Go San Angelo|agency=USA Today|date=28 November 2017|ref={{sfnref|''Go San Angelo'', 28 November 2017}}}}\n* {{cite news|last=Edgin|first=Alana|title=Paranormal activity: Spirits of the past still haunt Fort Concho grounds|url=https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/local/2018/10/10/fort-concho-texas-still-alive-spirits-past-paranormal-activity/1578791002/|work=Go San Angelo|agency=[[USA Today]]|date=10 October 2018|accessdate=11 February 2019|ref={{sfnref|''Go San Angelo'', 10 October 2018}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n===Online references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|title=List of NHLs by State|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalhistoriclandmarks/list-of-nhls-by-state.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=16 February 2019|ref={{sfnref|National Park Service: List of NHLs by State}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n;Texas State Historical Association\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|last=Anderson|first=H.

It was established in November 1867 at the confluence of the [[Concho River]]s near no fewer than five major trails such as the [[Butterfield Overland Mail in Texas|Butterfield Overland Mail Route]] and [[Goodnight\u2013Loving Trail]]. At its height, Fort Concho consisted of 40 buildings on {{convert|40|acre|ha|lk=on}} of land leased by the US Army. The fort was abandoned June 1889 and fell into civilian hands. Over the next twenty years, its buildings were used as residences or recycled for their material in the nearby town of San Angelo. Beginning in the late 1920s, a serious effort has been made to preserve and restore Fort Concho by its eponymous museum organization, founded in 1929. The property has been owned and operated by the city of San Angelo since 1935. It was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 4 July 1961. Fort Concho is one of the best-preserved examples of the [[Forts of Texas|military installations built by the US Army]] in the state of [[Texas]] during the [[American Indian Wars]].\n\nOver its 22-year long career as a US Army base, Fort Concho housed elements of fifteen [[US Cavalry]] and [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry]] [[regiment]]s, most prominently the \"[[Buffalo Soldiers]]\" of the [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th]] and [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]] and [[24th Infantry Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th Infantry]] regiments. From its establishment in 1867 until 1875, Fort Concho was the principal base of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]] and then of the 10th Cavalry from 1875 to 1882. The fort was of crucial importance during the late American Indian Wars in Texas; it was the headquarters of the short-lived [[District of the Pecos]] from 1878 to 1881 and contributed troops to [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]]'s 1872 summer campaign, the [[Red River War]] in 1874, and the [[Victorio's War|Victorio Campaign]] of 1879\u20131880.\n\n==Operation by the US military==\n[[File:Cattle-trails.jpg|thumb|left|alt=This is a map of the late 19th century Western cattle trails running from Texas in the south to the railroads in the Great Plains.

The [[Goodnight-Loving Trail]] is the farthest west of these and runs through the Concho valley and Fort Concho.]]\n\n[[American Indian Wars|Conflict in the Texas region]] between Native American tribes and white settlers spanned over 300 years, beginning in the early 16th century with Spanish missionaries and soldiers and ending with the cessation of organized resistance to the government of the [[United States of America]] in the 1870s.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|p=32}} In the area that is now [[Concho Valley]], the [[Jumano people]] established a village on the [[North Concho River]] sometime before 1534, when [[Cabeza de Vaca]] stayed there. [[Franciscan]] friars established a [[Mission (station)|mission]] in their village from 1629 to 1632 and were joined in the 1650s by traders from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. In the 1690s, the Jumanos were driven out of the region by the [[Apache]], who themselves were pushed southwest by the [[Comanche]] in the mid-18th century.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=1}} With America's victory over Mexico in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and the [[California Gold Rush|1849 discovery of gold]] in [[California]], American colonists began crossing [[Comancheria]]. The native Comanche, [[Kiowa]], and [[Kickapoo people]]s fiercely resisted them. To protect its citizens, the [[United States Army]] (US Army)'s [[Department of Texas]] surveyed the frontier by 1851 and built a string of forts along its principal routes of travel.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|pp=32, 35}}\n\nIn March 1852, American troops established a camp on the North Concho that was abandoned with the establishment, in October 1852, of [[Fort Chadbourne]] on a tributary of the nearby [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. Patrols launched from the fort still covered the Concho valley and the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] route, established in 1858.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=2}} This phase of frontier history ended just three years later with the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|p=32}} Fort Chadbourne, like the other Texas forts, was abandoned by Federal troops until the surrender of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=2}} During this time, the frontier receded to the east and the Comanche were emboldened into increased raiding.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|p=33}} With the establishment in 1866 of the [[Goodnight-Loving Trail]], which followed the [[Concho River|Middle Concho]] west, there came a need to protect cattlemen and settlers traveling around the Concho valley. To this end, the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th Cavalry]], commanded by [[Major]] [[John P. Hatch]], reoccupied Fort Chadbourne in May 1867. This was soon followed up by plans to locate an outpost on the Concho. There, for US troops and citizens would have a reliable and inexhaustible supply of water.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=2}} A fort on the Concho would simultaneously deny its usage to hostile Native Americans.{{sfn|Gibson|1971|p=4}}\n\nIn the summer of 1867, Hatch ordered [[Lieutenant]] [[Peter M. Boehm]] to establish a camp on the Middle Concho, fifty miles south of Fort Chadbourne. [[Captain (military rank)|Captain]] Michael J. Kelly and 50 troops established this camp that same summer, but on the North Concho, and remained there for the duration of the summer. A committee of officers including Hatch surveyed the North and Middle Concho rivers in September 1867 and chose a [[plateau]] at the junction of the three Conchos for its grazing grounds, the abundance of nearby [[limestone]], and inexhaustible supply of fresh water. On 28 November 1867, the 4th Cavalry's H [[Company (military unit)|Company]] departed from Fort Chadbourne for the site to establish the planned permanent outpost. H Company's commander, Captain George G. Huntt, named the site \"Camp Hatch\", but changed it to \"Camp Kelly\" in January 1868 at Hatch's request to honor Kelly, who had died of [[typhoid fever]] on 13 August 1867. Fort Concho, then under construction north of Camp Kelly, received its name in March 1868 from [[Edward M. Stanton]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War for the United States]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=3\u20134}} The land Fort Concho was built on was not bought by the US government, but leased.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}}<!-- But from whom? -->\n\n===Construction===\nConstruction of Fort Concho was assigned on 10 December 1867 to Captain David W. Porter, assistant quartermaster of the Department of Texas. He brought in civilian stonemasons and carpenters to construct first temporary storehouses{{when|date=February 2019}} and then a permanent [[commissary]] in January 1868. Porter, also responsible for constructing Forts [[Fort Griffin|Griffin]] and [[Fort Richardson (Texas)|Richardson]], was replaced by Major George C. Cram,{{when|date=February 2019}} built a temporary [[guardhouse]]. Construction was slow, as direction had been poor under Cram and his predecessor, who was rarely at Fort Concho. By Spring 1868, the only permanent building on-site was a [[sutler]]'s store, constructed from pickets and pecan rafters. The soldiers lived in tents heated by fireplaces and sometimes stoves or in timber huts. As at other forts, they also built temporary timber frame or picket buildings lined with [[canvas]] insulation in the lull of construction. At this time, Cram began a dispute with Major [[Ben Ficklin]], the regional mail line superintendent, over Ficklin's use of government resources. When Cram had Ficklin arrested, the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] soon became involved and by August Cram was reassigned out of the Concho valley. He was replaced with Major George A. Gordon, who handed Fort Concho's construction to Captain Joseph Rendlebrock, the 4th Cavalry's [[quartermaster]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=3, 4, 5, 7}}\n\nBy the end of 1868, Rendlebrock had completed the Commissary, Quartermaster's Storehouse, and a wing of the Hospital. Like Porter, Rendlebrock employed civilian masons and carpenters \u2013 they made up 90% of the fort's workforce from 1869 to 1871 \u2013 mostly German immigrants from [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]]. Aided by soldiers, who provided unskilled labor, five of the officer's residences and the first regimental barracks 1869. Officers and their families moved into those residences while single officers were housed on the hospital's second floor. The same manner of frame or picket buildings that housed the [[non-commissioned officers]], baker, [[Drum major (military)|drum major]], and chief musician supplied these buildings with kitchens. In October 1869, a timber frame building was put up for the post adjutant and quartermaster on the parade ground. Over 1870, two more officer's residences and another barracks were built, as well as a permanent guardhouse and [[stables]]. Hatch pushed for the completion of the fort through 1870\u201371, directing the building of a quartermaster's corral, a wagon shed, and a failed attempt at producing [[adobe bricks]] that earned him the moniker \"Dobe\". Construction was again slowed in February 1872 with the discharging of most of the civilian workforce, but by the end of the year Fort Concho consisted of four barracks, eight officers' residences, the hospital, a [[Gunpowder magazine|magazine]], stone guardhouse, bakery, several storehouses, workshops, and stables.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=6\u201310}}\n\nIn 1875, the parade ground was cleared and a flagstaff placed in its center. In the process, the adjutant's office was moved to the Command Row. It was replaced in short order with a stone command structure, the Headquarters building, built in 1876. Another officers' residence was built in 1877, as were the foundations for another that was completed in February 1879 as the Schoolhouse and chapel. It was the final permanent structure completed at Fort Concho.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=10\u201312, 51}} By 1879, the fort was an eight-company installation of entirely limestone-built structures with a parade ground {{convert|1000|ft|m|sp=us}} by {{convert|500|ft|m|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}} Construction had, by May 1877, cost the US Army 1 million [[US dollar|dollars]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=12}}\n\n===Base of the 4th Cavalry===\n[[File:Fort concho plaque.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Picture of the Texas State Historical Survey Committee plaque describing the service history of Fort Concho in metal type. Underneath it is a smaller plaque marking the fort as a National Register of Historic Places property.|Historical marker detailing the service life of Fort Concho]]\n\nIn the early years of Fort Concho's existence as a US Army outpost, its garrison spent much of their time ancillary to their patrol duties on the fort's construction. The first act undertaken by the 4th Cavalry when establishing the fort was to build a wagon road to the [[San Saba River]] to secure a supply route from [[Fort Mason (Texas)|Fort Mason]]. When not on construction details, soldiers patrolled, scouted, and escorted wagon trains on the Butterfield Overland Trail and [[San Antonio\u2013El Paso Road]] and cattle herds. Despite the frequency of these actions, Fort Concho's garrison rarely encountered Native Americans.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=3, 13}}\n\nOn 25 February 1871, Colonel [[Ranald S. Mackenzie]] took command of the 4th Cavalry. He moved the regimental headquarters to Fort Richardson a month later,{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Mackenzie, Ranald Slidell}} but kept a few companies at Fort Concho.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fourth United States Cavalry}} In May 1871, the 4th Cavalry contingent left at Fort Concho participated in a campaign against the Kiowa in retaliation for the [[Warren Wagon Train raid]] with troops from Forts Griffin and [[Fort Sill|Sill]]. Six [[troops]] of 4th Cavalry's I Company, commanded by Captain [[Napoleon B. McLaughlen]], joined the rest of the regiment at the [[Little Wichita River]] in pursuit of the Kiowa but turned back for Fort Concho in September after the raiders escaped. Comanche and Kiowa raids increased in number over early 1873, prompting a number of expeditions that again rarely saw Natives Americans. A notable exception was a patrol carried out by Sergeant [[William Wilson (Medal of Honor)|William Wilson]] from 26 to 29 March 1872. On 28 March, his patrol fought a group of [[Comanchero]]s, half-Native and Hispanic traders, and captured one of their number. The captured man, Apalonio Ortiz, revealed that there was water in the [[Staked Plains]] and the location of a large Comanche settlement and base of trade for the Comancheros at [[Mushaway Peak]]. Hatch,{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=13\u201315}} in charge of Fort Concho while Mackenzie was in the field,{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Hatch, John Porter}} reported Wilson's findings to the latter man and to the Departments of Texas and [[Department of New Mexico|New Mexico]]. McLaughlen set out again{{when|date=February 2019}} with two companies of the 4th Cavalry and one of the [[11th Infantry Regiment (United States)|11th Infantry]] to verify Ortiz's information and confirmed it. His expedition, which had also mapped some of the Staked Plains, returned on 13 May.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nAfter meeting with Hatch and Mackenzie, General [[Christopher C. Augur]], Commander of the Department of Texas issued orders on 31 May 1872. Mackenzie and McLaughlen, commanding Companies D and I, departed from their respective installations on 17 June. Over the following summer months, the 4th Cavalry explored the [[South Plains]] and fought the Comanche at the [[Battle of the North Fork of the Red River]] on 29 September. As a result of the battle, the 4th Cavalry captured 124 women and children and most of the horses of the involved Comanche warriors. The following night, the Comanche stole back some of their horses and escaped, but left their women and children as prisoners. Companies D and I returned to Fort Concho on 21 October with 116 of the noncombatants, who were interned in the quartermaster's corral. They remained in captivity at the fort over the winter of 1872\u201373 as hostages until the Comanche returned all their white captives. When this was accomplished, the Department of Texas ordered the release of the Comanche hostages on 14 April 1873. They departed Fort Concho on 24 May under escort from the 11th Infantry and arrived safely at Fort Sill on 10 June.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=16\u201319}}\n\nIn March 1873, Mackenzie moved the 4th Cavalry's command from Fort Concho to Fort Clark. That year, he embarked on another campaign, this time against the Kickapoo based across the [[Rio Grande]] in [[Mexico]]. Company I and McLaughlen again joined Mackenzie in the field for [[El Remolino Raid|his attack]] into [[Coahuila]], Mexico on 18 May 1873. On 27 June 1874, more than 200 Comanche warriors [[Second Battle of Adobe Walls|attacked a group of buffalo hunters camped at Adobe Walls]], beginning the [[Red River War]]. In response, Augur ordered Mackenzie and the 4th Cavalry back to Fort Concho in July. When the US Army asked for permission to follow the Comanche and their allies onto reservations, the War Secretary granted it. By August,{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=19\u201321}} General [[Philip H. Sheridan]], commanding the [[Military Division of the Missouri]], ordered five expeditionary forces of more than 3,000 soldiers into the South Plains.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fourth United States Cavalry}} The southern force, under Mackenzie, left Fort Concho on 23 August 1874 with eight companies of the 4th Cavalry, four of the [[10th Infantry Regiment (United States)|10th Infantry]], and one from the 11th Infantry. Over the course of the war, Mackenzie chased the Comanche until he found their base of operations in the [[Palo Duro Canyon]] and [[Battle of Palo Duro Canyon|destroyed it on 28 September]]. His force continued to patrol the area over the winter, preventing the Comanche from rebuilding their supplies and cementing the American victory in the Red River War. Left no other option, the Comanche returned to their reservation.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=21\u201323}}\n\n===Base of the 10th Cavalry===\n[[File:Buffalo Soldiers 3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A picture of another Texas State Historical Association placard with an abbreviated history of the 10th Cavalry in metal type.|Texas State Historical Association placard commemorating the 10th Cavalry]]\n\nIn early 1875, the 4th Cavalry was entirely transferred out of Fort Concho to Fort Sill to watch over the Comanche and were replaced by Fort Sill's previous garrison, the [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry]], commanded by Colonel [[Benjamin Grierson]]. Grierson and his \"[[Buffalo Soldiers]]\" arrived at Fort Concho on 17 April 1875 and established the regimental headquarters there. The 10th Cavalry took up the duties the 4th Cavalry previously held, patrolling the frontier, escorting wagons and settlers, and mounting expeditions. One of these was Captain [[Nicholas M. Nolan]]'s [[Buffalo Soldier tragedy of 1877|disastrous 1877 expedition]] in July 1877.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=23, 24\u201325}} Four men of the 10th Cavalry's Company A died on the trip by the time it returned to Fort Concho on 31 July.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Nolan Expedition}}{{sfn|Gibson|1971|p=6}}\n\nApache raids from the [[Mescalero]] and [[San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation|San Carlos reservations]] in the mid-1870s prompted the creation of the [[District of the Pecos]] in January 1878. This was placed under Grierson's command and therefore was based at Fort Concho. Over the next two years, Grierson established outposts like [[Grierson Spring]] across West Texas. In October 1879, Grierson received word that a war party of Ojo Caliente and Mescalero Apache under Chief [[Victorio]] entered the [[Trans-Pecos]]. He left Fort Concho on 23 March 1880 at the head of five companies of the 10th Cavalry and some of the [[25th Infantry Regiment (United States)|25th Infantry]] to destroy Victorio's source of supply, believed to be the [[Fort Stanton]] reservation. Grierson's soldiers fought with Apache raiders over early April, then reached Fort Stanton on 12 April. The disarmament was delayed until 16 April because of rains, and resulted in failure when the Mescalero Apache escaped with most of their arms. Grierson returned to Fort Concho on 16 May but left the 10th Cavalry's M Company at the head of the North Concho in case the Apache appeared in the area.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=26\u201328, 29\u201330}}\n\nGrierson, after convincing Sheridan not to send the 10th Cavalry back to New Mexico, began patrolling the springs of West Texas. For this purpose, he recalled Nolan and the [[battalion]] under his command at Fort Sill, which arrived at Fort Concho on 17 June 1880. Ten days later, Grierson issued the order for the patrols and himself set on from Fort Concho on 10 July.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=31}} Over the summer Grierson harried Victorio until the former man defeated the latter at Rattlesnake Springs and drove Victorio into Mexico. There, Victorio and his band [[Battle of Tres Castillos|were destroyed]] on 15 October 1880 by Mexican soldiers under the command of Colonel [[Joaqu\u00edn Terrazas]].{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Victorio}} The District of the Pecos was dissolved on 7 February 1881 as the Apache threat ended with the completion of the final campaign of the [[Texas\u2013Indian wars]]. In July 1882, the 10th Cavalry left Fort Concho for the last time for [[Fort Davis National Historic Site|Fort Davis]], farther to the west.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=35}}\n\n===Post-Texas Indian Wars and deactivation===\nOn 27 January 1881, the Texas Rangers fought and defeated what was left of Victorio's band in the final battle of the American Indian Wars fought in Texas. In August 1882, the 10th Cavalry was replaced at Fort Concho by the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)|16th Infantry]], commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Alfred L. Hough. Ten days before Hough and the regimental headquarters arrived at the fort, a massive flood of the Concho wiped Ben Ficklin off the map and badly damaged San Angelo. As a result, the 16th Infantry spent its first week on-site rendering humanitarian aid. After recovering, San Angelo began to prosper while, conversely, Fort Concho declined from poor maintenance.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=57}} From 1882 until the fort's final closure, it served primarily as a base for troops awaiting transfer elsewhere in Texas.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}} When [[Fort McKavett]] was abandoned by the US Army in June 1883, its garrison moved to Fort Concho.{{sfn|Alexander|Utley|2012|pp=38\u201339}}\n\nBy the mid-1880s, the ranches that now enclosed the surrounding plains via barbed wire fencing reduced the soldiers, barred by law from cutting the wire, to patrolling the roads. Many of the frontier forts, such as Forts Davis and Griffin, had either been abandoned or were on the chopping block. After the 16th Infantry left Fort Concho for [[Fort Bliss]] in February 1887, it was believed locally that Fort Concho would also be abandoned as soon as the railroad reached the town. In early 1888, the 8th Cavalry gathered at Fort Concho from around Texas and then left for [[Fort Meade (South Dakota)|Fort Meade]], in [[South Dakota]], in June. With their departure, only the [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry]]'s K Company were garrisoned at Fort Concho. Later that same year, on 17 September, the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] reached San Angelo. Interested locals appealed in vain to the Federal government to make Fort Concho a permanent installation. On 20 June 1889, the men of K Company lowered the flag over the fort for the final time and left the next morning.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=58\u201460}}\n\n==Relationship with San Angelo, Texas==\n{{main|San Angelo, Texas#History}}\n[[File:Immigrants going through San Angelo, Texas (11934905704).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plate photograph of a train of immigrants passing through San Angelo in 1885.|Immigrants and their wagons passing through San Angelo in 1885]]\n\nBartholomew J. DeWitt borrowed $1500 from Marcus Koenigheim, a San Antomio-based investor and used it to buy a half-[[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] of land on the opposite side of the Concho River of Fort Concho in 1870. He divided the area into plots to build a town, which he named Saint Angela (changed to San Angelo in 1881) after his wife, Carolina Angela de la Garza. The township was not a profitable venture. When [[Ben Ficklin, Texas|Ben Ficklin]] beat out San Angelo as the seat for [[Tom Green County, Texas|Tom Green County]], Koenigheim asked for payment of the balance and interest of DeWitt's loan in full. When he was unable to pay, Koenigheim sued him in 1875 and was awarded the {{convert|372|acres|ha}} of land that constituted the town. By then, San Angelo was a collection of [[bar|saloons]] and [[brothels]] and had a reputation befitting that.{{sfn|Gibson|1971|pp=6, 15\u201316, 26\u201327}}{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: San Angelo, TX}}\n\nRelations between the town and Fort Concho's garrison, who called San Angelo \"the town over the river\", were tentative. The enlisted men spent much of their time \u2013 and money \u2013 in the town, but its inhabitants were not appreciative of the garrison's black soldiers. When one of the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry was murdered on 31 January 1881, an entire company of the 16th Infantry and the slain man's comrades arrested the [[sheriff]] on 2 February and demanded the murderer. He was not given up, but the soldiers returned to the fort without incident. Two days later, and acting on rumors that the murderer had been released, the soldiers returned and shot up the Nimitz Hotel, where he was rumored to be staying.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=43\u201344}} The [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] arrived to help calm the situation and did this by issuing threats to attack the fort and to shoot any soldier that crossed the Concho River in a ten-day period.{{sfn|Gibson|1971|p=16}} Tension existed between the civilians and Fort Concho until after the 10th Cavalry left in 1882 and was replaced by the 16th Infantry. The aid rendered to locals by the fort's garrison, especially the 16th Infantry, following the flood of 1888 and fires in the vicinity eventually evaporated the lingering animosity.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=57}}\n\nFort Concho was crucial to San Angelo's early growth. The presence of its garrison attracted traders and settlers and allowed a wide diversification of the town's economy.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: San Angelo, TX}} Some of the [[sutler]]s that supplied Fort Concho's troops were William S. Veck, one of the organizers of Tom Green County and owner of San Angelo's first bank, and James L. Millspaugh, another county commissioner who helped bring the railroad to San Angelo.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=55\u201356}} When the fort was abandoned, the local economy dipped enough to cause the closing of Koenigheim's business in San Angelo.{{sfn|Gibson|1971|p=27}} Fort Concho and its garrison also had an important civilizing effect on San Angelo. Its [[chaplains]] were some of the first preachers and educators in the town. The medical staff, chiefly surgeon William Notson, treated not just the garrison but also civilian townsfolk and ranchers. One of Notson's civilian assistants, Samuel L.S. Smith, became San Angelo's first physician and in 1910 helped establish its first civilian hospital.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=48, 51, 53\u201355}}\n\n===Preservation===\nIn the last years of the 19th century, the post buildings became residences for the people of San Angelo.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=61}} Enlisted Barracks 3 and 4 fell into ruin and were replaced with a series of residences while the officer's residences were preserved as private homes. However, despite a general disrepair, an effort was still made by interested locals to preserve Fort Concho.{{sfn|Bluthardt|2010}} When C.A. Broome formed the Fort Concho Realty Company in 1905 to sell off his land in San Angelo and at Fort Concho, implored the city to buy the fort for $15,000 without success. The eastern third of the fort grounds, which had remained clear of adulteration, was given over to the city by the Santa Fe Railroad Company in 1913. A decade later, the local chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] tried and failed to raise funds to preserve the fort. Instead, a stone and bronze plaque was laid that is still present at the fort.{{sfn|Bluthardt|2010}}{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho National Historic Landmark}}\n\nIn 1928, [[Ginevra Wood Carson]] founded the West Texas Museum in a room of the [[Tom Green County Courthouse]]. The next year, she raised funds for and made the $6000 purchase of the Headquarters. Over 1930, she moved the museum into the building and renamed it as the Fort Concho Museum.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}}{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho National Historic Landmark}} The city of San Angelo assumed partial administrative responsibility for the museum in 1935, then fully annexed the museum in 1955.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=61}}{{sfn|Bluthardt|2010}} Fort Concho was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] on 4 July 1961,{{sfn|National Park Service: List of NHLs by State}} bringing federal resources and trained professionals to Fort Concho.{{sfn|Bluthardt|2010}} A three-phase plan was presented to the National Park Service in 1967 for the acquisition, preservation, and restoration of the fort site and the funding required.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho National Historic Landmark}} Restorations followed in the 1970s,{{sfn|Bluthardt|2010}} culminating in a 1980 plan by an [[Austin]]-based architectural firm. By the end of the 1980s, the Fort Concho Museum complex consisted of sixteen original buildings, six reconstructed buildings, and a stabilized ruin.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho National Historic Landmark}}\n\n===Recent history===\nBeginning 7 April 2008, the 416 children and 139 women removed from the [[YFZ Ranch]], operated by the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] [[polygamy|polygamist]] sect, were transported to Fort Concho and the [[Wells Fargo]] Pavilion (also in San Angelo),{{sfn|''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 11 April 2008a}} where they were housed until authorities decided how to best care for them.{{sfn|''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 11 April 2008b}} The children were reunited with their parents on 2 June 2008 after the [[Texas Supreme Court]] ruled that the seizure of the children was unlawful.{{sfn|''Associated Press'', 2 June 2008}}\n\nLate in 2017, the Fort Concho Museum announced that its plans for 2018, funded by the city of San Angelo and private donors. These included the expansion of the visitor's center into the entirety of Barracks 1 and 2, and the reconstruction of Barracks 3 and 4 as well as their mess halls.{{sfn|''Go San Angelo'', 28 November 2017}}\n\n==Grounds and architecture==\nFort Concho was constructed from [[limestone]] quarried south of the fort, which supplied [[Lime (material)|lime]] for the [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] mixture also used in its construction. Most of the wood used in the fort's construction was shipped from the [[Gulf Coast]], as the native [[pecan]] and [[mesquite]] trees were unsuitable for construction.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=6}}\n\nThe landmark today includes most of the original fort and 23 main structures, mostly original or restored, but some reconstructions. These structures include a headquarters, officers' quarters, soldiers' barracks, and the post hospital.

Note the boarded-up [[sally port]] in the center of Barracks 2]]\n\nThe Enlisted Men's Barracks were some of the first buildings erected at Fort Concho, from 1869 to 1872. Civilian laborers provided skilled labor such as carpentry while soldiers performed the actual construction work. Barracks 1 and 2 were built in 1869 and 1870 respectively and each contained two cavalry companies. Both structures are unique in having [[sally port]]s in the middle of the structures to allow the soldiers to lead their horses through, rather than around, the barracks to reach the stables, located behind the buildings. Barracks 1 is currently the visitor's center while Barracks 2 is a display space housing wagons and replica artillery pieces such as a [[Gatling gun]].{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=7, 8, 37}}\n\nThe other four barracks buildings were built to house infantrymen and had an attached [[mess hall]]. Barracks 3 and 4 were completed by the end of 1872 but were demolished some time after the fort was abandoned.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=10, 37}} For a time, houses stood on the site of Barracks 3 and 4.{{sfn|Bluthardt|2010}} Barracks 5 and 6 are living history spaces and are furnished to appear as they would have during Fort Concho's military career.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=10, 37}}\n\nAt the end of Barracks Row was a guardhouse, built in 1870 to replace an earlier one made of pecan wood.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=8}}\n\n===Command Row===\n[[File:Fort Concho, Hospital a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=This is a photograph of the post Hospital at Fort Concho, rebuilt in the 1980s, from the parade ground.

From 1878 to 1881, this building was the headquarters for the District of the Pecos, which included Forts Davis, Stockton, and Griffin. In addition to the adjutant's office, which it replaced, the Headquarters housed the court martial, and the 10th Cavalry's regimental headquarters. Another addition was a library of 292 books established by Chaplain Norman Badger in late 1873. By the end of 1875, this library had grown to 720 books. The Headquarters building was used in various capacities in the twenty years after the US Army left Fort Concho.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=10\u201311, 48\u201349}} In 1929, Ginevra Wood Carson purchased the building and moved the West Texas Museum into the building.{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho}}{{sfn|Handbook of Texas Online: Fort Concho National Historic Landmark}} Four of the rooms on the ground floor, the court martial, orderly's room, adjutant's office, and regimental headquarters, have been remodeled to appear as they would have during the fort's military career.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=10}}\n\nThe post Hospital was one of the earliest buildings at the fort, built from 1868 to 1870 according to the same plan of Fort Richardson's hospital. During Fort Concho's military career, the fort served both military and civilian patients but was plagued by poor supply and sanitation. After the fort's deactivation the Hospital was used as a rooming house and for storage until it was destroyed by fire in 1911. The building was rebuilt in the mid-1980s with the aid of architectural and historical records. Presently, the Hospital contains a museum to frontier medicine in its north ward, a library in the south ward, and general medical exhibits in the center.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=7, 53}}\n\nThe residential shed of [[Oscar Ruffini]], San Angelo's first civic architect, was moved to behind the Command Row on 14 May 1951.{{sfn|Prestiano|1984|p=7}}\n\n===Officers' Row===\n[[File:Fort Concho, Officer's Quarters 3.jpg|thumb|right|alt=This is an image of Officer's Quarters 3 from the north and west.|Officer's Quarters 3 from the northwest.]]\n\nThe officers' quarters were built in several phases from 1869 to the mid-1870s. These buildings were assigned not by need but by rank, regardless of the size of an officer's family. In 1879, Grierson had a water pipe laid behind the Officers' Quarters leading to a pump on the parade ground for horticultural use.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=7, 11}}\n\nOfficer's Quarters 1 was the residence of the fort commander from its completion in 1872, replacing Officer's Quarters 3 in that capacity. Benjamin Grierson was the commanding officer who lived here the longest, from 1875 to 1882. Grierson added the west office, kitchen, and carriage house and place locks on every door in the building. Grierson's daughter Edith of typhoid died in the building on 9 September 1878.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=27}} Edith's [[ghost]] is said to have haunted the building in the years following her death.{{sfn|''Go San Angelo'', 10 October 2018}} The Fort Concho Museum purchased the building in 1964 and it served for years as the meeting place of the Tom Green County Historical Society. Officer's Quarters 1 was renovated in 1994 and became the Concho Valley Pioneer Heritage Center.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=27}}\n\nUntil the completion of Officer's Quarters 1 in 1872, Officer's Quarters 3 was the home of Fort Concho's commander. This building may also have been first of the officers' residences to be completed, in 1870. Because Officer's Quarters 3 had the greatest abundance of original interior fabric, it was restored to appear as it would have in the 1870s.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|p=7}}\n\nThe ghost of [[Francis Henry French]] is said to haunt Officer's Quarters 6.{{sfn|''Go San Angelo'', 10 October 2018}}\n\nThe Schoolhouse, also functioning as a chapel, was the last permanent structure to be built at Fort Concho. The structure was begun in November 1872 as another officer's residence, but only the foundation and basement of the kitchen were completed.  When funding for construction was slashed, it was decided that instead a schoolhouse and chapel would be built instead for the education of the garrison's black soldiers and religious ceremonies. Both of these had been held in various places around the fort. Chaplain Badger had requested, fruitlessly, the construction of a permanent chapel and for want of such a building built a picket and sod chapel. Badger died at the fort on 3 June 1876 and was succeeded by George W. Ward, who dedicated the chapel upon its completion on 22 February 1879. After the US Army left, the building continued functioning as a schoolhouse and, at one point, a private home. The Fort Concho Museum acquired the Schoolhouse in 1946 and restored it. Since 1976, it has housed a living history event to teach local elementary schoolers about life in 1880s Texas.{{sfn|Matthews|2005|pp=11, 48\u201349, 51}}\n\n{{Panorama|image=File:Fort Concho, Barracks 2, Interior.jpg|height=250px|caption=Interior of Barracks 2, containing wagon coaches and artillery pieces from the 19th century.}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|National Register of Historic Places|Texas}}\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Tom Green County, Texas]]\n* [[Texas Forts Trail]]\n* [[Forts of Texas]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Alexander|first1=Thomas E.|last2=Utley|first2=Dan K.|title=Faded Glory: A Century of Forgotten Texas Military Sites, Then and Now|year=2012|publisher=[[Texas A&M University]] [[Texas A&M University Press|Press]]|isbn=978-1-60344-699-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Bluthardt|first=Robert|title=Through the Centuries at Old Fort Concho|url=http://newweb.ranchmagazine.com/index.php/item/140-through-the-centuries-at-fort-concho|year=2010|journal=Ranch and Rural Living|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Joe A.|title=Old Angelo|year=1971|publisher=The Minuteman Press|isbn=|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Matthews|first=James T.|title=Fort Concho|year=2005|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]]|isbn=0-87611-205-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Prestiano|first=Robert|title=Oscar Ruffini: The Early Years|journal=Fort Concho Report|volume=16|issue=Summer 1984|ref={{sfnref|Prestiano|1984}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n;News publications\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite news|title=FLDS kids may overload Texas' troubled foster care|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8859784|publisher=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=9 April 2008|accessdate=11 April 2008|url-status=dead|ref={{sfnref|''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 11 April 2008a}}|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412090459/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8859784|archive-date=12 April 2008}}\n* {{cite news|last=Smart|first=Christopher|title=FLDS children to stay in care of Texas officials pending court hearing|url=http://www.sltrib.com/News/ci_8893463|publisher=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]|date=11 April 2008|accessdate=11 April 2008|ref={{sfnref|''The Salt Lake Tribune'', 11 April 2008b}}|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413050003/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_8893463|archive-date=13 April 2008|url-status=dead}}\n* {{cite news|title=Polygamist parents, children begin reunions|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/24931622/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/polygamist-parents-children-begin-reunions/|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[NBC News]]|date=2 June 2008|accessdate=11 February 2019|ref={{sfnref|''Associated Press'', 2 June 2008}}}}\n* {{cite news|last=McDaniel|first=Matthew|title=Fort Concho looking forward to big things in its 151st year|url=https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/local/2017/11/28/fort-concho-looking-forward-big-things-its-151-year/869227001/|work=Go San Angelo|agency=USA Today|date=28 November 2017|ref={{sfnref|''Go San Angelo'', 28 November 2017}}}}\n* {{cite news|last=Edgin|first=Alana|title=Paranormal activity: Spirits of the past still haunt Fort Concho grounds|url=https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/local/2018/10/10/fort-concho-texas-still-alive-spirits-past-paranormal-activity/1578791002/|work=Go San Angelo|agency=[[USA Today]]|date=10 October 2018|accessdate=11 February 2019|ref={{sfnref|''Go San Angelo'', 10 October 2018}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n===Online references===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|title=List of NHLs by State|url=https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalhistoriclandmarks/list-of-nhls-by-state.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=16 February 2019|ref={{sfnref|National Park Service: List of NHLs by State}}}}\n{{refend}}\n\n;Texas State Historical Association\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|last=Anderson|first=H.
