Subsequently the road on which is the Chapel entrance was renamed [[Manette Street]].\n\n<blockquote>''In a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree rustled its green leaves, church organs claimed to be made, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant who had a golden arm starting out of the wall... as if he had beaten himself precious.''  - A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens<ref>A Tale of Two Cities, Charles Dickens</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe 'golden arm' now resides at the [[Charles Dickens Museum|Dickens House Museum]] but you can see a modern replica sticking out of the wall near the [[Pillars of Hercules (pub)|Pillars of Hercules]] pub at the western end of Manette Street (formerly Rose Street).\n\n=== Charitable work ===\n\nThe House of Charity, founded in 1846, moved from its home No. 9 Rose (now Manette) Street to the new premises at 1 Greek Street in 1861, which had been purchased for \u00a36,400.<ref name=\"Survey of London XXXIII p.89\" />\n\nBehind the House of Charity was an ideal of practical [[Christianity]], spurred on by the [[Oxford Movement]].<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\">{{cite book|title=The House of Charity Annual Reports 79-122, 1925-1967|year=1925|publisher=Women's Printing Society Ltd|location=Brick St, Piccadilly|page=2}}</ref>  The first list of members included [[William Ewart Gladstone]].\n\nOne of the original functions of the Charity was to keep families together when the husband of a  family went into a [[workhouse]]. Between January 1847 and February 1851, 487 people were admitted. Of these, 103 were families ranging from a single mother to a family of ten with both parents and eight children. These families were a typical example of the way in which the House of Charity set out \"to offer to those who are sunk in the depths of temporal, and frequently spiritual, wretchedness, the example of the discipline of a Christian family\".<ref name=\"The House of St Barnabas and its Georgian Setting\">{{cite book|last=Bignell|first=Peter|title=The House of St Barnabas and its Georgian Setting|year=2010|location=London|page=44}}</ref>\n\nThe House of Charity described itself as one of the few institutions in London where men, women and children of all walks of life, were able to 'apply for aid without a loss of self-respect'.  Temporary guests of the House included 'all who found themselves in a condition of friendlessness and destitution that is not the manifest result of idleness or vice.' <ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>\n\n=== The Second World War and beyond ===\n\nBetween 1862 and the outbreak of the Second World War the Charity broadened its functions and over the years helped the homeless of London in many different ways: it helped people who were emigrating to [[Australia]] and were awaiting the long sea journey, people who had to come to London for surgery in hospitals, servants who had lost their jobs, teachers between positions and \u00e9migr\u00e9s from [[Russia]] and the Balkans \u2013 an association which still continues to this day with the monthly services of the Macedonian community in the Chapel.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second World War, during the blitz, the nuns moved back to [[Community of St John Baptist|Clewer]] and the House was requisitioned for war duty.  In November 1940 a bomb fell on the House, causing sufficient damage though fortunately no fatalities.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/> The Air Training Corps used the premises as a Headquarters during the war, having first applied to repair the bomb damage sufficiently to allow use of the building.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>  Following this the London County Council were granted use of the building for 'the purpose of training Students in Child Welfare'.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>\n\nAfter the war the House opened as a women's hostel, originally helping ex-service women, and at one time providing 'as many as 802 beds'.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 3\"/> The hostel had many supporters and friends, among them [[Joyce Grenfell]], the comic actress, who was a constant visitor and fundraiser. The House closed as a women's hostel in 2006. All the residents were re-housed.\n\nThe individual stories of the people who made the House their home over this long period are recorded in the House archives, which are now kept in the [[Westminster]] Archive. Then, as now, the Charity was overseen by a Board of Trustees.\n\n===Now===\nThe House of St Barnabas has the vision ''\"to create a future where sustained employment is a reality for those affected by homelessness.\"'' It has been constituted as a members' club since 2013. <ref name=\"HOSB - Our Story\">{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://hosb.org.uk/about-us/#ourstory|publisher=HOSB|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> The club hosts music and entertainment events, and also showcases visual art from established and emerging artists. The founding members of the club were [[Andrew Weatherall]], [[Gilles Peterson]], [[Miranda Sawyer]], [[Ekow Eshun]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], Margot Bowon, [[Richard Strange]], [[Rob Da Bank]], [[Rankin (photographer)|Rankin]], [[Hew Locke]] and [[Jarvis Cocker]].\n\nIn July 2019 it was reported that the House was running a 12-week scheme in which participants work in the club, in hospitality and administrative roles, alongside attending workshops, before graduating with a City and Guilds qualification. Graduates are provided with a minimum of one year post-programme support to help them  back into lasting paid work and to help break the cycle of homelessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-48830330/the-private-members-club-staffed-by-the-homeless|title=The private members club staffed by the homeless|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref>\n\n== The House ==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Front of House.jpg|The front door\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Entrance Hall ===\n\nThe interior detail, the moulded [[plasterwork]], is one of the finest examples of the English [[Rococo]] style surviving in [[London]].  Whilst it is not known for sure who instigated this work, it is probable that Richard Beckford commissioned the additions to the House's interior.  Similarly, the designers of the elaborate plasterwork are thought to be George Fawkes and Humphrey Willmott, the plasterers employed at [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] at around the same date, though there is no solid evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Survey of London XXXIII p.96\">{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=F. H. W.|title=Survey of London XXXIII The Parish of St Anne Soho|date=1966|publisher=The Athlone Press University of London|location=2 Gower Street, London|page=96}}</ref>\n\nThe front door is original and the Charity still has the large key for the lock; 18th century London was a dangerous place, hence the enormous safety chain.\n\nThe simple decoration of the hall was a deliberate device to attract the visitor's eye to the decorated staircase leading to the rooms on the first floor.<ref name=\"Survey of London XXXIII p.96\" />\n\nThe wrought-iron [[balustrade]]s of the staircase are original. The original chandelier held candles and the mechanism for raising and lowering still exists. The Angel on the landing is the oldest object in the house. It dates from the 1600s, is made of wood and is Flemish.  This has been embellished by the artist Nancy Fouts.\n\nThere is a galleried landing from which the plasterwork can be viewed more closely: there is a deep [[relief]] of female busts, a lion's head and [[scrollwork]]. In Richard Beckford's time, the panels would almost certainly have held oil paintings,  probably of members of his large family.  Their places are now occupied by paintings by the artist [[Alan Rankle]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Staircase bottom (House of St. Barnabas).jpg|Entrance hall and staircase\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Soho & Dickens Rooms ===\n\nThe office for the Charity's Hostel Director and Personal Support Workers, who provided the one-to-one counselling, advice and support to the residents, was almost certainly the dining room, known as The Soho Room. This room, together with the Dickens room that leads from it, has plasterwork from the 1750s, although it is not quite as ornate as the decoration in the rooms above.\n\nThe Dickens Room has a fireplace with four roundel paintings of nuns, installed when the House of Charity moved into the buildings.\n\nThese rooms now hold the members' restaurant and private dining facilities.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Dickens Room.jpg|The Dickens Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Drawing Room ===\n\nThe ceiling of The Drawing Room has in its corners heads representing the Four Seasons. The central oval medallion shows four [[putti]],  holding in their hands the symbols of the four [[classical elements]]: earth, water, fire and air.\n\nAt the top of the wall panel in the drawing room opposite the [[chimneypiece]] are two dragons made of [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]. These are the dragons of the city of London which, as an alderman, [[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]] was permitted to use.<ref name=\"Country Life\" />  It is believed, although there is no concrete evidence, that the plasterers William used for [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] were engaged to plaster this, his brother Richard's house, as there are distinct similarities between the plasterwork, including the presence of the city of London dragons.\n\nWhen the House of Charity acquired the property three of the marble chimneypieces from the House, including the Council Room chimneypiece, were sold to fund the building of the Chapel. The [[overmantel]] and chimney piece were designed as part of the restoration in 1960 by Lawrence King.<ref name=\"Country Life\" />\n\nThe Drawing Room is the largest member's lounge in the club.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Drawing Room (House of St. Barnabas).jpg|The Drawing Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Silk Room ===\n\nThe Silk Room is a silk-lined room which also has its original plasterwork ceiling and carved wooden chimneypiece. It is also called the Withdrawing Room, because in Georgian times it was the room that ladies would have withdrawn to.\n\nThe Silk Room is currently used as both a board room and private dining space.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Silk or Withdrawing Room.jpg|The Silk or Withdrawing Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Bazalgette Room ===\n\nAt the rear of the House, The Bazalgette Room was the principal bedroom. The chimneypiece and overmantel are original and the entrance door is matched by a  false door at the southern end of the same wall.  This was to give the room symmetry, but the plain plasterwork indicates that the room has been reduced in size to provide storage space for the Metropolitan Board of Works. The room takes its name from being the offices of the civil engineer Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]], who designed London's sewage system. The House of Charity used the Bazalgette room to house its archives,  including all the records of those helped.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Bazalgette Room.jpg|The Bazalgette Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Library Bar ===\n\nThe Library has a Victorian fireplace with the badges of the House of Charity, inscribed with the Charity's founding date, 1846, and 1862, the date the Charity moved into the House.  Between the two badges is a text from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] \"I was a stranger and ye took me in\".\n\nThis is currently the club bar and central hub.\n\n=== The Monro & Garden Rooms ===\n\nThe Monro Room and the Garden Room were created by the Charity out of an extension devised by the Metropolitan Board of works on part of the site of the stables that complimented the Georgian House.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=F.H.W|title=Survey of London XXXIII Parish of St Anne Soho|year=1966|publisher=The Athlone Press, University of London|location=Gower Street, London|page=89}}</ref>\n\nA tavern clock about four feet high and made entirely of black lacquered wood with gold painted numbers hangs in the chapel corridor. The dial of these types of clocks was big and bold enabling them to be seen in dimly lit,  smoke filled taverns.  These clocks were also known as [[Act of Parliament clock]]s because they became popular after the British Parliament passed an Act in 1797 levying a tax on domestic clocks with the result that people relied on public clocks for their time-keeping.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Garden Room.JPG|The Garden Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Crinoline Stair===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Crinoline Stairs.jpg|The Crinoline Stairs\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Penny Chute ===\n\nOn the outside of the house is the Penny Chute attached to the railings in Soho Square.  Coins fall down the pipe to the [[alms box]] in the kitchen.  People today still donate to the Charity using this method.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PennyChute.JPG|Penny Chute\n</gallery>\n\n== The Chapel ==\nThe Chapel was built on the site of the Georgian stable yard between 1862 and 1864 by Edward Conder of Baltic Wharf, Kingsland Road. The architect was [[Joseph Clarke (architect)|Joseph Clarke]] and the original plans for the site included a refectory with dormitories above and a cloister. The Annual Report of 1928 mentions that the plan of the Chapel \"was suggested and partly designed from the plans of a Romanesque chapel attached to the Abbey of Montmajeur, [[Arles]], France.\"\n\nThe cost of building the chapel proved a financial strain to the Charity, and 'in 1864 three chimney pieces were sold from the House.'<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cornforth|first=John|title=The House of St Barnabas In Soho|journal=Country Life|date=6 July 1961|volume=70|series=3357|page=20}}</ref>\n\nThe Chapel is a reminder of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] revival in the [[Church of England]] spearheaded by men like [[John Henry Newman|Newman]], [[Edward Bouverie Pusey|Pusey]] and [[John Keble|Keble]] who published the [[Tracts for the Times]] between 1833-1841, earning them the name [[Tractarians]]. Their followers not only emphasised Catholic aspects of the Church of England but also a return to medieval Gothic architecture after neo-classical churches of the previous two hundred years. In 1848, the then Bishop of London, [[Archibald Tait]], became Visitor to the charity and his successors continue to hold this office. The original plan included a throne for the Bishop behind the altar but, in 1865, Joseph Clarke proposed the mosaics by Harland and Fisher. The advice and support of the Visitor provide a living link between the House of St Barnabas and the Church of England in the [[Diocese of London]].\n\nDuring the Second World War, the original stained glass windows and roof of the Chapel suffered bomb damage. The [[apse]] above the altar was originally painted with the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Christ and the windows commemorated the Charity's founders and supporters. The present windows behind the altar represent, from left to right, St Edward the Confessor; St Barnabas holding the Chapel in his arms; St Paul preaching and St [[John the Baptist]] holding the mother Chapel of Clewer in his arms; they were designed by [[John Hayward (architect)|John Hayward]].<ref name=\"Survey of London: The Parish of St Anne Soho\">{{cite book|last1=Sheppard|first1=F.H.W|title=Survey of London: The Parish of St Anne Soho volume XXXIII|date=1966|publisher=The Athlone Press|location=University of London, Gower Street|page=106}}</ref> The windows in the side apses, dating from 1958, represent the [[Stations of the Cross]] and the [[Annunciation]]. The organ was built by the firm of [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd]] in 1875 at a cost of \u00a3250 and was enlarged by them in 1884.  At the west end of the South West apse is a memorial to Captain Henry Norman who died in 1925. He became a porter of the House after retiring as first mate of the [[Cutty Sark]], the tea clipper now at Greenwich.\n\nThe Chapel remains a sacred space for prayer and worship. Although it is an Anglican Chapel, currently there are Roman Catholic services for London's [[Macedonian Orthodox]] community and baptisms and services following civil weddings. The Chapel is also used for concerts and broadcasts \u2014 [[Paloma Faith]] has sung here \u2014 and for photography \u2014 The BBC filmed part of ''The Time Travellers Wife'' in the Chapel.  The charity hosts a Culture Series in the chapel.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:mosaic_hosb.jpg|\nFile:Chapel4.jpg|\nFile:organs_hosb.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official|http://hosb.org.uk}}\n* [http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ The House of St Barnabas, registered charity number 207242], at the [http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ Charity Commission]\n\n{{coord|51.5149|N|0.1313|W|source:wikidata-and-enwiki-cat-tree_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Houses in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Soho, London]]\n[[Category:Soho Square]]\n[[Category:1862 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed houses in London]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1746]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in London]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:The House of St Barnabas from Soho Square.jpg|thumb|The House of St Barnabas from Soho Square]]\n\nThe '''House of St Barnabas''', at 1 [[Greek Street]],  [[Soho]], is a [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|Grade I Listed]] [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] building in London<ref>{{NHLE |num=1066753 |accessdate=4 June 2012}}</ref> notable for its [[rococo]] [[plasterwork]] interiors and for other architectural features.\n\nSince 1862 the House has been run as a charity to help those who have experienced homelessness.<ref name='The House of Charity'>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41052 |title=No. 1 Greek Street: The House of St. Barnabas-in-Soho |accessdate=3 July 2013 |last=Sheppard |first=F.

These families were a typical example of the way in which the House of Charity set out \"to offer to those who are sunk in the depths of temporal, and frequently spiritual, wretchedness, the example of the discipline of a Christian family\".<ref name=\"The House of St Barnabas and its Georgian Setting\">{{cite book|last=Bignell|first=Peter|title=The House of St Barnabas and its Georgian Setting|year=2010|location=London|page=44}}</ref>\n\nThe House of Charity described itself as one of the few institutions in London where men, women and children of all walks of life, were able to 'apply for aid without a loss of self-respect'.  Temporary guests of the House included 'all who found themselves in a condition of friendlessness and destitution that is not the manifest result of idleness or vice.' <ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>\n\n=== The Second World War and beyond ===\n\nBetween 1862 and the outbreak of the Second World War the Charity broadened its functions and over the years helped the homeless of London in many different ways: it helped people who were emigrating to [[Australia]] and were awaiting the long sea journey, people who had to come to London for surgery in hospitals, servants who had lost their jobs, teachers between positions and \u00e9migr\u00e9s from [[Russia]] and the Balkans \u2013 an association which still continues to this day with the monthly services of the Macedonian community in the Chapel.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second World War, during the blitz, the nuns moved back to [[Community of St John Baptist|Clewer]] and the House was requisitioned for war duty.  In November 1940 a bomb fell on the House, causing sufficient damage though fortunately no fatalities.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/> The Air Training Corps used the premises as a Headquarters during the war, having first applied to repair the bomb damage sufficiently to allow use of the building.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>  Following this the London County Council were granted use of the building for 'the purpose of training Students in Child Welfare'.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 2\"/>\n\nAfter the war the House opened as a women's hostel, originally helping ex-service women, and at one time providing 'as many as 802 beds'.<ref name=\"The House of Charity Annual Reports page 3\"/> The hostel had many supporters and friends, among them [[Joyce Grenfell]], the comic actress, who was a constant visitor and fundraiser. The House closed as a women's hostel in 2006. All the residents were re-housed.\n\nThe individual stories of the people who made the House their home over this long period are recorded in the House archives, which are now kept in the [[Westminster]] Archive. Then, as now, the Charity was overseen by a Board of Trustees.\n\n===Now===\nThe House of St Barnabas has the vision ''\"to create a future where sustained employment is a reality for those affected by homelessness.\"'' It has been constituted as a members' club since 2013. <ref name=\"HOSB - Our Story\">{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://hosb.org.uk/about-us/#ourstory|publisher=HOSB|accessdate=2 March 2015}}</ref> The club hosts music and entertainment events, and also showcases visual art from established and emerging artists. The founding members of the club were [[Andrew Weatherall]], [[Gilles Peterson]], [[Miranda Sawyer]], [[Ekow Eshun]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], Margot Bowon, [[Richard Strange]], [[Rob Da Bank]], [[Rankin (photographer)|Rankin]], [[Hew Locke]] and [[Jarvis Cocker]].\n\nIn July 2019 it was reported that the House was running a 12-week scheme in which participants work in the club, in hospitality and administrative roles, alongside attending workshops, before graduating with a City and Guilds qualification. Graduates are provided with a minimum of one year post-programme support to help them  back into lasting paid work and to help break the cycle of homelessness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-48830330/the-private-members-club-staffed-by-the-homeless|title=The private members club staffed by the homeless|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref>\n\n== The House ==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Front of House.jpg|The front door\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Entrance Hall ===\n\nThe interior detail, the moulded [[plasterwork]], is one of the finest examples of the English [[Rococo]] style surviving in [[London]].  Whilst it is not known for sure who instigated this work, it is probable that Richard Beckford commissioned the additions to the House's interior.  Similarly, the designers of the elaborate plasterwork are thought to be George Fawkes and Humphrey Willmott, the plasterers employed at [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] at around the same date, though there is no solid evidence to support this.<ref name=\"Survey of London XXXIII p.96\">{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=F. H. W.|title=Survey of London XXXIII The Parish of St Anne Soho|date=1966|publisher=The Athlone Press University of London|location=2 Gower Street, London|page=96}}</ref>\n\nThe front door is original and the Charity still has the large key for the lock; 18th century London was a dangerous place, hence the enormous safety chain.\n\nThe simple decoration of the hall was a deliberate device to attract the visitor's eye to the decorated staircase leading to the rooms on the first floor.<ref name=\"Survey of London XXXIII p.96\" />\n\nThe wrought-iron [[balustrade]]s of the staircase are original. The original chandelier held candles and the mechanism for raising and lowering still exists. The Angel on the landing is the oldest object in the house. It dates from the 1600s, is made of wood and is Flemish.  This has been embellished by the artist Nancy Fouts.\n\nThere is a galleried landing from which the plasterwork can be viewed more closely: there is a deep [[relief]] of female busts, a lion's head and [[scrollwork]]. In Richard Beckford's time, the panels would almost certainly have held oil paintings,  probably of members of his large family.  Their places are now occupied by paintings by the artist [[Alan Rankle]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Staircase bottom (House of St. Barnabas).jpg|Entrance hall and staircase\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Soho & Dickens Rooms ===\n\nThe office for the Charity's Hostel Director and Personal Support Workers, who provided the one-to-one counselling, advice and support to the residents, was almost certainly the dining room, known as The Soho Room. This room, together with the Dickens room that leads from it, has plasterwork from the 1750s, although it is not quite as ornate as the decoration in the rooms above.\n\nThe Dickens Room has a fireplace with four roundel paintings of nuns, installed when the House of Charity moved into the buildings.\n\nThese rooms now hold the members' restaurant and private dining facilities.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Dickens Room.jpg|The Dickens Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Drawing Room ===\n\nThe ceiling of The Drawing Room has in its corners heads representing the Four Seasons. The central oval medallion shows four [[putti]],  holding in their hands the symbols of the four [[classical elements]]: earth, water, fire and air.\n\nAt the top of the wall panel in the drawing room opposite the [[chimneypiece]] are two dragons made of [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]]. These are the dragons of the city of London which, as an alderman, [[William Beckford (politician)|William Beckford]] was permitted to use.<ref name=\"Country Life\" />  It is believed, although there is no concrete evidence, that the plasterers William used for [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] were engaged to plaster this, his brother Richard's house, as there are distinct similarities between the plasterwork, including the presence of the city of London dragons.\n\nWhen the House of Charity acquired the property three of the marble chimneypieces from the House, including the Council Room chimneypiece, were sold to fund the building of the Chapel. The [[overmantel]] and chimney piece were designed as part of the restoration in 1960 by Lawrence King.<ref name=\"Country Life\" />\n\nThe Drawing Room is the largest member's lounge in the club.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Drawing Room.jpg|The Drawing Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Silk Room ===\n\nThe Silk Room is a silk-lined room which also has its original plasterwork ceiling and carved wooden chimneypiece. It is also called the Withdrawing Room, because in Georgian times it was the room that ladies would have withdrawn to.\n\nThe Silk Room is currently used as both a board room and private dining space.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Silk or Withdrawing Room.jpg|The Silk or Withdrawing Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Bazalgette Room ===\n\nAt the rear of the House, The Bazalgette Room was the principal bedroom. The chimneypiece and overmantel are original and the entrance door is matched by a  false door at the southern end of the same wall.  This was to give the room symmetry, but the plain plasterwork indicates that the room has been reduced in size to provide storage space for the Metropolitan Board of Works. The room takes its name from being the offices of the civil engineer Sir [[Joseph Bazalgette]], who designed London's sewage system. The House of Charity used the Bazalgette room to house its archives,  including all the records of those helped.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Bazalgette Room.jpg|The Bazalgette Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Library Bar ===\n\nThe Library has a Victorian fireplace with the badges of the House of Charity, inscribed with the Charity's founding date, 1846, and 1862, the date the Charity moved into the House.  Between the two badges is a text from the [[Gospel of Matthew]] \"I was a stranger and ye took me in\".\n\nThis is currently the club bar and central hub.\n\n=== The Monro & Garden Rooms ===\n\nThe Monro Room and the Garden Room were created by the Charity out of an extension devised by the Metropolitan Board of works on part of the site of the stables that complimented the Georgian House.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sheppard|first=F.H.W|title=Survey of London XXXIII Parish of St Anne Soho|year=1966|publisher=The Athlone Press, University of London|location=Gower Street, London|page=89}}</ref>\n\nA tavern clock about four feet high and made entirely of black lacquered wood with gold painted numbers hangs in the chapel corridor. The dial of these types of clocks was big and bold enabling them to be seen in dimly lit,  smoke filled taverns.  These clocks were also known as [[Act of Parliament clock]]s because they became popular after the British Parliament passed an Act in 1797 levying a tax on domestic clocks with the result that people relied on public clocks for their time-keeping.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Garden Room.JPG|The Garden Room\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Crinoline Stair===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Crinoline Stairs.jpg|The Crinoline Stairs\n</gallery>\n\n=== The Penny Chute ===\n\nOn the outside of the house is the Penny Chute attached to the railings in Soho Square.  Coins fall down the pipe to the [[alms box]] in the kitchen.  People today still donate to the Charity using this method.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:PennyChute.JPG|Penny Chute\n</gallery>\n\n== The Chapel ==\nThe Chapel was built on the site of the Georgian stable yard between 1862 and 1864 by Edward Conder of Baltic Wharf, Kingsland Road. The architect was [[Joseph Clarke (architect)|Joseph Clarke]] and the original plans for the site included a refectory with dormitories above and a cloister. The Annual Report of 1928 mentions that the plan of the Chapel \"was suggested and partly designed from the plans of a Romanesque chapel attached to the Abbey of Montmajeur, [[Arles]], France.\"\n\nThe cost of building the chapel proved a financial strain to the Charity, and 'in 1864 three chimney pieces were sold from the House.'<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cornforth|first=John|title=The House of St Barnabas In Soho|journal=Country Life|date=6 July 1961|volume=70|series=3357|page=20}}</ref>\n\nThe Chapel is a reminder of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] revival in the [[Church of England]] spearheaded by men like [[John Henry Newman|Newman]], [[Edward Bouverie Pusey|Pusey]] and [[John Keble|Keble]] who published the [[Tracts for the Times]] between 1833-1841, earning them the name [[Tractarians]]. Their followers not only emphasised Catholic aspects of the Church of England but also a return to medieval Gothic architecture after neo-classical churches of the previous two hundred years. In 1848, the then Bishop of London, [[Archibald Tait]], became Visitor to the charity and his successors continue to hold this office. The original plan included a throne for the Bishop behind the altar but, in 1865, Joseph Clarke proposed the mosaics by Harland and Fisher. The advice and support of the Visitor provide a living link between the House of St Barnabas and the Church of England in the [[Diocese of London]].\n\nDuring the Second World War, the original stained glass windows and roof of the Chapel suffered bomb damage. The [[apse]] above the altar was originally painted with the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Christ and the windows commemorated the Charity's founders and supporters. The present windows behind the altar represent, from left to right, St Edward the Confessor; St Barnabas holding the Chapel in his arms; St Paul preaching and St [[John the Baptist]] holding the mother Chapel of Clewer in his arms; they were designed by [[John Hayward (architect)|John Hayward]].<ref name=\"Survey of London: The Parish of St Anne Soho\">{{cite book|last1=Sheppard|first1=F.H.W|title=Survey of London: The Parish of St Anne Soho volume XXXIII|date=1966|publisher=The Athlone Press|location=University of London, Gower Street|page=106}}</ref> The windows in the side apses, dating from 1958, represent the [[Stations of the Cross]] and the [[Annunciation]]. The organ was built by the firm of [[J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd]] in 1875 at a cost of \u00a3250 and was enlarged by them in 1884.  At the west end of the South West apse is a memorial to Captain Henry Norman who died in 1925. He became a porter of the House after retiring as first mate of the [[Cutty Sark]], the tea clipper now at Greenwich.\n\nThe Chapel remains a sacred space for prayer and worship. Although it is an Anglican Chapel, currently there are Roman Catholic services for London's [[Macedonian Orthodox]] community and baptisms and services following civil weddings. The Chapel is also used for concerts and broadcasts \u2014 [[Paloma Faith]] has sung here \u2014 and for photography \u2014 The BBC filmed part of ''The Time Travellers Wife'' in the Chapel.  The charity hosts a Culture Series in the chapel.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:mosaic_hosb.jpg|\nFile:Chapel4.jpg|\nFile:organs_hosb.jpg|\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official|http://hosb.org.uk}}\n* [http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ The House of St Barnabas, registered charity number 207242], at the [http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/find-charities/ Charity Commission]\n\n{{coord|51.5149|N|0.1313|W|source:wikidata-and-enwiki-cat-tree_region:GB|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Grade I listed buildings in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Houses in the City of Westminster]]\n[[Category:Soho, London]]\n[[Category:Soho Square]]\n[[Category:1862 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Grade I listed houses in London]]\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1746]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in London]]\n", "name_user": "DragonflySixtyseven", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:The Drawing Room.jpg\u2192File:The Drawing Room (House of St. Barnabas).jpgthere are hundreds of thousands of drawing rooms.

Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon. ''Grey's Anatomy'' then concluded its 10th season and saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh. The eleventh season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pearce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene. He later dies at another hospital following the doctors' mishandling of his injuries. The season 12 finale saw the departure of one of the show's longest running characters, Callie Torres, played by Sara Ramirez. Altman returns to Seattle at the beginning of the 14th season while Robbins and Kepner depart at the season's end to pursue other career opportunities.

The fictional series focuses on the lives of surgical [[internship (medicine)|interns]], [[residency (medicine)|residents]], and [[attending physician|attending doctor]]s, as they develop into seasoned doctors while trying to maintain personal lives and relationships. The title is an allusion to ''[[Gray's Anatomy]]'', a classic human anatomy textbook first published in 1858 in London and written by [[Henry Gray]]. [[Shonda Rhimes]] developed the pilot and continues to write for the series; she is also one of the executive producers, along with [[Betsy Beers]], [[Mark Gordon]], [[Krista Vernoff]], [[Rob Corn]], [[Mark Wilding]], and [[Allan Heinberg]]. Although the series is set in [[Seattle]] (at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, later renamed), it is filmed primarily in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\nThe series is designed to be racially diverse and uses [[color-blind casting]]. It revolves around the title character, Dr. [[Meredith Grey]], played by [[Ellen Pompeo]], first featured as an intern. The original cast consisted of nine star-billed actors: Pompeo, [[Sandra Oh]], [[Katherine Heigl]], [[Justin Chambers]], [[T. R. Knight]], [[Chandra Wilson]], [[James Pickens Jr.]], [[Isaiah Washington]] and [[Patrick Dempsey]]. The cast has undergone major changes through the series' run, with many members leaving and being replaced by [[List of Grey's Anatomy characters|others]].

Robbins cheats on Torres with a visiting facial reconstruction surgeon. ''Grey's Anatomy'' then concluded its 10th season and saw the departure of one of its major players, Cristina Yang, played by Sandra Oh. The eleventh season also saw the introduction of the new Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Maggie Pearce, Richard's secret daughter with Ellis Grey. Towards the end of the eleventh season, Derek Shepherd witnesses a car accident and pulls over to help the injured, but his car is hit by a truck with him inside as he attempts to leave the scene.

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]]. It is also the 9th [[List of highest-grossing media franchises|highest-grossing media franchise]] of all time, with an estimated revenue above {{US$|36 billion|long=no}}.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Characters ==\n{{Main|List of Mario franchise characters}}\n\n== Video games ==\n{{Main|List of video games featuring Mario}}\n\n=== Origin games ===\n\n==== ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' ====\n{{Main|Donkey Kong (video game)}}\n[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|thumb|125px|A replica of a ''Donkey Kong'' arcade cabinet.]]\n\nAfter the commercial failure of ''[[Radar Scope]]'', Nintendo's company president referred to [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] to create an arcade game to save the company. Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]] was the first original game in the series released on the [[PlayStation 2]], and was released in 1999. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games. It continued on the Wii as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]'', on the 3DS as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and on the [[Wii U]] as ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'' and '' [[New Super Luigi U]]'', with a sequel titled ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe]] on the Nintendo Switch in January, 2020. This gameplay is further offered by the level creator game ''[[Super Mario Maker]]'', released on [[Wii U]] in 2015.

The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' in 1993. The latter lost a large amount of money at the box office and was widely considered to be a [[Box office bomb|failure]].<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. 1993\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=supermariobros.htm |title=Super Mario Bros.

It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990.

Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]]. It is the third and currently last [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] based on the ''Mario'' series. The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. Episodes of ''Super Mario World'' were later shown as part of the [[Television syndication|syndication]] package ''Captain N and the Video Game Masters''. Afterwards, the series was split from ''Captain N'' altogether and shown in time-compressed reruns on ''Mario All-Stars''.\n\n=== Anime ===\n''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen!]]'' is a [[Japan]]ese [[anime]] film released on July 20, 1986.

A [[manga]] adaptation of the film was published in Japan around the same time as the film's release.\n\nA series of three [[Original video animation|OVA]] episodes titled ''[[Amada Anime Series: Super Mario Bros.]]'', based on ''[[Momotar\u014d]]'', ''[[Issun-b\u014dshi]]'' and ''[[Snow White]]'', were released on August 3, 1989.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the ''Mario'' franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''.

It is primarily a [[video game franchise]], with the franchise's other forms of media including several [[List of Mario television series|television series]] and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. It was originally created by game designer [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] with the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', released on July 9, 1981. The games have been developed by a variety of developers including Nintendo, [[Hudson Soft]], and [[AlphaDream Corporation|AlphaDream]]. Most ''Mario'' games have been released for Nintendo's various video game consoles and handhelds, from the [[Third generation of video game consoles|third generation]] onward.\n\nThe main series in the franchise is the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series of [[platform game|platform games]] which mostly follows Mario's adventures in the fictional world of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]]. These games typically rely on Mario's jumping ability to allow him to progress through [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]. The franchise has spawned more than 200 games of various genres and series, including ''[[Mario Kart]]'', ''[[Mario Party]]'', ''[[Mario Tennis]]'', and ''[[Mario Golf (video game)|Mario Golf]]''.\n\nThe ''Mario'' series is one of Nintendo's most renowned and successful franchises; many games in its series, specifically the \"Super Mario\" portion, are considered to be some of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games ever made]]. By 2011, the core ''Super Mario'' video games had grossed an estimated {{US$|12 billion}} in sales.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ryan|first1=Jeff|title=Super Mario: How Nintendo Conquered America|date=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781101517635|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1k-6ksl3uLsC&pg=PT8|language=en}}</ref> More than 600 million copies of ''Mario'' games have been sold, making it the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchise of all time]].

Miyamoto came up with the idea of a game in which the playable character has to make his way through an obstacle course consisting of sloped platforms, ladders and rolling barrels. Miyamoto named the game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', and its main protagonist \"Jumpman\". ''Donkey Kong'' is an early example of the [[platform game|platform]] genre. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game gives the player a [[score (gaming)|score]]. Points are awarded for finishing screens; leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer [[power-up]]; collecting items such as hats, [[parasol]]s, and [[Coin purse|purse]]s (presumably belonging to the Lady/Pauline); and completing other tasks. The game was surprisingly successful.<ref>{{Cite news|date=June 1994|title=|periodical=[[Nintendo Power]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|issue=61|pages=}}</ref> \"Jumpman\" was called \"[[Mario]]\" in certain promotional materials for the game's release overseas;<ref name=\"US Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=316&image=2 |title= Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Nintendo |work= The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate= October 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"France Donkey Kong promo flyer\">{{cite web|url=https://flyers.arcade-museum.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=2950&image=2 |title=Video Game Flyers: Donkey Kong, Karateco |work=The Arcade Flyer Archive |accessdate=October 29, 2018}}</ref> his namesake was [[Mario Segale]], the landlord of [[Nintendo of America]]'s office/warehouse, who barged in on a meeting to demand an overdue rent payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=10 Mario Fun Facts!|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2007/09/22/10-mario-fun-facts/|accessdate=September 29, 2007}}</ref> Eventually Jumpman's name was internationally and permanently changed to Mario. The success of the game spawned several ports, and a sequel, ''[[Donkey Kong Jr.]]'', which is Mario's only appearance as an antagonist. ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' did not feature Mario.\n\n==== ''Mario Bros.'' ====\n{{Main|Mario Bros.}}\n\nThe ''Mario'' branding was used for the first time in a later arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', which introduced Mario's brother, [[Luigi]]. The objective of ''Mario Bros.'' is to defeat all of the enemies in each [[Level (video gaming)|phase]]. Each phase is a series of platforms with four pipes at each corner of the screen, and an object called a \"POW\" block in the center.<ref name=\"NESpg5\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 5 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref><ref name=\"NESpg8\">{{cite book |author=Nintendo |title=Mario Bros. manual |section=pg. 8 |version=Nintendo Entertainment System |year=1983 }}</ref> The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' titles, players cannot jump on enemies until they are flipped over; this can be accomplished by jumping under the platform they are on or by using the \"POW\" block. Both sides of every phase feature a mechanism that allows the player to go off-screen to the left and appear on the right, and vice versa.<ref name=\"NESpg8\" /> The game has since reappeared in various forms, including as a minigame in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' and the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series, and reimagined as ''[[Mario Clash]]''.\n\n==== Game & Watch ====\n{{Main|List of LCD games featuring Mario}}\n\n[[Nintendo]] has released several ''Mario'' and ''[[Donkey Kong]]'' LCD video games for the [[Game & Watch series|Game & Watch line]]. Eleven were released between 1982 and 1994. Nintendo also licensed the release of six LCD games for [[Nelsonic Industries|Nelsonic]]'s Game Watch line between 1989 and 1994. Many remakes of Game & Watch games have changed the protagonist from a generic [[Game & Watch#Mr. Game & Watch|Mr. Game & Watch]] character to Mario.\n\n=== Platform games ===\n==== ''Super Mario'' series ====\n{{Main|Super Mario}}\nMario then became the star of his own side scrolling platform game in [[1985 in video gaming|1985]], titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', which was the pack-in game included with the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. It was also later sold in a package with ''[[Duck Hunt]]''. In [[Japan]], a game titled ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels|Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' was released in [[1986 in video gaming|1986]], but a different [[Super Mario Bros. 2|game with the same name]] was released internationally in [[1988 in video gaming|1988]], followed by ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' later that same year. The Japanese version would subsequently be released in the United States in [[1993 in video gaming|1993]] under the title ''Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels'' as part of the ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' title for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], a console that also features iterations of the game known as ''[[Super Mario World]]''. While ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and two sequels were the [[Game Boy]] installments in the series, the [[Game Boy Advance]] did not receive any original entries, only [[Video game remake|remakes]]. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' debuted as the launch title for the [[Nintendo 64]] console in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' was the series' entry for the [[GameCube]], and ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its [[Super Mario Galaxy 2|sequel]] continued the franchise for the [[Wii]]. ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' was the series' flagship title for [[Nintendo 3DS]]. The [[Wii U]] saw the release of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' would be the first original game in the series to be released on the [[Nintendo Switch]], and was released in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/features/2017/11/8/16621744/the-best-mario-games|title=Ranking the core Super Mario games|first=Jeremy | last=Parish | date=November 8, 2017 | accessdate=November 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, a [[Retrogaming#Modern retrogaming|retro]] throwback sub-series called ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' was inaugurated on the Nintendo DS, featuring the mechanics of the ''Super Mario Bros.'' games.

The player progresses through the game by eliminating all the viruses on the screen in each [[level (video gaming)|level]].\n\n<!-- Titles -->\nThere have been 4 ''[[Dr. Mario]]'' games released for home consoles and two portable games, for a total of six original titles. As the series has progressed, each new game has introduced new elements in order to keep the gameplay fresh such as new game modes. In 2001, ''[[Dr. Mario 64]]'' for the Nintendo 64 introduced new game modes such as a ''Story'' mode, ''Score Attack'' and ''Marathon'', [[Wario]] as a playable character and four-player multiplayer. After a seven-year hiatus, in 2008, ''[[Dr. Mario Express]]'' for the [[Nintendo DSi]]'s [[DSiWare]] service re-introduced the series to the portable gaming market. Also in 2008, ''[[Dr. Mario Online Rx]]'' for the [[Wii]]'s [[WiiWare]] service introduced [[online multiplayer]] to the series.

It is similar to the original ''Mario Bros.'', but featured a new gameplay mechanic of \"punch balls\", small balls which [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]] can kick into enemies to stun them, instead of hitting them from below, as in the original.\n\nHudson Soft was originally responsible for the ''Mario Party'' series until ''[[Mario Party DS]]'' in 2007, but as of March 2012 this has been taken over by [[Nd Cube]] since Hudson has become a part of [[Konami]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Konami acquiring Hudson|url=http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724081748/http://asia.gamespot.com/news/konami-acquiring-hudson-6286645|archivedate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Many of Hudson's employees now work for Nd Cube.\n\n==== Philips ====\nThree games were planned for development by [[Philips|Philips Interactive Media]] for use on its [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] machine: ''[[Super Mario's Wacky Worlds]]'', ''[[Hotel Mario]]'', and ''Mario Takes America''. Only ''Hotel Mario'' was released; ''Super Mario's Wacky Worlds'' and ''Mario Takes America'' were eventually cancelled.

Though the game [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] are based on those in ''Super Mario World'', the level design is based on Earth locations rather than Dinosaur Land. Due to the limitations of the CD-i, several features could not be included in the game, such as large numbers of sprites on the screen, and many visual effects. The nature of the pointing device controller provides difficult controls for Mario, as the game has the default controls of running and jumping.\n\n''Mario Takes America'' was proposed about Mario's trip to Hollywood to make his own movie. The game's concept initially impressed Philips, but was cancelled due to the company being unsatisfied with the game's development progress.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cancelled Mario Game That Was Taken Away By A Bank In Canada|url=https://www.unseen64.net/2014/09/15/mario-takes-america-cdi-cancelled/|website=Unseen64|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''Hotel Mario'' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]] developed by Fantasy Factory and published by Philips Interactive Media for the CD-i in 1994. The primary characters of the game are [[Mario]] and [[Luigi]], who must find [[Princess Peach]] by going through seven [[Bowser (character)|Koopa]] Hotels in the Mushroom Kingdom. Every hotel is divided into multiple stages, and the objective is to close all doors on each stage. The game has been criticized as one of the worst ''Mario''-centered games, mainly because of its [[cutscene]]s and simple gameplay.<ref name=\"instructions2\">{{cite book|year=1994|title=Hotel Mario instruction book|publisher=Philips Interactive Media|id=PP0260 GA|page=3}}</ref><ref name=\"EG\">{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|title=The History of Mario|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/the-history-of-mario-article?page=3|date=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=June 21, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Ubisoft Milan ====\n\n''[[Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle]]'' is a [[turn-based]] [[Tactical role-playing game|tactical role-playing video game]] developed by [[Ubisoft Milan]] (Ubisoft's Italian studio division) for the Nintendo Switch. The game is a [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] with Ubisoft's ''[[Raving Rabbids]]'' franchise, and features both singleplayer and [[local cooperative|cooperative]] multiplayer gameplay. The game's story sees players controlling Mario, his friends, and a group of Rabbids dressed as them, dealing with the aftermath of a sudden invasion by a group of Rabbids, who have accidentally misused a powerful invention that has brought chaos to the Mushroom Kingdom. Shigeru Miyamoto was initially impressed by the prototype of the game, that was presented to him by creative director Davide Soliani in 2014, which later caused Nintendo to greenlight the game for a Nintendo Switch release. It was released in Europe and North America on August 29, 2017, and was met with generally favorable reception from critics, who praised its gameplay, depth, and graphics.\n\n==== Others ====\n[[Electronic Arts]] developed and released ''[[NBA Street V3]]'' and ''[[SSX on Tour]]'' in 2005, both of which included Mario, Luigi, and Peach as playable characters in the GameCube versions.\n\n== Other media ==\n{{Main|List of non-video game media featuring Mario}}\nThe ''Mario'' franchise includes many comics, manga and TV series based on the games. Most were released in the late 1980s to early 1990s, and have since become obscure. Mario, Luigi and Peach have made cameo appearances in two sports games, including the [[GameCube]] version of ''[[NBA Street V3]]''. The series launched two films, the [[anime]] ''[[Super Mario Bros.: Peach-Hime Kyushutsu Dai Sakusen]]'' released in 1986 and the [[live action]] film ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Bros.]]'' in 1993. The latter lost a large amount of money at the box office and was widely considered to be a [[Box office bomb|failure]].<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. 1993\">{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=supermariobros.htm |title=Super Mario Bros.

The show starred King Koopa (also known as [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]), the main antagonist of the ''Mario'' series. The 30-minute program was originally broadcast during the after-school afternoon time-slots on [[Los Angeles]]-based [[KTTV|KTTV Fox 11]].\n\n''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' is the second TV series based on the ''Mario'' NES games. It aired on [[NBC]] from September 8 to December 1, 1990. Based on the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' video game, the cartoon shows Mario, Luigi, Princess Toadstool and Toad fighting against Bowser and his [[Koopalings]], who went by different names on the show (Hip, Hop, Kooky, Kootie Pie, Big Mouth, Cheatsy, and Bully). Like the previous Mario cartoon series, the animation was done by Sei Young Animation Co. Ltd, however this show was co-produced by Reteitalia S.P.A., hence the slight differences in character design.\n\n''[[Super Mario Challenge]]'' was a show which aired on [[The Children's Channel]]. It ran from 1990 to 1991 and aired at 4:30&nbsp;p.m. every weekday. The presenter, [[John Lenahan]], was a lookalike of [[Mario]], and dressed in his clothes. Two guest players had to do tasks, all of which involved playing the ''Mario'' video games ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and, after its release in 1991, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]''. Rounds included challenges to see which player could complete a level in the fastest time and who could collect the most gold coins on a certain level.\n\n''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] based on the [[Super Mario World|SNES video game of the same name]]. It is the third and currently last [[Saturday morning cartoons|Saturday morning cartoon]] based on the ''Mario'' series. The show was originally aired on Saturday mornings on [[NBC]] in the 1991\u201392 season. It was featured in a half-hour time slot with a shortened version of ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]''. Episodes of ''Super Mario World'' were later shown as part of the [[Television syndication|syndication]] package ''Captain N and the Video Game Masters''.

A 1996 article in ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' declared that \"The evolution of the ''Mario'' series led the rest of gaming by the hand, blazing a trail, and teaching lessons in game mechanics, structure, and sheer playability to any who would study its secrets\".\n\n== Setting ==\nMost of Mario's games are set in the fictional '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', but there are other settings which explore more details of the Mario Universe.\n\nThe places introduced in the ''Mario'' franchise are:\n\n* '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', the central kingdom of the universe and the setting of most Mario games. It is usually ruled by '''[[Princess Peach]]'''. The capital of the kingdom is '''Toad Town''', a city that lies below Peach's Castle.\n* '''Subcon''' is the dreamworld that is the setting of [[Super Mario Bros. 2]].\n* '''Bowser's Kingdom''', the kingdom ruled by '''[[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]''', the main antagonist of the series. The kingdom has appeared in several games under different names, and often appears as the final level of the game which it is featured in. The first time this kingdom appears under the name Bowser's Kingdom is in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n* '''Sprixie Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', is home to fairy-like creatures called '''Sprixies'''. It is composed of 8 islands with different themes, with each island being ruled by a Sprixie. It is the main setting of ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''.\n* '''Kingdom of Bask''', introduced in ''[[Mario Tennis Aces]]'', the Kingdom of Bask was ruled by '''King Bask''' until '''Lucien''', the main antagonist of the game, attacked it, forcing King Bask to split his power into Power Stones. It is the main setting of ''Mario Tennis Aces''.\n* '''Sarasaland''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'', is ruled by '''[[Princess Daisy]]''', and is divided into four kingdoms: '''Birabuto Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient Egypt]]), '''Muda Kingdom''' (based on Mu and [[Bermuda]]), '''Easton Kingdom''' (based on Easter Island) and '''Chai Kingdom''' (based on [[Ancient China]]). It is the main setting of ''Super Mario Land''.\n* '''Beanbean Kingdom''', introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'', is governed by '''Queen Bean''' and his son '''Prince Peasley'''. The capital is '''Beanbean Castle Town''', and the kingdom is known to have good relations with the '''[[Mushroom Kingdom]]''', in addition to bordering it. The regions are named after laughter onomatopoeias. Just like the Mushroom Kingdom is mushroom themed, the Beanbean Kingdom is bean themed. It is also home to the famous '''Chuckola Cola'''. The forest where it is produced is named '''Chucklehuck Woods'''. It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga''.\n* '''Pi'illo Island''', formerly known as '''Pi'illo Kingdom''', is introduced in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', and is an island that was ruled by '''Prince Dreambert''' until he and the other Pi'illos were imprisoned by '''Antasma''', the main antagonist of the game. At some undefined time in the past, the island was acquired by '''Dr. Snoozemore'''. At the end of the game, with all the Pi'illos released, the island is once again governed by '''Prince Dreambert.''' It is the main setting of ''Mario & Luigi: Dream Team''.\n* '''Isle Delfino''', introduced in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', is a [[dolphin]]-shaped paradise island somewhere outside the [[Mushroom Kingdom]].

It is a follow up and [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', and is the fifth film in the [[Marvel One-Shots]] short film series. The film is written and directed by [[Drew Pearce]], and is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. It stars [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Scoot McNairy]], [[Lester Speight]], and [[Sam Rockwell]], with Kingsley reprising his role from ''Iron Man 3'', and Rockwell reprising [[Justin Hammer|his role]] from ''[[Iron Man 2]]''. In ''All Hail the King'', a documentary filmmaker interviews the infamous fake terrorist Trevor Slattery from behind bars.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Trevor Slattery]], having been captured at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', is now being held in Seagate Prison. At the prison he is living luxuriously, with his own personal \"butler\" Herman, and other inmates acting as his fan club and protection. Slattery is interviewed by documentary filmmaker [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Jackson Norriss]], who wishes to chronicle the events of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] situation seen in ''Iron Man 3''. Norriss, trying to learn more about Slattery personally, recounts his past from his first casting as a child as well as his starring in a failed [[CBS]] pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Trevor Slattery]]: An inmate at Seagate prison who is the subject of a documentary by Jackson Norriss. Kingsley reprises the role from ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.<ref name=\"Kingsley\" />\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Jackson Norriss]]: <br />A member of the Ten Rings terrorist organization posing as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> In the comics the character's name is spelled 'Norris',<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> while a video released as part of a [[viral marketing]] campaign for ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' in May 2016 revealed that a separate character named Jackson Norris in fact exists elsewhere in the MCU.<ref name=\"WHIHNorris\" /><ref name=\"WHIHNorris2\" />\n* [[Lester Speight]] as Herman:<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> Slattery's butler and protector in Seagate.\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Justin Hammer]]: <br />An inmate at Seagate prison, who was a weapons manufacturer. Rockwell reprises his role from ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" /> On Rockwell's cameo, Pearce explained that both Marvel and Rockwell were \"on board\" for it, but Rockwell was unable to do it due to production on the [[Poltergeist (2015 film)|''Poltergeist'' remake]]. However, during post-production of that film, Rockwell read the script for the short and called Pearce, saying that he was happy to participate if his scenes could be shot in an hour in Toronto. Pearce went to Canada, and \"Rockwell came in and just nailed it.\"<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Matt Gerald]] portrays White Power Dave;<ref name=\"Gerald\" /> [[Crystal the Monkey]] portrays the bar monkey;<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> and [[Allen Maldonado]] portrays Fletcher Heggs,<ref name=\"Maldonado\" /> who has a tattoo of a chess piece on his face as a nod to the comics, where he is a minor character going by \"Knight\".<ref name=\"PearceSR\" />\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sir Ben Kingsley 2012.jpg|left|thumb|upright|After Ben Kingsley was attached to ''All Hail the King'', additional crew members signed on.<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" />]]\n[[Drew Pearce]], the co-screenwriter of ''Iron Man 3'', and producer Stephen Broussard had the idea for the short ''All Hail the King'' during the production of ''Iron Man 3'', to provide \"a fresh take\" on the Mandarin character.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> [[Marvel Studios]] and consultant [[Joss Whedon]] were positive about the short, reliant on [[Ben Kingsley]]'s involvement.<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> In October 2013, Kingsley said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving \"many members of the crew that were involved in ''Iron Man 3''.\"<ref name=\"KingsleySecret\" /> This was later revealed to be the short, written and directed by Pearce.<ref name=\"Kingsley\" />\n\n''Iron Man 3'' director [[Shane Black]] felt Marvel \"saw so many negative things\" surrounding the Mandarin's portrayal, that the short was created as \"an apology to fans who were so angry.\"<ref name=\"ShaneBlack\" /> Though some of the dialogue is written in response to critics of ''Iron Man 3''{{'}}s Mandarin portrayal, the story was written simply as an extension of the Ten Rings and Mandarin storyline featured throughout the ''Iron Man'' films. Pearce wrote the short to be ambiguous enough that the storyline could be further explored in future films or television series. On the Ten Rings, Pearce stated that he found the group to be a \"very powerful\" part of the MCU due to their introduction in the universe's first film, and noted that producer [[Kevin Feige]] was excited to see a member of the organization be \"genuinely vicious\". Because of this, Pearce worked to make the action in the short \"real and brutal\" to juxtapose the more comedic tone leading up to it, which he felt would increase the humor of Kingsley's Slattery anyway given that the character \"does not respond to anything the same way any other right minded human being\" should.<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> Speaking about adding [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] and nods to the comics, Pearce noted that him adding them to the script did not necessarily mean that they were a part of Marvel's bigger plan for the MCU, and said that he enjoyed \"stuff[ing] it full of MCU\" and waiting to see if \"some of it sticks and some of it remains just a kind of charming nod.\"<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> The name ''Caged Heat'' was previously used by Marvel as the [[working title]] for ''Iron Man 3''.<ref name=\"CagedHeatIronMan\" />\n\nThe short was filmed in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" /> with [[Sam Rockwell]]'s cameo filmed in Toronto on a set that was painted to match the Los Angeles shoot.<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" /> Music for the short was composed by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], with the ''Caged Heat'' scenes composed by 1980s TV-music icon [[Mike Post]].<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> The main-on-end [[title sequence]], which was created by Perception, was inspired by ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', and ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'', as well as other [[Kung-Fu]] [[exploitation films]].<ref name=\"PerceptionAHTK\" />\n{{-}}\n\n==Release==\n''All Hail the King'' was released on the digital download release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' on February 4, 2014, and on February 25, 2014 for the Blu-ray release.<ref name=\"AHTK\" /> It was included on the bonus-disc of the \"[[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection]]\" [[box set]], which includes all of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as the other [[Marvel One-Shots]]. The collection features audio commentary by Pearce and Kingsley, and was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nIGN's Cliff Wheatley gave ''All Hail the King'' a 9.4 out of 10. He said that it's \"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it's the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from ''Iron Man 3'' in a sort of referential way, but it's nothing too damaging.\"<ref name=\"IGNAHTK\" />\n\nDevin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death called the short \"another excellent short film from the folks at Marvel Studios\", which he felt deserved to be shown in theaters rather than just released on home media. He felt that the character of Slattery \"was used the perfect amount in ''Iron Man Three'', and giving him more screen time here, in a side project, feels the right way to return to him. Kingsley is having a blast, delivering plenty of wonderful jokes and sinking right into the clueless, egocentric character who represents all of our worst stereotypes of actors.\" Faraci praised the ''Caged Heat'' sequence, as well as Rockwell's cameo, and positively stated on the Mandarin reveal, \"rather than a retcon this feels like an expansion, a pulling back of the curtain to reveal more of the picture.\"<ref name=\"BMDAHTK\" /> Conversely, Andrew Wheeler of [[Comics Alliance]] criticized the short's presentation of homosexuality, given it was Marvel Studio's first attempt to bring [[LGBT]] concepts into the MCU.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"KingsleySecret\">{{cite

[[direct-to-video]] [[short film]] featuring the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) character [[Trevor Slattery]], produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]] on the home media release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''. It is a follow up and [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', and is the fifth film in the [[Marvel One-Shots]] short film series. The film is written and directed by [[Drew Pearce]], and is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of the franchise]]. It stars [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Scoot McNairy]], [[Lester Speight]], and [[Sam Rockwell]], with Kingsley reprising his role from ''Iron Man 3'', and Rockwell reprising [[Justin Hammer|his role]] from ''[[Iron Man 2]]''. In ''All Hail the King'', a documentary filmmaker interviews the infamous fake terrorist Trevor Slattery from behind bars.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Trevor Slattery]], having been captured at the end of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', is now being held in Seagate Prison. At the prison he is living luxuriously, with his own personal \"butler\" Herman, and other inmates acting as his fan club and protection. Slattery is interviewed by documentary filmmaker [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Jackson Norriss]], who wishes to chronicle the events of the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] situation seen in ''Iron Man 3''. Norriss, trying to learn more about Slattery personally, recounts his past from his first casting as a child as well as his starring in a failed [[CBS]] pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ben Kingsley]] as [[Trevor Slattery]]: An inmate at Seagate prison who is the subject of a documentary by Jackson Norriss. Kingsley reprises the role from ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.<ref name=\"Kingsley\" />\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as [[Nighthawk (Marvel Comics)|Jackson Norriss]]: <br />A member of the Ten Rings terrorist organization posing as a documentary filmmaker.<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> In the comics the character's name is spelled 'Norris',<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> while a video released as part of a [[viral marketing]] campaign for ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' in May 2016 revealed that a separate character named Jackson Norris in fact exists elsewhere in the MCU.<ref name=\"WHIHNorris\" /><ref name=\"WHIHNorris2\" />\n* [[Lester Speight]] as Herman:<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> Slattery's butler and protector in Seagate.\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as [[Justin Hammer]]: <br />An inmate at Seagate prison, who was a weapons manufacturer. Rockwell reprises his role from ''[[Iron Man 2]]''.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" /> On Rockwell's cameo, Pearce explained that both Marvel and Rockwell were \"on board\" for it, but Rockwell was unable to do it due to production on the [[Poltergeist (2015 film)|''Poltergeist'' remake]]. However, during post-production of that film, Rockwell read the script for the short and called Pearce, saying that he was happy to participate if his scenes could be shot in an hour in Toronto. Pearce went to Canada, and \"Rockwell came in and just nailed it.\"<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Matt Gerald]] portrays White Power Dave;<ref name=\"Gerald\" /> [[Crystal the Monkey]] portrays the bar monkey;<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> and [[Allen Maldonado]] portrays Fletcher Heggs,<ref name=\"Maldonado\" /> who has a tattoo of a chess piece on his face as a nod to the comics, where he is a minor character going by \"Knight\".<ref name=\"PearceSR\" />\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Sir Ben Kingsley 2012.jpg|left|thumb|upright|After Ben Kingsley was attached to ''All Hail the King'', additional crew members signed on.<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" />]]\n[[Drew Pearce]], the co-screenwriter of ''Iron Man 3'', and producer Stephen Broussard had the idea for the short ''All Hail the King'' during the production of ''Iron Man 3'', to provide \"a fresh take\" on the Mandarin character.<ref name=\"AssemblingAUniverse\" /> [[Marvel Studios]] and consultant [[Joss Whedon]] were positive about the short, reliant on [[Ben Kingsley]]'s involvement.<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> In October 2013, Kingsley said he was working on a secret project with Marvel involving \"many members of the crew that were involved in ''Iron Man 3''.\"<ref name=\"KingsleySecret\" /> This was later revealed to be the short, written and directed by Pearce.<ref name=\"Kingsley\" />\n\n''Iron Man 3'' director [[Shane Black]] felt Marvel \"saw so many negative things\" surrounding the Mandarin's portrayal, that the short was created as \"an apology to fans who were so angry.\"<ref name=\"ShaneBlack\" /> Though some of the dialogue is written in response to critics of ''Iron Man 3''{{'}}s Mandarin portrayal, the story was written simply as an extension of the Ten Rings and Mandarin storyline featured throughout the ''Iron Man'' films. Pearce wrote the short to be ambiguous enough that the storyline could be further explored in future films or television series. On the Ten Rings, Pearce stated that he found the group to be a \"very powerful\" part of the MCU due to their introduction in the universe's first film, and noted that producer [[Kevin Feige]] was excited to see a member of the organization be \"genuinely vicious\". Because of this, Pearce worked to make the action in the short \"real and brutal\" to juxtapose the more comedic tone leading up to it, which he felt would increase the humor of Kingsley's Slattery anyway given that the character \"does not respond to anything the same way any other right minded human being\" should.<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> Speaking about adding [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]] and nods to the comics, Pearce noted that him adding them to the script did not necessarily mean that they were a part of Marvel's bigger plan for the MCU, and said that he enjoyed \"stuff[ing] it full of MCU\" and waiting to see if \"some of it sticks and some of it remains just a kind of charming nod.\"<ref name=\"PearceSR\" /> The name ''Caged Heat'' was previously used by Marvel as the [[working title]] for ''Iron Man 3''.<ref name=\"CagedHeatIronMan\" />\n\nThe short was filmed in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" /> with [[Sam Rockwell]]'s cameo filmed in Toronto on a set that was painted to match the Los Angeles shoot.<ref name=\"PearceEmpire\" /> Music for the short was composed by [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], with the ''Caged Heat'' scenes composed by 1980s TV-music icon [[Mike Post]].<ref name=\"AHTKMovieweb\" /> The main-on-end [[title sequence]], which was created by Perception, was inspired by ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', and ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'', as well as other [[Kung-Fu]] [[exploitation films]].<ref name=\"PerceptionAHTK\" />\n{{-}}\n\n==Release==\n''All Hail the King'' was released on the digital download release of ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' on February 4, 2014, and on February 25, 2014 for the Blu-ray release.<ref name=\"AHTK\" /> It was included on the bonus-disc of the \"[[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Home media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Two Collection]]\" [[box set]], which includes all of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Two|Phase Two]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as well as the other [[Marvel One-Shots]]. The collection features audio commentary by Pearce and Kingsley, and was released on December 8, 2015.<ref name=\"PhaseTwoBoxset\" />\n\n==Reception==\nIGN's Cliff Wheatley gave ''All Hail the King'' a 9.4 out of 10. He said that it's \"a return to the loveable personality of the hapless Trevor and a step forward for the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has its twists that should satisfy both lovers and haters of Trevor Slattery. But it's the approach that Pearce takes with the material, from the kung-fu movie style credit sequences to the light-hearted tone that takes a sudden and jarring turn. Kingsley once again shines in the role of Slattery, aloof and ignorant, but more than happy to slide back into Mandarin mode if it will please his adoring fans. Pearce does go for some of the same jokes from ''Iron Man 3'' in a sort of referential way, but it's nothing too damaging.\"<ref name=\"IGNAHTK\" />\n\nDevin Faraci of Birth.Movies.Death called the short \"another excellent short film from the folks at Marvel Studios\", which he felt deserved to be shown in theaters rather than just released on home media. He felt that the character of Slattery \"was used the perfect amount in ''Iron Man Three'', and giving him more screen time here, in a side project, feels the right way to return to him. Kingsley is having a blast, delivering plenty of wonderful jokes and sinking right into the clueless, egocentric character who represents all of our worst stereotypes of actors.\" Faraci praised the ''Caged Heat'' sequence, as well as Rockwell's cameo, and positively stated on the Mandarin reveal, \"rather than a retcon this feels like an expansion, a pulling back of the curtain to reveal more of the picture.\"<ref name=\"BMDAHTK\" /> Conversely, Andrew Wheeler of [[Comics Alliance]] criticized the short's presentation of homosexuality, given it was Marvel Studio's first attempt to bring [[LGBT]] concepts into the MCU.<ref name=\"Rockwell\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"KingsleySecret\">{{cite

It stars [[Clive Owen]], [[Catherine Keener]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]], and [[Liana Liberato]].\n\nThe film is about a fourteen-year-old girl who becomes a victim of sexual abuse when she befriends a man on the Internet.\n\n==Plot==\nFor her fourteenth birthday, Annie Cameron ([[Liana Liberato]]) receives a laptop from her parents, and she soon meets Charlie in an online [[chat room]]. At first, he states that he is 16 years old but, over time, he confesses he is 20 and then 25. Annie is taken aback at first but comes to believe that the two of them are in love.\n\nAfter two months of communicating electronically, Charlie invites Annie to meet him at the mall. When he ([[Chris Henry Coffey]]) arrives, she discovers that he is a man in his late 30s. Annie is upset at first, but he charms her into going with him to a motel. He makes her try on lingerie that he bought her. When he begins kissing her, she tells him to stop, but he pushes her down onto the bed and [[rape]]s her, filming the ordeal.\n\nAt school, Brittany, Annie's best friend, confronts Annie after having seen her and Charlie at the mall. Brittany is concerned about his age and notifies the school administration. The police arrive and depart with Annie, drawing unwanted attention from fellow students at her high school. The events initiate an [[FBI]] investigation. The FBI have Annie contact Charlie, in an attempt to identify him, but he figures out the ruse and breaks off contact with her before the FBI can trace his location.\n\nAnnie's father, Will ([[Clive Owen]]), slowly becomes obsessed with catching Charlie; he hires a private investigation firm in [[New Jersey]] and even steals a collection of his daughter's chat conversations from the FBI. The private investigation proves fruitless, as it is discovered Charlie masks his IP address so his location shows up as the [[Czech Republic]]. Will's relationship with his daughter and his wife, Lynn ([[Catherine Keener]]), starts to become alienating, and he questions his work at an advertising firm, which uses provocative advertisements involving teenagers.\n\nIn the midst of her father's pursuit of her attacker, Annie begins to see Gail Friedman ([[Viola Davis]]), a hospital counsellor. Annie's so-called \"love\" for Charlie is obstructing her view of what really transpired on the day that they met, and she believes Charlie loves her, too.  Annie later goes back to school. Brittany tries to apologize but Annie refuses to forgive her and orders Brittany never to talk to her again.\n\nDays later, although Charlie has still not been identified, DNA evidence proves he has previously sexually abused several other young girls. After seeing pictures of Charlie's other victims, she flees her home and seeks consolation from Friedman, before finally admitting to herself that she was raped.\n\nThe next day, Annie tries to move on with her life by participating in her school's volleyball game. There, Will sees a man in the crowd taking pictures, whom Will mistakes as one of the men from the registered [[sex offender]] list. Will violently confronts him, but he turns out to be the father of one of Annie's teammates. The assaulted man chooses not to press charges. Will apologizes to the man but Annie feels humiliated. She confronts her father, and insists that she just wants to move on with her life.\n\nAnnie hears from Brittany about a website in which people are belittling the fact that she was raped and posting photo manipulations of her in pornographic poses, as well as revealing her phone number and address. She locks herself in the bathroom at home and attempts suicide by overdosing with pills, unbeknownst to her father, who's still at home. A panicked call from Lynn leads Will to search the house for a semi-conscious Annie. Will forces Annie to vomit up the pills, and she is hastily rushed to a nearby hospital. Brittany spends the night to keep her company, mending their broken friendship.\n\nAnnie wakes up early the next day and discovers her father sitting outside in the freezing cold. He admits that he blames himself for not doing enough to protect her and pleads for her forgiveness, even though he believes he does not deserve it. Annie starts to cry and then embraces him.\n\nAs the credits roll, a home video reveals Charlie to be a high school physics teacher named Graham Weston, a married father with a young son.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Liana Liberato]] as Annie Cameron\n* [[Clive Owen]] as Will Cameron\n* [[Catherine Keener]] as Lynn Cameron\n* [[Viola Davis]] as Gail Friedman, a hospital counselor\n* [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]] as Doug Tate, an FBI agent\n* [[Chris Henry Coffey]] as \"Charlie\" / Graham Weston\n* [[Noah Emmerich]] as Al Hart, Will's boss\n* Spencer Curnutt as Peter, Annie's older brother\n* Aislinn Debutch as Katie Cameron, Annie's younger sister\n* [[Zoe Levin]] as Brittany, Annie's best friend\n\n==Production==\nIn an interview Schwimmer stated that he always wanted Annie to be played by a 14-year-old, as \"there is a danger, if you cast someone who is 18, 19 or 20 to play 14 or 15, that very subtly, almost unconsciously, the audience is, 'Oh, this isn't so bad.'\" He based the film on 14 years of involvement with The Rape Foundation and seven years of research.

It stars [[Clive Owen]], [[Catherine Keener]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]], and [[Liana Liberato]].\n\nThe film is about a fourteen-year-old girl who becomes a victim of sexual abuse when she befriends a man on the Internet.\n\n==Plot==\nFor her fourteenth birthday, Annie Cameron ([[Liana Liberato]]) receives a laptop from her parents, and she soon meets Charlie in an online [[chat room]]. At first, he states that he is 16 years old but, over time, he confesses he is 20 and then 25. Annie is taken aback at first but comes to believe that the two of them are in love.\n\nAfter two months of communicating electronically, Charlie invites Annie to meet him at the mall. When he ([[Chris Henry Coffey]]) arrives, she discovers that he is a man in his late 30s. Annie is upset at first, but he charms her into going with him to a motel. He makes her try on lingerie that he bought her. When he begins kissing her, she tells him to stop, but he pushes her down onto the bed and [[rape]]s her, filming the ordeal.\n\nAt school, Brittany, Annie's best friend, confronts Annie after having seen her and Charlie at the mall. Brittany is concerned about his age and notifies the school administration. The police arrive and depart with Annie, drawing unwanted attention from fellow students at her high school. The events initiate an [[FBI]] investigation. The FBI have Annie contact Charlie, in an attempt to identify him, but he figures out the ruse and breaks off contact with her before the FBI can trace his location.\n\nAnnie's father, Will ([[Clive Owen]]), slowly becomes obsessed with catching Charlie; he hires a private investigation firm in [[New Jersey]] and even steals a collection of his daughter's chat conversations from the FBI. The private investigation proves fruitless, as it is discovered Charlie masks his IP address so his location shows up as the [[Czech Republic]]. Will's relationship with his daughter and his wife, Lynn ([[Catherine Keener]]), starts to become alienating, and he questions his work at an advertising firm, which uses provocative advertisements involving teenagers.\n\nIn the midst of her father's pursuit of her attacker, Annie begins to see Gail Friedman ([[Viola Davis]]), a hospital counsellor. Annie's so-called \"love\" for Charlie is obstructing her view of what really transpired on the day that they met, and she believes Charlie loves her, too.  Annie later goes back to school. Brittany tries to apologize but Annie refuses to forgive her and orders Brittany never to talk to her again.\n\nDays later, although Charlie has still not been identified, DNA evidence proves he has previously sexually abused several other young girls. After seeing pictures of Charlie's other victims, she flees her home and seeks consolation from Friedman, before finally admitting to herself that she was raped.\n\nThe next day, Annie tries to move on with her life by participating in her school's volleyball game. There, Will sees a man in the crowd taking pictures, whom Will mistakes as one of the men from the registered [[sex offender]] list. Will violently confronts him, but he turns out to be the father of one of Annie's teammates. The assaulted man chooses not to press charges. Will apologizes to the man but Annie feels humiliated. She confronts her father, and insists that she just wants to move on with her life.\n\nAnnie hears from Brittany about a website in which people are belittling the fact that she was raped and posting photo manipulations of her in pornographic poses, as well as revealing her phone number and address. She locks herself in the bathroom at home and attempts suicide by overdosing with pills, unbeknownst to her father, who's still at home. A panicked call from Lynn leads Will to search the house for a semi-conscious Annie. Will forces Annie to vomit up the pills, and she is hastily rushed to a nearby hospital.

He admits that he blames himself for not doing enough to protect her and pleads for her forgiveness, even though he believes he does not deserve it.

It charted at number 4 in France and number 2 in Japan.\n\nThe release included the single version of the song followed by an instrumental version. Later on three remixes were made available in special editions of the single. Internationally, it was released as \"I'm Fed Up!\". In [[Japan]], it was released as \"'''Mon bain de mousse'''\" (\"My Foam Bath\") along with a music video and a remix version of the song.\n\n== Background ==\nAliz\u00e9e told [[MTV Spain]] that the song was released as her comeback single because of its upbeat sound.<ref name=\"mtvspain\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQilwjal2TA Interview with Aliz\u00e9e] (in Spanish). [[MTV Spain]]. 8 April 2003.</ref>\n\n== Content ==\n{{original research|section|date=May 2019}}\nInternationally, the song was released as the English language translation and re-recording \"I'm Fed Up!\".\n\nThe title translates roughly as 'I'm fed up with it,' an idiomatic French expression. Marre means \"fed-up-ness\". 'J'ai marre de x' would be a more conventional form, meaning, \"I have fed-up-ness with x\", where x is something one is fed up with. The j'en form leaves x implicit or to context, which changes during the song. 'En' means roughly 'it' or 'that' and is used similarly to the implicit and changing referents of 'that' in Meat Loaf's 'I won't do that'.  The same form is used in the verse 'j'en ris' = 'I am laughing at/about it'.\n\nThe English translation is artistic rather than literal, lacking both the wordplay and some of the darkness of Myl\u00e8ne Farmer's French.  In particular, the French \"extr\u00e9mistes \u00e0 deux balles\" translates literally to \"extremists with two bullets\", where \"bullets\" is also French slang for the old currency \"Francs\", used similarly to \"bucks\" for \"dollars\" or \"quid\" for British \"pounds\".  This suggests English phases such as \"two-penn'orth\", \"two-cents\" or \"two-bit\", as in \"my two penn'orth\", \"just my two cents\" or \"two-bit extremists\", though as a post-9/11 recording, the French \"bullets\" also has a darker echo, reflecting the \"shadow of bombs\" earlier in the song.   The French \"Delits dociles\" is a pun which may mean \"docile offence\" or \"docile delight\", and also echoes \"de lit\", \"of bed\", but the translation does not attempt to render this and replaces it by a simple filler, \"Twisting up my toes\".  The whinging big sister and the idomatic French \"annoying people who roll(drive) at 2km/h\" of the chorus are both replaced by a different character, a stressed-out uncle, with various different but similarly annoying complaints.\n\nThe translation does however introduce some of its own novel English wordplay such as \"I\u2019m foamely ecstatic\", which captures the playfulness and cross-line phrasing of the French the \"mon etat aquatique\" from another section of the song.\n\n==Live performances==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThe song is widely noted for its live TV performance routine which appeared on several French programmes as well as the UK's Top of the Pops.  This featured distinctive choreography featuring a section of notable hip movement which, amongst other reactions, inspired the female Night Elf dance emote in the popular international video game ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video, filmed on 4 February 2003 and directed by [[Olivier Megaton]], premiered 19 February 2003 on [[M6 (television channel)|M6]]. It is the first video for a song from Aliz\u00e9e's second album.

It charted at number 4 in France and number 2 in Japan.\n\nThe release included the single version of the song followed by an instrumental version. Later on three remixes were made available in special editions of the single. Internationally, it was released as \"I'm Fed Up!\". In [[Japan]], it was released as \"'''Mon bain de mousse'''\" (\"My Foam Bath\") along with a music video and a remix version of the song.\n\n== Background ==\nAliz\u00e9e told [[MTV Spain]] that the song was released as her comeback single because of its upbeat sound.<ref name=\"mtvspain\">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQilwjal2TA Interview with Aliz\u00e9e] (in Spanish). [[MTV Spain]]. 8 April 2003.</ref>\n\n== Content ==\n{{original research|section|date=May 2019}}\nInternationally, the song was released as the English language translation and re-recording \"I'm Fed Up!\".\n\nThe title translates roughly as 'I'm fed up with it,' an idiomatic French expression. Marre means \"fed-up-ness\". 'J'ai marre de x' would be a more conventional form, meaning, \"I have fed-up-ness with x\", where x is something one is fed up with. The j'en form leaves x implicit or to context, which changes during the song. 'En' means roughly 'it' or 'that' and is used similarly to the implicit and changing referents of 'that' in Meat Loaf's 'I won't do that'.  The same form is used in the verse 'j'en ris' = 'I am laughing at/about it'.\n\nThe English translation is artistic rather than literal, lacking both the wordplay and some of the darkness of Myl\u00e8ne Farmer's French.  In particular, the French \"extr\u00e9mistes \u00e0 deux balles\" translates literally to \"extremists with two bullets\", where \"bullets\" is also French slang for the old currency \"Francs\", used similarly to \"bucks\" for \"dollars\" or \"quid\" for British \"pounds\".  This suggests English phases such as \"two-penn'orth\", \"two-cents\" or \"two-bit\", as in \"my two penn'orth\", \"just my two cents\" or \"two-bit extremists\", though as a post-9/11 recording, the French \"bullets\" also has a darker echo, reflecting the \"shadow of bombs\" earlier in the song.   The French \"Delits dociles\" is a pun which may mean \"docile offence\" or \"docile delight\", and also echoes \"de lit\", \"of bed\", but the translation does not attempt to render this and replaces it by a simple filler, \"Twisting up my toes\".  The whinging big sister and the idomatic French \"annoying people who roll(drive) at 2km/h\" of the chorus are both replaced by a different character, a stressed-out uncle, with various different but similarly annoying complaints.\n\nThe translation does however introduce some of its own novel English wordplay such as \"I\u2019m foamely ecstatic\", which captures the playfulness and cross-line phrasing of the French the \"mon etat aquatique\" from another section of the song.\n\n==Live performances==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nThe song is widely noted for its live TV performance routine which appeared on several French programmes as well as the UK's Top of the Pops.  This featured distinctive choreography featuring a section of notable hip movement which, amongst other reactions, inspired the female Night Elf dance emote in the popular international video game ''[[World of Warcraft]]''.\n\n==Music video==\nThe video, filmed on 4 February 2003 and directed by [[Olivier Megaton]], premiered 19 February 2003 on [[M6 (television channel)|M6]]. It is the first video for a song from Aliz\u00e9e's second album. During the filming of the clip, the artist harmed her knees due to lack of appropriate protection, which led to a swelling.<ref name=\"mtvspain\" />\n\nIn the video, Aliz\u00e9e, dressed in an erotic red jumpsuit and red thong, is enclosed in a glass cubicle, big enough for her to move freely; this scene represents a [[redfish]] swimming on an [[aquarium]].<ref name=\"mtvspain\" /> Some scenes show her creeping against the glass wall, some show her throwing a tennis ball towards the wall; one particular scene shows her throwing a camera to the ground and smashing it in the process. Throughout the video, water is poured into the cubicle, making Aliz\u00e9e wet. In the middle of the video, i.e. towards the final chorus, Aliz\u00e9e punches the cubicle and it breaks.\n\n==Formats and track listings==\n'''French CD Single'''\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" \u2013 4:35\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (Instrumental Mix) \u2013 5:05\n\n'''French CD maxi single'''\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (Single Version) \u2013 4:35\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (Soft Skin Club Mix) \u2013 7:40\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (Bubbly Club Remix) \u2013 7:50\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (My Goldfish is Under me Remix) \u2013 3:40\n\n'''French 12\" vinyl single'''\n\nA Side:\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (Soft Skin Club Mix) \u2013 7:40\n\nB Side:\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (Bubbly Club Remix) \u2013 7:50\n#\"J'en ai marre !\" (My Goldfish is Under me Remix) \u2013 3:40\n\n==Charts and sales==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (2003)\n!Peak<br/>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|43|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|18|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|5|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|4|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|21|songid=5502|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Hungary|40|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre|year=2003|week=32|accessdate=2010-12-08}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Italy|23|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|Poland ([[Polish Music Charts|Polish Airplay Charts]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pifpaf.com.pl/airplay/lista_27_2003.html |title=Polish Airplay Charts - Lista krajowa 27/2003 |publisher=PiF PaF Production |access-date=November 18, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022144946/http://www.pifpaf.com.pl/airplay/lista_27_2003.html |archive-date=October 22, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"| 5\n|-\n{{singlechart|Sweden|57|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Switzerland|5|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|song=J'en ai marre!|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (2003)\n!Position\n|-\n|Belgium (Ultratop Flanders)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultratop.be/nl/annual.asp?year=2003|title=Jaaroverzichten 2003|publisher=Ultratop|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|98\n|-\n|Belgium (Ultratop Wallonia)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultratop.be/fr/annual.asp?year=2003|title=Rapports Annuels 2003|publisher=Ultratop|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|29\n|-\n|Germany (Official German Charts)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/charts/single-jahr/for-date-2003|title=Top 100 Single-Jahrescharts|language=German|work=GfK Entertainment|publisher=offiziellecharts.de|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|78\n|-\n|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hitparade.ch/charts/jahreshitparade/2003|title=Schweizer Jahreshitparade 2003 \u2013 hitparade.ch|publisher=Hung Medien|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|89\n|}\n\n===Certifications===\n{{Certification Table Top}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=Belgium|award=Gold|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|title=J'en ai marre!|type=single|relyear=2003|certyear=2003}}\n{{Certification Table Entry|region=France|award=Gold|salesamount=256,000|salesref=<ref>[http://www.infodisc.fr/S_Certif_Or.php InfoDisc : Les Certifications (Singles) du SNEP (les Disques d'Or)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330000000/http://www.infodisc.fr/S_Certif_Or.php |date=March 30, 2014 }}</ref>|artist=Aliz\u00e9e|title=J'en ai marre!|type=single}}\n{{Certification Table Bottom|noshipments=yes}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Aliz\u00e9e}}\n\n[[Category:2003 singles]]\n[[Category:Aliz\u00e9e songs]]\n[[Category:Songs with lyrics by Myl\u00e8ne Farmer]]\n", "name_user": "Electrochemiluminescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "removing unnecessary and inappropriate details", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%27en_ai_marre!"}
