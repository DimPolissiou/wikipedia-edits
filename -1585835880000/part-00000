He is a record-holding diver and has participated in numerous archeological dives. He was married to Olga Herdova, fom Czech Republic and has one son Alexandr Herda (*1969), later he was married to Julia Gurkovska and has a daughter, Yana. Doncho Papazov is the author of four books and many documentaries about his voyages. He spent over 20 years working as a journalist for the [[Bulgarian National Television]]. He was also a member of the Coordinating Council of the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]],<ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/UDF_Coordinating_Council_1990 Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces.] ''Demokratsiya Newspaper'', 27 April 1990.</ref> a member of the 36th [[National Assembly of Bulgaria|Ordinary National Assembly]], and deputy chairman of the Union of Bulgarian Journalists (1993\u20131995). He currently resides in Sofia.\n\n\n==The Plankton I Expedition - Sozopol==\n15 days: July 20 - August 3, 1970.\n\nIn this first expedition of the Plankton program,<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct1_en.html Plankton I, Boat Dju II]</ref> Papazov set out to determine whether zoo-plankton can provide sufficient nutrition to survive on in extreme conditions. On board Dju II (a conventional dinghy), he spent 15 days alone off the coast of [[Sozopol]] in the [[Bay of Burgas]] in the [[Black Sea]], eating nothing but plankton. Despite some weight loss, it was determined that plankton can potentially sustain humans in distress.\n\n==The Plankton II Expedition - Across the Black Sea==\n26 days: May 25 - June 6, 1972.\n\nPapazov undertook this expedition along with his wife, Julia Gurkovska (nicknamed Dju, giving her name to all the boats in the Dju series). In 26 days, they crossed the [[Black Sea]] from [[Varna]] to [[Sochi]], aboard a standard keel-less lifeboat, Dju III. This was a continuation of the first plankton experiment, with their on-board diet supplying only 50% of required daily nutrition. Relying on zoo-plankton for the rest was shown to significantly reduce the expected exhaustion in their organisms. This was the first crossing of the Black Sea with a vessel of this caliber.<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct2_en.html Plankton II, Boat Dju III]</ref>\n\n==The Plankton III Expedition - Across the Atlantic==\n63 days: May 8 - July 16, 1974.\n\nThis was the first truly daring expedition that Papazov and his wife undertook.<ref>[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/263539362.html?dids=263539362:263539362&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&date=Mar+21%2C+1974&author=&pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&desc=Researchers+to+sail+Atlantic+using+plankton+for+food&pqatl=google Researchers to sail Atlantic using plankton for food]</ref> On an 8-metre keel-less lifeboat (dubbed Dju IV), they set out to cross the Atlantic from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Cuba]]. The journey was a grueling test of endurance. The two-person crew had to keep 4-hour steering shifts around the clock to ensure the boat didn't flip over in the turbulent [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Unlike most yachts, Dju IV was originally a ship's lifeboat, made of two sheets of plastic bolted together. It was designed to withstand a few days at sea at most, and lacked a weighted keel, which made it prone to flipping and guaranteed that such a flip would be irreversible. The Plankton III voyage marked the first long-haul trip of such a lifeboat.<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct3_en.html Plankton III, Boat Dju IV]</ref> The journey ended successfully in [[Santiago de Cuba]].\n\n==The Plankton IV Expedition - Across the Pacific==\n140 days (100 days at sea): March 17 - August 3, 1976.\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic, Papazov and his wife planned to cross the Pacific in a similar way. Leaning on their experiences with Dju IV, they outfitted their next lifeboat much more carefully. It sported a full deck, an outboard engine which powered a lit compass and their radio and a water pump. The crew had to maintain around-the-clock steering, and faced numerous technical problems.\n\nIn the first days of the expedition, the boat's radio antenna broke, cutting off communication with the outside world and making issuing a distress call impossible. Later the steering oar also broke, and finally, 1000 [[nautical mile|miles]] from  [[Callao]], the aluminum mast snapped in a storm, leaving them to complete the bulk of their journey with a makeshift mast.\n\nDespite all obstacles, they consecutively reached [[Marquesas Islands|the Marquesas]], [[Tahiti]], and [[Samoa]]. After 100 days at sea, their journey ended successfully in [[Fiji]], 14,800&nbsp;km from their starting point in [[Peru]].<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct4_en.html Plankton IV, Boat Dju V]</ref>\n\n==Around Europe With Tivia==\n91 days: September 6 - December 9, 1978.\n\nHaving decided to sponsor Papazov's next voyage, the [[Bulgarian National Television]] purchased a two-mast yacht, model \"Conrad - 45A\", built in [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]] in 1978. In exchange, Papazov was tasked with sailing the yacht from Gda\u0144sk to [[Burgas]] along with a BNT filming crew. The yacht, named Tivia, took the journey around Europe in the winter of 1978, going through the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[Bay of Biscay]], the [[Mediterranean]], and finally the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThe crew consisted of Doncho Papazov, Julia Papazova, their 5-year old daughter Yana, Simeon Idakiev, Boris Siriyski, Rumen Kostov and Peter Andonov. Simeon Idakiev wrote a book about the voyage, capturing all the difficult and comic moments.\n\n==The Plankton V Expedition - Around the World==\n777 days: April 29, 1979 - June 14, 1981.\n\nAmong increased marital strains, Doncho and Julia began preparing for their around-the-world expedition.<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct5_en.html Plankton V, A cruise around the world with the \"Tivia yacht\"(sic)]</ref> No longer on a life boat, the journey would be undertaken on Tivia, and would take two years.

The journey was a grueling test of endurance. The two-person crew had to keep 4-hour steering shifts around the clock to ensure the boat didn't flip over in the turbulent [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Unlike most yachts, Dju IV was originally a ship's lifeboat, made of two sheets of plastic bolted together. It was designed to withstand a few days at sea at most, and lacked a weighted keel, which made it prone to flipping and guaranteed that such a flip would be irreversible. The Plankton III voyage marked the first long-haul trip of such a lifeboat.<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct3_en.html Plankton III, Boat Dju IV]</ref> The journey ended successfully in [[Santiago de Cuba]].\n\n==The Plankton IV Expedition - Across the Pacific==\n140 days (100 days at sea): March 17 - August 3, 1976.\n\nAfter crossing the Atlantic, Papazov and his wife planned to cross the Pacific in a similar way. Leaning on their experiences with Dju IV, they outfitted their next lifeboat much more carefully. It sported a full deck, an outboard engine which powered a lit compass and their radio and a water pump. The crew had to maintain around-the-clock steering, and faced numerous technical problems.\n\nIn the first days of the expedition, the boat's radio antenna broke, cutting off communication with the outside world and making issuing a distress call impossible. Later the steering oar also broke, and finally, 1000 [[nautical mile|miles]] from  [[Callao]], the aluminum mast snapped in a storm, leaving them to complete the bulk of their journey with a makeshift mast.\n\nDespite all obstacles, they consecutively reached [[Marquesas Islands|the Marquesas]], [[Tahiti]], and [[Samoa]]. After 100 days at sea, their journey ended successfully in [[Fiji]], 14,800&nbsp;km from their starting point in [[Peru]].<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct4_en.html Plankton IV, Boat Dju V]</ref>\n\n==Around Europe With Tivia==\n91 days: September 6 - December 9, 1978.\n\nHaving decided to sponsor Papazov's next voyage, the [[Bulgarian National Television]] purchased a two-mast yacht, model \"Conrad - 45A\", built in [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Poland]] in 1978. In exchange, Papazov was tasked with sailing the yacht from Gda\u0144sk to [[Burgas]] along with a BNT filming crew. The yacht, named Tivia, took the journey around Europe in the winter of 1978, going through the [[Baltic Sea]], the [[Bay of Biscay]], the [[Mediterranean]], and finally the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThe crew consisted of Doncho Papazov, Julia Papazova, their 5-year old daughter Yana, Simeon Idakiev, Boris Siriyski, Rumen Kostov and Peter Andonov. Simeon Idakiev wrote a book about the voyage, capturing all the difficult and comic moments.\n\n==The Plankton V Expedition - Around the World==\n777 days: April 29, 1979 - June 14, 1981.\n\nAmong increased marital strains, Doncho and Julia began preparing for their around-the-world expedition.<ref>[http://www.geology.bas.bg/plancton/planct5_en.html Plankton V, A cruise around the world with the \"Tivia yacht\"(sic)]</ref> No longer on a life boat, the journey would be undertaken on Tivia, and would take two years.

The SLA had chosen to kidnap Hearst to increase the news coverage of the incident.<ref name=\"movie\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/index.html ''Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst'']. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Retrieved on January 21, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe SLA issued an ultimatum to the Hearst family: that they would release Patty in exchange for the freedom of Remiro and Little. When such an arrangement proved impossible, the SLA demanded a ransom, in the form of a food distribution program. The value of food to be distributed fluctuated: on February 23 the demand was for $4 million; it peaked at $400 million. Although free food was distributed, the operation was halted when violence erupted at one of the four distribution points.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/> This happened because the crowds were much greater than expected, and people were injured as panicked workers threw boxes of food off moving trucks into the crowd. After the SLA demanded that a community coalition called the Western Addition Project Area Committee be put in charge of the food distribution, 100,000 bags of groceries were handed out at 16 locations across four counties between February 26 and the end of March.<ref name=\"Toobin\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=The_Legacy_of_the_SLA |first=Calvin|last=Welsh|title=The Legacy of the SLA|publisher=Foundsf.org |date=1974-03-25 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Conditions of the initial captivity of Patricia Hearst==\nThe FBI was conducting an unsuccessful search, and the SLA took refuge in a number of safe houses. Hearst later claimed she was subjected to a series of ordeals while in SLA captivity that her mother would later describe as \"brainwashing\". The change in Hearst's politics has been attributed to [[Stockholm syndrome]], a psychological response in which a hostage exhibits apparent loyalty to the abductor. Hearst was later examined by specialist psychologist [[Margaret Singer]], who came to the same conclusion.\n\n[[Terence Hallinan]], the first attorney who represented her, was planning to argue involuntary intoxication, a side effect of which is amnesia.<ref name=\"foundsf.org\" />\n\nHearst's attorney [[F. Lee Bailey]] used the Stockholm syndrome argument as part of the defense at trial. During Hearst's subsequent trial, her lawyer claimed that she had been confined in a closet barely large enough for her to lie down in; that her contact with the outside world was regulated by her captors; and that she was regularly threatened with execution. Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial.<ref name=\"foundsf.org\"/> The SLA claimed to be holding Hearst according to the conditions of the [[Geneva Conventions]].<ref name=\"Toobin\" />\n\n===Political inculcation===\nThe SLA subjected Hearst to indoctrination in SLA ideology. In Hearst's taped recordings, used to announce demands and conditions, Hearst can first be heard extemporaneously expressing SLA ideology on day 13 of her capture.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/>\n\nWith each successive taped communiqu\u00e9, Hearst voiced increasing support for the aims of the SLA. She eventually denounced her former life, her parents, and fianc\u00e9. She later claimed that at that point, when the SLA had ostensibly given her the option of being released or joining the SLA, she had believed she would be killed if she turned them down. She began using the [[nom de guerre]] \"Tania\", after Che Guevara's associate \"[[Tamara Bunke|Tania the Guerilla]]\".\n\n==Activities during the period of Hearst's membership==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Hearst-hibernia.jpg|thumb|220px|Patricia Hearst (right) during the April 1974 Hibernia bank robbery.]] -->\n[[File:Hearst-hibernia-yell.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Patty Hearst]] (right) yelling commands at bank customers.

She has denied willing involvement in the robbery in her book ''Every Secret Thing''. The group was able to get away with over $10,000.<ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite web |date= 2005-02-16|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/gallery/index.html|title = Gallery: The Hibernia Bank Robbery |publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| accessdate = 2007-08-18 | last= |quote=}}</ref> (Hearst was later sentenced to 7 years in prison for her involvement in the robbery. Her sentence was later commuted by [[Jimmy Carter]] and her crime eventually pardoned by [[Bill Clinton]].)\n\n===Move to Los Angeles and police shootout===<!-- This section is linked from [[SWAT]] -->\nThe SLA believed that its future depended on its ability to acquire new members and realized that, because of the killing of Marcus Foster, few if any people in the Bay Area underground wished to join them. Cinque suggested moving the organization to his former neighborhood in Los Angeles, where he had friends who they might recruit. However, they had difficulty becoming established in the new area. The SLA relied on commandeering housing and supplies in Los Angeles, and thus alienated the people who were ensuring their secrecy and protection. At this stage, the imprisoned SLA member Russell Little said that he believed the SLA had entirely lost sight of its goals and had entered into a confrontation with the police rather than a political dialogue with the public.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/>\n\nOn May 16, 1974, \"Teko\" and \"Yolanda\" ([[William Harris (Symbionese Liberation Army)|William]] and [[Emily Harris]]) entered Mel's Sporting Goods Store in the Los Angeles suburb of [[Inglewood, California]], to shop for supplies. While Yolanda made the purchases, Teko on a whim decided to shoplift a bandolier.<ref name=\"Toobin\" /> When a security guard confronted him, Teko brandished a revolver. The guard knocked the gun out of his hand and placed a handcuff on William's left wrist. Hearst, on armed lookout from the group's van across the street, began shooting up the store's overhead sign. Everyone in the store but the Harrises took cover, and the Harrises fled the store and drove off with Hearst.\n\nAs a result of the SLA's botched shoplifting incident, the police acquired the address of the safe house from a parking ticket in the glove box of the van, which had been abandoned. The rest of the SLA fled the safe house when they saw the events on the news. The SLA took over a house occupied by Christine Johnson and Minnie Lewisin. One of the people in the house at the time was a then-17-year-old neighbor named Brenda Daniels, who was sleeping on the couch. Daniels recalls the events that day:\n\n{{quote|I went down to Minnie's every Thursday evening to play some cards and drink a little. I fell asleep early and when I woke up around two A.M. I saw four white women and three dudes\u2014two blacks and one white. I saw guns spread out all over the floor, an' I asked them why they had guns, more than I'd ever seen in my life. They didn't answer, and, instead, the black dude asked me my name and then introduced me to everyone.\n\n[When asked if Patty Hearst was there]\n\nMan, how can I tell? All white women look the same to me.|Brenda Daniels<ref name=\"presslord\"/>}}\n\nThe next day, an anonymous phone call to the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) stated that several heavily armed people were staying at the caller's daughter's house. That afternoon, more than 400 LAPD officers, under the command of Captain [[Mervin King]], along with the FBI, [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD), [[California Highway Patrol]] (CHP), and [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] (LAFD), surrounded the neighborhood. The leader of a [[SWAT]] team used a bullhorn to announce, \"Occupants of 1466 East 54th Street, this is the Los Angeles Police Department speaking. Come out with your hands up!\" A young child walked out, along with an older man. The man stated that no one else was in the house, but the child intervened stating that several people were in the house with guns and ammo belts. After several more attempts to get anyone else to leave the house, a member of the SWAT team fired [[tear gas]] projectiles into the house. This was answered by heavy bursts of automatic gunfire, and a violent gun battle began. The police were firing semi-automatic [[AR-15]] and [[AR-180]] rifles. The SLA members were armed with [[M1 Carbine]]s, which had been converted to fully automatic fire. Police also reported that the SLA had created homemade grenades from 35mm film canisters, and had thrown them at responding officers.\n\nDuring the shootout, police continued to fire dozens of tear-gas grenades into the home, trying to flush out the SLA members. About two hours into the shootout, the house caught fire, probably due to an exploding tear gas canister. As the house began to burn, two women left from the rear of the house and one came out the front (she had come in drunk the previous night, passed out, and woken up in the middle of the siege); all were taken into custody, but were found not to be SLA members. Automatic weapons fire continued from the house. At this point, Nancy Ling Perry and [[Camilla Hall]] came out of the house. [[Lake Headley|Investigators]] working for their parents would claim that they walked out intending to surrender and that they were unarmed but police later stated that Hall was shot in the head by police as she aimed a weapon towards them while Perry was providing covering fire.<ref name=\"presslord\">Bryan, John.

Perry followed Hall out of the house, firing a pistol at officers as she emerged, and was shot twice.

The coroner's report concluded that Donald DeFreeze committed suicide by shooting himself in the side of the head. After the shooting stopped and the fire was extinguished, 19 firearms\u2014including rifles, pistols, and shotguns\u2014were recovered. Thousands of rounds had been fired out of the house by the SLA and police in response had fired several thousands of rounds into the house. This remains one of the largest police shootouts in U.S. history with a reported total of over 9,000 rounds being fired (4,000 by the SLA and 5,000 by police). Every round fired by SLA members at the police missed the officers. There were no casualties among law enforcement, firefighters, and civilians.\n\nThe SLA dead were: Nancy Ling Perry (\"Fahizah\"), Angela Atwood (\"General Gelina\"), Camilla Hall (\"Gabi\"), [[Willie Wolfe]] (\"Kahjoh\", misspelled by the media at the time as \"Cujo\"),<ref name=\"cujo/kahjoh\">''The Voices of Guns'', p. 286.</ref> Donald DeFreeze (\"Cinque\"), and Patricia Soltysik (\"Mizmoon,\" \"Zoya\"). All but one of the bodies were found huddled in a crawl space under the house, which had burned down around them.\n\nNew broadcasting technology (smaller portable cameras and more nimble and versatile mobile units that made it easier to cover unfolding news events) had recently been acquired by area TV stations, so Hearst and the Harrises were able to watch the televised siege live from their hotel room in [[Anaheim]].\n\nPolice allegedly consulted [[psychics]] in searching for Hearst.<ref name=\"esp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.spr.ac.uk/publication/reality-esp-physicist's-proof-psychic-abilities|title=The Reality of ESP: A Physicist's Proof of Psychic Abilities\n|website=Spr.ac.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"reason\">{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2016/10/08/was-patty-hearst-brainwashed/1|title=Was Patty Hearst Brainwashed?|author=Glenn Garvin|website=Reason.com|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Return to the Bay Area===\nAs a result of the siege, the remaining SLA members returned to the relative safety of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and protection of [[student radical]] households. At this time, a number of new members gravitated towards the SLA.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/> The active participants at this time were: Bill and Emily Harris, Patty Hearst, [[Wendy Yoshimura]], siblings Steve and Kathleen Soliah, [[James Kilgore]] (Kathleen Soliah's boyfriend) and Michael Bortin.\n\n===Crocker Bank robbery===\nOn April 21, 1975, the remaining members of the SLA robbed the [[Crocker National Bank]] in [[Carmichael, California]]. During the robbery, bank customer Myrna Lee Opsahl, a 42-year-old mother of four children, was killed when Emily Harris discharged the shotgun she was holding, apparently by accident. Five SLA members were ultimately held accountable for the murder and robbery, but not until almost 27 years later, in early 2002.<ref name=\"judgement\">{{cite news |date= November 8, 2002 |url = http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/SLA-s-judgment-day-Four-members-of-radical-70s-2773569.php|title = SLA's judgment day / '70s group plead guilty in deadly bank robbery|newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle| accessdate = 2017-07-16 }}</ref><ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news |date= January 17, 2002 <!--22:22 GMT-->|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1765993.stm|title = America's hippy extremists|publisher = BBC| accessdate = 2007-08-18 | last=Sarah Brown |quote=[Hearst] Customer Myrna Opsahl was shot dead as she stood depositing church receipts, killing her instantly.}}</ref>\n[[File:Emily Harris (SLA).jpg|thumb|Emily Harris 1975 mugshot]]\n\n===Capture and conviction===\nPatricia Hearst, after a long and highly publicized search, was captured on September 18, 1975, along with the Harrises, Steven Soliah, and Yoshimura, all rounded up in San Francisco safe houses.

The devices did not detonate.\n\n[[File:1795Hillcrest.jpg|thumb|left|The house where Soliah lived as a fugitive in St. Paul, Minnesota]]\nSoliah went on the run, moving to [[Minnesota]], and living a quiet upper middle class life under the alias [[Sara Jane Olson]]; she married a doctor and had three daughters, while managing to remain a fugitive for over 23 years.\n\nThe FBI caught up with and arrested Soliah/Olson in 1999 after a tip was received by the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', which had twice aired her profile. In 2001, she pleaded guilty to possession of explosives with the intent to murder and was sentenced to two consecutive terms of ten years to life, although she had been told as part of a plea bargain that she would serve no more than eight years. She attempted to change her plea, claiming to the judge that she pleaded guilty only because she believed she could not receive a fair trial for bombing charges considering public sentiment after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]]. She maintained her innocence, insisting that she personally had had nothing to do with making, possessing or placement of the pipe bombs. The judge refused her request.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/11/14/MN113298.DTL&type=printable \"Now ex-fugitive Olson wants to stand trial\"], Larry D. Hatfield, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 14, 2001</ref>\n\nThe Opsahl murder/Crocker bank robbery [[cold case]] was finally pursued due to new evidence brought forth through the efforts of the Los Angeles deputy district attorneys, who had prosecuted Olson. On January 16, 2002, first-degree murder charges for the killing of Myrna Opsahl were filed against Sara Jane Olson, Emily Harris, William Harris, Michael Bortin, and James Kilgore. All were living \"above ground\" and were immediately arrested except for Kilgore, who remained at large for nearly another year, in South Africa.\n\nOn November 7, 2002, Olson, the Harrises, and Bortin pleaded guilty to reduced second-degree murder charges. Emily Harris, now known as Emily Montague, admitted to being the one holding the murder weapon but said that the shotgun had gone off accidentally. Hearst had claimed that Montague had dismissed the murder at the time saying, \"She was a bourgeois pig anyway. Her husband is a doctor.\" In court, Montague denied having said this and added, \"I do not want [the Opsahl family] to believe that we ever considered her life insignificant.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSentences were handed down on February 14, 2003, in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], California, for all four defendants in the Opsahl murder case. Montague was sentenced to eight years for the murder (2nd degree). Her former husband, William Harris, was sentenced to seven years, and Bortin to six years. Olson was sentenced to six years, adding two consecutively to the 14-year sentence she had already received. All sentences were the maximum allowed under their plea bargains.\n\nOn November 8, 2002, [[James Kilgore]], who had been a fugitive since 1975, was arrested in [[South Africa]] and extradited to the United States to face federal explosives and passport fraud charges. Prosecutors alleged that a pipe bomb had been found in Kilgore's apartment in 1975 and that he had obtained a passport under a false name. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 2003.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nSara Jane Olson was expecting to receive a sentence of 5 years and 4 months, but \"in stiffening Olson's sentence ..., the prison board turned to a seldom-used section of state law, allowing it to recalculate sentences for old crimes in light of new, tougher sentencing guidelines.\"<ref name=\"courttv2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/soliah/090804_reduce_ap.html|title=Ex-SLA member gets sentence reduced in attempted bombings|date=September 8, 2004 <!-- 10:27 a.m. ET -->|publisher=Court TV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909100347/http://courttv.com/trials/soliah/090804_reduce_ap.html|archive-date=2004-09-09|url-status=dead|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> Olson was sentenced to 14 years\u2014 later reduced to 13 years\u2014plus six years for her role in the Opsahl killing.

He sought refuge among these contacts, and ended up at a commune known as Peking House in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

The FBI did not take any precautions, and the SLA did not act until a month later.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/> On February 4, 1974, publishing heiress Patricia Hearst, a sophomore at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], was kidnapped from her Berkeley residence at Apartment 4, 2603 Benvenue Avenue. The kidnapping occurred less than three months after a November 1973 ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' story in the \"Society\" section announcing the Hearst\u2013Steven Weed betrothal (with the apartment's address given). The SLA had chosen to kidnap Hearst to increase the news coverage of the incident.<ref name=\"movie\">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/index.html ''Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst'']. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Retrieved on January 21, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe SLA issued an ultimatum to the Hearst family: that they would release Patty in exchange for the freedom of Remiro and Little. When such an arrangement proved impossible, the SLA demanded a ransom, in the form of a food distribution program. The value of food to be distributed fluctuated: on February 23 the demand was for $4 million; it peaked at $400 million. Although free food was distributed, the operation was halted when violence erupted at one of the four distribution points.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/> This happened because the crowds were much greater than expected, and people were injured as panicked workers threw boxes of food off moving trucks into the crowd. After the SLA demanded that a community coalition called the Western Addition Project Area Committee be put in charge of the food distribution, 100,000 bags of groceries were handed out at 16 locations across four counties between February 26 and the end of March.<ref name=\"Toobin\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=The_Legacy_of_the_SLA |first=Calvin|last=Welsh|title=The Legacy of the SLA|publisher=Foundsf.org |date=1974-03-25 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Conditions of the initial captivity of Patricia Hearst==\nThe FBI was conducting an unsuccessful search, and the SLA took refuge in a number of safe houses. Hearst later claimed she was subjected to a series of ordeals while in SLA captivity that her mother would later describe as \"brainwashing\". The change in Hearst's politics has been attributed to [[Stockholm syndrome]], a psychological response in which a hostage exhibits apparent loyalty to the abductor. Hearst was later examined by specialist psychologist [[Margaret Singer]], who came to the same conclusion.\n\n[[Terence Hallinan]], the first attorney who represented her, was planning to argue involuntary intoxication, a side effect of which is amnesia.<ref name=\"foundsf.org\" />\n\nHearst's attorney [[F. Lee Bailey]] used the Stockholm syndrome argument as part of the defense at trial. During Hearst's subsequent trial, her lawyer claimed that she had been confined in a closet barely large enough for her to lie down in; that her contact with the outside world was regulated by her captors; and that she was regularly threatened with execution. Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial.<ref name=\"foundsf.org\"/> The SLA claimed to be holding Hearst according to the conditions of the [[Geneva Conventions]].<ref name=\"Toobin\" />\n\n===Political inculcation===\nThe SLA subjected Hearst to indoctrination in SLA ideology. In Hearst's taped recordings, used to announce demands and conditions, Hearst can first be heard extemporaneously expressing SLA ideology on day 13 of her capture.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/>\n\nWith each successive taped communiqu\u00e9, Hearst voiced increasing support for the aims of the SLA. She eventually denounced her former life, her parents, and fianc\u00e9. She later claimed that at that point, when the SLA had ostensibly given her the option of being released or joining the SLA, she had believed she would be killed if she turned them down. She began using the [[nom de guerre]] \"Tania\", after Che Guevara's associate \"[[Tamara Bunke|Tania the Guerilla]]\".\n\n==Activities during the period of Hearst's membership==\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Hearst-hibernia.jpg|thumb|220px|Patricia Hearst (right) during the April 1974 Hibernia bank robbery.]] -->\n[[File:Hearst-hibernia-yell.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Patty Hearst]] (right) yelling commands at bank customers.

Cinque suggested moving the organization to his former neighborhood in Los Angeles, where he had friends who they might recruit. However, they had difficulty becoming established in the new area. The SLA relied on commandeering housing and supplies in Los Angeles, and thus alienated the people who were ensuring their secrecy and protection. At this stage, the imprisoned SLA member Russell Little said that he believed the SLA had entirely lost sight of its goals and had entered into a confrontation with the police rather than a political dialogue with the public.<ref name=\"Guerrilla 2004\"/>\n\nOn May 16, 1974, \"Teko\" and \"Yolanda\" ([[William Harris (Symbionese Liberation Army)|William]] and [[Emily Harris]]) entered Mel's Sporting Goods Store in the Los Angeles suburb of [[Inglewood, California]], to shop for supplies. While Yolanda made the purchases, Teko on a whim decided to shoplift a bandolier.<ref name=\"Toobin\" /> When a security guard confronted him, Teko brandished a revolver. The guard knocked the gun out of his hand and placed a handcuff on William's left wrist. Hearst, on armed lookout from the group's van across the street, began shooting up the store's overhead sign. Everyone in the store but the Harrises took cover, and the Harrises fled the store and drove off with Hearst.\n\nAs a result of the SLA's botched shoplifting incident, the police acquired the address of the safe house from a parking ticket in the glove box of the van, which had been abandoned. The rest of the SLA fled the safe house when they saw the events on the news. The SLA took over a house occupied by Christine Johnson and Minnie Lewisin. One of the people in the house at the time was a then-17-year-old neighbor named Brenda Daniels, who was sleeping on the couch. Daniels recalls the events that day:\n\n{{quote|I went down to Minnie's every Thursday evening to play some cards and drink a little. I fell asleep early and when I woke up around two A.M. I saw four white women and three dudes\u2014two blacks and one white. I saw guns spread out all over the floor, an' I asked them why they had guns, more than I'd ever seen in my life.

All white women look the same to me.|Brenda Daniels<ref name=\"presslord\"/>}}\n\nThe next day, an anonymous phone call to the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] (LAPD) stated that several heavily armed people were staying at the caller's daughter's house. That afternoon, more than 400 LAPD officers, under the command of Captain [[Mervin King]], along with the FBI, [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD), [[California Highway Patrol]] (CHP), and [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] (LAFD), surrounded the neighborhood. The leader of a [[SWAT]] team used a bullhorn to announce, \"Occupants of 1466 East 54th Street, this is the Los Angeles Police Department speaking. Come out with your hands up!\" A young child walked out, along with an older man. The man stated that no one else was in the house, but the child intervened stating that several people were in the house with guns and ammo belts. After several more attempts to get anyone else to leave the house, a member of the SWAT team fired [[tear gas]] projectiles into the house. This was answered by heavy bursts of automatic gunfire, and a violent gun battle began. The police were firing semi-automatic [[AR-15]] and [[AR-180]] rifles. The SLA members were armed with [[M1 Carbine]]s, which had been converted to fully automatic fire. Police also reported that the SLA had created homemade grenades from 35mm film canisters, and had thrown them at responding officers.\n\nDuring the shootout, police continued to fire dozens of tear-gas grenades into the home, trying to flush out the SLA members. About two hours into the shootout, the house caught fire, probably due to an exploding tear gas canister. As the house began to burn, two women left from the rear of the house and one came out the front (she had come in drunk the previous night, passed out, and woken up in the middle of the siege); all were taken into custody, but were found not to be SLA members. Automatic weapons fire continued from the house. At this point, Nancy Ling Perry and [[Camilla Hall]] came out of the house. [[Lake Headley|Investigators]] working for their parents would claim that they walked out intending to surrender and that they were unarmed but police later stated that Hall was shot in the head by police as she aimed a weapon towards them while Perry was providing covering fire.<ref name=\"presslord\">Bryan, John.

The coroner's report concluded that Donald DeFreeze committed suicide by shooting himself in the side of the head. After the shooting stopped and the fire was extinguished, 19 firearms\u2014including rifles, pistols, and shotguns\u2014were recovered. Thousands of rounds had been fired out of the house by the SLA and police in response had fired several thousands of rounds into the house. This remains one of the largest police shootouts in U.S. history with a reported total of over 9,000 rounds being fired (4,000 by the SLA and 5,000 by police). Every round fired by SLA members at the police missed the officers. There were no casualties among law enforcement, firefighters, and civilians.\n\nThe SLA dead were: Nancy Ling Perry (\"Fahizah\"), Angela Atwood (\"General Gelina\"), Camilla Hall (\"Gabi\"), [[Willie Wolfe]] (\"Kahjoh\", misspelled by the media at the time as \"Cujo\"),<ref name=\"cujo/kahjoh\">''The Voices of Guns'', p. 286.</ref> Donald DeFreeze (\"Cinque\"), and Patricia Soltysik (\"Mizmoon,\" \"Zoya\"). All but one of the bodies were found huddled in a crawl space under the house, which had burned down around them.\n\nNew broadcasting technology (smaller portable cameras and more nimble and versatile mobile units that made it easier to cover unfolding news events) had recently been acquired by area TV stations, so Hearst and the Harrises were able to watch the televised siege live from their hotel room in [[Anaheim]].\n\nPolice allegedly consulted [[psychics]] in searching for Hearst.<ref name=\"esp\">{{cite web|url=https://www.spr.ac.uk/publication/reality-esp-physicist's-proof-psychic-abilities|title=The Reality of ESP: A Physicist's Proof of Psychic Abilities\n|website=Spr.ac.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"reason\">{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2016/10/08/was-patty-hearst-brainwashed/1|title=Was Patty Hearst Brainwashed?|author=Glenn Garvin|website=Reason.com|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Return to the Bay Area===\nAs a result of the siege, the remaining SLA members returned to the relative safety of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and protection of [[student radical]] households.

During the robbery, bank customer Myrna Lee Opsahl, a 42-year-old mother of four children, was killed when Emily Harris discharged the shotgun she was holding, apparently by accident.

The devices did not detonate.\n\n[[File:1795Hillcrest.jpg|thumb|left|The house where Soliah lived as a fugitive in St. Paul, Minnesota]]\nSoliah went on the run, moving to [[Minnesota]], and living a quiet upper middle class life under the alias [[Sara Jane Olson]]; she married a doctor and had three daughters, while managing to remain a fugitive for over 23 years.\n\nThe FBI caught up with and arrested Soliah/Olson in 1999 after a tip was received by the television show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', which had twice aired her profile. In 2001, she pleaded guilty to possession of explosives with the intent to murder and was sentenced to two consecutive terms of ten years to life, although she had been told as part of a plea bargain that she would serve no more than eight years. She attempted to change her plea, claiming to the judge that she pleaded guilty only because she believed she could not receive a fair trial for bombing charges considering public sentiment after the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]]. She maintained her innocence, insisting that she personally had had nothing to do with making, possessing or placement of the pipe bombs. The judge refused her request.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/11/14/MN113298.DTL&type=printable \"Now ex-fugitive Olson wants to stand trial\"], Larry D.

On January 16, 2002, first-degree murder charges for the killing of Myrna Opsahl were filed against Sara Jane Olson, Emily Harris, William Harris, Michael Bortin, and James Kilgore. All were living \"above ground\" and were immediately arrested except for Kilgore, who remained at large for nearly another year, in South Africa.\n\nOn November 7, 2002, Olson, the Harrises, and Bortin pleaded guilty to reduced second-degree murder charges. Emily Harris, now known as Emily Montague, admitted to being the one holding the murder weapon but said that the shotgun had gone off accidentally. Hearst had claimed that Montague had dismissed the murder at the time saying, \"She was a bourgeois pig anyway. Her husband is a doctor.\" In court, Montague denied having said this and added, \"I do not want [the Opsahl family] to believe that we ever considered her life insignificant.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSentences were handed down on February 14, 2003, in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], California, for all four defendants in the Opsahl murder case. Montague was sentenced to eight years for the murder (2nd degree). Her former husband, William Harris, was sentenced to seven years, and Bortin to six years. Olson was sentenced to six years, adding two consecutively to the 14-year sentence she had already received. All sentences were the maximum allowed under their plea bargains.\n\nOn November 8, 2002, [[James Kilgore]], who had been a fugitive since 1975, was arrested in [[South Africa]] and extradited to the United States to face federal explosives and passport fraud charges. Prosecutors alleged that a pipe bomb had been found in Kilgore's apartment in 1975 and that he had obtained a passport under a false name. He pleaded guilty to the charges in 2003.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nSara Jane Olson was expecting to receive a sentence of 5 years and 4 months, but \"in stiffening Olson's sentence ..., the prison board turned to a seldom-used section of state law, allowing it to recalculate sentences for old crimes in light of new, tougher sentencing guidelines.\"<ref name=\"courttv2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/soliah/090804_reduce_ap.html|title=Ex-SLA member gets sentence reduced in attempted bombings|date=September 8, 2004 <!-- 10:27 a.m. ET -->|publisher=Court TV|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040909100347/http://courttv.com/trials/soliah/090804_reduce_ap.html|archive-date=2004-09-09|url-status=dead|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> Olson was sentenced to 14 years\u2014 later reduced to 13 years\u2014plus six years for her role in the Opsahl killing.
