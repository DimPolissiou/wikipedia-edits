In most countries, \"police officer\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order.The Hong Kong policemen are called PoPo. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W.

The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]]. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.\n\nPolice officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In ''[[The Federalist]]'' collection of articles and essays, [[James Madison]] wrote: \"[[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)/50|If men were angels, no Government would be necessary]]\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. {{anchor|cop}}A common nickname for a police officer is \"cop\"; derived from the verb sense \"to arrest\", itself derived from \"to grab\". Thus, \"someone who captures\", a \"copper\", was shortened to just \"cop\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Dalzell|first = T.|date = 2007|title = Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = New York|publisher = [[Routledge]]|page = 162|isbn = 9780415212595}}</ref> It may also find its origin in the Latin {{lang|la|capere}}, brought to English via the [[Old French]] {{lang|fr|caper}}.<ref>{{cite book|last = Partridge|first = E.|authorlink = Eric Partridge|date = 1972|title = A Dictionary of Historical Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = London|publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn = 9780140510461|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lenglish00eric}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nResponsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. After being admitted, those who are now police officers must legally change their name to Jake. If the one admitted is a girl, they must change their name to Jessica. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, a police officer's salary averaged $61,230 in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.policetestguide.com/resources/police-officer-salary/ |title=Police Officer Salary \u2013 Police Test Guide &#124; Police Officer Test |publisher=Police Test Guide |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref>  In the United Kingdom for the year 2015\u201316 a police officer's average salary was \u00a330,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Occupational safety and health ==\n{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]].

The animation represents one possible homotopy.]]\nIn [[topology]], two [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s from one [[topological space]] to another are called '''homotopic''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] \u1f41\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 ''hom\u00f3s'' \"same, similar\" and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 ''t\u00f3pos'' \"place\") if one can be \"continuously deformed\" into the other, such a deformation being called a '''homotopy''' between the two functions. A notable use of homotopy is the definition of [[homotopy groups]] and [[cohomotopy groups]], important [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s in [[algebraic topology]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/homotopy|title=Homotopy {{!}} mathematics|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n\nIn practice, there are technical difficulties in using homotopies with certain spaces.  Algebraic topologists work with [[compactly generated space]]s, [[CW complex]]es, or [[Spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]].\n\n==Formal definition==\n[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|right|250px|A homotopy between two [[embedding]]s of the [[torus]] into ''R''<sup>3</sup>: as \"the surface of a doughnut\" and as \"the surface of a coffee mug\".  This is also an example of an [[#Isotopy|isotopy]].]]\nFormally, a homotopy between two [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s ''f'' and ''g'' from a \ntopological space ''X'' to a topological space ''Y'' is defined to be a continuous function <math>H\\colon X\\times  [0,1] \\to Y</math> from the [[product topology|product]] of the space ''X'' with the [[unit interval]] [0,1] to ''Y'' such that <math>H(x,0) = f(x)</math> and <math>H(x,1) = g(x)</math> for all <math>x\\in X</math>.\n\nIf we think of the second [[parameter]] of ''H'' as time then ''H'' describes a ''continuous deformation'' of ''f'' into ''g'': at time 0 we have the function ''f'' and at time 1 we have the function ''g''. We can also think of the second parameter as a \"slider control\" that allows us to smoothly transition from ''f'' to ''g'' as the slider moves from 0 to 1, and vice versa.\n\nAn alternative notation is to say that a homotopy between two continuous functions <math>f, g \\colon X\\to Y</math> is a family of continuous functions <math>h_t\\colon X\\to Y</math> for <math>t\\in  [0,1]</math> such that <math>h_0 = f</math> and <math>h_1 = g</math>, and the map <math>(x,t) \\mapsto h_t(x)</math> is continuous from <math>X\\times [0,1]</math> to <math>Y</math>. The two versions coincide by setting <math>h_t(x) = H(x,t)</math>. It is not sufficient to require each map <math>h_t(x)</math> to be continuous.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/104515 Path homotopy and separately continuous functions]</ref>\n\nThe animation that is looped above right provides an example of a homotopy between two embeddings, ''f'' and ''g'', of the torus into {{nowrap|1=''R''<sup>3</sup>}}.  ''X'' is the torus, ''Y'' is {{nowrap|1=''R''<sup>3</sup>}}, ''f'' is some continuous function from the torus to ''R''<sup>3</sup> that takes the torus to the embedded surface-of-a-doughnut shape with which the animation starts; ''g'' is some continuous function that takes the torus to the embedded surface-of-a-coffee-mug shape.  The animation shows the image of ''h<sub>t</sub>''(''x'') as a function of the parameter t, where t varies with time from 0 to 1 over each cycle of the animation loop.  It pauses, then shows the image as t varies back from 1 to 0, pauses, and repeats this cycle.\n\n===Properties===\n\nContinuous functions ''f'' and ''g'' are said to be homotopic if and only if there is a homotopy ''H'' taking ''f'' to ''g'' as described above.\nBeing homotopic is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all continuous functions from ''X'' to ''Y''. \nThis homotopy relation is compatible with [[function composition]] in the following sense: if {{nowrap|1=''f''<sub>1</sub>, ''g''<sub>1</sub> : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} are homotopic, and {{nowrap|1=''f''<sub>2</sub>, ''g''<sub>2</sub> : ''Y'' \u2192 ''Z''}} are homotopic, then their compositions {{nowrap|1=''f''<sub>2</sub> \u2218 ''f''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>2</sub> \u2218 ''g''<sub>1</sub> : ''X'' \u2192 ''Z''}} are also homotopic.\n\n== Examples ==\n* If <math>f,g:\\R\\to\\R^2</math> are given by <math>f(x):=(x,x^3)</math> and <math>g(x)=(x,e^x)</math>, then the map <math>H:\\mathbb{R}\\times [0,1]\\to\\mathbb{R}^2</math> given by <math>H(x,t)=(x,(1-t)x^3+te^x)</math> is a homotopy between them.\n* More generally, if <math>C\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^n</math> is a [[Convex set|convex]] subset of [[Euclidean space]] and <math>f,g:[0,1]\\to C</math> are [[Path (topology)|paths]] with the same endpoints, then there is a '''linear homotopy'''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Algebraic topology|last=Allen.|first=Hatcher|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521795401|location=Cambridge|pages=185|oclc=45420394}}</ref> (or '''straight-line homotopy''') given by \n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  H:[0,1]&\\times [0,1]\\longrightarrow C \\\\\n  (s, t) \\longmapsto (1&-t)f(s)+tg(s).\n\\end{align}</math>\n* Let <math>\\operatorname{id}_{B^n}:B^n\\to B^n</math> be the [[identity function]] on the unit ''n''-[[Ball (mathematics)|disk]], i.e. the set <math>B^n:=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}^n:\\|x\\|\\leq 1\\}</math>. Let <math>c_{\\vec{0}}:B^n\\to B^n</math> be the [[constant function]] <math>c_{\\vec{0}}(x):=\\vec{0}</math> which sends every point to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Then the following is a homotopy between them:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  H:B^n&\\times [0,1]\\longrightarrow B^n \\\\\n  (x, t) &\\longmapsto (1-t)x.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Homotopy equivalence==\nGiven two spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', we say they are '''homotopy equivalent''', or of the same '''homotopy type''', if there exist continuous [[map (mathematics)|map]]s {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''g'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g'' \u2218 ''f''}} is homotopic to the [[identity function|identity map]] id<sub>''X''</sub> and {{nowrap|1=''f'' \u2218 ''g''}} is homotopic to id<sub>''Y''</sub>.\n\nThe maps ''f'' and ''g'' are called '''homotopy equivalences''' in this case.  Every [[homeomorphism]] is a homotopy equivalence, but the converse is not true: for example, a solid disk is not homeomorphic to a single point (since there is no bijection between them), although the disk and the point are homotopy equivalent (since you can deform the disk along radial lines continuously to a single point). As another example, the [[M\u00f6bius strip]] and an untwisted strip are homotopy equivalent (since you can deform both strips continuously to a circle) but not homeomorphic. Spaces that are homotopy equivalent to a point are called [[contractible]].\n\nIntuitively, two spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are homotopy equivalent if they can be transformed into one another by bending, shrinking and expanding operations.\n\n=== Examples ===\n* The first example of a homotopy equivalence is <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> with a point, denoted <math>\\mathbb{R}^n \\simeq \\{ 0\\}</math>. The part that needs to be checked is the existence of a homotopy <math>H: I \\times \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n</math> between <math>\\operatorname{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}</math> and <math>p_0</math>, the projection of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> onto the origin. This can be described as <math>H(t,\\cdot) = t\\cdot p_0 + (1-t)\\cdot\\operatorname{id}_{\\mathbb{R}^n}</math>.\n* There is a homotopy equivalence between <math>S^1</math> and <math>\\mathbb{R}^2-\\{0\\}</math>.\n* More generally, <math>\\mathbb{R}^n-\\{ 0\\} \\simeq S^{n-1}</math>.\n* Any [[fiber bundle]] <math>\\pi: E \\to B</math> with fibers <math>F_b</math> homotopy equivalent to a point has homotopy equivalent total and base spaces. This generalizes the previous two examples since <math>\\pi:\\mathbb{R}^n - \\{0\\} \\to S^{n-1}</math>is a fiber bundle with fiber <math>\\mathbb{R}_{>0}</math>.\n* Every [[vector bundle]] is a fiber bundle with a fiber homotopy equivalent to a point.\n* For any <math>0 \\le k < n</math>, <math>\\mathbb{R}^n - \\mathbb{R}^k \\simeq S^{n-k-1}</math> by writing <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> as <math>\\mathbb{R}^k \\times \\mathbb{R}^{n-k}</math> and applying the homotopy equivalences above.\n* If a subcomplex <math>A</math> of a [[CW complex]] <math>X</math> is contractible, then the [[quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] <math>X/A</math> is homotopy equivalent to <math>X</math>. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Algebraic topology|last=Allen.|first=Hatcher|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521795401|location=Cambridge|pages=11|oclc=45420394}}</ref>\n\n===Null-homotopy===\nA function ''f'' is said to be '''null-homotopic''' {{anchor|null homotopic}} if it is homotopic to a constant function.  (The homotopy from ''f'' to a constant function is then sometimes called a '''null-homotopy'''.)  For example, a map ''f'' from the [[unit circle]] ''S''<sup>1</sup> to any space ''X'' is null-homotopic precisely when it can be continuously extended to a map from the [[unit disk]] ''D''<sup>2</sup> to ''X'' that agrees with ''f'' on the boundary.\n\nIt follows from these definitions that a space ''X'' is contractible if and only if the identity map from ''X'' to itself&mdash;which is always a homotopy equivalence&mdash;is null-homotopic.\n\n==Invariance==\nHomotopy equivalence is important because in [[algebraic topology]] many concepts are '''homotopy invariant''', that is, they respect the relation of homotopy equivalence.  For example, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are homotopy equivalent spaces, then:\n* ''X'' is [[connected space|path-connected]] if and only if ''Y'' is.\n* ''X'' is [[simply connected]] if and only if ''Y'' is.\n* The (singular) [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[cohomology group]]s of ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]].\n* If ''X'' and ''Y'' are path-connected, then the [[fundamental group]]s of ''X'' and ''Y'' are isomorphic, and so are the higher [[homotopy group]]s. (Without the path-connectedness assumption, one has \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''X'',''x''<sub>0</sub>) isomorphic to \u03c0<sub>1</sub>(''Y'',''f''(''x''<sub>0</sub>)) where {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y''}} is a homotopy equivalence and {{nowrap|1=''x''<sub>0</sub> &isin; ''X''.)}}\n\nAn example of an algebraic invariant of topological spaces which is not homotopy-invariant is [[compactly supported homology]] (which is, roughly speaking, the homology of the [[compactification (mathematics)|compactification]], and compactification is not homotopy-invariant).\n\n== Variants ==\n\n===Relative homotopy===\n\nIn order to define the [[fundamental group]], one needs the notion of '''homotopy relative to a subspace'''. These are homotopies which keep the elements of the subspace fixed. Formally: if ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous maps from ''X'' to ''Y'' and ''K'' is a [[subset]] of ''X'', then we say that ''f'' and ''g'' are homotopic relative to ''K'' if there exists a homotopy {{nowrap|1=''H'' : ''X'' &times; [0,1] \u2192 ''Y''}} between ''f'' and ''g'' such that {{nowrap|1=''H''(''k'',''t'') = ''f''(''k'') = ''g''(''k'')}} for all {{nowrap|1=''k'' \u2208 ''K''}} and {{nowrap|1=''t'' \u2208 [0,1].}} Also, if ''g'' is a [[retraction (topology)|retraction]] from ''X'' to ''K'' and ''f'' is the identity map, this is known as a strong [[deformation retract]] of ''X'' to ''K''.\nWhen ''K'' is a point, the term '''pointed homotopy''' is used.\n\n=== Isotopy ===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Blue Unknot.png\n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Blue Trefoil Knot.png\n| caption2 = \n| footer = The [[unknot]] is not equivalent to the [[trefoil knot]] since one cannot be deformed into the other through a continuous path of homeomorphisms of the ambient space. Thus they are not ambient-isotopic.\n}}\nIn case the two given continuous functions ''f'' and ''g'' from the topological space ''X'' to the topological space ''Y'' are [[embedding]]s, one can ask whether they can be connected 'through embeddings'. This gives rise to the concept of '''isotopy''', which is a homotopy, ''H'', in the notation used before, such that for each fixed ''t'', ''H''(''x'',''t'') gives an embedding.<ref>{{MathWorld|Isotopy|Isotopy}}</ref>\n\nA related, but different, concept is that of [[ambient isotopy]].\n\nRequiring that two embeddings be isotopic is a stronger requirement than that they be homotopic. For example, the map from the interval [&minus;1,1] into the real numbers defined by ''f''(''x'') = &minus;''x'' is ''not'' isotopic to the identity ''g''(''x'') = ''x''.  Any homotopy from ''f'' to the identity would have to exchange the endpoints, which would mean that they would have to 'pass through' each other. Moreover, ''f'' has changed the orientation of the interval and ''g'' has not, which is impossible under an isotopy. However, the maps are homotopic; one homotopy from ''f'' to the identity is ''H'':&nbsp;[&minus;1,1]&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;[0,1]&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;[&minus;1,1] given by ''H''(''x'',''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''yx''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''x''.\n\nTwo homeomorphisms (which are special cases of embeddings) of the unit ball which agree on the boundary can be shown to be isotopic using [[Alexander's trick]]. For this reason, the map of the [[unit disc]] in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> defined by ''f''(''x'',''y'') = (&minus;''x'',&nbsp;&minus;''y'') is isotopic to a 180-degree [[rotation]] around the origin, and so the identity map and ''f'' are isotopic because they can be connected by rotations.\n\nIn [[geometric topology]]&mdash;for example in [[knot theory]]&mdash;the idea of isotopy is used to construct equivalence relations. For example, when should two knots be considered the same?  We take two knots, ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub>, in three-[[dimension]]al space. A knot is an [[embedding]] of a one-dimensional space, the \"loop of string\" (or the circle), into this space, and this embedding gives a homeomorphism between the circle and its image in the embedding space. The intuitive idea behind the notion of knot equivalence is that one can ''deform'' one embedding to another through a path of embeddings: a continuous function starting at ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 giving the ''K''<sub>1</sub> embedding, ending at ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 giving the ''K''<sub>2</sub> embedding, with all intermediate values corresponding to embeddings. This corresponds to the definition of isotopy. An [[ambient isotopy]], studied in this context, is an isotopy of the larger space, considered in light of its action on the embedded submanifold. Knots ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub> are considered equivalent when there is an ambient isotopy which moves ''K''<sub>1</sub> to ''K''<sub>2</sub>. This is the appropriate definition in the topological category.\n\nSimilar language is used for the equivalent concept in contexts where one has a stronger notion of equivalence.  For example, a path between two smooth embeddings is a '''smooth isotopy'''.\n\n=== Timelike homotopy ===\nOn a [[Lorentzian manifold]], certain curves are distinguished as [[timelike]] (representing something that only goes forwards, not backwards, in time, in every local frame). A [[timelike homotopy]] between two [[timelike curve]]s is a homotopy such that the curve remains timelike during the continuous transformation from one curve to another. No [[closed timelike curve]] (CTC) on a Lorentzian manifold is timelike homotopic to a point (that is, null timelike homotopic); such a manifold is therefore said to be [[multiply connected]] by timelike curves. A manifold such as the [[3-sphere]] can be [[simply connected]] (by any type of curve), and yet be [[timelike multiply connected]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monroe|first=Hunter|date=2008-11-01|title=Are Causality Violations Undesirable?|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1065\u20131069|doi=10.1007/s10701-008-9254-9|issn=0015-9018|arxiv=gr-qc/0609054|bibcode=2008FoPh...38.1065M}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Lifting and extension properties ===\n{{main|Homotopy lifting property}}\nIf we have a homotopy {{nowrap|1=''H'' : ''X'' &times; [0,1] &rarr; ''Y''}} and a cover {{nowrap|1=''p'' : <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''Y''</span> &rarr; ''Y''}} and we are given a map {{nowrap|1=<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''h''</span><sub>0</sub> : ''X'' &rarr; <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''Y''</span>}} such that {{nowrap|1=''H''<sub>0</sub> = ''p'' \u25cb <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''h''</span><sub>0</sub>}}   (<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''h''</span><sub>0</sub> is called a [[Lift (mathematics)|lift]] of ''h''<sub>0</sub>), then we can lift all ''H'' to a map {{nowrap|1=<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''H''</span> : ''X'' &times; [0,1] &rarr; <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''Y''</span>}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u25cb <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''H''</span> = ''H''.}} The homotopy lifting property is used to characterize [[fibration]]s.\n\nAnother useful property involving homotopy is the [[homotopy extension property]],\nwhich characterizes the extension of a homotopy between two functions from a subset of some set to the set itself. It is useful when dealing with [[cofibration]]s.\n\n===Groups===\n\n{{main|Homotopy group}}\nSince the relation of two functions <math>f, g\\colon X\\to Y</math> being homotopic relative to a subspace is an equivalence relation, we can look at the [[equivalence class]]es of maps between a fixed ''X'' and ''Y''. If we fix <math>X = [0,1]^n</math>, the unit interval [0,1] [[cartesian product|crossed]] with itself ''n'' times, and we take its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] <math>\\partial([0,1]^n)</math> as a subspace, then the equivalence classes form a group, denoted <math>\\pi_n(Y,y_0)</math>, where <math>y_0</math> is in the image of the subspace <math>\\partial([0,1]^n)</math>.\n\nWe can define the action of one equivalence class on another, and so we get a group. These groups are called the [[homotopy group]]s. In the case <math>n = 1</math>, it is also called the [[fundamental group]].\n\n===Homotopy category===\n{{Main articles|Homotopy category}}\nThe idea of homotopy can be turned into a formal category of [[category theory]]. The '''[[homotopy category]]''' is the category whose objects are topological spaces, and whose morphisms are homotopy equivalence classes of continuous maps. Two topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are isomorphic in this category if and only if they are homotopy-equivalent.  Then a [[functor]] on the category of topological spaces is homotopy invariant if it can be expressed as a functor on the homotopy category.\n\nFor example, homology groups are a ''functorial'' homotopy invariant: this means that if ''f'' and ''g'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' are homotopic, then the [[group homomorphism]]s induced by ''f'' and ''g'' on the level of [[homology group]]s are the same: H<sub>''n''</sub>(''f'') = H<sub>''n''</sub>(''g'') : H<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'') \u2192 H<sub>''n''</sub>(''Y'') for all ''n''.  Likewise, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are in addition [[connectedness|path connected]], and the homotopy between ''f'' and ''g'' is pointed, then the group homomorphisms induced by ''f'' and ''g'' on the level of [[homotopy group]]s are also the same: \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''f'') = \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''g'') : \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'') \u2192 \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''Y'').\n\n==Applications==\nBased on the concept of the homotopy, [[Numerical methods|computation methods]] for [[algebraic equations|algebraic]] and [[differential equations]] have been developed.

We can also think of the second parameter as a \"slider control\" that allows us to smoothly transition from ''f'' to ''g'' as the slider moves from 0 to 1, and vice versa.\n\nAn alternative notation is to say that a homotopy between two continuous functions <math>f, g \\colon X\\to Y</math> is a family of continuous functions <math>h_t\\colon X\\to Y</math> for <math>t\\in  [0,1]</math> such that <math>h_0 = f</math> and <math>h_1 = g</math>, and the map <math>(x,t) \\mapsto h_t(x)</math> is continuous from <math>X\\times [0,1]</math> to <math>Y</math>.

Every [[homeomorphism]] is a homotopy equivalence, but the converse is not true: for example, a solid disk is not homeomorphic to a single point (since there is no bijection between them), although the disk and the point are homotopy equivalent (since you can deform the disk along radial lines continuously to a single point). As another example, the [[M\u00f6bius strip]] and an untwisted strip are homotopy equivalent (since you can deform both strips continuously to a circle) but not homeomorphic.

This corresponds to the definition of isotopy. An [[ambient isotopy]], studied in this context, is an isotopy of the larger space, considered in light of its action on the embedded submanifold. Knots ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub> are considered equivalent when there is an ambient isotopy which moves ''K''<sub>1</sub> to ''K''<sub>2</sub>. This is the appropriate definition in the topological category.\n\nSimilar language is used for the equivalent concept in contexts where one has a stronger notion of equivalence.  For example, a path between two smooth embeddings is a '''smooth isotopy'''.\n\n=== Timelike homotopy ===\nOn a [[Lorentzian manifold]], certain curves are distinguished as [[timelike]] (representing something that only goes forwards, not backwards, in time, in every local frame). A [[timelike homotopy]] between two [[timelike curve]]s is a homotopy such that the curve remains timelike during the continuous transformation from one curve to another. No [[closed timelike curve]] (CTC) on a Lorentzian manifold is timelike homotopic to a point (that is, null timelike homotopic); such a manifold is therefore said to be [[multiply connected]] by timelike curves. A manifold such as the [[3-sphere]] can be [[simply connected]] (by any type of curve), and yet be [[timelike multiply connected]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Monroe|first=Hunter|date=2008-11-01|title=Are Causality Violations Undesirable?|journal=Foundations of Physics|language=en|volume=38|issue=11|pages=1065\u20131069|doi=10.1007/s10701-008-9254-9|issn=0015-9018|arxiv=gr-qc/0609054|bibcode=2008FoPh...38.1065M}}</ref>\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Lifting and extension properties ===\n{{main|Homotopy lifting property}}\nIf we have a homotopy {{nowrap|1=''H'' : ''X'' &times; [0,1] &rarr; ''Y''}} and a cover {{nowrap|1=''p'' : <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''Y''</span> &rarr; ''Y''}} and we are given a map {{nowrap|1=<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''h''</span><sub>0</sub> : ''X'' &rarr; <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''Y''</span>}} such that {{nowrap|1=''H''<sub>0</sub> = ''p'' \u25cb <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''h''</span><sub>0</sub>}}   (<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''h''</span><sub>0</sub> is called a [[Lift (mathematics)|lift]] of ''h''<sub>0</sub>), then we can lift all ''H'' to a map {{nowrap|1=<span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''H''</span> : ''X'' &times; [0,1] &rarr; <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''Y''</span>}} such that {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u25cb <span style=\"text-decoration: overline;\">''H''</span> = ''H''.}} The homotopy lifting property is used to characterize [[fibration]]s.\n\nAnother useful property involving homotopy is the [[homotopy extension property]],\nwhich characterizes the extension of a homotopy between two functions from a subset of some set to the set itself. It is useful when dealing with [[cofibration]]s.\n\n===Groups===\n\n{{main|Homotopy group}}\nSince the relation of two functions <math>f, g\\colon X\\to Y</math> being homotopic relative to a subspace is an equivalence relation, we can look at the [[equivalence class]]es of maps between a fixed ''X'' and ''Y''. If we fix <math>X = [0,1]^n</math>, the unit interval [0,1] [[cartesian product|crossed]] with itself ''n'' times, and we take its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] <math>\\partial([0,1]^n)</math> as a subspace, then the equivalence classes form a group, denoted <math>\\pi_n(Y,y_0)</math>, where <math>y_0</math> is in the image of the subspace <math>\\partial([0,1]^n)</math>.\n\nWe can define the action of one equivalence class on another, and so we get a group. These groups are called the [[homotopy group]]s. In the case <math>n = 1</math>, it is also called the [[fundamental group]].\n\n===Homotopy category===\n{{Main articles|Homotopy category}}\nThe idea of homotopy can be turned into a formal category of [[category theory]]. The '''[[homotopy category]]''' is the category whose objects are topological spaces, and whose morphisms are homotopy equivalence classes of continuous maps. Two topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' are isomorphic in this category if and only if they are homotopy-equivalent.  Then a [[functor]] on the category of topological spaces is homotopy invariant if it can be expressed as a functor on the homotopy category.\n\nFor example, homology groups are a ''functorial'' homotopy invariant: this means that if ''f'' and ''g'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' are homotopic, then the [[group homomorphism]]s induced by ''f'' and ''g'' on the level of [[homology group]]s are the same: H<sub>''n''</sub>(''f'') = H<sub>''n''</sub>(''g'') : H<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'') \u2192 H<sub>''n''</sub>(''Y'') for all ''n''.  Likewise, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are in addition [[connectedness|path connected]], and the homotopy between ''f'' and ''g'' is pointed, then the group homomorphisms induced by ''f'' and ''g'' on the level of [[homotopy group]]s are also the same: \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''f'') = \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''g'') : \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''X'') \u2192 \u03c0<sub>''n''</sub>(''Y'').\n\n==Applications==\nBased on the concept of the homotopy, [[Numerical methods|computation methods]] for [[algebraic equations|algebraic]] and [[differential equations]] have been developed. The methods for algebraic equations include the [[homotopy continuation]] method<ref name=Allgower1990>{{cite web|last1=Allgower |first1=Eugene | last2=Georg| first2=Kurt|title=Introduction to Numerical Continuation Methods |url=http://inis.jinr.ru/sl/M_Mathematics/MN_Numerical%20methods/MNd_Numerical%20calculus/Allogower%20Introduction.pdf |publisher=CSU |accessdate=22 February 2020 }}</ref> and the continuation method (see [[numerical continuation]]).

A pre-[[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] bourse was not exactly a formal stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 1600s, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specializes in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporations]] \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/01/is-asia-the-next-financial-center-of-the-world.html | title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? | work=[[CNBC]] | last=Murphy | first=Richard McGill | quote=As Richard McGill Murphy (2014) notes: \"In 1602 the Dutch East India Company opened the world's first stock exchange in Amsterdam.

Stock exchanges often function as \"continuous auction\" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via [[open outcry]] at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an [[electronic trading platform]].<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:3 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nTo be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use [[electronic communication network]]s, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, [[alternative trading system]]s and \"[[dark pool]]s\" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a7\u00a72:25 - 2:30 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\n[[Initial public offering]]s of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the [[primary market]] and subsequent trading is done in the [[secondary market]]. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in [[stock market]]s are driven by various factors that, as in all [[free market]]s, affect the price of stocks (see [[stock valuation]]).\n\nThere is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be ''off exchange'' or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. This is the usual way that [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are traded.

One of Europe's oldest stock exchanges is the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] ([[:de:B\u00f6rse Frankfurt|Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse]]) established in 1585 in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. Economist [[Ulrike Malmendier]] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] argues that a share market existed as far back as [[ancient Rome]], that derives from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] \"Argentari\". In the [[Roman Republic]], which existed for centuries before the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was founded, there were ''societates publicanorum'', organizations of contractors or leaseholders who performed temple-building and other services for the government. One such service was the feeding of geese on the Capitoline Hill as a reward to the birds after their honking warned of a Gallic invasion in 390&nbsp;B.C. Participants in such organizations had ''partes'' or shares, a concept mentioned various times by the statesman and orator [[Cicero]]. In one speech, Cicero mentions \"shares that had a very high price at the time\". Such evidence, in Malmendier's view, suggests the instruments were tradable, with fluctuating values based on an organization's success. The ''societas'' declined into obscurity in the time of the emperors, as most of their services were taken over by direct agents of the state.\n\nTradable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as a commonly used type of security were a more recent innovation, spearheaded by the Italian city-states of the late [[medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods.<ref>Stringham, Edward Peter; Curott, Nicholas A.: ''On the Origins of Stock Markets'' [Part IV: ''Institutions and Organizations''; Chapter 14], pp. 324-344, in ''The Oxford Handbook of Austrian Economics'', edited by [[Peter J.

The company paid an average dividend of over 16% per year from 1602 to 1650. Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by [[Isaac Le Maire]] formed history's first [[bear market]] syndicate, but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to remain robust throughout the 17th century. By the 1620s, the company was expanding its securities issuance with the first use of corporate bonds.\n\n[[Joseph de la Vega]], also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega and by other variations of his name, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman in 17th-century Amsterdam. His 1688 book ''Confusion of Confusions''<ref>[[Joseph de la Vega|De la Vega, Joseph]], ''Confusion de Confusiones'' (1688), ''Portions Descriptive of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange'', introduction by Hermann Kellenbenz, Baker Library, Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration (1957)</ref> explained the workings of the city's stock market. It was the earliest book about [[stock trading]] and inner workings of a stock market, taking the form of a dialogue between a merchant, a shareholder and a philosopher, the book described a market that was sophisticated but also prone to excesses, and de la Vega offered advice to his readers on such topics as the unpredictability of market shifts and the importance of patience in investment.\n\n[[File:Microcosm of London Plate 075 - New Stock Exchange (tone).jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[London Stock Exchange]] in 1810]]\nIn England, [[William III of England|King William III]] sought to modernize the kingdom's finances to pay for its wars, and thus the first government bonds were issued in 1693 and the [[Bank of England]] was set up the following year. Soon thereafter, English [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] began going public. \n\nLondon's first stockbrokers, however, were barred from the old commercial center known as the Royal Exchange, reportedly because of their rude manners. Instead, the new trade was conducted from coffee houses along [[Exchange Alley, London|Exchange Alley]]. By 1698, a broker named John Castaing, operating out of [[Jonathan's Coffee House]], was posting regular lists of stock and commodity prices. Those lists mark the beginning of the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockbroking101.com/stockbroker-101-a-cool-history/ | title=Stockbroker 101 - A Cool History | publisher=Stockbroker 101}}</ref>\n\nOne of history's greatest [[financial bubble]]s occurred around 1720. At the center of it were the [[South Sea Company]], set up in 1711 to conduct English trade with South America, and the [[Mississippi Company]], focused on commerce with France's Louisiana colony and touted by transplanted Scottish financier [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], who was acting in effect as France's central banker. Investors snapped up shares in both, and whatever else was available. In 1720, at the height of the mania, there was even an offering of \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".\n\nBy the end of that same year, share prices had started collapsing, as it became clear that expectations of imminent wealth from the Americas were overblown. In London, Parliament passed the [[Bubble Act]], which stated that only royally chartered companies could issue public shares. In Paris, Law was stripped of office and fled the country. Stock trading was more limited and subdued in subsequent decades. Yet the market survived, and by the 1790s shares were being traded in the young United States. On May 17, 1792, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] opened under a [[platanus occidentalis]] (buttonwood tree) in [[New York City]], as 24 stockbrokers signed the [[Buttonwood Agreement]], agreeing to trade five securities under that buttonwood tree.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/hottopic/stock_market.html | title=History of the NY Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | date=May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Role of stock exchanges==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Neue Boerse von Suedosten-20120222.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[B\u00f6rse Frankfurt]] (founded in 1585)]]\n[[File:NYSE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]]]\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[London Stock Exchange]], the [[City of London]]]]\n[[File:TokyoStockExchange1144.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], Tokyo]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Building.jpg|thumb|[[B3 (stock exchange)|B3]] is the largest stock exchange in Latin America]]\n[[File:Indonesia Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Indonesian Stock Exchange]] ''(Bursa Efek Indonesia)'' building in [[Jakarta]] is considered one of the oldest in Asia.]]\n[[File:Torre Axtel y Bolsa de Valores.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mexican Stock Exchange]] (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), it's the second largest stock exchanges in Latin America.]]\n[[File:Bursa Malaysia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The offices of [[Bursa Malaysia]], Malaysia's national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) ]]\nStock exchanges have multiple roles in the economy.

For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges has been one of the most important funding sources for many capital intensive [[Startup company|startup]]s. {{confusing-short|text=After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges|reason=word grouping is ambiguous, especially with the word \"listed\" in there, but even without|post-text=(confusing syntax)|date=May 2019}}, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company is already generating sales and earnings, or the company has demonstrated credibility and potential from successful outcomes: clinical trials, market research, patent registrations, etc. This is quite different from the situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) [[Initial public offering|went public]] in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world in the total absence of sales, earnings, or any type of well-documented promising outcome. Though it's not as common, it still happens that highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups are listed for the first time in a major stock exchange. Additionally, there are smaller, specialized entry markets for these kind of companies with [[stock index]]es tracking their performance (examples include the [[Alternext]], [[CAC Small]], [[SDAX]], [[TecDAX]]).\n\n====Alternatives to stock exchanges for raising capital====\n===== Research and Development limited partnerships=====\nCompanies have also raised significant amounts of capital through [[R&D]] [[limited partnership]]s. Tax law changes that were enacted in 1987 in the United States changed the tax deductibility of investments in R&D limited partnerships. In order for a partnership to be of interest to investors today, the [[cash on cash return]] must be high enough to entice investors.\n\n=====Venture capital=====\nA general source of capital for startup companies has been [[venture capital]]. This source remains largely available today, but the maximum statistical amount that the venture company firms in aggregate will invest in any one company is not limitless (it was approximately $15 million in 2001 for a biotechnology company).\n\n=====Corporate partners=====\nAnother alternative source of cash for a private company is a corporate partner, usually an established multinational company, which provides capital for the smaller company in return for marketing rights, patent rights, or equity. Corporate partnerships have been used successfully in a large number of cases.\n\n===Mobilizing savings for investment===\nWhen people draw their savings and invest in shares (through an [[initial public offering]] or the [[seasoned equity offering]] of an already listed company), it usually leads to [[Rationality|rational]] allocation of resources because funds, which could have been consumed, or kept in idle [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]] with banks, are mobilized and redirected to help companies' management boards finance their organizations. This may promote business activity with benefits for several economic sectors such as agriculture, commerce and industry, resulting in stronger economic growth and higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] levels of firms.\n\n===Facilitating acquisitions===\nCompanies view acquisitions as an opportunity to expand [[product line]]s, increase distribution channels, hedge against volatility, increase their [[market share]], or acquire other necessary business [[asset]]s. A [[takeover bid]] or  [[mergers and acquisitions]] through the [[stock market]] is one of the simplest and most common ways for a company to grow by acquisition or fusion.\n\n===Profit sharing===\nBoth casual and professional [[stock investor]]s, as large as [[institutional investor]]s or as small as an ordinary [[Middle class|middle-class family]], through [[dividend]]s and [[stock price]] increases that may result in [[capital gain]]s, share in the wealth of profitable businesses. Unprofitable and troubled businesses may result in [[capital loss]]es for shareholders.\n\n===Corporate governance===\nBy having a wide and varied scope of owners, companies generally tend to improve management standards and [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] to satisfy the demands of these shareholders and the more stringent rules for public corporations imposed by public stock exchanges and the government. This improvement can be attributed in some cases to the price mechanism exerted through shares of stock, wherein the price of the stock falls when management is considered poor (making the firm vulnerable to a takeover by new management) or rises when management is doing well (making the firm less vulnerable to a takeover).  In addition, publicly listed shares are subject to greater transparency so that investors can make informed decisions about a purchase.  Consequently, it is alleged that public companies (companies that are owned by shareholders who are members of the general public and trade shares on public exchanges) tend to have better management records than [[privately held company|privately held companies]] (those companies where shares are not publicly traded, often owned by the company founders, their families and heirs, or otherwise by a small group of investors).\n\nDespite this claim, some well-documented cases are known where it is alleged that there has been considerable slippage in [[corporate governance]] on the part of some public companies, particularly in the cases of [[accounting scandal]]s. The policies that led to the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2007\u201308 are also examples of corporate mismanagement. The mismanagement of companies such as [[Pets.com]] (2000), [[Enron]] (2001), [[One.Tel]] (2001), [[Sunbeam Products]] (2001), [[Webvan]] (2001), [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] (2002), [[MCI WorldCom]] (2002), [[Parmalat]] (2003), [[American International Group]] (2008), [[Bear Stearns]] (2008), [[Lehman Brothers]] (2008), [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|General Motors]] (2009) and [[Satyam Computer Services]] (2009) all received plenty of media attention.\n\nMany banks and companies worldwide utilize securities identification numbers ([[ISIN]]) to identify, uniquely, their stocks, bonds and other securities. Adding an ISIN code helps to distinctly identify securities and the ISIN system is used worldwide by funds, companies, and governments.\n\nHowever, when poor financial, ethical or managerial records become public, [[stock investor]]s tend to lose money as the stock and the company tend to lose value. In the stock exchanges, shareholders of underperforming firms are often penalized by significant share price decline, and they tend as well to dismiss incompetent management teams.\n\n===Creating investment opportunities for small investors===\nAs opposed to other businesses that require huge capital outlay, investing in shares is open to both the large and small [[stock investor]]s as minimum investment amounts are minimal. Therefore, the stock exchange provides the opportunity for small investors to own shares of the same companies as large investors.\n\n===Government capital-raising for development projects===\nGovernments at various levels may decide to borrow money to finance infrastructure projects such as sewage and water treatment works or housing estates by selling another category of [[Security (finance)|securities]] known as [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. These bonds can be raised through the stock exchange whereby members of the public buy them, thus loaning money to the government. The issuance of such bonds can obviate, in the short term, direct taxation of citizens to finance development\u2014though by securing such bonds with the full faith and credit of the government instead of with collateral, the government must eventually tax citizens or otherwise raise additional funds to make any regular coupon payments and refund the principal when the bonds mature.\n\n===Barometer of the economy===\nAt the stock exchange, share prices rise and fall depending, largely, on economic forces. Share prices tend to rise or remain stable when companies and the economy in general show signs of stability and growth. A [[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], or [[financial crisis]] could eventually lead to a [[stock market crash]]. Therefore, the movement of share prices and in general of the [[stock index]]es can be an indicator of the general trend in the economy.\n\n==Listing requirements==\nEach stock [https://www.smartworking1.in/?m=1 exchange] imposes its own [[listing requirements]] upon companies that want to be listed on that exchange. Such conditions may include minimum number of shares outstanding, minimum market capitalization, and minimum annual income.\n\n===Examples of listing requirements===\nThe listing requirements imposed by some stock exchanges include:\n* '''New York Stock Exchange:''' the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE_Initial_Listing_Standards_Summary.pdf | title=Overview of NYSE Quantitative Initial Listing Standards | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n* '''NASDAQ Stock Exchange:''' [[NASDAQ]] requires a company to have issued at least 1.25 million shares of stock worth at least $70 million and must have earned more than $11 million over the last three years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/about/listing_information.stm | title=Applications, Notifications & Guides - Nasdaq Listing Center | publisher=[[NASDAQ]]}}</ref>\n* '''London Stock Exchange:''' the main market of the [[London Stock Exchange]] requires a minimum market capitalization (\u00a3700,000), three years of audited financial statements, minimum public float (25%) and sufficient [[working capital]] for at least 12 months from the date of listing.\n* '''Bombay Stock Exchange:''' [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) requires a minimum market capitalization of {{INRConvert|250|m}} and minimum public float equivalent to {{INRConvert|100|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bseindia.com/ | title=Bombay Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Bombay Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nStock exchanges originated as [[mutual organization]]s, owned by its member stockbrokers. However, the major stock exchanges have ''demutualized'', where the members sell their shares in an [[initial public offering]]. In this way the mutual organization becomes a corporation, with shares that are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (1998), [[Euronext]] (merged with New York Stock Exchange), [[NASDAQ]] (2002), [[Bursa Malaysia]] (2004), the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (2005), [[Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles]], and the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] (2007).\n\nThe [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] can be characterized as quasi-state institutions insofar as they were created by government bodies in China and their leading personnel are directly appointed by the [[China Securities Regulatory Commission]].\n\nAnother example is [[Tashkent Stock Exchange]] established in 1994, three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, mainly state-owned but has a form of a public corporation ([[joint-stock company]]). [[Korea Exchange]] (KRX) owns 25% less one share of the Tashkent Stock Exchange.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uzse.uz/abouts/history?locale=en | title=Stages of the Republican Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Tashkent Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, there were 15 licensed stock exchanges in the United States, of which 13 actively traded securities.

A pre-[[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] bourse was not exactly a formal stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 1600s, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specializes in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporations]] \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/01/is-asia-the-next-financial-center-of-the-world.html | title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? | work=[[CNBC]] | last=Murphy | first=Richard McGill | quote=As Richard McGill Murphy (2014) notes: \"In 1602 the Dutch East India Company opened the world's first stock exchange in Amsterdam.

Stock exchanges may also provide facilities for the issue and redemption of such securities and instruments and capital events including the payment of income and [[dividend]]s.{{cn|date=March 2018}} Securities traded on a stock exchange include stock issued by [[listed company|listed companies]], [[unit trust]]s, [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], pooled investment products and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. Stock exchanges often function as \"continuous auction\" markets with buyers and sellers consummating transactions via [[open outcry]] at a central location such as the floor of the exchange or by using an [[electronic trading platform]].<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a72:3 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\nTo be able to trade a security on a certain stock exchange, the security must be [[Listing (finance)|listed]] there. Usually, there is a central location at least for record keeping, but trade is increasingly less linked to a physical place, as modern markets use [[electronic communication network]]s, which give them advantages of increased speed and reduced cost of transactions. Trade on an exchange is restricted to brokers who are members of the exchange. In recent years, various other trading venues, such as electronic communication networks, [[alternative trading system]]s and \"[[dark pool]]s\" have taken much of the trading activity away from traditional stock exchanges.<ref>Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities'', \u00a7\u00a72:25 - 2:30 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.).</ref>\n\n[[Initial public offering]]s of stocks and bonds to investors is done in the [[primary market]] and subsequent trading is done in the [[secondary market]]. A stock exchange is often the most important component of a stock market. Supply and demand in [[stock market]]s are driven by various factors that, as in all [[free market]]s, affect the price of stocks (see [[stock valuation]]).\n\nThere is usually no obligation for stock to be issued through the stock exchange itself, nor must stock be subsequently traded on an exchange. Such trading may be ''off exchange'' or [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. This is the usual way that [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are traded. Increasingly, stock exchanges are part of a global securities market.

One of Europe's oldest stock exchanges is the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange]] ([[:de:B\u00f6rse Frankfurt|Frankfurter Wertpapierb\u00f6rse]]) established in 1585 in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]]. Economist [[Ulrike Malmendier]] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]] argues that a share market existed as far back as [[ancient Rome]], that derives from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] \"Argentari\". In the [[Roman Republic]], which existed for centuries before the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was founded, there were ''societates publicanorum'', organizations of contractors or leaseholders who performed temple-building and other services for the government. One such service was the feeding of geese on the Capitoline Hill as a reward to the birds after their honking warned of a Gallic invasion in 390&nbsp;B.C. Participants in such organizations had ''partes'' or shares, a concept mentioned various times by the statesman and orator [[Cicero]]. In one speech, Cicero mentions \"shares that had a very high price at the time\". Such evidence, in Malmendier's view, suggests the instruments were tradable, with fluctuating values based on an organization's success. The ''societas'' declined into obscurity in the time of the emperors, as most of their services were taken over by direct agents of the state.\n\nTradable [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] as a commonly used type of security were a more recent innovation, spearheaded by the Italian city-states of the late [[medieval]] and early [[Renaissance]] periods.<ref>Stringham, Edward Peter; Curott, Nicholas A.: ''On the Origins of Stock Markets'' [Part IV: ''Institutions and Organizations''; Chapter 14], pp. 324-344, in ''The Oxford Handbook of Austrian Economics'', edited by [[Peter J.

The company paid an average dividend of over 16% per year from 1602 to 1650. Financial innovation in Amsterdam took many forms. In 1609, investors led by [[Isaac Le Maire]] formed history's first [[bear market]] syndicate, but their coordinated trading had only a modest impact in driving down share prices, which tended to remain robust throughout the 17th century. By the 1620s, the company was expanding its securities issuance with the first use of corporate bonds.\n\n[[Joseph de la Vega]], also known as Joseph Penso de la Vega and by other variations of his name, was an Amsterdam trader from a Spanish Jewish family and a prolific writer as well as a successful businessman in 17th-century Amsterdam.

Soon thereafter, English [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]] began going public. \n\nLondon's first stockbrokers, however, were barred from the old commercial center known as the Royal Exchange, reportedly because of their rude manners. Instead, the new trade was conducted from coffee houses along [[Exchange Alley, London|Exchange Alley]]. By 1698, a broker named John Castaing, operating out of [[Jonathan's Coffee House]], was posting regular lists of stock and commodity prices. Those lists mark the beginning of the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.stockbroking101.com/stockbroker-101-a-cool-history/ | title=Stockbroker 101 - A Cool History | publisher=Stockbroker 101}}</ref>\n\nOne of history's greatest [[financial bubble]]s occurred around 1720. At the center of it were the [[South Sea Company]], set up in 1711 to conduct English trade with South America, and the [[Mississippi Company]], focused on commerce with France's Louisiana colony and touted by transplanted Scottish financier [[John Law (economist)|John Law]], who was acting in effect as France's central banker. Investors snapped up shares in both, and whatever else was available. In 1720, at the height of the mania, there was even an offering of \"a company for carrying out an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is\".\n\nBy the end of that same year, share prices had started collapsing, as it became clear that expectations of imminent wealth from the Americas were overblown. In London, Parliament passed the [[Bubble Act]], which stated that only royally chartered companies could issue public shares. In Paris, Law was stripped of office and fled the country. Stock trading was more limited and subdued in subsequent decades. Yet the market survived, and by the 1790s shares were being traded in the young United States. On May 17, 1792, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] opened under a [[platanus occidentalis]] (buttonwood tree) in [[New York City]], as 24 stockbrokers signed the [[Buttonwood Agreement]], agreeing to trade five securities under that buttonwood tree.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/business/hottopic/stock_market.html | title=History of the NY Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Library of Congress]] | date=May 2004}}</ref>\n\n==Role of stock exchanges==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Neue Boerse von Suedosten-20120222.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[B\u00f6rse Frankfurt]] (founded in 1585)]]\n[[File:NYSE.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The floor of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]]]\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[London Stock Exchange]], the [[City of London]]]]\n[[File:TokyoStockExchange1144.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Tokyo Stock Exchange]], Tokyo]]\n[[File:S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange Building.jpg|thumb|[[B3 (stock exchange)|B3]] is the largest stock exchange in Latin America]]\n[[File:Indonesia Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Indonesian Stock Exchange]] ''(Bursa Efek Indonesia)'' building in [[Jakarta]] is considered one of the oldest in Asia.]]\n[[File:Torre Axtel y Bolsa de Valores.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|[[Mexican Stock Exchange]] (Bolsa Mexicana de Valores), it's the second largest stock exchanges in Latin America.]]\n[[File:Bursa Malaysia.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|The offices of [[Bursa Malaysia]], Malaysia's national stock exchange (known before demutualization as Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) ]]\nStock exchanges have multiple roles in the economy. This may include the following:<ref>{{cite journal | last=Diamond | first=Peter A. | authorlink= | year=1967 | title=The Role of a Stock Market in a General Equilibrium Model with Technological Uncertainty | journal=[[American Economic Review]] | volume=57 | issue=4 | pages=759\u2013776 | doi= | jstor=1815367}}</ref>\n\n===Raising capital for businesses===\nBesides the borrowing capacity provided to an individual or firm by the [[banking system]], in the form of [[credit (finance)|credit]] or a loan, a stock exchange provides [[company|companies]] with the facility to raise [[Financial capital|capital]] for expansion through selling [[Share (finance)|shares]] to the investing public.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gilson |first=Ronald J. |authorlink= |author2=Black, Bernard S.  |year=1998 |title=Venture Capital and the Structure of Capital Markets: Banks Versus Stock Markets |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=47 |issue= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.46909 |url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2152&context=faculty_scholarship}}</ref>\n\n[[Capital intensive]] companies, particularly [[high tech]] companies, always need to raise high volumes of capital in their early stages. For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges has been one of the most important funding sources for many capital intensive [[Startup company|startup]]s. {{confusing-short|text=After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges|reason=word grouping is ambiguous, especially with the word \"listed\" in there, but even without|post-text=(confusing syntax)|date=May 2019}}, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company is already generating sales and earnings, or the company has demonstrated credibility and potential from successful outcomes: clinical trials, market research, patent registrations, etc. This is quite different from the situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) [[Initial public offering|went public]] in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world in the total absence of sales, earnings, or any type of well-documented promising outcome. Though it's not as common, it still happens that highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups are listed for the first time in a major stock exchange. Additionally, there are smaller, specialized entry markets for these kind of companies with [[stock index]]es tracking their performance (examples include the [[Alternext]], [[CAC Small]], [[SDAX]], [[TecDAX]]).\n\n====Alternatives to stock exchanges for raising capital====\n===== Research and Development limited partnerships=====\nCompanies have also raised significant amounts of capital through [[R&D]] [[limited partnership]]s. Tax law changes that were enacted in 1987 in the United States changed the tax deductibility of investments in R&D limited partnerships. In order for a partnership to be of interest to investors today, the [[cash on cash return]] must be high enough to entice investors.\n\n=====Venture capital=====\nA general source of capital for startup companies has been [[venture capital]]. This source remains largely available today, but the maximum statistical amount that the venture company firms in aggregate will invest in any one company is not limitless (it was approximately $15 million in 2001 for a biotechnology company).\n\n=====Corporate partners=====\nAnother alternative source of cash for a private company is a corporate partner, usually an established multinational company, which provides capital for the smaller company in return for marketing rights, patent rights, or equity. Corporate partnerships have been used successfully in a large number of cases.\n\n===Mobilizing savings for investment===\nWhen people draw their savings and invest in shares (through an [[initial public offering]] or the [[seasoned equity offering]] of an already listed company), it usually leads to [[Rationality|rational]] allocation of resources because funds, which could have been consumed, or kept in idle [[Deposit (finance)|deposits]] with banks, are mobilized and redirected to help companies' management boards finance their organizations. This may promote business activity with benefits for several economic sectors such as agriculture, commerce and industry, resulting in stronger economic growth and higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]] levels of firms.\n\n===Facilitating acquisitions===\nCompanies view acquisitions as an opportunity to expand [[product line]]s, increase distribution channels, hedge against volatility, increase their [[market share]], or acquire other necessary business [[asset]]s. A [[takeover bid]] or  [[mergers and acquisitions]] through the [[stock market]] is one of the simplest and most common ways for a company to grow by acquisition or fusion.\n\n===Profit sharing===\nBoth casual and professional [[stock investor]]s, as large as [[institutional investor]]s or as small as an ordinary [[Middle class|middle-class family]], through [[dividend]]s and [[stock price]] increases that may result in [[capital gain]]s, share in the wealth of profitable businesses. Unprofitable and troubled businesses may result in [[capital loss]]es for shareholders.\n\n===Corporate governance===\nBy having a wide and varied scope of owners, companies generally tend to improve management standards and [[Efficiency (economics)|efficiency]] to satisfy the demands of these shareholders and the more stringent rules for public corporations imposed by public stock exchanges and the government. This improvement can be attributed in some cases to the price mechanism exerted through shares of stock, wherein the price of the stock falls when management is considered poor (making the firm vulnerable to a takeover by new management) or rises when management is doing well (making the firm less vulnerable to a takeover).  In addition, publicly listed shares are subject to greater transparency so that investors can make informed decisions about a purchase.  Consequently, it is alleged that public companies (companies that are owned by shareholders who are members of the general public and trade shares on public exchanges) tend to have better management records than [[privately held company|privately held companies]] (those companies where shares are not publicly traded, often owned by the company founders, their families and heirs, or otherwise by a small group of investors).\n\nDespite this claim, some well-documented cases are known where it is alleged that there has been considerable slippage in [[corporate governance]] on the part of some public companies, particularly in the cases of [[accounting scandal]]s. The policies that led to the [[dot-com bubble]] in the late 1990s and the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] in 2007\u201308 are also examples of corporate mismanagement. The mismanagement of companies such as [[Pets.com]] (2000), [[Enron]] (2001), [[One.Tel]] (2001), [[Sunbeam Products]] (2001), [[Webvan]] (2001), [[Adelphia Communications Corporation]] (2002), [[MCI WorldCom]] (2002), [[Parmalat]] (2003), [[American International Group]] (2008), [[Bear Stearns]] (2008), [[Lehman Brothers]] (2008), [[General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization|General Motors]] (2009) and [[Satyam Computer Services]] (2009) all received plenty of media attention.\n\nMany banks and companies worldwide utilize securities identification numbers ([[ISIN]]) to identify, uniquely, their stocks, bonds and other securities. Adding an ISIN code helps to distinctly identify securities and the ISIN system is used worldwide by funds, companies, and governments.\n\nHowever, when poor financial, ethical or managerial records become public, [[stock investor]]s tend to lose money as the stock and the company tend to lose value. In the stock exchanges, shareholders of underperforming firms are often penalized by significant share price decline, and they tend as well to dismiss incompetent management teams.\n\n===Creating investment opportunities for small investors===\nAs opposed to other businesses that require huge capital outlay, investing in shares is open to both the large and small [[stock investor]]s as minimum investment amounts are minimal. Therefore, the stock exchange provides the opportunity for small investors to own shares of the same companies as large investors.\n\n===Government capital-raising for development projects===\nGovernments at various levels may decide to borrow money to finance infrastructure projects such as sewage and water treatment works or housing estates by selling another category of [[Security (finance)|securities]] known as [[bond (finance)|bonds]]. These bonds can be raised through the stock exchange whereby members of the public buy them, thus loaning money to the government. The issuance of such bonds can obviate, in the short term, direct taxation of citizens to finance development\u2014though by securing such bonds with the full faith and credit of the government instead of with collateral, the government must eventually tax citizens or otherwise raise additional funds to make any regular coupon payments and refund the principal when the bonds mature.\n\n===Barometer of the economy===\nAt the stock exchange, share prices rise and fall depending, largely, on economic forces. Share prices tend to rise or remain stable when companies and the economy in general show signs of stability and growth. A [[recession]], [[Depression (economics)|depression]], or [[financial crisis]] could eventually lead to a [[stock market crash]]. Therefore, the movement of share prices and in general of the [[stock index]]es can be an indicator of the general trend in the economy.\n\n==Listing requirements==\nEach stock [https://www.smartworking1.in/?m=1 exchange] imposes its own [[listing requirements]] upon companies that want to be listed on that exchange. Such conditions may include minimum number of shares outstanding, minimum market capitalization, and minimum annual income.\n\n===Examples of listing requirements===\nThe listing requirements imposed by some stock exchanges include:\n* '''New York Stock Exchange:''' the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) requires a company to have issued at least a million shares of stock worth $100 million and must have earned more than $10 million over the last three years.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/listing/NYSE_Initial_Listing_Standards_Summary.pdf | title=Overview of NYSE Quantitative Initial Listing Standards | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n* '''NASDAQ Stock Exchange:''' [[NASDAQ]] requires a company to have issued at least 1.25 million shares of stock worth at least $70 million and must have earned more than $11 million over the last three years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nasdaq.com/about/listing_information.stm | title=Applications, Notifications & Guides - Nasdaq Listing Center | publisher=[[NASDAQ]]}}</ref>\n* '''London Stock Exchange:''' the main market of the [[London Stock Exchange]] requires a minimum market capitalization (\u00a3700,000), three years of audited financial statements, minimum public float (25%) and sufficient [[working capital]] for at least 12 months from the date of listing.\n* '''Bombay Stock Exchange:''' [[Bombay Stock Exchange]] (BSE) requires a minimum market capitalization of {{INRConvert|250|m}} and minimum public float equivalent to {{INRConvert|100|m}}.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bseindia.com/ | title=Bombay Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Bombay Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nStock exchanges originated as [[mutual organization]]s, owned by its member stockbrokers. However, the major stock exchanges have ''demutualized'', where the members sell their shares in an [[initial public offering]]. In this way the mutual organization becomes a corporation, with shares that are listed on a stock exchange. Examples are [[Australian Securities Exchange]] (1998), [[Euronext]] (merged with New York Stock Exchange), [[NASDAQ]] (2002), [[Bursa Malaysia]] (2004), the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (2005), [[Bolsas y Mercados Espa\u00f1oles]], and the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] (2007).\n\nThe [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange]] and [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]] can be characterized as quasi-state institutions insofar as they were created by government bodies in China and their leading personnel are directly appointed by the [[China Securities Regulatory Commission]].\n\nAnother example is [[Tashkent Stock Exchange]] established in 1994, three years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, mainly state-owned but has a form of a public corporation ([[joint-stock company]]). [[Korea Exchange]] (KRX) owns 25% less one share of the Tashkent Stock Exchange.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uzse.uz/abouts/history?locale=en | title=Stages of the Republican Stock Exchange | publisher=[[Tashkent Stock Exchange]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, there were 15 licensed stock exchanges in the United States, of which 13 actively traded securities. All of these exchanges were owned by three publicly traded multinational companies, [[Intercontinental Exchange]], [[Nasdaq, Inc.]], and [[Cboe Global Markets]], except one, [[IEX]].<ref name=Reuters1-19>{{Cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wallstreet-exchange-idUSKCN1P11A6 |title=Major Wall Street players plan exchange to challenge NYSE, Nasdaq | first=Diptendu | last=Lahiri | work=[[Reuters]] | date=January 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.businessinsider.com/competition-among-exchanges-has-reached-a-new-low-and-its-dangerous-for-the-stock-market-2018-5 | title=Competition among exchanges has reached a new low, and it's dangerous for the stock market | first=John | last=Ramsay | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=May 23, 2018}} (for recent history see also, {{Cite web | url=http://www.finra.org/investors/nyse-nasdaq-and-get-know-uss-stock-exchanges-part-1 |title=NYSE, Nasdaq and...?

He commissioned the design of two houses, both called [[Crimonmogate]], one in central Aberdeen, the other on his estate in [[Lonmay]], Aberdeenshire.\n\n==Ancestry==\nMilne was the eldest son of Alexander Milne of [[Crimonmogate]], an Aberdeen merchant. His mother, Margaret, was the daughter of Patrick Bannerman, Lord Provost of Aberdeen from 1715\u20131716.{{sfn|Fisher|Milne}}\nHis father was a partner in the linen company Gordon, Barron & Co.{{sfn|Fitton|1989|p=75}} and the Porthill Company that later became Milne, Cruden, & Company.{{sfn|Electricscotland}} These companies had extensive factories in Aberdeen and Donside.{{sfn|Wilson|1822|pp=214\u2013216}} After the decline of the Porthill linen company, Milne's father bought the Crimonmogate estate in Aberdeenshire,{{sfn|Fisher|Milne}} which Milne then inherited.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Monument at Crimonmogate House.jpg|thumb|alt=Granite obelisk, memorial to Milne|Monument at Crimonmogate House, Lonmay, erected by Charles Bannerman in memory of Milne]]\nMilne had a healthy income from overseas business ventures{{sfn|Historic Environment Scotland|GDL00397}} and tax records of 1797\u201398 show he was levied various taxes on the number of clocks and watches,{{sfn|Scotland's Places,|Clock and watch taxes, 1797\u201398}} dogs{{sfn|Scotland's Places,|Dog taxes, 1797\u201398}} and male servants he had.{{sfn|Scotland's Places,|Male Servant tax rolls, 1797\u201398}}\n\nSeveral new settlements were established in the [[Buchan]] area after the middle of the 18th-century and this continued into the early 19th-century bringing more wealth to the area. Wealthy landowners, like Milne, began to invest profits in the construction of stylish mansions.{{sfn|McKean|1990|p=5}} In 1810, Milne commissioned the Aberdeen city architect [[John Smith (architect)|John Smith]] to design a town house for him.

His mother, Margaret, was the daughter of Patrick Bannerman, Lord Provost of Aberdeen from 1715\u20131716.{{sfn|Fisher,|Milne}}\nHis father was a partner in the linen company Gordon, Barron & Co.{{sfn|Fitton,|1989|p=75}} and the Porthill Company that later became Milne, Cruden, & Company.{{sfn|Electricscotland}} These companies had extensive factories in Aberdeen and Donside.{{sfn|Wilson,|1822|pp=214\u2013216}} After the decline of the Porthill linen company, Milne's father bought the Crimonmogate estate in Aberdeenshire,{{sfn|Fisher,|Milne}} which Milne then inherited.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Monument at Crimonmogate House.jpg|thumb|alt=Granite obelisk, memorial to Milne|Monument at Crimonmogate House, Lonmay, erected by Charles Bannerman in memory of Milne]]\nMilne had a healthy income from overseas business ventures{{sfn|Historic Environment Scotland|GDL00397}} and tax records of 1797\u201398 show he was levied various taxes on the number of clocks and watches,{{sfn|Scotland's Places,|Clock and watch taxes, 1797\u201398}} dogs{{sfn|Scotland's Places,|Dog taxes, 1797\u201398}} and male servants he had.{{sfn|Scotland's Places,|Male Servant tax rolls, 1797\u201398}}\n\nSeveral new settlements were established in the [[Buchan]] area after the middle of the 18th-century and this continued into the early 19th-century bringing more wealth to the area.

Unnao is a large industrial city with three industrial suburbs around it. The city is famous for its [[leather]], [[mosquito net]], [[Zardozi]] and [[chemical]] industries. Unnao is an historical city with many historical buildings and structures. [[Trans Ganga City]], a new satellite town of Unnao is being developed in order to develop Unnao as a major industrial and infrastructural hub as the region comes under Kanpur-Lucknow Counter Magnet Area. Unnao district is a part of Central [[Ganges Plain]] of the state covering an area of 4558&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The city is enlisted as a municipality of [[Kanpur metropolitan area]] and is the second largest city within the metropolitan area. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nThe district is named after its capital, Unnao. About 900 years ago, the site of this town was covered with extensive forests. Godo Singh, a Chauhan Rajput, cleared the forests probably in the third quarter of the 12th century and founded a town, called Sawai Godo, which shortly afterwards passed into the hands of the rulers of the Kannauj, who appointed Khande Singh as the Governor of the place. Unwant Rai Singh, a Bisen Rajput and a lieutenant of the Governor, killed him and built a fort here, renaming the place as Unnao after himself.\n\nIn ancient times, the area which comprises Unnao formed part of the [[Kosala]] [[Mahajanapada]]. It was later included in [[Oudh]]. This region has been inhabited since antiquity as traces from ancient times remain at some places in the district. After the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence in 1857]], power was transferred from the [[British East India Company]] to the British Crown, by the Queen's Proclamation of 1858. Once the order was restored, the civil administration was re-established in the district which was named Unnao, with headquarters at Unnao. It assumed its present size in 1869. The same year the town of Unnao was constituted a Municipality. There were many rulers with a small estates ruled under the constituency of Unnao proclaimed by British Constituency during early 1900s till 1948 until India has been handed over to the interim government of 1948. Later, in 1956 the local throne was handed over to Pahadpur estate, one of the strongest estates in Unnao and had been ruled under Rao ShivBali Singh Bahadur Chauhan, who had served his country as a Royal Indian Army personnel in British rule. Later, in 1970s the custody of Unnao had been succeeded by his descendant and his very own son Rao Ramsajeevan Singh Bahadur Chauhan, who also had served his country in Royal Indian Army. He is blessed with 5 children, 2 daughters and 3 sons and had married to the daughter of Raja Bahadur Singh of Dalpatkheda estate. This history is in the Unnao book.\n\n==Surrounding towns==\nUnnao district is surrounded by some of the main cities of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 [[Lucknow]], [[Kanpur]], [[Raebareli]] and [[Hardoi]].{{Geographic location\n|Northwest = Avas Vikas Colony\n|North     = Unnao Industrial Estate\n|Northeast = Shiv Nagar\n|West      = Campbell Lines\n|Center    = Unnao City Downtown\n|South     = A B Nagar ( Atal Behari Nagar)\n|Southwest = Canal Street\n|Southeast = Priyadarshani Nagar Township\n|East      = Lake Town\n|}}\n\n==Urban Agglomeration==\n\nThe Unnao urban agglomeration includes municipal limits of Unnao city and Shuklaganj, the villages of Unnao Rural, Deeh, Dostinagar, Turkmannagar, Ganjauli,Singrosi, Shakpur, Magarwara, Akrampur, Galgalha, Sahjani, Maswasi, Haibatpur, Kathadal Narainpur, Dhaudhi Rautapur which together makes up the population of 303,224\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location and boundaries===\nThe District is roughly a parallelogram in shape and lies between Latitude 26\u00b08' N & 27\u00b02' N and Longitude 80\u00b03' E & 81\u00b03' E. It is bounded on the North by District Hardoi, on the East by District Lucknow, on the South by District Rae Bareli and on the West by the Ganga which separates it from districts of Kanpur & Fatehpur.\n\n===River systems and water resources===\nThe Ganga, Kalyani and Sai are the main rivers of the district, the former making its western and southern boundaries and the latter, for the greater part of its course, forming its northern & eastern boundaries. Among the other mainstreams of the district are Kalyani, the Tanai,  the Loni and the Morahi (Naurahi), all tributaries of the Ganga. These rivers generally run dry during the hot weather, but hold water during the greater part of the year and are utilized for irrigation.\n\n====Ganga====\nThe only great river of the district is the [[Ganga]] which first touches the district near the village of Purwa Gahir, in pargana [[Bangarmau]] and flows south-eastward, separating this district from districts [[Kanpur]] and [[Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh|Fatehpur]]. Generally, it flows from north-west to the south-east, but it makes several sharp bends such as those near Umriya Bhagwantpur, and Rustampur in tehsil Safipur,   Rautapur in tehsil Unnao and Ratua Khera and Duli Khera in tehsil [[Purwa]]. The Ganga receives the Morahi near [[Baksar]] where it flows close to its old high bank. It leaves the district at a short distance from [[Baksar]].\n\nThe river is not, however, put to much use either as a waterway or as a source of [[irrigation]]. There are several ferries for pedestrians and pilgrims but none of them approaches what may be termed a trade route. The river cannot, as a rule, be utilised for irrigation owing to the height of the bank but certain of its small drainage channels or sotas, which run island for a considerable distance in some parganas, are sometimes used to irrigate crops grown in low-lying alluvial lands. Otherwise, cultivated lands lie at great distances and cannot be irrigated from the river whose water would, in order to irrigate these lands, have to be passed through the sands on the sides of the river, and in the process be greatly washed, if not altogether absorbed. The main channel of the river is subject to constant variation and the cultivation in its immediate neighbourhood is, therefore of a shifting kind.\n\nIt appears from its old high bank that the river has a general tendency to shift its course to the west. In the days of Akbar, the river skirted the village of Ghatampur but has since then so altered its course that it now runs about 8&nbsp; km to the south-west of this village.\n\n====Lakes====\nThere is the unusually large number of  [[swamp]]s & [[lake]]s of great size and value, particularly in the southern & eastern parts of the district. The larger lakes, which hold water all the year round, are the Kundra Samundar near Jhalotar, the lake near Nawabganj, the wide expanse of water near Kantha and the long chain of lakes in pargana Mauranwan. In Tehsil Safipur, the more important tanks are those at Mawai-Bhari and Kursat and the Harial Tal near Mustafabad. In Tehsil Hasanganj, besides the Kundra Samundar at Mawai, there are the Kulli Bani and Jalesar tanks near Ajgain and the chain of lakes called Basaha, which it seems, partakes of certain characteristics of a stream also, travelling a distance of 96&nbsp;km in the district and eventually leaving it for district Rae Bareli where it is reckoned as a tributary of the river Sai. In the western part of the [[Tehsil]] are the Katgari lake near Asiwan and the stretches of water at Amarpur, Sambha, Sheothana, Marenda & Asakhera, but in its northern and eastern parts, there are only small and very shallow tanks which dry up when rainfall is deficient. In Tehsil Unnao there are no important lakes, but a number of very shallow depressions, which get filled up with water during the rains and yield excellent crop of rice.\n\nIn Tehsil [[Purwa]] there are many lakes, situated in a well-defined belt stretching along the whole length of the tehsil. The main among them are the lakes at Kantha, Bhadain, Unchagaon, Qila, Akhori, Miri, Zorawarganj and Sarwan. The Barhna tank near Sagauli, the Mohan and Sukrar lakes near Mauranwan, and several others, like the Bharda lake, skirting district Rae Bareli. Besides these, there are the tanks at Sahrawan, the Bhundi tank at Gulariha, and the Kumbha tank at Bhagwantnagar. The lakes at Kantha, Sagauli, and Barela contain water all the year round, while the others generally provide irrigation for the Rabi crops only, drying up in the years of drought. These lakes and tanks abound in fish, and singhara (water chestnut)  is very extensively grown in them.\n\n===Geology===\n[[Geologically]] the district forms part of the vast Indo-Gangetic alluvial tract, of which the origin is attributed to a sag in the earth's crust, formed, in the upper eocene times, between the northwardly drifting Gondwanaland and the rising Himalayan belt, and gradually filled in by sediments so as to constitute a level plane with a very gentle seaward slope. The alluvium formation of the district, comprising sand, silt & clay with occasional gravel, is of the early quaternary to sub-recent age. The older alluvium called bhangar, forms slightly elevated terraces usually above the flood levels. It is rather dark in colour generally rich in concretions and nodules of impure calcium carbonate, locally known as kankar. The newer alluvium, called khandar, forming the lowlands between the Ganga and Bhangar, is light coloured, poor in calcareous contain and composed of lenticular beds of sand, gravel and clays. The economic minerals found in the district are kankar, reh and sand.\n\n===Topology===\nUnnao lies in the great plains of the [[Ganges]] and hence the land is highly fertile. The soil is mostly [[alluvial]].  The Ganges separates Unnao from [[Kanpur]] district. The district is bounded by river Ganges in the west and the river Sai in the east. The entire district falling in Sai Sub-basin of the Ganges basin represents flat topography. The irrigation in the district takes place through Sharda Canal network system and tubewells.\nAbout 92% of the district area is under cultivation.<ref name=dist36>http://cgwb.gov.in/NR/hydro/dist36.pdf</ref> The district has a subtropical climate. The district is mainly drained by the river Ganges and its tributaries Kalyani, Khar, Loni and Marahai in the western part of the district, and by Sai river in the eastern part of the district. All\nthese rivers are perennial in nature. About 87% area of the net sown area (3,00,000 hectares) is irrigated both by surface water (Sharda Canal network system) and ground water through shallow and moderately deep tubewells. The share of surface water irrigation\nis 48% while that of ground water is 52%. The economy of the district mainly depends on agriculture.<ref name=dist36/>\n{{Weather box\n|collapsed =\n|location = Unnao\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 28\n|Feb record high C = 32\n|Mar record high C = 40\n|Apr record high C = 44\n|May record high C = 46\n|Jun record high C = 48\n|Jul record high C = 41\n|Aug record high C = 38\n|Sep record high C = 38\n|Oct record high C = 36\n|Nov record high C = 32\n|Dec record high C = 28\n|year record high C = 48\n|Jan high C = 18\n|Feb high C = 24\n|Mar high C = 29\n|Apr high C = 35\n|May high C = 40\n|Jun high C = 41\n|Jul high C = 35\n|Aug high C = 34\n|Sep high C = 32\n|Oct high C = 30\n|Nov high C = 25\n|Dec high C = 20\n|year high C = 33\n|Jan low C = 6\n|Feb low C = 12\n|Mar low C = 14\n|Apr low C = 20\n|May low C = 22\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 26\n|Aug low C = 23\n|Sep low C = 22\n|Oct low C = 16\n|Nov low C = 12\n|Dec low C = 7\n|year low C = 15\n|Jan record low C = -3\n|Feb record low C = 6\n|Mar record low C = 7\n|Apr record low C = 15\n|May record low C = 17\n|Jun record low C = 20\n|Jul record low C = 21\n|Aug record low C = 18\n|Sep record low C = 19\n|Oct record low C = 15\n|Nov record low C = 9\n|Dec record low C = 0\n|year record low C = -3\n|Jan precipitation mm = 23\n|Feb precipitation mm = 16\n|Mar precipitation mm = 9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 5\n|May precipitation mm = 6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 68\n|Jul precipitation mm = 208\n|Aug precipitation mm = 286\n|Sep precipitation mm = 202\n|Oct precipitation mm = 43\n|Nov precipitation mm = 7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 8\n|year precipitation mm = 881\n|source 1 = <ref name=\"imd\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.imd.gov.in/section/climate/unnao.htm | title = Unnao | accessdate = 25 March 2010\n| publisher = | language = }}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:Unnaocityhospital.jpg|thumb|right|Unnao City Government Hospital]]\n\nUnnao hospital serves patients from nearby villages.

Unnao is a large industrial city with three industrial suburbs around it. The city is famous for its [[leather]], [[mosquito net]], [[Zardozi]] and [[chemical]] industries. Unnao is an historical city with many historical buildings and structures. [[Trans Ganga City]], a new satellite town of Unnao is being developed in order to develop Unnao as a major industrial and infrastructural hub as the region comes under Kanpur-Lucknow Counter Magnet Area. Unnao district is a part of Central [[Ganges Plain]] of the state covering an area of 4558&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The city is enlisted as a municipality of [[Kanpur metropolitan area]] and is the second largest city within the metropolitan area. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\nThe district is named after its capital, Unnao. About 900 years ago, the site of this town was covered with extensive forests. Godo Singh, a Chauhan Rajput, cleared the forests probably in the third quarter of the 12th century and founded a town, called Sawai Godo, which shortly afterwards passed into the hands of the rulers of the Kannauj, who appointed Khande Singh as the Governor of the place. Unwant Rai Singh, a Bisen Rajput and a lieutenant of the Governor, killed him and built a fort here, renaming the place as Unnao after himself.\n\nIn ancient times, the area which comprises Unnao formed part of the [[Kosala]] [[Mahajanapada]]. It was later included in [[Oudh]]. This region has been inhabited since antiquity as traces from ancient times remain at some places in the district. After the [[Indian rebellion of 1857|First War of Indian Independence in 1857]], power was transferred from the [[British East India Company]] to the British Crown, by the Queen's Proclamation of 1858. Once the order was restored, the civil administration was re-established in the district which was named Unnao, with headquarters at Unnao. It assumed its present size in 1869. The same year the town of Unnao was constituted a Municipality. There were many rulers with a small estates ruled under the constituency of Unnao proclaimed by British Constituency during early 1900s till 1948 until India has been handed over to the interim government of 1948. Later, in 1956 the local throne was handed over to Pahadpur estate, one of the strongest estates in Unnao and had been ruled under Rao ShivBali Singh Bahadur Chauhan, who had served his country as a Royal Indian Army personnel in British rule. Later, in 1970s the custody of Unnao had been succeeded by his descendant and his very own son Rao Ramsajeevan Singh Bahadur Chauhan, who also had served his country in Royal Indian Army. He is blessed with 5 children, 2 daughters and 3 sons and had married to the daughter of Raja Bahadur Singh of Dalpatkheda estate. This history is in the Unnao book.\n\n==Surrounding towns==\nUnnao district is surrounded by some of the main cities of Uttar Pradesh \u2013 [[Lucknow]], [[Kanpur]], [[Raebareli]] and [[Hardoi]].{{Geographic location\n|Northwest = Avas Vikas Colony\n|North     = Unnao Industrial Estate\n|Northeast = Shiv Nagar\n|West      = Campbell Lines\n|Center    = Unnao City Downtown\n|South     = A B Nagar ( Atal Behari Nagar)\n|Southwest = Canal Street\n|Southeast = Priyadarshani Nagar Township\n|East      = Lake Town\n|}}\n\n==Urban Agglomeration==\n\nThe Unnao urban agglomeration includes municipal limits of Unnao city and Shuklaganj, the villages of Unnao Rural, Deeh, Dostinagar, Turkmannagar, Ganjauli,Singrosi, Shakpur, Magarwara, Akrampur, Galgalha, Sahjani, Maswasi, Haibatpur, Kathadal Narainpur, Dhaudhi Rautapur which together makes up the population of 303,224\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location and boundaries===\nThe District is roughly a parallelogram in shape and lies between Latitude 26\u00b08' N & 27\u00b02' N and Longitude 80\u00b03' E & 81\u00b03' E.

Among the other mainstreams of the district are Kalyani, the Tanai,  the Loni and the Morahi (Naurahi), all tributaries of the Ganga. These rivers generally run dry during the hot weather, but hold water during the greater part of the year and are utilized for irrigation.\n\n====Ganga====\nThe only great river of the district is the [[Ganga]] which first touches the district near the village of Purwa Gahir, in pargana [[Bangarmau]] and flows south-eastward, separating this district from districts [[Kanpur]] and [[Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh|Fatehpur]]. Generally, it flows from north-west to the south-east, but it makes several sharp bends such as those near Umriya Bhagwantpur, and Rustampur in tehsil Safipur,   Rautapur in tehsil Unnao and Ratua Khera and Duli Khera in tehsil [[Purwa]]. The Ganga receives the Morahi near [[Baksar]] where it flows close to its old high bank. It leaves the district at a short distance from [[Baksar]].\n\nThe river is not, however, put to much use either as a waterway or as a source of [[irrigation]]. There are several ferries for pedestrians and pilgrims but none of them approaches what may be termed a trade route. The river cannot, as a rule, be utilised for irrigation owing to the height of the bank but certain of its small drainage channels or sotas, which run island for a considerable distance in some parganas, are sometimes used to irrigate crops grown in low-lying alluvial lands. Otherwise, cultivated lands lie at great distances and cannot be irrigated from the river whose water would, in order to irrigate these lands, have to be passed through the sands on the sides of the river, and in the process be greatly washed, if not altogether absorbed. The main channel of the river is subject to constant variation and the cultivation in its immediate neighbourhood is, therefore of a shifting kind.\n\nIt appears from its old high bank that the river has a general tendency to shift its course to the west. In the days of Akbar, the river skirted the village of Ghatampur but has since then so altered its course that it now runs about 8&nbsp; km to the south-west of this village.\n\n====Lakes====\nThere is the unusually large number of  [[swamp]]s & [[lake]]s of great size and value, particularly in the southern & eastern parts of the district. The larger lakes, which hold water all the year round, are the Kundra Samundar near Jhalotar, the lake near Nawabganj, the wide expanse of water near Kantha and the long chain of lakes in pargana Mauranwan. In Tehsil Safipur, the more important tanks are those at Mawai-Bhari and Kursat and the Harial Tal near Mustafabad. In Tehsil Hasanganj, besides the Kundra Samundar at Mawai, there are the Kulli Bani and Jalesar tanks near Ajgain and the chain of lakes called Basaha, which it seems, partakes of certain characteristics of a stream also, travelling a distance of 96&nbsp;km in the district and eventually leaving it for district Rae Bareli where it is reckoned as a tributary of the river Sai. In the western part of the [[Tehsil]] are the Katgari lake near Asiwan and the stretches of water at Amarpur, Sambha, Sheothana, Marenda & Asakhera, but in its northern and eastern parts, there are only small and very shallow tanks which dry up when rainfall is deficient. In Tehsil Unnao there are no important lakes, but a number of very shallow depressions, which get filled up with water during the rains and yield excellent crop of rice.\n\nIn Tehsil [[Purwa]] there are many lakes, situated in a well-defined belt stretching along the whole length of the tehsil. The main among them are the lakes at Kantha, Bhadain, Unchagaon, Qila, Akhori, Miri, Zorawarganj and Sarwan. The Barhna tank near Sagauli, the Mohan and Sukrar lakes near Mauranwan, and several others, like the Bharda lake, skirting district Rae Bareli. Besides these, there are the tanks at Sahrawan, the Bhundi tank at Gulariha, and the Kumbha tank at Bhagwantnagar. The lakes at Kantha, Sagauli, and Barela contain water all the year round, while the others generally provide irrigation for the Rabi crops only, drying up in the years of drought. These lakes and tanks abound in fish, and singhara (water chestnut)  is very extensively grown in them.\n\n===Geology===\n[[Geologically]] the district forms part of the vast Indo-Gangetic alluvial tract, of which the origin is attributed to a sag in the earth's crust, formed, in the upper eocene times, between the northwardly drifting Gondwanaland and the rising Himalayan belt, and gradually filled in by sediments so as to constitute a level plane with a very gentle seaward slope. The alluvium formation of the district, comprising sand, silt & clay with occasional gravel, is of the early quaternary to sub-recent age. The older alluvium called bhangar, forms slightly elevated terraces usually above the flood levels. It is rather dark in colour generally rich in concretions and nodules of impure calcium carbonate, locally known as kankar. The newer alluvium, called khandar, forming the lowlands between the Ganga and Bhangar, is light coloured, poor in calcareous contain and composed of lenticular beds of sand, gravel and clays. The economic minerals found in the district are kankar, reh and sand.\n\n===Topology===\nUnnao lies in the great plains of the [[Ganges]] and hence the land is highly fertile. The soil is mostly [[alluvial]].  The Ganges separates Unnao from [[Kanpur]] district. The district is bounded by river Ganges in the west and the river Sai in the east. The entire district falling in Sai Sub-basin of the Ganges basin represents flat topography. The irrigation in the district takes place through Sharda Canal network system and tubewells.\nAbout 92% of the district area is under cultivation.<ref name=dist36>http://cgwb.gov.in/NR/hydro/dist36.pdf</ref> The district has a subtropical climate. The district is mainly drained by the river Ganges and its tributaries Kalyani, Khar, Loni and Marahai in the western part of the district, and by Sai river in the eastern part of the district. All\nthese rivers are perennial in nature. About 87% area of the net sown area (3,00,000 hectares) is irrigated both by surface water (Sharda Canal network system) and ground water through shallow and moderately deep tubewells. The share of surface water irrigation\nis 48% while that of ground water is 52%. The economy of the district mainly depends on agriculture.<ref name=dist36/>\n{{Weather box\n|collapsed =\n|location = Unnao\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 28\n|Feb record high C = 32\n|Mar record high C = 40\n|Apr record high C = 44\n|May record high C = 46\n|Jun record high C = 48\n|Jul record high C = 41\n|Aug record high C = 38\n|Sep record high C = 38\n|Oct record high C = 36\n|Nov record high C = 32\n|Dec record high C = 28\n|year record high C = 48\n|Jan high C = 18\n|Feb high C = 24\n|Mar high C = 29\n|Apr high C = 35\n|May high C = 40\n|Jun high C = 41\n|Jul high C = 35\n|Aug high C = 34\n|Sep high C = 32\n|Oct high C = 30\n|Nov high C = 25\n|Dec high C = 20\n|year high C = 33\n|Jan low C = 6\n|Feb low C = 12\n|Mar low C = 14\n|Apr low C = 20\n|May low C = 22\n|Jun low C = 25\n|Jul low C = 26\n|Aug low C = 23\n|Sep low C = 22\n|Oct low C = 16\n|Nov low C = 12\n|Dec low C = 7\n|year low C = 15\n|Jan record low C = -3\n|Feb record low C = 6\n|Mar record low C = 7\n|Apr record low C = 15\n|May record low C = 17\n|Jun record low C = 20\n|Jul record low C = 21\n|Aug record low C = 18\n|Sep record low C = 19\n|Oct record low C = 15\n|Nov record low C = 9\n|Dec record low C = 0\n|year record low C = -3\n|Jan precipitation mm = 23\n|Feb precipitation mm = 16\n|Mar precipitation mm = 9\n|Apr precipitation mm = 5\n|May precipitation mm = 6\n|Jun precipitation mm = 68\n|Jul precipitation mm = 208\n|Aug precipitation mm = 286\n|Sep precipitation mm = 202\n|Oct precipitation mm = 43\n|Nov precipitation mm = 7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 8\n|year precipitation mm = 881\n|source 1 = <ref name=\"imd\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.imd.gov.in/section/climate/unnao.htm | title = Unnao | accessdate = 25 March 2010\n| publisher = | language = }}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Healthcare==\n[[File:Unnaocityhospital.jpg|thumb|right|Unnao City Government Hospital]]\n\nUnnao hospital serves patients from nearby villages.
