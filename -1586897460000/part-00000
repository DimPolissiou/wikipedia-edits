It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2010, and [[PlayStation 3]] in 2011. ''Mass Effect 2'' is the second installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series and a sequel to the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''. The game takes place within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy during the 22nd century, where humanity is threatened by an [[insectoid]] species known as the Collectors. The player assumes the role of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who must construct and gain the loyalty of a diverse team and stop the enemy in a [[suicide mission]]. With the use of a completed [[saved game]] of its predecessor, the player can impact the story of the game in numerous ways.\n\nFor the game, BioWare changed several gameplay elements and put further emphasis on [[third-person shooter]] aspects, including limited ammunition and regenerable [[Health (gaming)|health]]. In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original ''Mass Effect'', the developers opted to create a plot where optional missions had as much intensity as the main mission. ''Mass Effect'' composer [[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]] returned to compose ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s music, aiming for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game. ''Mass Effect 2'' also supports a variety of [[downloadable content]] packs, ranging from single in-game character outfits to entirely new plot-related missions. Notable packs include ''[[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory|Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory]]'', ''[[Mass Effect 2: Overlord|Overlord]]'', ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker|Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Arrival|Arrival]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 2'' was a commercial success and received critical acclaim from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], with the Xbox 360 version holding a score of 96 out of 100 at the review aggregate website [[Metacritic]]. Critics praised multiple aspects of the game, including its [[interactive storytelling]], [[characterization]], and combat. In contrast, some reviewers expressed concerns about the game's simplified gameplay compared to the previous game in the series. The game received numerous year-end awards, including Game of the Year at the 14th Annual [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|Interactive Achievement Awards]], and Best Game at the 2011 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] Awards. The game is frequently cited as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. A sequel, ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', was released in 2012.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 2'' is a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes the role of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person perspective]]. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> The player may choose to import a character from a completed [[saved game]] of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' or start the game with a new character.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Importing an old character allows several decisions the player made in the original game to impact the story of ''Mass Effect 2'' and grants the player with a set of starting bonuses.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/><ref name=\"Manual starting\"/> The game features six different [[character class]]es for the player to choose from.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> Each class is proficient in a different set of powers and weapon types.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> For example, the Vanguard class is specialized in close-range combat and [[shotgun]]s, while the Infiltrator class relies on stealth combat and the use of [[sniper rifle]]s.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nThe game's [[overworld]] is a [[galaxy]] map that the player can explore to find and complete [[Quest (gaming)|quests]].<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Most quests consist of combat missions, but some involve the player interacting with [[non-player character]]s during visits to settlements.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> As the player progresses throughout the game, different locations and new squad members become available.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> [[Experience point]]s are gained by completing quests.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/> Each time a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the player \"levels up\" and is awarded Squad Points that can be used to develop powers for both Shepard and the members of the squad.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/> Powers provide enhanced combat capabilities, with each power having four ranks that can be unlocked.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Each rank costs the same number of Squad Points as its rank. For example, unlocking the first rank of a power requires one point, but unlocking all four ranks of a single power requires a total of ten points. Upon raising a power to its fourth rank, the player must evolve the power into one of two given forms.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/>\n\nThe player's primary mode of transportation is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armour, travel to numerous [[planetary systems]], and scan planets for mineral resources.<ref name=\"Manual normandy\"/> These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that are found in the missions, providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others.<ref name=\"Prima guide upgrades\"/> Scanning requires the player to move a [[reticle]] over a planet and launch a [[Space probe|probe]] when an [[oscilloscope]] warns of near resources.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> Additional upgrades, equipment, and non-essential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:Mass Effect 2 Combat.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|In combat, the player can pause the action to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The enemy's life bars are shown in a frame at the top of the screen.]]\n\nCombat in ''Mass Effect 2'' is squad-based and a maximum of two squad members may accompany the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Battles take place in [[Time-keeping systems in games|real-time]], but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/> The game uses an [[Over the shoulder shot|over the shoulder perspective]] akin to a [[third-person shooter]], and places a strong emphasis on using [[Cover system|cover]] to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designated target.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nUnlike the original ''Mass Effect'', where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods, the weapons of ''Mass Effect 2'' have a finite [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots.<ref name=\"GI Review\"/> Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage-absorbing shield. When the shield is fully depleted, further damage reduces the [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] of a secondary health meter. Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> The player can revive fallen squad members with the use of the Unity power.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/> However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nAll enemies are protected by health, shields, armour, barriers, or a combination thereof.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Each type of protection has its vulnerabilities. For example, armour is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and weapons with a low [[rate of fire]] such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and rapid-firing weapons like [[submachine gun]]s and [[assault rifle]]s.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Barriers are typically used by [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> When the shields, armour, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Other powers may temporarily benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in [[bullet time]]. Powers do not require any [[Magic point|expendable resource]]; they only have a global [[cooldown]].<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\n===Dialogue and morality===\nDuring conversations with characters, ''Mass Effect 2'' employs a [[Pie menu|radial command menu]], called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's [[Interactive storytelling|dialogue options]] depend on wheel direction.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> The left side of the wheel is typically reserved for options that will continue the conversation in-depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/> The game also introduces a [[Context-sensitive user interface|context-sensitive]] interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances, and the Commander's morality.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nMorality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a unique power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> Upon completing the game, a [[New Game Plus]] option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.<ref name=\"New Game+\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{see also|List of Mass Effect characters}}\n''Mass Effect 2'' is set within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy during the 22nd century where [[interstellar travel]] is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans.<ref name=\"CODEX Mass Relays\"/> A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls a large percentage of the galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community.<ref name=\"CODEX Citadel Council\"/> Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans, asari, salarians, and turians. Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian krogan and drell, the environmental-suited quarians, and a hostile race of networked [[artificial intelligence]]s called geth.<ref name=\"CODEX Geth\"/> During the events of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'', a geth army attempted to open a portal for the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships that are believed to eradicate all organic civilization every 50,000 years.<ref name=\"ME2 Prologue\"/> The galactic community has since lived in fear of another possible invasion. Meanwhile, a human supremacist organization called Cerberus believes that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community and supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal experimentation and [[Terrorism|terrorist]] activities.<ref name=\"CODEX Cerberus\"/>\n\nThe protagonist of the game is Commander Shepard (voiced by [[Mark Meer]] or [[Jennifer Hale]]), an elite human soldier who is the Commanding Officer of the ''SSV Normandy'' and ''Normandy SR-2'' starships. Shepard's squad members include human Cerberus operative [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Jacob Taylor|Jacob Taylor]] (Adam Lazarre-White), human Cerberus officer [[Miranda Lawson]] ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]), salarian scientist [[Mordin Solus]] (Michael Beattie), turian vigilante [[Garrus Vakarian]] ([[Brandon Keener]]), human criminal [[Jack (Mass Effect)|Jack]] ([[Courtenay Taylor]]), genetically engineered krogan super soldier [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Grunt|Grunt]] ([[Steve Blum]]), quarian engineer [[Tali'Zorah]] (Liz Sroka), drell assassin [[Thane Krios]] ([[Keythe Farley]]), asari Justicar [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Samara|Samara]] ([[Maggie Baird]]) or Samara's serial killer daughter [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Morinth|Morinth]] ([[Natalia Cigliuti]]), and geth mobile platform [[Legion (Mass Effect)|Legion]] ([[D. C. Douglas]]). Other characters include the ''Normandy''{{'}}s pilot [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau|Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau]] ([[Seth Green]]), Cerberus leader the [[Illusive Man]] ([[Martin Sheen]]), and the ''Normandy SR-2''{{'}}s enhanced defense intelligence, also known as [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#EDI|EDI]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]).<ref name=\"Manual credits\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nIn 2183, shortly after the events of the first game, the ''SSV Normandy'', while patrolling for geth resistance, is attacked by an unknown vessel, forcing the crew to abandon ship. Shepard pushes Joker into the final [[escape pod]] before being blasted into space. After a suit breach, Shepard dies via [[asphyxia]]tion as his/her body is pulled into the orbit of a nearby planet.<ref name=\"Prima guide intro\"/> The body is recovered by Cerberus, who begins the \"Lazarus Project\" with the sole purpose of bringing Shepard back to life. Two years later, Shepard is revived on an operating table and escapes a research station under attack by its own security [[mecha|mechs]] alongside Jacob Taylor and Miranda Lawson. Shepard is brought to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to investigate a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues suggesting that the Reapers are working by proxy through an [[insectoid]] species called the Collectors.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\nThe Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned, and tasks Shepard with assembling a team to stop them. Shepard is also given command of a new starship, the ''Normandy SR-2'', piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before the Illusive Man informs him/her that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard defends the colony, but is unable to stop a large portion of the population from being captured. Shepard can then recruit former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally replaced by Morinth), before being sent to explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship. There, Shepard learns that the Collectors were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the Reapers. With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors. Although Shepard's squad escapes, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\nShepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] necessary to safely travel through the Omega-4 Relay. Shepard also acquires a disabled geth that, if activated, joins the squad as Legion. While Shepard and the squad leave in a shuttle, the ''Normandy SR-2'' integrates the IFF into her systems. During their absence, the Collectors board the ''Normandy SR-2''. Only Joker avoids capture and, with EDI's help, extracts the ''Normandy SR-2'' to safety. When Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the [[Galactic Center]]. The team rescues any surviving crew members and fights their way to the central chamber. Squad members will either survive or perish depending on the upgrades made to the ''Normandy SR-2'', their loyalty to Shepard, and the tasks they are assigned in battle.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\nIn the central chamber, Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists. Shepard destroys the machine powering it and prepares to destroy the Collector base. However, the Illusive Man proposes [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] the base instead with a timed [[radiation]] pulse so that it can be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the ''Normandy SR-2'', after speaking with the Illusive Man one last time, Shepard meets the survivors in the cargo bay. There, Joker gives him/her schematics of a Reaper. The final scene shows the Reapers awakening in [[Intergalactic space|dark space]] and descending upon the galaxy.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\n==Development==\n===Game design===\n[[File:Christina Norman - Game Developers Conference 2010 - Day 5.jpg|right|thumb|Lead gameplay designer Christina Norman at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]\n''Mass Effect 2'' was developed by [[BioWare]] and directed by [[Casey Hudson]], who previously led the production of the first ''Mass Effect'' game.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers, and internal people.<ref name=\"IGN interview\"/> The company's main goal was to \"create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience.\"<ref name=\"Joystiq interview\"/> In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original ''Mass Effect'', Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities.<ref name=\"Joystiq interview\"/> He noted, \"the funny thing is that people will say 'other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.' But that is the story.\"<ref name=\"Joystiq interview\"/>\n\nDuring the first stages of development, the designers' priority was purely on streamlining and polishing the [[Shooter game|shooting]] aspects; [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] elements were not added until this process was complete.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> According to lead designer Christina Norman, \"we wanted more satisfying combat and a big part of that is making weapons more accurate and powerful at level one\u2014basically saying 'let's take the RPG out of the shooter.'\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> Since BioWare had no experience with shooter games, the team spent roughly three months tuning how combat would work using the original ''Mass Effect'' as a basis.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> The camera was improved to offer a more precise aiming that included body-specific targeting like headshots.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> Norman explained that they wanted the weapons to have their own identity, noting that the final build of the game has 19 weapons with 108 tuning variables.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> The inclusion of limited ammunition was initially not part of the game design and was simply implemented for some early playtesting.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> However, the developers ultimately felt it improved the tension and pacing of combat.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/>\n\nReal-time gameplay with an emphasis on weapons and cover was a preference because the team felt that the constant pausing to select powers interrupts the intensity of the combat.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> As a result, more options to assign different abilities to the [[user interface]] for use in real-time were added.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> Developers also decided to introduce regenerating health because it prevented players from playing erratically and relying on health kits.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> Norman remarked that it was important not to oversimplify the RPG elements but to still make them easier to use.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> She explained that the original ''Mass Effect'' offered \"too many choices that weren't particularly representative of how they would impact the game. In ''Mass Effect 2'', the levelling options were pared down and made more descriptive.\"<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> For the character classes, the developers wanted to create very different play styles, \"even if it meant cutting some of the possible choices.\"<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> The powers were balanced with a unified refresh cooldown since the earlier system, where powers could be used sequentially, was considered \"ridiculous and endgame easy.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/>\n\nKeeping track of the enemies' strengths and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players did not have to estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> The game's [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] was revised eight times during development.<ref name=\"GameInformer Trivia\"/> As the inventory management of the original ''Mass Effect'' received criticism, designing a new inventory system for ''Mass Effect 2'' was one of the main concerns during development.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/> Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/> Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/> Ultimately, the team opted to replace it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management.<ref name=\"PC World interview 4\"/> This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/>\n\nThe planetary exploration of the original ''Mass Effect'' was completely revamped. Instead of having vast barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find.<ref name=\"PC World interview 3\"/> Initially, the developers experimented with the idea of having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain more flexibly than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game.<ref name=\"PC World interview 4\"/> The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was initially meant to be a feature in the original ''Mass Effect'', was introduced in ''Mass Effect 2'' to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.<ref name=\"PC World interview 2\"/> The pacing of the story was also improved because developers wanted to get players into the action faster.<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/>\n\n===Production===\nSince the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series was envisioned as a trilogy from its inception, work on ''Mass Effect 2'' started shortly before the original ''Mass Effect'' was released.<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/> The game was initially developed exclusively for the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] platforms with the same level of dedication.<ref name=\"IGN interview\"/> As a result, each version of the game features different user interfaces and controls.<ref name=\"IGN interview\"/> Like its predecessor, ''Mass Effect 2'' was built using [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 3]] in conjunction with a [[Software framework|framework]] that BioWare specifically developed for the ''Mass Effect'' games.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> As most of these ''Mass Effect'' technologies were already developed in the first game, the development team focused on adding a lot of new content and perfecting new features rather than creating them from scratch.<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/> Technical improvements included better [[memory management]], greater textures, a higher [[frame rate]], and better [[lighting]] scenarios.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> According to Hudson, \"I actually can't think of an aspect of the game that we haven't overhauled and made 100% better.\"<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/>\n\n''Mass Effect 2'' contains voices from 90 [[voice actors]] who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue.<ref name=\"GameInformer Trivia\"/> Voice recording for the game took twice as long as the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"GZ voice recording\"/> The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> As Hudson explained, \"Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that you end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination when you have a conversation with characters.\"<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first ''Mass Effect'' game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/>\n\nAlthough ''Mass Effect 2'' was primarily developed at BioWare's [[Edmonton]] studio, a new team of 30 people was set to work at [[EA Montreal]] in March 2009 to supplement the teams already working on the game.<ref name=\"IGN new studio\"/> The new team was composed of many people who worked on the original game, but the majority was new hires.<ref name=\"IGN new studio\"/> Overall, ''Mass Effect 2'' was developed over the course of roughly two years and more than 150 people worked on the game.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> Hudson mentioned two significant challenges that interfered with the development: financial problems due to the [[Great Recession]] limited the game's budget, and the team had to get through it without impacting their ambitious goals.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 3\"/> Additionally, due to the [[2009 flu pandemic]], a significant part of the team was ill during the last months of development, resulting in a loss of a man-year of time.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 3\"/> Despite these factors, Hudson described the development of ''Mass Effect 2'' as successful \"on time, on budget, and exceeding quality goals.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 3\"/>\n\nInitially, BioWare denied that a [[PlayStation 3]] version was in the works.<ref name=\"IGN no PS3\"/> Despite this, it was reported that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of [[Computer program|code]] referencing the PlayStation 3.<ref name=\"EuroG PS3 code\"/> BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is [[cross-platform]], which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code.<ref name=\"EuroG PS3 code\"/> Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of ''Mass Effect 2'' was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 called ''Mass Effect 3'' engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''.<ref name=\"Joystiq ME2 PS3\"/> In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the [[PlayStation 3 controller]]. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.<ref name=\"Joystiq ME2 PS3\"/>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Jack Wall.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]] returned to compose ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s music, aiming for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game.]]\nThe music of ''Mass Effect 2'' was primarily composed by [[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]].<ref name=\"Jack Wall returns\"/> His previous work with BioWare was as the main composer for ''[[Jade Empire]]'' and the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"Jack Wall returns\"/><ref name=\"Jack Wall Jade Empire\"/> The score also features some pieces by Sam Hulick, David Kates, and Jimmy Hinson (better known as [[Big Giant Circles]]), with additional editing and in-game implementation by Brian DiDomenico.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> Unlike with the original ''Mass Effect'', the composers aimed for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> The music incorporates both [[orchestra]]l and classic [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] arrangements which were inspired by the soundtrack of the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and music by German [[Electronic music|electronic]] group [[Tangerine Dream]].<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> The [[harmonic]] structure of [[Wendy Carlos]]'s ''[[Tron]]'' soundtrack also represented significant influences.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> To complement each character, the composers gave them their own theme song to convey their personalities and backgrounds.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> According to Kates, \"it was one of our mandates to create a dynamic score that expressed a wide range of emotions.\"<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/>\n\nOverall, around 180 minutes of music were composed for ''Mass Effect 2'', which totalled more than 700 assets.<ref name=\"Kates interview\"/> The song \"Callista\" by video game music composer [[Saki Kaskas]], who wrote the music for five ''[[Need for Speed]]'' games,<ref name=\"Kaskas\"/> was used as the game's Afterlife Club theme.<ref name=\"Callista\"/> Music from the game has been released in several albums.<ref name=\"ME2 main soundtrack\"/><ref name=\"ME2 Atmospheric\"/><ref name=\"ME2 Combat\"/> BioWare released the main [[soundtrack album]], ''Mass Effect 2: Original Videogame Score'', on January 19, 2010. The soundtrack spans two discs and 27 tracks, covering a duration of 1:55:43.<ref name=\"ME2 main soundtrack\"/> ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s score was nominated for Best Original Music at the [[7th British Academy Games Awards]],<ref name=\"BAFTA nominees and winners\"/> and Best Soundtrack Album at the 9th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.<ref name=\"GANG nominees\"/><ref name=\"GANG winners\"/> In 2012, ''Legacy'', an album composed mostly of tracks written for ''Mass Effect 2'' but not used in the game was released by Big Giant Circles.<ref name=\"Legacy album\"/>\n\n==Marketing and release==\n''Mass Effect 2'' was formally unveiled at the [[Game Developers Conference]] on March 17, 2009, accompanied by a teaser [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] which declared Shepard to be \"killed in action\".<ref name=\"IGN first trailer\"/> The announcement confirmed that the game would be released for both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360.<ref name=\"IGN ME2 announced\"/> In June 2009, the game was presented at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]],<ref name=\"IGN E3 preview\"/> where it was confirmed that Shepard would be alive and playable in ''Mass Effect 2'', but the character could die at the end of the game.<ref name=\"IGN E3 preview\"/> If the game was pre-ordered at certain retailers, players could receive new in-game armours and weapons.<ref name=\"Release date\"/> Players could also redeem codes on specially marked [[Dr Pepper]] products for one of three pieces of headgear,<ref name=\"Dr. Pepper\"/> and registered copies of ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' for a new set of armour.<ref name=\"Blood Dragon Armor\"/> In the months leading up to the game's release, BioWare released a final cinematic trailer and launched six class trailers narrated by Norman.<ref name=\"Cinematic trailer\"/><ref name=\"Class trailers\"/>\n\n''Mass Effect 2'' was initially released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010, in North America and January 29, 2010, in Europe.<ref name=\"Release date\"/> Alongside the standard edition, a digital deluxe edition and a [[collector's edition]] were made available for purchase.<ref name=\"Collector's edition\"/> The collector's edition featured a different packaging, an artbook, bonus in-game content, a behind-the-scenes DVD, and one issue from the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' comic series.<ref name=\"Collector's edition\"/> Electronic Arts sold-in more than two million copies of the game to worldwide retailers in its first week of release.<ref name=\"1st week sales to retailers\"/> Although ''Mass Effect 2'' was released at the end of the month, it became the second best-selling game of January 2010 with 572,100 units sold, behind [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''.<ref name=\"Sales January 2010\"/>\n\nAt [[Gamescom]] 2010, BioWare announced that a [[PlayStation 3]] version of the game was in development.<ref name=\"IGN ME2 PS3 announcement\"/> Microsoft responded to the announcement that, despite losing the game's exclusivity, the Xbox 360 was still the most appropriate console to play the game due to the game's compatibility with the original ''Mass Effect'', which was only available on the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 systems at the time.<ref name=\"CNET Microsoft\"/> The PlayStation 3 version was released on January 18, 2011, in North America and January 21, 2011, in Europe.<ref name=\"PS3 version release\"/> The [[PlayStation Network]] version accounted for more than 10% of the game's overall sales on PlayStation 3.<ref name=\"PS3 revenue\"/> As of April 2011, it was reported that both the original ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2'' combined had sold more than seven million units worldwide.<ref name=\"7 million units\"/> In 2012, a compilation featuring the three main games of the series, titled ''[[Mass Effect Trilogy]]'', was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.<ref name=\"ME Trilogy\"/> In 2016, ''Mass Effect 2'' was added to the [[List of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One|list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games]] on [[Xbox One]].<ref name=\"BC XONE\"/>\n\nNew purchases of the game are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's [[Cerberus Network]], an online [[downloadable content]] and news service that enables bonus content for the game.<ref name=\"Cerberus Network\"/> However, users who bought the game used would have to pay for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content.<ref name=\"Cerberus Network\"/> This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like [[GameStop]] have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit.<ref name=\"Cerberus Network\"/> BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network.<ref name=\"DLC business\"/> The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.<ref name=\"DLC overpriced\"/>\n\n===Technical issues===\nShortly after the game's release, it was reported that the game's font-size had been formatted in such a way as to make in-game text difficult to read on [[standard-definition television]]s.<ref name=\"PC World text\"/> Representatives from BioWare stated that the issue was a design choice instead of a [[Software bug|bug]].<ref name=\"PC World text\"/> Mark Barlet, president of the website [[AbleGamers]], which advocates for making games more accessible to the disabled, observed that \"It's not just the size of the text of ''Mass Effect 2'' that is the problem, it's the coloring of the text\" that is the problem.<ref name=\"AbleGamers\"/> After investigating the complaints further, BioWare released a statement acknowledging that \"on some standard definition TVs the smallest text in ''Mass Effect 2'' can be difficult to read\", and concluded that they were unable to resolve it through a title update. However, they stated that they would consider the feedback in future games.<ref name=\"Escapist\"/>\n\nOther issues with regards to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]], temporary [[Hang (computing)|freezes]] and long load times were found on single-core computers, but these were ultimately addressed in a [[Patch (computing)|patch]].<ref name=\"PC patch 1\"/> A second patch, which reduced the amount of mining time required to acquire upgrades, fixed some saved game loading issues, and addressed other minor bugs, was also released.<ref name=\"PC patch 2\"/> On PlayStation 3, a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly.<ref name=\"CVG corrupting\"/> After community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare asked affected players to provide details about the issue, BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save bugs and crashes experienced.<ref name=\"PS3 patch\"/>\n\n==Downloadable content==\n{{Main|List of Mass Effect 2 downloadable content}}\n''Mass Effect 2'' supports additional in-game content in the form of downloadable content packs that were released from January 2010 to May 2011. The downloadable content ranges from single in-game character outfits to entirely new plot-related missions. Major packs include ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker|Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Arrival|Arrival]]'', which are vital to the series' plot. In ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'', Shepard helps former squad member [[Liara T'Soni]] to find an information dealer known as the Shadow Broker.<ref name=\"LOTSB Preview\"/> In ''Arrival'', Shepard investigates evidence of a Reaper invasion, leading to events that bridge to ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Arrival Review\"/> Other plot-related downloadable content packs include the loyalty missions ''Zaeed \u2013 The Price of Revenge'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory|Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Overlord|Overlord]]'', which adds five new missions to the game.<ref name=\"Zaeed Hands-on\"/><ref name=\"Kasumi Review\"/><ref name=\"Overlord Review\"/>\n\nUnlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game, the PlayStation 3 version includes the ''Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory'', ''Overlord'', and ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' packs.<ref name=\"ME2 PS3 DLC included\"/> Since the first ''Mass Effect'' game was originally not released on PlayStation 3, BioWare released ''Genesis'', a downloadable content pack which allows the player to impact the story of the game with several major plot decisions of the first game. These decisions are made through a digital interactive [[comic]] which appears at the beginning of the game.<ref name=\"IGN version differences\"/> ''Genesis'' was eventually released on May 17, 2011, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 users.<ref name=\"ME Genesis\"/> The game's downloadable content was generally well-received by critics and some packs were nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content) at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]].<ref name=\"LotSB Spike Awards\"/><ref name=\"Arrival Spike Awards\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n{{Video game reviews\n| 1UP       = A-<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/>\n| Edge      = 9/10<ref name=\"Edge Review\"/>\n| EuroG     = 10/10<ref name=\"EuroG Review\"/>\n| Fam       = 35/40 <small>(PS3)</small><ref name=\"Famitsu PS3\"/><br />36/40 <small>(X360)</small><ref name=\"Famitsu X360\"/>\n| GI        = 9.5/10 <small>(PS3)</small><ref name=\"GI PS3 Review\"/><br />9.75/10 <small>(X360)</small><ref name=\"GI Review\"/>\n| GamePro   = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/>\n| GameRev   = A-<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n| GSpot     = 8.5/10 <small>(PS3)</small><ref name=\"GSpot PS3 Review\"/><br />9/10 <small>(X360)</small><ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/>\n| GSpy      = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref name=\"GSpy Review\"/>\n| GT        = 9.7/10<ref name=\"GT Review\"/>\n| IGN       = 9.5/10 <small>(PS3)</small><ref name=\"IGN PS3 Review\"/><br />9.6/10 <small>(X360)</small><ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n| rev1      = ''GameCritics.com''\n| rev1Score = 7.5/10<ref name=\"GameCritics Review\"/>\n| rev2      = RPGamer\n| rev2Score = 4.5/5<ref name=\"RPGamer Review\"/>\n| MC        = 94/100 <small>(PC)</small><ref name=\"Metacritic PC\"/><br />94/100 <small>(PS3)</small><ref name=\"Metacritic PS3\"/><br />96/100 <small>(X360)</small><ref name=\"Metacritic X360\"/>\n}}\n\nUpon release, ''Mass Effect 2'' received universal critical acclaim from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]].<ref name=\"Metacritic X360\"/> Substantial praise was given to the game's diverse characters, [[interactive storytelling]], voice acting and art design.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> [[IGN]] reviewer Erik Brudvig called ''Mass Effect 2'' a very personal game, with a lot of emotion involved.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> He praised the option of importing a character, stating that the overall experience changes as different saved games from the previous game are used.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Tom Bramwell of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' positively highlighted the weight of social interaction on the outcome of events and that players feel actual pressure for their decisions.<ref name=\"EuroG Review\"/> Further praise was given to the game's characters. ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' credited them for their complex personalities and great [[characterization]],<ref name=\"Edge Review\"/> while [[Game Revolution]] pointed out that the loyalty missions \"reach deep enough into their characters to make you empathize with all of them\".<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n\nThe game's visuals and atmosphere received similar praise. [[GameSpot]] reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that ''Mass Effect 2'' is more detailed and darker than its predecessor.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> He wrote that \"deep reds and glowing [[indigo]]s saturate certain scenes, making them richer and more sinister; eerie fog limits your vision in one side mission, while rain pours down upon you in another. Subtle, moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact.\"<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and [[cutscene]]s for featuring better cinematography than the first game, stating that \"it's hard to imagine them becoming much better in ''Mass Effect 3''\".<ref name=\"RPGamer Review\"/> Critics also gave high marks to the game's extensive [[Voice acting|cast of voices]]; in particular, Martin Sheen's performance of the Illusive Man, which was singled out for \"steal[ing] the show\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Andrew Reiner, writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', opined that the music \"flows beautifully\" in both the story and action sequences.<ref name=\"GI Review\"/> The game's presentation and direction were considered \"miles ahead of the competition\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nNumerous publications declared the gameplay was an improvement over the original.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/><ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/><ref name=\"EuroG Review\"/><ref name=\"GSpy Review\"/> John Davison of ''[[GamePro]]'' wrote \"BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic.\"<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/> VanOrd praised ''Mass Effect 2'' for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> He noted that the shooting is \"more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter\".<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> Similarly, [[GameSpy]]{{'}}s Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original ''Mass Effect'' \"walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] ''Mass Effect 2'' has become a much more focused shooter experience\".<ref name=\"GSpy Review\"/> Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it.<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/> Some publications, however, expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it \"stripped-down\" and with a \"dumbed-down feeling\".<ref name=\"GameCritics Review\"/><ref name=\"RPGamer Review\"/> The game's slow planet scanning was also criticized.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/><ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/><ref name=\"GameCritics Review\"/> Game Revolution felt it was a \"chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge\", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole \"does more than enough to live up to its predecessor\".<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n\nReception for the PlayStation 3 version was similar. Colin Moriarty of IGN described it as \"the best, most complete version of the game available\" due to the upgraded game engine and the extra downloadable content packs.<ref name=\"IGN PS3 Review\"/> In contrast, VanOrd criticized the inclusion of the character Kasumi Goto from the ''Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory'' pack, stating that \"she never fits in with her more fully developed cohorts.\"<ref name=\"GSpot PS3 Review\"/> He also remarked that the PlayStation 3 version suffers from technical issues such as frame rate inconsistencies, graphical glitches, and other minor bugs, which are mostly present in the downloadable content sections of the game.<ref name=\"GSpot PS3 Review\"/> ''Game Informer'' reviewer Joe Juba reacted negatively to the lack of save importation from the original ''Mass Effect'', which was originally not released on PlayStation 3, and pointed out that the decisions made in the ''Genesis'' comic \"have practically no context\".<ref name=\"GI PS3 Review\"/> Despite the criticism, he stated that the game itself is equally as good on PlayStation 3 as it is on Xbox 360.<ref name=\"GI PS3 Review\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Mass Effect 2}}\n''Mass Effect 2'' received numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards for its writing, characters, and soundtrack. At the 2010 [[Spike Video Game Awards]], the game won awards for Best Xbox 360 Game and Best RPG.

''[[GamesRadar]]'' editor Hollander Cooper explained that the game improved the technical issues of its predecessor significantly, while at the same time \"expanding the already-impressive universe without sacrificing what made the series special.\"<ref name=\"GRadar retro\"/> He went so far as to call the game ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' of video games, stating that \"few sequels have trumped the original as handily as ''Mass Effect 2''.\"<ref name=\"GRadar retro\"/> The game's focus on characters, along with their deeper stresses and internal conflicts, was highly praised.<ref name=\"GRadar retro\"/><ref name=\"EuroG retro\"/> The way the game lets non-player characters carry the weight of the narrative progression has also attracted scholarly interest.<ref name=\"Eludamos\"/> ''Eurogamer'' editor Rick Lane described ''Mass Effect 2'' as a darker, warmer, and overall more human game than its predecessor, noting that it is the player's responsibility to make sure these characters are prepared for the final mission, or they will die.<ref name=\"EuroG retro\"/> He explained that ''Mass Effect 2'' is a long quest that \"works towards an epic climax\", and when it arrives there, \"it doesn't disappoint.\"<ref name=\"EuroG retro\"/> A decade after the game was released, ''Eurogamer'' considered the game's finale  \"some of BioWare's best ever work\" due to its choice complexity.<ref name=\"EuroG finale\"/>\n\n''Mass Effect 2'' has been cited as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]] by multiple publications, including ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' in 2014,<ref name=\"Slant Top 100\"/> IGN in 2015,<ref name=\"IGN Top 100\"/> ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' in 2017,<ref name=\"Polygon Top 500\"/> and ''Game Informer'' in 2018.<ref name=\"GI Top 300\"/> In 2011, the game was selected as one of 80 titles from the past 40 years to be placed in the Art of Video Games exhibit in the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].<ref name=\"Smithsonian\"/> According to the museum, the exhibit explored \"the 40-year evolution of video games as an artistic medium, with a focus on striking visual effects and the creative use of new technologies.\"<ref name=\"GSpot exhibit\"/>\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Mass Effect 3}}\nA sequel to the game, entitled ''Mass Effect 3'', was released in 2012.<ref name=\"ME3 release date\"/> The sequel begins on [[Earth]] with Commander Shepard having been detained following the events in the ''Arrival'' downloadable content pack.<ref name=\"ME3 after Arrival\"/> The story of the game is influenced by decisions the player made in the original ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2''.<ref name=\"IGN ME3 Review\"/> However, if Shepard dies at the end of ''Mass Effect 2'', the character cannot be imported into ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Shepard dies\"/> BioWare stated that ''Mass Effect 3'' ends Shepard's story arc and that future games in the series would feature a different context.<ref name=\"No more Shepard\"/> Unlike its predecessors, ''Mass Effect 3'' features a [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative]] mode in addition to the single-player campaign.<ref name=\"IGN ME3 Review\"/> Although the game received critical acclaim from video game publications,<ref name=\"ME3 Metacritic\"/> its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations.<ref name=\"ME3 ending\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<!--CITE VIDEO GAME-->\n\n<ref name=\"ME2 Prologue\">{{Cite video game |title=Mass Effect 2 |developer=[[BioWare]] |publisher=[[Electronic Arts]] |date=January 2010 |scene=Opening |quote=In 2183, the heart of the galaxy suffered a devastating attack.

It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2010, and [[PlayStation 3]] in 2011. ''Mass Effect 2'' is the second installment of the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series and a sequel to the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]''. The game takes place within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy during the 22nd century, where humanity is threatened by an [[insectoid]] species known as the Collectors. The player assumes the role of [[Commander Shepard]], an elite human soldier who must construct and gain the loyalty of a diverse team and stop the enemy in a [[suicide mission]]. With the use of a completed [[saved game]] of its predecessor, the player can impact the story of the game in numerous ways.\n\nFor the game, BioWare changed several gameplay elements and put further emphasis on [[third-person shooter]] aspects, including limited ammunition and regenerable [[Health (gaming)|health]]. In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original ''Mass Effect'', the developers opted to create a plot where optional missions had as much intensity as the main mission. ''Mass Effect'' composer [[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]] returned to compose ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s music, aiming for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game. ''Mass Effect 2'' also supports a variety of [[downloadable content]] packs, ranging from single in-game character outfits to entirely new plot-related missions. Notable packs include ''[[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory|Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory]]'', ''[[Mass Effect 2: Overlord|Overlord]]'', ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker|Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Arrival|Arrival]]''.\n\n''Mass Effect 2'' was a commercial success and received critical acclaim from [[Video game journalism|video game publications]], with the Xbox 360 version holding a score of 96 out of 100 at the review aggregate website [[Metacritic]]. Critics praised multiple aspects of the game, including its [[interactive storytelling]], [[characterization]], and combat. In contrast, some reviewers expressed concerns about the game's simplified gameplay compared to the previous game in the series. The game received numerous year-end awards, including Game of the Year at the 14th Annual [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|Interactive Achievement Awards]], and Best Game at the 2011 [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] Awards. The game is frequently cited as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. A sequel, ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'', was released in 2012.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mass Effect 2'' is a [[Single-player video game|single-player]] [[action role-playing game]] in which the player takes the role of [[Commander Shepard]] from a [[Virtual camera system|third-person perspective]]. Shepard's gender, appearance, military background, combat-training, and first name are determined by the player before the game begins.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> The player may choose to import a character from a completed [[saved game]] of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'' or start the game with a new character.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Importing an old character allows several decisions the player made in the original game to impact the story of ''Mass Effect 2'' and grants the player with a set of starting bonuses.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/><ref name=\"Manual starting\"/> The game features six different [[character class]]es for the player to choose from.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> Each class is proficient in a different set of powers and weapon types.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> For example, the Vanguard class is specialized in close-range combat and [[shotgun]]s, while the Infiltrator class relies on stealth combat and the use of [[sniper rifle]]s.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nThe game's [[overworld]] is a [[galaxy]] map that the player can explore to find and complete [[Quest (gaming)|quests]].<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Most quests consist of combat missions, but some involve the player interacting with [[non-player character]]s during visits to settlements.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> As the player progresses throughout the game, different locations and new squad members become available.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> [[Experience point]]s are gained by completing quests.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/> Each time a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the player \"levels up\" and is awarded Squad Points that can be used to develop powers for both Shepard and the members of the squad.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/> Powers provide enhanced combat capabilities, with each power having four ranks that can be unlocked.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Each rank costs the same number of Squad Points as its rank. For example, unlocking the first rank of a power requires one point, but unlocking all four ranks of a single power requires a total of ten points. Upon raising a power to its fourth rank, the player must evolve the power into one of two given forms.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/>\n\nThe player's primary mode of transportation is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armour, travel to numerous [[planetary systems]], and scan planets for mineral resources.<ref name=\"Manual normandy\"/> These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that are found in the missions, providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others.<ref name=\"Prima guide upgrades\"/> Scanning requires the player to move a [[reticle]] over a planet and launch a [[Space probe|probe]] when an [[oscilloscope]] warns of near resources.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> Additional upgrades, equipment, and non-essential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\n===Combat===\n[[File:Mass Effect 2 Combat.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|In combat, the player can pause the action to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The enemy's life bars are shown in a frame at the top of the screen.]]\n\nCombat in ''Mass Effect 2'' is squad-based and a maximum of two squad members may accompany the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Battles take place in [[Time-keeping systems in games|real-time]], but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/> The game uses an [[Over the shoulder shot|over the shoulder perspective]] akin to a [[third-person shooter]], and places a strong emphasis on using [[Cover system|cover]] to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designated target.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nUnlike the original ''Mass Effect'', where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods, the weapons of ''Mass Effect 2'' have a finite [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots.<ref name=\"GI Review\"/> Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage-absorbing shield. When the shield is fully depleted, further damage reduces the [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] of a secondary health meter. Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> The player can revive fallen squad members with the use of the Unity power.<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/> However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nAll enemies are protected by health, shields, armour, barriers, or a combination thereof.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Each type of protection has its vulnerabilities. For example, armour is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and weapons with a low [[rate of fire]] such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and rapid-firing weapons like [[submachine gun]]s and [[assault rifle]]s.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Barriers are typically used by [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]]-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> When the shields, armour, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> Other powers may temporarily benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in [[bullet time]]. Powers do not require any [[Magic point|expendable resource]]; they only have a global [[cooldown]].<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\n===Dialogue and morality===\nDuring conversations with characters, ''Mass Effect 2'' employs a [[Pie menu|radial command menu]], called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's [[Interactive storytelling|dialogue options]] depend on wheel direction.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> The left side of the wheel is typically reserved for options that will continue the conversation in-depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile.<ref name=\"Manual command\"/> The game also introduces a [[Context-sensitive user interface|context-sensitive]] interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances, and the Commander's morality.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/>\n\nMorality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.<ref name=\"Prima guide training\"/> For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a unique power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between.<ref name=\"GSpot guide\"/> Upon completing the game, a [[New Game Plus]] option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.<ref name=\"New Game+\"/>\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Setting and characters===\n{{see also|List of Mass Effect characters}}\n''Mass Effect 2'' is set within the [[Milky Way]] galaxy during the 22nd century where [[interstellar travel]] is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans.<ref name=\"CODEX Mass Relays\"/> A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls a large percentage of the galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community.<ref name=\"CODEX Citadel Council\"/> Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans, asari, salarians, and turians. Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian krogan and drell, the environmental-suited quarians, and a hostile race of networked [[artificial intelligence]]s called geth.<ref name=\"CODEX Geth\"/> During the events of the original ''[[Mass Effect (video game)|Mass Effect]]'', a geth army attempted to open a portal for the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships that are believed to eradicate all organic civilization every 50,000 years.<ref name=\"ME2 Prologue\"/> The galactic community has since lived in fear of another possible invasion. Meanwhile, a human supremacist organization called Cerberus believes that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community and supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal experimentation and [[Terrorism|terrorist]] activities.<ref name=\"CODEX Cerberus\"/>\n\nThe protagonist of the game is Commander Shepard (voiced by [[Mark Meer]] or [[Jennifer Hale]]), an elite human soldier who is the Commanding Officer of the ''SSV Normandy'' and ''Normandy SR-2'' starships. Shepard's squad members include human Cerberus operative [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Jacob Taylor|Jacob Taylor]] (Adam Lazarre-White), human Cerberus officer [[Miranda Lawson]] ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]), salarian scientist [[Mordin Solus]] (Michael Beattie), turian vigilante [[Garrus Vakarian]] ([[Brandon Keener]]), human criminal [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Jack|Jack]] ([[Courtenay Taylor]]), genetically engineered krogan super soldier [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Grunt|Grunt]] ([[Steve Blum]]), quarian engineer [[Tali'Zorah]] (Liz Sroka), drell assassin [[Thane Krios]] ([[Keythe Farley]]), asari Justicar [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Samara|Samara]] ([[Maggie Baird]]) or Samara's serial killer daughter [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Morinth|Morinth]] ([[Natalia Cigliuti]]), and geth mobile platform [[Legion (Mass Effect)|Legion]] ([[D. C. Douglas]]). Other characters include the ''Normandy''{{'}}s pilot [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau|Jeff \"Joker\" Moreau]] ([[Seth Green]]), Cerberus leader the [[Illusive Man]] ([[Martin Sheen]]), and the ''Normandy SR-2''{{'}}s enhanced defense intelligence, also known as [[Characters of the Mass Effect universe#EDI|EDI]] ([[Tricia Helfer]]).<ref name=\"Manual credits\"/>\n\n===Plot===\nIn 2183, shortly after the events of the first game, the ''SSV Normandy'', while patrolling for geth resistance, is attacked by an unknown vessel, forcing the crew to abandon ship. Shepard pushes Joker into the final [[escape pod]] before being blasted into space. After a suit breach, Shepard dies via [[asphyxia]]tion as his/her body is pulled into the orbit of a nearby planet.<ref name=\"Prima guide intro\"/> The body is recovered by Cerberus, who begins the \"Lazarus Project\" with the sole purpose of bringing Shepard back to life. Two years later, Shepard is revived on an operating table and escapes a research station under attack by its own security [[mecha|mechs]] alongside Jacob Taylor and Miranda Lawson. Shepard is brought to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to investigate a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues suggesting that the Reapers are working by proxy through an [[insectoid]] species called the Collectors.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\nThe Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned, and tasks Shepard with assembling a team to stop them. Shepard is also given command of a new starship, the ''Normandy SR-2'', piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before the Illusive Man informs him/her that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard defends the colony, but is unable to stop a large portion of the population from being captured. Shepard can then recruit former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally replaced by Morinth), before being sent to explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship. There, Shepard learns that the Collectors were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the Reapers. With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors. Although Shepard's squad escapes, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\nShepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] necessary to safely travel through the Omega-4 Relay. Shepard also acquires a disabled geth that, if activated, joins the squad as Legion. While Shepard and the squad leave in a shuttle, the ''Normandy SR-2'' integrates the IFF into her systems. During their absence, the Collectors board the ''Normandy SR-2''. Only Joker avoids capture and, with EDI's help, extracts the ''Normandy SR-2'' to safety. When Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the [[Galactic Center]]. The team rescues any surviving crew members and fights their way to the central chamber. Squad members will either survive or perish depending on the upgrades made to the ''Normandy SR-2'', their loyalty to Shepard, and the tasks they are assigned in battle.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\nIn the central chamber, Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists. Shepard destroys the machine powering it and prepares to destroy the Collector base. However, the Illusive Man proposes [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] the base instead with a timed [[radiation]] pulse so that it can be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the ''Normandy SR-2'', after speaking with the Illusive Man one last time, Shepard meets the survivors in the cargo bay. There, Joker gives him/her schematics of a Reaper. The final scene shows the Reapers awakening in [[Intergalactic space|dark space]] and descending upon the galaxy.<ref name=\"Prima guide walkthrough\"/>\n\n==Development==\n===Game design===\n[[File:Christina Norman - Game Developers Conference 2010 - Day 5.jpg|right|thumb|Lead gameplay designer Christina Norman at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]\n''Mass Effect 2'' was developed by [[BioWare]] and directed by [[Casey Hudson]], who previously led the production of the first ''Mass Effect'' game.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers, and internal people.<ref name=\"IGN interview\"/> The company's main goal was to \"create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience.\"<ref name=\"Joystiq interview\"/> In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original ''Mass Effect'', Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities.<ref name=\"Joystiq interview\"/> He noted, \"the funny thing is that people will say 'other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.' But that is the story.\"<ref name=\"Joystiq interview\"/>\n\nDuring the first stages of development, the designers' priority was purely on streamlining and polishing the [[Shooter game|shooting]] aspects; [[Role-playing video game|RPG]] elements were not added until this process was complete.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> According to lead designer Christina Norman, \"we wanted more satisfying combat and a big part of that is making weapons more accurate and powerful at level one\u2014basically saying 'let's take the RPG out of the shooter.'\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> Since BioWare had no experience with shooter games, the team spent roughly three months tuning how combat would work using the original ''Mass Effect'' as a basis.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> The camera was improved to offer a more precise aiming that included body-specific targeting like headshots.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> Norman explained that they wanted the weapons to have their own identity, noting that the final build of the game has 19 weapons with 108 tuning variables.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> The inclusion of limited ammunition was initially not part of the game design and was simply implemented for some early playtesting.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/> However, the developers ultimately felt it improved the tension and pacing of combat.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/>\n\nReal-time gameplay with an emphasis on weapons and cover was a preference because the team felt that the constant pausing to select powers interrupts the intensity of the combat.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> As a result, more options to assign different abilities to the [[user interface]] for use in real-time were added.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> Developers also decided to introduce regenerating health because it prevented players from playing erratically and relying on health kits.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> Norman remarked that it was important not to oversimplify the RPG elements but to still make them easier to use.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> She explained that the original ''Mass Effect'' offered \"too many choices that weren't particularly representative of how they would impact the game. In ''Mass Effect 2'', the levelling options were pared down and made more descriptive.\"<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> For the character classes, the developers wanted to create very different play styles, \"even if it meant cutting some of the possible choices.\"<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> The powers were balanced with a unified refresh cooldown since the earlier system, where powers could be used sequentially, was considered \"ridiculous and endgame easy.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 1\"/>\n\nKeeping track of the enemies' strengths and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players did not have to estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies.<ref name=\"GSpot Norman\"/> The game's [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]] was revised eight times during development.<ref name=\"GameInformer Trivia\"/> As the inventory management of the original ''Mass Effect'' received criticism, designing a new inventory system for ''Mass Effect 2'' was one of the main concerns during development.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/> Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/> Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/> Ultimately, the team opted to replace it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management.<ref name=\"PC World interview 4\"/> This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 2\"/>\n\nThe planetary exploration of the original ''Mass Effect'' was completely revamped. Instead of having vast barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find.<ref name=\"PC World interview 3\"/> Initially, the developers experimented with the idea of having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain more flexibly than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game.<ref name=\"PC World interview 4\"/> The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was initially meant to be a feature in the original ''Mass Effect'', was introduced in ''Mass Effect 2'' to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action.<ref name=\"PC World interview 2\"/> The pacing of the story was also improved because developers wanted to get players into the action faster.<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/>\n\n===Production===\nSince the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' series was envisioned as a trilogy from its inception, work on ''Mass Effect 2'' started shortly before the original ''Mass Effect'' was released.<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/> The game was initially developed exclusively for the [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox 360]] platforms with the same level of dedication.<ref name=\"IGN interview\"/> As a result, each version of the game features different user interfaces and controls.<ref name=\"IGN interview\"/> Like its predecessor, ''Mass Effect 2'' was built using [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 3]] in conjunction with a [[Software framework|framework]] that BioWare specifically developed for the ''Mass Effect'' games.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> As most of these ''Mass Effect'' technologies were already developed in the first game, the development team focused on adding a lot of new content and perfecting new features rather than creating them from scratch.<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/> Technical improvements included better [[memory management]], greater textures, a higher [[frame rate]], and better [[lighting]] scenarios.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> According to Hudson, \"I actually can't think of an aspect of the game that we haven't overhauled and made 100% better.\"<ref name=\"PC World interview 1\"/>\n\n''Mass Effect 2'' contains voices from 90 [[voice actors]] who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue.<ref name=\"GameInformer Trivia\"/> Voice recording for the game took twice as long as the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"GZ voice recording\"/> The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> As Hudson explained, \"Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that you end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination when you have a conversation with characters.\"<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first ''Mass Effect'' game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/>\n\nAlthough ''Mass Effect 2'' was primarily developed at BioWare's [[Edmonton]] studio, a new team of 30 people was set to work at [[EA Montreal]] in March 2009 to supplement the teams already working on the game.<ref name=\"IGN new studio\"/> The new team was composed of many people who worked on the original game, but the majority was new hires.<ref name=\"IGN new studio\"/> Overall, ''Mass Effect 2'' was developed over the course of roughly two years and more than 150 people worked on the game.<ref name=\"UE3 Hudson\"/> Hudson mentioned two significant challenges that interfered with the development: financial problems due to the [[Great Recession]] limited the game's budget, and the team had to get through it without impacting their ambitious goals.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 3\"/> Additionally, due to the [[2009 flu pandemic]], a significant part of the team was ill during the last months of development, resulting in a loss of a man-year of time.<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 3\"/> Despite these factors, Hudson described the development of ''Mass Effect 2'' as successful \"on time, on budget, and exceeding quality goals.\"<ref name=\"GamesRadar interview 3\"/>\n\nInitially, BioWare denied that a [[PlayStation 3]] version was in the works.<ref name=\"IGN no PS3\"/> Despite this, it was reported that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of [[Computer program|code]] referencing the PlayStation 3.<ref name=\"EuroG PS3 code\"/> BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is [[cross-platform]], which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code.<ref name=\"EuroG PS3 code\"/> Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of ''Mass Effect 2'' was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 called ''Mass Effect 3'' engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming ''[[Mass Effect 3]]''.<ref name=\"Joystiq ME2 PS3\"/> In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the [[PlayStation 3 controller]]. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.<ref name=\"Joystiq ME2 PS3\"/>\n\n===Music===\n[[File:Jack Wall.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]] returned to compose ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s music, aiming for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game.]]\nThe music of ''Mass Effect 2'' was primarily composed by [[Jack Wall (composer)|Jack Wall]].<ref name=\"Jack Wall returns\"/> His previous work with BioWare was as the main composer for ''[[Jade Empire]]'' and the original ''Mass Effect''.<ref name=\"Jack Wall returns\"/><ref name=\"Jack Wall Jade Empire\"/> The score also features some pieces by Sam Hulick, David Kates, and Jimmy Hinson (better known as [[Big Giant Circles]]), with additional editing and in-game implementation by Brian DiDomenico.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> Unlike with the original ''Mass Effect'', the composers aimed for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> The music incorporates both [[orchestra]]l and classic [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] arrangements which were inspired by the soundtrack of the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'' and music by German [[Electronic music|electronic]] group [[Tangerine Dream]].<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> The [[harmonic]] structure of [[Wendy Carlos]]'s ''[[Tron]]'' soundtrack also represented significant influences.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> To complement each character, the composers gave them their own theme song to convey their personalities and backgrounds.<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/> According to Kates, \"it was one of our mandates to create a dynamic score that expressed a wide range of emotions.\"<ref name=\"Jack Wall interview\"/>\n\nOverall, around 180 minutes of music were composed for ''Mass Effect 2'', which totalled more than 700 assets.<ref name=\"Kates interview\"/> The song \"Callista\" by video game music composer [[Saki Kaskas]], who wrote the music for five ''[[Need for Speed]]'' games,<ref name=\"Kaskas\"/> was used as the game's Afterlife Club theme.<ref name=\"Callista\"/> Music from the game has been released in several albums.<ref name=\"ME2 main soundtrack\"/><ref name=\"ME2 Atmospheric\"/><ref name=\"ME2 Combat\"/> BioWare released the main [[soundtrack album]], ''Mass Effect 2: Original Videogame Score'', on January 19, 2010. The soundtrack spans two discs and 27 tracks, covering a duration of 1:55:43.<ref name=\"ME2 main soundtrack\"/> ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s score was nominated for Best Original Music at the [[7th British Academy Games Awards]],<ref name=\"BAFTA nominees and winners\"/> and Best Soundtrack Album at the 9th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards.<ref name=\"GANG nominees\"/><ref name=\"GANG winners\"/> In 2012, ''Legacy'', an album composed mostly of tracks written for ''Mass Effect 2'' but not used in the game was released by Big Giant Circles.<ref name=\"Legacy album\"/>\n\n==Marketing and release==\n''Mass Effect 2'' was formally unveiled at the [[Game Developers Conference]] on March 17, 2009, accompanied by a teaser [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] which declared Shepard to be \"killed in action\".<ref name=\"IGN first trailer\"/> The announcement confirmed that the game would be released for both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360.<ref name=\"IGN ME2 announced\"/> In June 2009, the game was presented at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]],<ref name=\"IGN E3 preview\"/> where it was confirmed that Shepard would be alive and playable in ''Mass Effect 2'', but the character could die at the end of the game.<ref name=\"IGN E3 preview\"/> If the game was pre-ordered at certain retailers, players could receive new in-game armours and weapons.<ref name=\"Release date\"/> Players could also redeem codes on specially marked [[Dr Pepper]] products for one of three pieces of headgear,<ref name=\"Dr. Pepper\"/> and registered copies of ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' for a new set of armour.<ref name=\"Blood Dragon Armor\"/> In the months leading up to the game's release, BioWare released a final cinematic trailer and launched six class trailers narrated by Norman.<ref name=\"Cinematic trailer\"/><ref name=\"Class trailers\"/>\n\n''Mass Effect 2'' was initially released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010, in North America and January 29, 2010, in Europe.<ref name=\"Release date\"/> Alongside the standard edition, a digital deluxe edition and a [[collector's edition]] were made available for purchase.<ref name=\"Collector's edition\"/> The collector's edition featured a different packaging, an artbook, bonus in-game content, a behind-the-scenes DVD, and one issue from the ''[[Mass Effect: Redemption]]'' comic series.<ref name=\"Collector's edition\"/> Electronic Arts sold-in more than two million copies of the game to worldwide retailers in its first week of release.<ref name=\"1st week sales to retailers\"/> Although ''Mass Effect 2'' was released at the end of the month, it became the second best-selling game of January 2010 with 572,100 units sold, behind [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''.<ref name=\"Sales January 2010\"/>\n\nAt [[Gamescom]] 2010, BioWare announced that a [[PlayStation 3]] version of the game was in development.<ref name=\"IGN ME2 PS3 announcement\"/> Microsoft responded to the announcement that, despite losing the game's exclusivity, the Xbox 360 was still the most appropriate console to play the game due to the game's compatibility with the original ''Mass Effect'', which was only available on the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 systems at the time.<ref name=\"CNET Microsoft\"/> The PlayStation 3 version was released on January 18, 2011, in North America and January 21, 2011, in Europe.<ref name=\"PS3 version release\"/> The [[PlayStation Network]] version accounted for more than 10% of the game's overall sales on PlayStation 3.<ref name=\"PS3 revenue\"/> As of April 2011, it was reported that both the original ''Mass Effect'' and ''Mass Effect 2'' combined had sold more than seven million units worldwide.<ref name=\"7 million units\"/> In 2012, a compilation featuring the three main games of the series, titled ''[[Mass Effect Trilogy]]'', was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.<ref name=\"ME Trilogy\"/> In 2016, ''Mass Effect 2'' was added to the [[List of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One|list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games]] on [[Xbox One]].<ref name=\"BC XONE\"/>\n\nNew purchases of the game are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's [[Cerberus Network]], an online [[downloadable content]] and news service that enables bonus content for the game.<ref name=\"Cerberus Network\"/> However, users who bought the game used would have to pay for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content.<ref name=\"Cerberus Network\"/> This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like [[GameStop]] have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit.<ref name=\"Cerberus Network\"/> BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all ''Mass Effect 2''{{'}}s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network.<ref name=\"DLC business\"/> The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.<ref name=\"DLC overpriced\"/>\n\n===Technical issues===\nShortly after the game's release, it was reported that the game's font-size had been formatted in such a way as to make in-game text difficult to read on [[standard-definition television]]s.<ref name=\"PC World text\"/> Representatives from BioWare stated that the issue was a design choice instead of a [[Software bug|bug]].<ref name=\"PC World text\"/> Mark Barlet, president of the website [[AbleGamers]], which advocates for making games more accessible to the disabled, observed that \"It's not just the size of the text of ''Mass Effect 2'' that is the problem, it's the coloring of the text\" that is the problem.<ref name=\"AbleGamers\"/> After investigating the complaints further, BioWare released a statement acknowledging that \"on some standard definition TVs the smallest text in ''Mass Effect 2'' can be difficult to read\", and concluded that they were unable to resolve it through a title update. However, they stated that they would consider the feedback in future games.<ref name=\"Escapist\"/>\n\nOther issues with regards to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]], temporary [[Hang (computing)|freezes]] and long load times were found on single-core computers, but these were ultimately addressed in a [[Patch (computing)|patch]].<ref name=\"PC patch 1\"/> A second patch, which reduced the amount of mining time required to acquire upgrades, fixed some saved game loading issues, and addressed other minor bugs, was also released.<ref name=\"PC patch 2\"/> On PlayStation 3, a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly.<ref name=\"CVG corrupting\"/> After community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare asked affected players to provide details about the issue, BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save bugs and crashes experienced.<ref name=\"PS3 patch\"/>\n\n==Downloadable content==\n{{Main|List of Mass Effect 2 downloadable content}}\n''Mass Effect 2'' supports additional in-game content in the form of downloadable content packs that were released from January 2010 to May 2011. The downloadable content ranges from single in-game character outfits to entirely new plot-related missions. Major packs include ''[[Mass Effect 2: Lair of the Shadow Broker|Lair of the Shadow Broker]]'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Arrival|Arrival]]'', which are vital to the series' plot. In ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'', Shepard helps former squad member [[Liara T'Soni]] to find an information dealer known as the Shadow Broker.<ref name=\"LOTSB Preview\"/> In ''Arrival'', Shepard investigates evidence of a Reaper invasion, leading to events that bridge to ''Mass Effect 3''.<ref name=\"Arrival Review\"/> Other plot-related downloadable content packs include the loyalty missions ''Zaeed \u2013 The Price of Revenge'' and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory|Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory]]'', and ''[[Mass Effect 2: Overlord|Overlord]]'', which adds five new missions to the game.<ref name=\"Zaeed Hands-on\"/><ref name=\"Kasumi Review\"/><ref name=\"Overlord Review\"/>\n\nUnlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game, the PlayStation 3 version includes the ''Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory'', ''Overlord'', and ''Lair of the Shadow Broker'' packs.<ref name=\"ME2 PS3 DLC included\"/> Since the first ''Mass Effect'' game was originally not released on PlayStation 3, BioWare released ''Genesis'', a downloadable content pack which allows the player to impact the story of the game with several major plot decisions of the first game.

[[GameSpot]] reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that ''Mass Effect 2'' is more detailed and darker than its predecessor.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> He wrote that \"deep reds and glowing [[indigo]]s saturate certain scenes, making them richer and more sinister; eerie fog limits your vision in one side mission, while rain pours down upon you in another. Subtle, moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact.\"<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and [[cutscene]]s for featuring better cinematography than the first game, stating that \"it's hard to imagine them becoming much better in ''Mass Effect 3''\".<ref name=\"RPGamer Review\"/> Critics also gave high marks to the game's extensive [[Voice acting|cast of voices]]; in particular, Martin Sheen's performance of the Illusive Man, which was singled out for \"steal[ing] the show\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/> Andrew Reiner, writing for ''[[Game Informer]]'', opined that the music \"flows beautifully\" in both the story and action sequences.<ref name=\"GI Review\"/> The game's presentation and direction were considered \"miles ahead of the competition\".<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/>\n\nNumerous publications declared the gameplay was an improvement over the original.<ref name=\"IGN Review\"/><ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/><ref name=\"EuroG Review\"/><ref name=\"GSpy Review\"/> John Davison of ''[[GamePro]]'' wrote \"BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic.\"<ref name=\"GamePro Review\"/> VanOrd praised ''Mass Effect 2'' for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> He noted that the shooting is \"more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter\".<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/> Similarly, [[GameSpy]]{{'}}s Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original ''Mass Effect'' \"walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] ''Mass Effect 2'' has become a much more focused shooter experience\".<ref name=\"GSpy Review\"/> Jeremy Parish of [[1UP.com]] credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it.<ref name=\"1UP Review\"/> Some publications, however, expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it \"stripped-down\" and with a \"dumbed-down feeling\".<ref name=\"GameCritics Review\"/><ref name=\"RPGamer Review\"/> The game's slow planet scanning was also criticized.<ref name=\"GSpot Review\"/><ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/><ref name=\"GameCritics Review\"/> Game Revolution felt it was a \"chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge\", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole \"does more than enough to live up to its predecessor\".<ref name=\"GameRev Review\"/>\n\nReception for the PlayStation 3 version was similar. Colin Moriarty of IGN described it as \"the best, most complete version of the game available\" due to the upgraded game engine and the extra downloadable content packs.<ref name=\"IGN PS3 Review\"/> In contrast, VanOrd criticized the inclusion of the character Kasumi Goto from the ''Kasumi \u2013 Stolen Memory'' pack, stating that \"she never fits in with her more fully developed cohorts.\"<ref name=\"GSpot PS3 Review\"/> He also remarked that the PlayStation 3 version suffers from technical issues such as frame rate inconsistencies, graphical glitches, and other minor bugs, which are mostly present in the downloadable content sections of the game.<ref name=\"GSpot PS3 Review\"/> ''Game Informer'' reviewer Joe Juba reacted negatively to the lack of save importation from the original ''Mass Effect'', which was originally not released on PlayStation 3, and pointed out that the decisions made in the ''Genesis'' comic \"have practically no context\".<ref name=\"GI PS3 Review\"/> Despite the criticism, he stated that the game itself is equally as good on PlayStation 3 as it is on Xbox 360.<ref name=\"GI PS3 Review\"/>\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Main|List of accolades received by Mass Effect 2}}\n''Mass Effect 2'' received numerous [[Game of the Year]] awards for its writing, characters, and soundtrack.
