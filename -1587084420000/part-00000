The player assumes control of a [[starship]] named the TRY-Z, as it must prevent the Fourth Empire from taking over the entire [[galaxy]]. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies using either a [[Laser|laser shot]] or a limited supply of [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking missiles]], all while avoiding collision with projectiles or obstacles and making sure the ship's energy meter doesn't fully deplete. It ran on the [[Sega Y Board]] arcade system.\n\nCreated by the same group of developers that later went on to form [[Sega AM1]], ''Galaxy Force'' was developed specifically to show off the capabilities of the Sega Y hardware with its usage of large, detailed backgrounds and massive amount of on-screen [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. The game is part of Sega's \"super scaler\" line of [[Arcade cabinet|arcade cabinets]], alongside titles such as ''[[Out Run]]'' and ''[[Space Harrier]]''. It was largely inspired by ''[[Star Wars]]''. The soundtrack was composed jointly by Katsuhiro Hayashi and Kouichi Namaki, both of who previously created the music for ''[[Thunder Blade]]''. The game came in three different cabinet styles; a standard upright, a \"Deluxe\" machine, and a \"Super Deluxe\" version that could twist and turn the player around. Almost immediately after the game's release, Sega published an updated version titled ''Galaxy Force II'' which added two new levels and other minor additions.\n\n''Galaxy Force'' was critically-acclaimed, being praised for its graphics, gameplay, presentation, music and hardware capabilities, considered to be visually impressive for the time period. It was ported to several platforms, including the [[Master System]], [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Commodore 64]], as well as being released under several different Sega classic game re-release labels such as ''[[Sega Ages]]''. A high-definition remake titled ''Galaxy Force Neo Classic'' was released for the PlayStation 2 in ''Galaxy Force II Special Extended Edition'', alongside the original, which featured smoothed-out graphics and additional visual effects. With the exception of the Master System version, all home versions of the game are based on ''Galaxy Force II''.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:ARC Galaxy Force (Galaxy Force_II).png|thumb|left|Arcade version screenshot.|alt=The player ship flies over a fiery planet surface.

The player assumes control of a starship named the TRY-Z, in its mission to vanquish the Fourth Empire before they take over the entire galaxy.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Gameplay involves maneuvering the TRY-Z through six different stages, referred to as \"worlds\" in-game, all while shooting down incoming enemies and avoiding collision with either them, their projectiles, or an obstacle such as a wall.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> The TRY-Z is equipped with two weapons to destroy enemies; a standard [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] laser shot, and a limited supply of heat-seeking missiles that automatically track down targets.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> Additional missiles can be found throughout specific portions of levels.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> A shield is displayed at the bottom left of the screen that will deplete should the TRY-Z collide with an obstacle or projectile.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The TRY-Z has an energy meter at the bottom of the screen that depletes as the level progresses; energy is decreased by firing weapons and coming into contact with obstacles or projectiles.

The player assumes control of a [[starship]] named the TRY-Z, as it must prevent the Fourth Empire from taking over the entire [[galaxy]]. Gameplay involves shooting down enemies using either a [[Laser|laser shot]] or a limited supply of [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking missiles]], all while avoiding collision with projectiles or obstacles and making sure the ship's energy meter doesn't fully deplete. It ran on the [[Sega Y Board]] arcade system.\n\nCreated by the same group of developers that later went on to form [[Sega AM1]], ''Galaxy Force'' was developed specifically to show off the capabilities of the Sega Y hardware with its usage of large, detailed backgrounds and massive amount of on-screen [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. The game is part of Sega's \"super scaler\" line of [[Arcade cabinet|arcade cabinets]], alongside titles such as ''[[Out Run]]'' and ''[[Space Harrier]]''. It was largely inspired by ''[[Star Wars]]''. The soundtrack was composed jointly by Katsuhiro Hayashi and Kouichi Namaki, both of who previously created the music for ''[[Thunder Blade]]''. The game came in three different cabinet styles; a standard upright, a \"Deluxe\" machine, and a \"Super Deluxe\" version that could twist and turn the player around. Almost immediately after the game's release, Sega published an updated version titled ''Galaxy Force II'' which added two new levels and other minor additions.\n\n''Galaxy Force'' was critically-acclaimed, being praised for its graphics, gameplay, presentation, music and hardware capabilities, considered to be visually impressive for the time period. It was ported to several platforms, including the [[Master System]], [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Commodore 64]], as well as being released under several different Sega classic game re-release labels such as ''[[Sega Ages]]''. A high-definition remake titled ''Galaxy Force Neo Classic'' was released for the PlayStation 2 in ''Galaxy Force II Special Extended Edition'', alongside the original, which featured smoothed-out graphics and additional visual effects.

The player assumes control of a starship named the TRY-Z, in its mission to vanquish the Fourth Empire before they take over the entire galaxy.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Gameplay involves maneuvering the TRY-Z through six different stages, referred to as \"worlds\" in-game, all while shooting down incoming enemies and avoiding collision with either them, their projectiles, or an obstacle such as a wall.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> The TRY-Z is equipped with two weapons to destroy enemies; a standard [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] laser shot, and a limited supply of heat-seeking missiles that automatically track down targets.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> Additional missiles can be found throughout specific portions of levels.<ref name=\"NLife\"/> A shield is displayed at the bottom left of the screen that will deplete should the TRY-Z collide with an obstacle or projectile.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The TRY-Z has an energy meter at the bottom of the screen that depletes as the level progresses; energy is decreased by firing weapons and coming into contact with obstacles or projectiles. When the energy meter is fully depleted, the game will end.<ref name=\"HG101\"/>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Development and release==\n''Galaxy Force'' was released into arcades by [[Sega]] in May 1988 in Japan and later that year in both North America and Europe.<ref name=\"TV Book\">{{cite book |last1=Akagi |first1=Masumi |title=\u30a2\u30fc\u30b1\u30fc\u30c9TV\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u56fd\u5185\u2022\u6d77\u5916\u7de8(1971-2005) |date=13 October 2006 |publisher=Amusement News Agency |location=Japan |isbn=978-4990251215 |edition=First |url=https://archive.org/details/ArcadeGameList1971-2005/page/n51 |accessdate=16 August 2019}}</ref> Created as part of Sega's \"super scaler\" line of arcade games, which also included games such as ''[[Out Run]]'' and ''[[Space Harrier]]'', ''Galaxy Force'' was designed specifically to show off the [[Sega Y Board]] arcade system, showcasing scrolling backgrounds and many on-screen sprites.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Development of the game was handled by a group of developers that later went on to form [[Sega AM1]], and was in production alongside [[Yu Suzuki]]'s ''[[Power Drift]]''.<ref name=\"3D Interview 2\">{{cite web |author1=DePapier |title=SEGA: \u2018SEGA 3D Classics Collection Developer\u2019s Interview Part 2\u2019 |url=https://nintendobserver.com/2016/05/sega-sega-3d-classics-collection-developers-interview-part-2/ |website=Nintendo Observer |accessdate=15 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215143421/https://nintendobserver.com/2016/05/sega-sega-3d-classics-collection-developers-interview-part-2/ |archivedate=15 February 2020 |date=22 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Three cabinet versions of the game were produced; a standard upright cabinet, a \"Deluxe\" machine, and a \"Super Deluxe\" version that could twist and turn 335 degrees left and right, and move forwards and backwards at 15 degrees.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The Super Deluxe version also included a headphone jack.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The music in ''Galaxy Force'' was composed jointly by Katsuhiro Hayashi and Kouichi Namaki, both of who previously worked on the soundtrack for ''[[Thunder Blade]]''.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The game was largely inspired by ''[[Star Wars]]'', containing several subtle references in-game through its stage design.<ref name=\"HG101\">{{cite web |last1=Kalata |first1=Kurt |title=Galaxy Force |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/galaxy-force/ |website=Hardcore Gaming 101 |accessdate=15 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806045540/http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/galaxy-force/ |archivedate=6 August 2019 |date=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo months after the game was released, Sega published ''Galaxy Force II'' as a conversion kit; it is not a sequel, but rather an updated version of the original that adds two new levels, corrects many difficulty balance problems, and allows the player to fire all four missiles at once instead of one at a time.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> Almost all home releases of ''Galaxy Force'' either are or based on ''Galaxy Force II'';<ref name=\"HG101\"/> the first of these was released in 1990 for the [[FM Towns]], followed by a port for the [[Sega Genesis]]; both of these were developed by Japanese company [[CRI Middleware]].<ref name=\"HG101\"/> A version for the [[Master System]] was also released, which was published by Sega in Europe and by [[Activision]] in Europe.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> The Master System port was completely redone to accommodate for the console's technical limitations, bearing a much closer resemblance to ''Space Harrier'', and is the only port not to be based on ''Galaxy Force II''.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> ''Galaxy Force'' was also ported to several home computers, including the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Atari ST]] and [[Amstrad]].<ref name=\"HG101\"/>\n\nIn 1998, ''Galaxy Force II'' was released for the [[Sega Saturn]] as part of the ''[[Sega Ages]]'' series of classic game re-releases, including a brief background on the game's story and the ability to watch a pre-recorded playthrough.<ref name=\"HG101\"/> A [[PlayStation 2]] version was released in Japan in 2007 under the ''Sega Ages 2500'' brand, developed by [[M2 (game developer)|M2]] and titled ''Galaxy Force II: Special Extended Edition''.
