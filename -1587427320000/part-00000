Blood donors are generally healthier. People may be more interested in street tests if they may have been infected, or are more likely to get infected if they venture on the streets. Furthermore, the disease is rapidly evolving, out-dating many findings quickly. It typically takes some weeks do develop antibodies after infection. It typically takes some weeks to die after infection. It is widely recognized that deaths are often under-reported, for instance when only confirmed cases are counted. Deaths may be caused by or be attributed to underlying conditions or other causes.\n\nIn [[Castiglione d'Adda]], a small village of 4600 in northern Italy, 80 people (1.7% of the population) are already dead.

A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The position of Ni\u0161 is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Ni\u0161 is easily accessible, having an airport \u2013 [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines. \n{{wide image|Ni\u0161, panorama n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|700px|Panorama picture of the Square of the [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].}}\nIt is in Ni\u0161 that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:\n\n* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,\n* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava]] and the [[Maritsa|Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.\n\nThese roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Ni\u0161 thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2017, Ni\u0161 has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name=\"srbeconomiczone2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n;Economic preview\n[[File:Saborna_crkva_april_2012a.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].]]\n[[File:Ni\u0161ava_River,_Ni\u0161,_Serbia.jpg|thumb|[[Ni\u0161ava]] river.]]\n[[File:Kazandzijsko_Nis.JPG|thumb|[[Tinkers Alley]], old urban downtown built in the first half of the [[18th century]].]]\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2019):<ref name=\"stats19employees\">{{cite web |title=\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, 2019. - \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u045a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a - |url=https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2020/Pdf/G20201018.pdf |website=stat.gov.rs |publisher=Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia |accessdate=15 March 2020 |language=Serbian |date=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

In the Ni\u0161 area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the [[Ni\u0161ava]] river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of [[Sofia]] and [[Istanbul]]. The city has been a passing station for the [[Orient Express]].\n\nThe first highways date back to the 1950s when Ni\u0161 was linked with capital Belgrade through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]], the first in Central-Eastern Europe.\n\nHistorically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the [[Roman Empire]] that built the important road [[Via Militaris]], linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast. Nowadays, the city is connected by the highway [[E75 in Serbia|E75]] with Belgrade and Central Europe in north, and [[Skopje]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]] in the south. The road [[European route E80|E80]] connects Ni\u0161 with Sofia, Istanbul towards the Middle East, and [[Pristina]], [[Montenegro]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the West. The road [[E771]] connects the city with [[Zaje\u010dar]], [[Kladovo]] and [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]] in [[Romania]].\n\nThe city is also a major regional railway junction linking Serbia to Sofia and Istanbul.\n\nThe [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport|Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great]] airport is the second most important airport in Serbia. The first airfield serving the city of Ni\u0161 was established in 1910, near the village of [[Donje Me\u0111urovo]]. In the 1930s then-national airline company [[Aeroput]] used the airport for civil service. In 1935 Aeroput included a stop in Ni\u0161 in its route linking Belgrade with Skoplje.<ref>[http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ Drustvo za Vazdusni Saobracaj A D \u2013 Aeroput (1927-1948)] at europeanairlines.no</ref>\n\nThe city public transportation consists nowadays of 13 bus lines.

The position of Ni\u0161 is strategically important, at the intersection of European highway and railway networks connecting Europe with Asia. Ni\u0161 is easily accessible, having an airport \u2013 [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport]] and being a point of intersection of numerous railroad and highway lines. \n{{wide image|Ni\u0161, panorama n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed.jpg|700px|Panorama picture of the Square of the [[Milan I of Serbia|King Milan I]].}}\nIt is in Ni\u0161 that the trunk road running from the north down the [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava River]] valley forks into two major lines:\n\n* the south one, leading to [[Thessalonica]] and [[Athens]], along the [[Vardar]] River valley,\n* and the east one, running along the [[Nisava]] and the [[Maritsa|Marica]], leading towards Sofia and Istanbul, and further on, towards the Near East.\n\nThese roads have been widely known from ancient times, because they represented the beaten tracks along which peoples, goods and armies moved. Known as 'Via Militaris' in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] periods, or 'Constantinople road' in Middle Ages, these roads still represent major European traffic arteries. Ni\u0161 thus stands at a point of intersection of the roads connecting Asia Minor to Europe, and the [[Black Sea]] to the Mediterranean. Nis had been a relatively developed city in the former Yugoslavia. In 1981, its GDP per capita was 110% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 2017, Ni\u0161 has one of 14 [[free economic zone]]s established in Serbia.<ref name=\"srbeconomiczone2017\">{{cite news |last1=Mikavica |first1=A. |title=Slobodne zone mamac za investitore |url=http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/388105/Slobodne-zone-mamac-za-investitore |accessdate=17 March 2019 |work=politika.rs |date=3 September 2017 |language=Serbian}}</ref>\n\n;Economic preview\n[[File:Saborna_crkva_april_2012a.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]].]]\n[[File:Ni\u0161ava_River,_Ni\u0161,_Serbia.jpg|thumb|[[Ni\u0161ava]] river.]]\n[[File:Kazandzijsko_Nis.JPG|thumb|[[Tinkers Alley]], old urban downtown built in the first half of the [[18th century]].]]\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2019):<ref name=\"stats19employees\">{{cite web |title=\u0417\u0430\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438 \u0443 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, 2019. - \u0413\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0448\u045a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043a - |url=https://publikacije.stat.gov.rs/G2020/Pdf/G20201018.pdf |website=stat.gov.rs |publisher=Statistical Office of Republic of Serbia |accessdate=15 March 2020 |language=Serbian |date=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|- \n!

In the Ni\u0161 area, this major transportation and communication route is linked with the natural corridor formed by the [[Ni\u0161ava]] river valley, which runs Eastwards in the direction of [[Sofia]] and [[Istanbul]]. The city has been a passing station for the [[Orient Express]].\n\nThe first highways date back to the 1950s when Ni\u0161 was linked with capital Belgrade through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]], the first in Central-Eastern Europe.\n\nHistorically, because of its location, the city had always great importance in the region. The first to take advantage of it was the [[Roman Empire]] that built the important road [[Via Militaris]], linking the city with ''Singidunum'' (current Belgrade) to the North and ''Constantinople'' (current Istanbul) to the southeast. Nowadays, the city is connected by the highway [[E75 in Serbia|E75]] with Belgrade and Central Europe in north, and [[Skopje]], [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Athens]] in the south. The road [[European route E80|E80]] connects Ni\u0161 with Sofia, Istanbul towards the Middle East, and [[Pristina]], [[Montenegro]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the West. The road [[E771]] connects the city with [[Zaje\u010dar]], [[Kladovo]] and [[Drobeta-Turnu Severin]] in [[Romania]].\n\nThe city is also a major regional railway junction linking Serbia to Sofia and Istanbul.\n\nThe [[Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great Airport|Ni\u0161 Constantine the Great]] airport is the second most important airport in Serbia. The first airfield serving the city of Ni\u0161 was established in 1910, near the village of [[Donje Me\u0111urovo]]. In the 1930s then-national airline company [[Aeroput]] used the airport for civil service.

It originally ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from October 3, 2001, to June 2, 2009.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:ATJcast.jpg|thumb|left|The cast of ''According to Jim''.]]\nJim is a happy-go-lucky [[Suburb|suburban]] father. Much like his real-life counterpart, Jim's character is a fan of [[blues]] music, as well as the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Chicago Bulls]], and [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Together with his wife Cheryl, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of twins Jonathan and Gordon.\n\nJim often finds himself in difficult situations, because his [[slacker]] sensibilities cause him to search for alternative ways to get things done with less effort. While Cheryl's brother Andy is Jim's best friend, her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him which resulted of calling Jim a jerk or a jackass. He hates losing to women, especially if Cheryl or Dana find out. He doesn't like people interrupting him when he talks, so he speaks over them to shut them up. Jim often makes an example of Andy, who for most of the series does not have a steady girlfriend. Dana and Jim argue constantly, but Dana flirts with Jim when she's [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], discovering after one such event that she respects Jim as a loving father despite his flaws.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of According to Jim episodes}}\n{{:List of According to Jim episodes}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Note: episode counts are against guidelines set at WP:TVCAST -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!rowspan=\"2\" |Actor\n!rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n!colspan=\"8\" |Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|1\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|2\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|3\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|4\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|5\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|6\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|7\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|8\n|-\n| [[Jim Belushi]]\n| James Orenthal \"Jim\"\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]\n| Cheryl Mabel\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Kimberly Williams-Paisley]]\n| Dana Gibson\n| colspan=\"7\" {{CMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest|Special Guest}}\n|-\n| [[Larry Joe Campbell]]\n| Andy\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Taylor Atelian\n| Ruby\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}} \n|-\n| Billi Bruno\n| Gracie\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Mitch Rouse]]\n| Ryan Gibson\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CNone}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CNone}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest}}\n|-\n| Conner Rayburn\n| Kyle\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CNone}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{CMain}}\n|}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''According to Jim'' was created by [[Tracy Newman]] and [[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]].

Was he really wrong? He's contrite, sure. But isn't he just being a man?'\"\n\nIn an interview, Jim Belushi explained that the show many times directly reflected his actual life. Quite a few episodes were experiences taken directly from Belushi's home. Most of the episodes were taken from experiences inside the writers\u2019 homes, too. He adds:<ref name=\"fame10.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fame10.com/entertainment/7-things-you-didnt-know-about-according-to-jim/|title=7 things you didnt know about According to Jim}}</ref>\n\n\"Every show is based in somebody\u2019s reality.

Because it was a relationship show about a family, everyone would bring in their experiences as a family, and we would do shows around them.\"\n\n====Family names====\n[[Surname|Last names]] were never really addressed for the entire run of the show. None of the main characters did get a last name until Season 4 when [[Kimberly Williams-Paisley]]'s character Dana married Dr. Ryan Gibson (played by [[Mitch Rouse]]). She became Dana Gibson with their marriage. Only guest characters had first and last names in most cases.<ref name=\"fame10.com\"/>\n\n===History===\nThe show first aired following the surprise hit comedy ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'' and quickly developed an audience of its own. For its second season ABC placed it on its revitalized Tuesday line-up, which also included John Ritter's ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', Bonnie Hunt's ''[[Life with Bonnie]]'' and Sara Rue's ''[[Less Than Perfect]]''. Week by week, the show attracted more and more viewers, becoming ABC's second most watched sitcom. The show performed so well that the network made a risky move: putting ''Jim'' opposite the [[NBC]] juggernaut ''[[Frasier]]''. Although ''Jim'' did not beat the competition, it performed well enough to secure itself that spot on the 2003 fall schedule.\n\nOn May 15, 2007, ABC announced that ''According to Jim'' would not be renewed for another season. ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson said, \"We are talking to the studio to see if there's something financially, a deal that would make sense for us.\"<ref>[https://archive.is/20070517044954/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php ]</ref>  But on June 27, 2007, ABC renewed the show for a seventh season with 18 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/06/abc_renews_according_to_jim.php |title=ABC Renews \u2018According to Jim\u2019 |publisher=TVWeek |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2015-10-02}}</ref><ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070628/ap_on_en_tv/tv_according_to_jim_1]\n{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\n''According to Jim'' returned to ABC's schedule on Tuesday, January 1, 2008, with two episodes at 9&nbsp;pm and 9:30&nbsp;pm.

It originally ran on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from October 3, 2001, to June 2, 2009.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:ATJcast.jpg|thumb|left|The cast of ''According to Jim''.]]\nJim is a happy-go-lucky [[Suburb|suburban]] father. Much like his real-life counterpart, Jim's character is a fan of [[blues]] music, as well as the [[Chicago Bears]], [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Chicago Bulls]], and [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. Together with his wife Cheryl, they have three children, daughters Ruby and Gracie and son Kyle. In the seventh season they become parents of twins Jonathan and Gordon.\n\nJim often finds himself in difficult situations, because his [[slacker]] sensibilities cause him to search for alternative ways to get things done with less effort. While Cheryl's brother Andy is Jim's best friend, her sister Dana frequently teams up with Cheryl against Jim. He also prefers to lie to Cheryl and Dana to do his own activities but they end up backfiring on him. He hates losing to women, especially if Cheryl or Dana find out. He doesn't like people interrupting him when he talks, so he speaks over them to shut them up. Jim often makes an example of Andy, who for most of the series does not have a steady girlfriend. Dana and Jim argue constantly, but Dana flirts with Jim when she's [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]], discovering after one such event that she respects Jim as a loving father despite his flaws.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of According to Jim episodes}}\n{{:List of According to Jim episodes}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Note: episode counts are against guidelines set at WP:TVCAST -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!rowspan=\"2\" |Actor\n!rowspan=\"2\" |Character\n!colspan=\"8\" |Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|1\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|2\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|3\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|4\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|5\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|6\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|7\n! style=\"width:8%;\"|8\n|-\n| [[Jim Belushi]]\n| James Orenthal \"Jim\"\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Courtney Thorne-Smith]]\n| Cheryl Mabel\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Kimberly Williams-Paisley]]\n| Dana Gibson\n| colspan=\"7\" {{CMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest|Special Guest}}\n|-\n| [[Larry Joe Campbell]]\n| Andy\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| Taylor Atelian\n| Ruby\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}} \n|-\n| Billi Bruno\n| Gracie\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CMain}}\n|-\n| [[Mitch Rouse]]\n| Ryan Gibson\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CNone}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CMain}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CNone}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CGuest}}\n|-\n| Conner Rayburn\n| Kyle\n| colspan=\"3\" {{CNone}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"4\" {{CMain}}\n|}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n''According to Jim'' was created by [[Tracy Newman]] and [[Jonathan Stark (actor)|Jonathan Stark]].

Only guest characters had first and last names in most cases.<ref name=\"fame10.com\"/>\n\n===History===\nThe show first aired following the surprise hit comedy ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'' and quickly developed an audience of its own. For its second season ABC placed it on its revitalized Tuesday line-up, which also included John Ritter's ''[[8 Simple Rules]]'', Bonnie Hunt's ''[[Life with Bonnie]]'' and Sara Rue's ''[[Less Than Perfect]]''. Week by week, the show attracted more and more viewers, becoming ABC's second most watched sitcom. The show performed so well that the network made a risky move: putting ''Jim'' opposite the [[NBC]] juggernaut ''[[Frasier]]''. Although ''Jim'' did not beat the competition, it performed well enough to secure itself that spot on the 2003 fall schedule.\n\nOn May 15, 2007, ABC announced that ''According to Jim'' would not be renewed for another season. ABC Entertainment President Stephen McPherson said, \"We are talking to the studio to see if there's something financially, a deal that would make sense for us.\"<ref>[https://archive.is/20070517044954/http://www.tvseriesfinale.com/2007/05/2007_cancelled_shows_abc_cuts_some_beloved_series.php ]</ref>  But on June 27, 2007, ABC renewed the show for a seventh season with 18 episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/06/abc_renews_according_to_jim.php |title=ABC Renews \u2018According to Jim\u2019 |publisher=TVWeek |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2015-10-02}}</ref><ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070628/ap_on_en_tv/tv_according_to_jim_1]\n{{dead link|date=November 2010}}</ref>\n\n''According to Jim'' returned to ABC's schedule on Tuesday, January 1, 2008, with two episodes at 9&nbsp;pm and 9:30&nbsp;pm.

He graduated from the Faculty of Economics, [[University of Indonesia]] (FEUI) in 1958. Positions held in government included, among others, Chairman of Supreme Audit Agency, [[List of Ministers of Finance of Indonesia|Minister of Finance]], Chairman of the National Planning Agency (Bappenas), and Minister for Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform.<ref name=Bondan2012>Bondan W., ''J.B.

Kompas Nusantara.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nSumarlin graduated with an [[master's degree|M.A.]] in economics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1960, and a [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mustopadidjaja AR |title=Bappenas dalam Sejarah Perencanaan Pembangunan Indonesia 1945-2025 [Bappenas in the History of Development Planning in Indonesia 1945-2025] |date=2012 |publisher=LP3ES |location=Jakarta |isbn=978-979-3330-97-6 |page=543 |ref=mar}}</ref> His master's thesis was about ''Some Aspects of American and Indonesian Fiscal and Monetary Policies: A Comparative Study''<ref name=\"ma1960\" /> and his doctoral's thesis was entitled ''Some Aspects of Stabilization Policies and Their Institutional Problems: The Indonesian Case 1950-1960''.\n\nAfter graduating with an undergraduate degree (S1 in the Indonesian system) at the University of Indonesia in 1958, Sumarlin served as a teaching assistant for some years. In 1965 he was appointed as a lecturer in the FEUI, then as a professor in 1979. Previously, he had worked in an industrial company in Jakarta. During earlier political struggles, Sumarlin had worked as a member of the Indonesian Red Cross, and as a recruit in the Indonesian army (''Tentara Nasional Indonsia'', or TNI) in East Java. For his service, in 1973 he received the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Indonesia#Stars of the Republic of Indonesia|''Mahaputra Utama'' star]], one of the highest honours awarded in Indonesia. Two years later he was awarded the Grand Cross in the [[Order of Leopold II]] of the Belgian government. In his private life, Sumarlin was a sports enthusiast and enjoyed tennis and jogging. He was married to Th. Yostiana Soedarmi. Together they had four children.<ref name=Bondan2012 />\n\nSumarlin had a slight build and this was associated with an incident that became well known among his colleagues in Jakarta. Around 1969, during the early stage of the work of the New Order government of president [[Suharto|Soeharto]], in his position as Deputy Minister of the Indonesian National Planning Agency, Bappenas, Sumarlin was often required to accompany the Chair of Bappenas, [[Widjojo Nitisastro|Professor Widjojo Nitisastro]], to Cabinet meetings. During one of the meetings at the [[Merdeka Palace|National Palace]], Cabinet Secretary [[Sudharmono]] is said to have casually gestured towards Sumarlin asking, \"Who is the boy sitting there, Widjojo?\" Widjojo then introduced Sumarlin to the Cabinet Secretary. Sudharmono responded that, indeed, he recalled that Widjojo had mentioned that that he was recruiting a team to work with him in the National Planning Agency.\n\nAfter the incident, Sumarlin was reluctant to continue attending Cabinet meetings, knowing that attendance was usually severely limited and the names of participants needed to be notified to Cabinet Secretary Sudharmono beforehand. But Widjojo encouraged Sumarlin to continue attending. Widjojo's approach proved correct because, in time, Sumarlin became one of Soeharto's most trusted economics advisers.\n\nWhile serving as Deputy Chair of Bappenas, Sumarlin was closely involved in drafting government reforms with guidance from Cabinet Secretary Sudharmono. He was regularly involved, for example, in the preparation of the key Annex document attached to the Presidential State Address released on August 16 each year for presentation to parliament. He was also actively in government administration as a member of various official teams charged with reviews of procedures governing such things as controls over the procurement of goods and equipment.\n\n==Experience in government==\nAlthough of modest stature and known for a disarming smile, Sumarlin became an effective minister during the period of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government in Indonesia. From 1970 through to 1998, he was influential in guiding economic and financial policy. Along with Widjojo and other ministers in the economic team, Sumarlin became a key economic policy adviser to president Soeharto.<ref name=Bondan2012 />\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973 Sumarlin was secretary to the Indonesian Monetary Board. Previously he had held the post of deputy minister for Fiscal and Monetary Affairs in the Indonesian National Planning Agency. During the next ten years (1973\u20131983), Sumarlin served as Minister of State for Administrative Control. Later, between 1983 and 1988, he was appointed to the position of State Minister for National Development Planning, concurrently holding the post of Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas). On the sidelines during that period he was appointed interim Minister of Finance, and also Minister of Education & Culture ad interim replacing Prof. Dr. [[Nugroho Notosusanto]] who died in 1985.\n\nSumarlin then became Minister of Finance in the [[Fifth Development Cabinet]] (March 21, 1988 \u2013 March 17, 1993).

He graduated from the Faculty of Economics, [[University of Indonesia]] (FEUI) in 1958. Positions held in government included, among others, Chairman of Supreme Audit Agency, [[List of Ministers of Finance of Indonesia|Minister of Finance]], Chairman of the National Planning Agency (Bappenas), and Minister for Administrative and Bureaucratic Reform.<ref name=Bondan2012>Bondan W., ''J.B.

Kompas Nusantara.</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nSumarlin graduated with an [[master's degree|M.A.]] in economics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1960, and a [[doctorate]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mustopadidjaja AR |title=Bappenas dalam Sejarah Perencanaan Pembangunan Indonesia 1945-2025 [Bappenas in the History of Development Planning in Indonesia 1945-2025] |date=2012 |publisher=LP3ES |location=Jakarta |isbn=978-979-3330-97-6 |page=543 |ref=mar}}</ref> His master's thesis was about ''Some Aspects of American and Indonesian Fiscal and Monetary Policies: A Comparative Study''<ref name=\"ma1960\" /> and his doctoral's thesis was entitled ''Some Aspects of Stabilization Policies and Their Institutional Problems: The Indonesian Case 1950-1960''.\n\nAfter graduating with an undergraduate degree (S1 in the Indonesian system) at the University of Indonesia in 1958, Sumarlin served as a teaching assistant for some years. In 1965 he was appointed as a lecturer in the FEUI, then as a professor in 1979. Previously, he had worked in an industrial company in Jakarta. During earlier political struggles, Sumarlin had worked as a member of the Indonesian Red Cross, and as a recruit in the Indonesian army (''Tentara Nasional Indonsia'', or TNI) in East Java. For his service, in 1973 he received the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Indonesia#Stars of the Republic of Indonesia|''Mahaputra Utama'' star]], one of the highest honours awarded in Indonesia. Two years later he was awarded the Grand Cross in the [[Order of Leopold II]] of the Belgian government. In his private life, Sumarlin was a sports enthusiast and enjoyed tennis and jogging. He was married to Th. Yostiana Soedarmi. Together they had four children.<ref name=Bondan2012 />\n\nSumarlin had a slight build and this was associated with an incident that became well known among his colleagues in Jakarta. Around 1969, during the early stage of the work of the New Order government of president [[Suharto|Soeharto]], in his position as Deputy Minister of the Indonesian National Planning Agency, Bappenas, Sumarlin was often required to accompany the Chair of Bappenas, [[Widjojo Nitisastro|Professor Widjojo Nitisastro]], to Cabinet meetings. During one of the meetings at the [[Merdeka Palace|National Palace]], Cabinet Secretary [[Sudharmono]] is said to have casually gestured towards Sumarlin asking, \"Who is the boy sitting there, Widjojo?\" Widjojo then introduced Sumarlin to the Cabinet Secretary. Sudharmono responded that, indeed, he recalled that Widjojo had mentioned that that he was recruiting a team to work with him in the National Planning Agency.\n\nAfter the incident, Sumarlin was reluctant to continue attending Cabinet meetings, knowing that attendance was usually severely limited and the names of participants needed to be notified to Cabinet Secretary Sudharmono beforehand. But Widjojo encouraged Sumarlin to continue attending. Widjojo's approach proved correct because, in time, Sumarlin became one of Soeharto's most trusted economics advisers.\n\nWhile serving as Deputy Chair of Bappenas, Sumarlin was closely involved in drafting government reforms with guidance from Cabinet Secretary Sudharmono. He was regularly involved, for example, in the preparation of the key Annex document attached to the Presidential State Address released on August 16 each year for presentation to parliament. He was also actively in government administration as a member of various official teams charged with reviews of procedures governing such things as controls over the procurement of goods and equipment.\n\n==Experience in government==\nAlthough of modest stature and known for a disarming smile, Sumarlin became an effective minister during the period of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government in Indonesia. From 1970 through to 1998, he was influential in guiding economic and financial policy. Along with Widjojo and other ministers in the economic team, Sumarlin became a key economic policy adviser to president Soeharto.<ref name=Bondan2012 />\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973 Sumarlin was secretary to the Indonesian Monetary Board. Previously he had held the post of deputy minister for Fiscal and Monetary Affairs in the Indonesian National Planning Agency. During the next ten years (1973\u20131983), Sumarlin served as Minister of State for Administrative Control. Later, between 1983 and 1988, he was appointed to the position of State Minister for National Development Planning, concurrently holding the post of Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas). On the sidelines during that period he was appointed interim Minister of Finance, and also Minister of Education & Culture ad interim replacing Prof. Dr. [[Nugroho Notosusanto]] who died in 1985.\n\nSumarlin then became Minister of Finance in the [[Fifth Development Cabinet]] (March 21, 1988 \u2013 March 17, 1993). Subsequently, before the fall of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government in 1998, he was appointed to the senior post of Chairman of the [[Audit Board of Indonesia|Supreme Audit Agency]] (''Badan Permeriksaan Keuangan'', or BPK).\n\n==Career==\n{{cleanup list|date=May 2013}}\n\n===Education===\n*Elementary School I, Blitar (1944)\n*SMP, Kediri and Yogyakarta (1947)\n*High School, Yogyakarta and Jakarta (1952)\n*Faculty of Economics, University of Indonesia (1958)\n*University of California, Berkeley, USA (MA, 1960)\n*University of Pittsburgh, USA (doctorate, 1968)\n\n===Positions held===\n*Assistant lecturer at the Faculty of Economics, University of Indonesia (UI) (1957)\n*Lecturer and later Professor of Economics UI (1960\u2013present)\n*Secretary of the Monetary Board (1970\u20131973)\n*Deputy Head of Bappenas field of Fiscal and Monetary (1970\u20131973)\n*Members of the Assembly (1972\u20131988)\n*Vice Chairman of National Development Planning Agency (1973\u20131982)\n*Chairman Opstib, concurrently Minister of State for Administrative Control (1973\u20131983)\n*Minister of State for National Development Planning, concurrently Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency (1983\u20131988)\n*Education Minister ad interim (1985)\n*Finance Minister of Development Cabinet V (1988\u20131993)\n*Chairman of the CPC 1993\u20131998\n*Chairman (Independent) Asuransi Ramayana Tbk.

It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry. Globelink.co.uk mentioned Bordeaux as the best tourist destination in Europe in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globelink.co.uk/articles/country-information/france/3-best-places-to-retire-in-france.html|title=3 Best Places to Retire in France|publisher=Globelink.co.uk|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccess to the [[Port de la Lune|port]] from the Atlantic is via the [[Gironde estuary]]. Almost nine million tonnes of goods arrive and leave each year.\n\n=== Major companies ===\n\nThis list includes indigenous Bordeaux-based companies and companies that have major presence in Bordeaux, but are not necessarily headquartered there.\n[[File:Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac.jpg|250px|thumb|Dassault Falcon 7X assembly line at Merignac]]\n*[[Arena (swimwear)|Arena]]\n*[[Groupe Bernard]]\n*[[Groupe Castel]]\n*[[Cdiscount]]\n*[[Dassault Group|Dassault]]\n*[[Jock (company)|Jock]]\n*[[Marie Brizard et Roger International|Marie Brizard]]\n*[[McKesson Corporation]]\n*[[Oxbow (surfwear)|Oxbow]]\n*[[Pernod Ricard|Ricard]]\n*[[Sanofi-Aventis|Sanofi Aventis]]\n*[[Smurfit Kappa]]\n*[[Snecma|SNECMA]]\n*[[Solectron]]\n*[[Thales Group]]\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nAt the January 2011 census, there were 239,399 inhabitants in the city proper (commune) of Bordeaux.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Anthony Frederick Sandys - Queen Eleanor.JPG|[[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

{{IPA-oc|bu\u027e\u02c8\u00f0\u025bw|}}) is a port city on the [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]] in Southwestern [[France]].\n\nThe municipality ([[Communes of France|commune]]) of Bordeaux proper has a population of 257,804 (2019). Bordeaux is the centre of the [[Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] that has a population of 783,081 (2017) and includes its [[suburb]]s and close [[satellite town]]s. With 1,195,335 in the metropolitan area, it is the sixth-largest in France, after Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, and Lille. It is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called ''\"Bordelais\"'' (for men) or ''\"Bordelaises\"'' (women). The term \"Bordelais\" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.\n\nBeing at the center of a major wine-growing and wine-producing region, Bordeaux remains a prominent powerhouse and exercises significant influence on the world wine industry although no wine production is conducted within the city limits. It is home to the world's main wine fair, [[Vinexpo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique |title=Archived copy |accessdate=20 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706075152/http://www.vinexpo.com/en/a-propos/historique/ |archivedate=6 July 2009}}</ref> and the wine economy in the metro area takes in 14.5&nbsp;billion euros each year.

The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |author=Sivan, H., R.

During this period were built the amphitheatre and the momument ''Les Piliers de Tutelle''.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Bordeaux - Pilliers de Tutelle.jpg|''Les Piliers de Tutelle''\nFile:Bordeaux - Palais Gallien 2.jpg|The Roman amphitheatre\n</gallery>\n\nIn 276 it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.\n\n[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|140px|thumb|left|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-\u00c9tienne, late 6th century. [[British Museum]].]]\nIn the late 6th century the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made count of [[County of Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] and fought the Basques.\n\nIn 732 the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the Aquitanian garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river Dordogne. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.\n\nIn 735 following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux.  However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).\n\nDuring the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760\u2013768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]].  Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).\n\nIn 778 [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]<sup>[9]-</sup>. In 814 Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845 the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.\n\nAlthough the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was constantly threatened by Germanic and [[Vikings|Norman]] invasions. It wasn't until the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] and [[Henry Plantagenet]] in 1152 established some sort of protection, as it provided a connection with the English<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux</ref> After this union, Bordeaux suddenly had access to naval protection, which made the attacks from the nomadic groups few and far between.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\">https://www.bordeaux-port.fr/en/port-bordeaux/history</ref>\n\n=== 12th century to the 15th century, the English era ===\n\n[[File:Arms of the city of Bordeaux (In the time of Richard C\u0153ur de Lion).svg|120px|thumb|First Arms of the city, in the time of [[Richard I of England]]]]\n\nFrom the 12th to the 15th century Bordeaux regained importance following the marriage of Duchess [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|El\u00e9onore]] of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] to the French-speaking Count Henri Plantagenet, born in [[Le Mans]], who within months of their wedding became King [[Henry II of England]]. The city flourished, primarily due to the wine trade, and the [[Bordeaux Cathedral|cathedral of St. Andr\u00e9]] and the belfry (Grosse Cloche) were built. After granting a tax-free trade status with England, King Henry II was adored by the locals as they could be even more profitable in the wine trade, their main source of income. The city cathedral St. Cath\u00e9drale St-Andr\u00e9 was built in 1227, incorporating the artisan quarter of Saint-Paul.<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/france/bordeaux/background/history/a/nar/5e51aa7a-15f6-47ad-8ad8-719613858dc0/359293</ref> It was also the capital of an independent state under [[Edward, the Black Prince]] (1362\u20131372), but after the [[Battle of Castillon]] (1453) it was annexed by France, and so extended its territory.\n\n=== 15th century to the 17th century  ===\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bordeaux, France.svg|120px|thumb|Coat of arms after the French Reconquest]]\n\nIn 1462 Bordeaux created a local parliament. However, it only begun to regain its importance during the 17th century when it became a major trading centre for sugar and slaves from the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], along with its traditional wine exports.<ref>''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'', \"Bordeaux struggles with slave past\", 28 September 2009.</ref>\n\nBordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.\n\n=== 18th century to the 19th century, the golden era ===\n\nThe 18th century saw another golden age of Bordeaux<ref>https://www.commanderie.org/showRegion.action</ref>. The [[Port of the Moon]] supplied the majority of Europe with coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton and indigo, becoming France's busiest port and the second busiest port in the world after London.<ref name=\"bordeaux-port.fr\"/> Many downtown buildings (about 5,000), including those on the quays, are from this period. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: \"Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux\". [[Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann]], a long-time prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform a then still quasi-medieval [[Paris]] into a \"modern\" capital that would make France proud.\n\nTowards the end of the [[Peninsula war]] on 12 March 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], so the British troops were treated as liberators.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Deuxieme vue du port de Bordeaux prise du ch\u00e2teau Trompette.jpg|thumb|right|[[Port of the Moon]] in 1759\nFile:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavali\u00e8re de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux m\u00e9tropole.jpg|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899\n</gallery>\n\n\nIn 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux  |title=Bordeaux |accessed date= March 30, 2020 12:03 am</ref>. This recurred during the [[World War I]] and again very briefly during the [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-074-2852-36A, Bordeaux, Platzkonzert der Wehrmacht.jpg|200px|thumb|The square of the Comedy during Occupation]]\n\nDuring the [[Word War II]], Bordeaux fell under [[German Occupation]].\n\nIn May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German Occupation.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (''[[Regia Marina]] Italiana'') established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from this base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boat]]s as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.\n\n== Geography ==\n\nBordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.\n\n== Climate ==\n\nBordeaux's climate is classified as a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), or in the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system as temperate oceanic or Do climate. Bordeaux lies close to the humid subtropical climate zone, its summers not quite warm enough for that classification.\n\nWinters are cool because of the prevalence of westerly winds from the Atlantic. Summers are warm and long due to the influence from the Bay of Biscay (surface temperature reaches {{convert|21|to|22|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0|abbr=on}}). The average seasonal winter temperature is {{convert|7.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, but recent winters have been warmer than this. Frosts in the winter occur several times during a winter, but snowfall is very rare, occurring only once every three years. The average summer seasonal temperature is {{convert|20.7|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971\u20132000</ref>\n\n{{Bordeaux weatherbox}}\n\n== Economy ==\n\nBordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.\n\n{{As of|2014}}, the GDP of Bordeaux is \u20ac32.7 Billion.\n\n=== Wine ===\n\n{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}\n\n[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]]]]\n\nThe wine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |edition=4th|year=1994 |place=London |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |page=13}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1 Saint-\u00c9milion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-\u00c9milion]] aerial view]]\n\nBordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (ch\u00e2teaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960 million bottles,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html|title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region|publisher=IntoWine.com|accessdate=23 October 2009}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth|first growth]]) red wines (four from [[M\u00e9doc]] and one, [[Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:\n\nBoth red and [[Wine|white wines]] are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re]].\n\nWhite Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[S\u00e9millon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem]].\n\nBecause of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.\n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 du Vin]], a [[museum]] as well as a place of exhibitions, shows, movie projections and [[Academia|academic]] [[seminar]]s on the theme of [[wine]] opened its doors in June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|language=fr|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2016/02/19/la-cite-du-vin-cernee-par-les-chantiers-2278033-2780.php|title=Bordeaux : la Cit\u00e9 du vin cern\u00e9e par les chantiers|date=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Others ===\n\nThe [[Laser M\u00e9gajoule]] will be one of the most powerful lasers in the world, allowing [[Research|fundamental research]] and the development of the [[laser]] and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] technologies. This project, carried by the [[Minister of Defence (France)|French Ministry of Defence]], involves an investment of 2&nbsp;billion euros. The \"Road of the lasers\", a major project of [[regional planning]], promotes regional investment in optical and laser related industries leading to the Bordeaux area having the most important concentration of optical and laser expertise in Europe.\n\nSome 20,000 people work for the aeronautic industry in Bordeaux. The city has some of the biggest companies including [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault]], [[EADS Sogerma]], [[Snecma]], [[Thales Group|Thales]], SNPE, and others. The [[Dassault Aviation|Dassault Falcon]] private jets are built there as well as the [[military aircraft]] [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000]], the [[Airbus A380]] [[cockpit]], the [[Booster (rocketry)|boosters]] of [[Ariane 5]], and the [[M51 (missile)|M51 SLBM]] [[missile]].\n\nTourism, especially [[wine tourism]], is a major industry.

Then came [[Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal with 25.87%, followed by Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.\n\n=== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ===\nIn the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. It should be added that after the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Beatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragu\u00e9]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]] confronted the General Counsel PS Mich\u00e8le Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Jupp\u00e9 was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Mich\u00e8le Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Jupp\u00e9, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency \"Mayor\" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.\n\n=== Municipal elections of 2008 ===\nIn 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Jupp\u00e9 and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal and [[Mich\u00e8le Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Jupp\u00e9 who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62%, far ahead of Alain Rousset who has managed to get 34.14%. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.\n\n=== European elections of 2009 ===\nIn the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district \"Southwest\", here are the results:\n\nUMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front G\u00e9rard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.\n\n<small>''Only candidates obtaining more than 5% are listed''</small>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ 2007 Presidential Election<ref>[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Elections/Les-resultats/Presidentielles/elecresult__presidentielle_2007/%28path%29/presidentielle_2007/072/033/33063.html R\u00e9sultat de l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2007 \u00e0 Bordeaux] sur le site du minist\u00e8re de l'int\u00e9rieur.</ref>\n!rowspan=2|Candidate !!colspan=2|Ist round !!colspan=2|IInd round\n|-\n!Bordeaux !!

The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}} and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The \u20ac160 million bridge was inaugurated by President [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Jupp\u00e9 on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.\n\n=== Shopping ===\n\n[[File:Rue Sainte-Catherine (Bordeaux) 2005.JPG|140px|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]\n\nBordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and caf\u00e9s; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' by the ''Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Com\u00e9die'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.\n\n=== Culture ===\n\nBordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en r\u00eave]]''.{{citation needed |date=January 2018}} Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux|Op\u00e9ra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year.\n\n<gallery widths=\"140\" heights=\"140\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:GrandTheatreBordeaux2.jpg|''[[Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux]]''\nFile:Bordeaux - Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina.jpg|''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Femina''\nFile:RB 20200222 Bordeaux-11.jpg|''MECA, Maison de l\u2019\u00c9conomie Cr\u00e9ative et de la Culture en Aquitaine''\n</gallery>\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Road ===\n\nBordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the \"Rocade\" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.\n\n[[File:Pont d&#039;Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]\n\nBordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspended bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009\u20132012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height comparable to the Pont de pierre in closed position, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine in open position. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well.\nAnother bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc \u2013 La CUB |date=24 October 2013 |work=archive.org |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\nLacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations has been established in 2010.\n\n=== Rail ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nThe main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[P\u00e9rigueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le M\u00e9doc, Angoul\u00eame and [[Bayonne]].\n\nHistorically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.\n\nThe two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.\n\nSince July 2017, the [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] is fully operational and makes Bordeaux city 2h04 from Paris.\n\n[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]]]]\n\n=== Air ===\n\nBordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux\u2013M\u00e9rignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[M\u00e9rignac, Gironde|M\u00e9rignac]].\n\n=== Trams, buses and boats ===\n\n[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]\nBordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux M\u00e9tropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:\n* 4 [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])\n* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)\n* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)\n* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre\n* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river\nThis network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.\n\nThere had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses ground-level power supply technology [[Ground-level power supply|(APS)]], a new cable-free technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.\n\nThe planned Bordeaux tramway system is to link with the airport to the city centre towards the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/transports/bordeaux-voici-le-trace-du-tramway-qui-va-desservir-l-aeroport-1461940859|title=Bordeaux : voici le trac\u00e9 du tramway qui va desservir l'a\u00e9roport|date=29 April 2016|website=France Bleu}}</ref>\n\n=== Taxis ===\n\nThere are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.\n\n=== Public transportation statistics ===\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Bordeaux, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 51 min. 12.% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nThere are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team, playing in [[Ligue 1]] in the [[Football in France|French football]] championship. [[Union Bordeaux B\u00e8gles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]].\nSkateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a beautiful quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.\n\nBordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.\n\nThere is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], V\u00e9lodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.\n\nThe 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris bombing(s) and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in 10th place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in 2nd.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pike |first1=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Ausonius.jpg|[[Ausonius]]\nFile:Anthony Frederick Sandys - Queen Eleanor.JPG|[[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]\nFile:Richard II King of England.jpg|[[Richard II of England]]\nFile:Michel-eyquem-de-montaigne 1.jpg|[[Michel de Montaigne]]\nFile:Sta.

[[Biomarker|Biomarkers]] and geologic evidence suggests that [[Anoxic event|oxygen-deprived oceans]] resulting from high carbon dioxide concentrations may have contributed to the [[Extinction event|five previous mass extinction events]] in Earth's history. Geoscientists have found that anaerobic microbes would have thrived in these conditions and produced vast amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic, and its lethality increases with temperature. At a critical threshold, this toxic gas would have been released into the atmosphere, causing plant and animal extinctions both in the ocean and on land. Models suggest that this would also have damaged the [[ozone layer]], exposing life on Earth to harmful levels of [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]]. Deformities found in fossil spores in Greenland provides evidence that this may have occurred during the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction event]]. At the end of the [[Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum|Paleocene]] and [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event|Triassic]] eras, mass extinctions occurred at carbon dioxide concentrations of around 1,000 ppm. If these concentrations were reached again in the future, either as a result of anthropogenic or naturally occurring greenhouse gas emissions, it is possible that such an event could be repeated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Peter D.|date=December 2006|title=Impact From the Deep|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/scientificamerican1006-64|journal=Scientific American|volume=295|issue=4|pages=64\u201371|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1006-64|issn=0036-8733|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kump|first=Lee R.|last2=Pavlov|first2=Alexander|last3=Arthur|first3=Michael A.|date=2005-05-01|title=Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geology/article-abstract/33/5/397/29629/Massive-release-of-hydrogen-sulfide-to-the-surface|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=397\u2013400|doi=10.1130/G21295.1|issn=0091-7613}}</ref>\n\n=== Disease ===\nRising temperatures increase the risk of an [[epidemic]] or [[pandemic]]. As the climate changes, distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to new areas and transmit illnesses to regions which may not have experienced them otherwise. Epidemics are also made more likely after severe weather events, such as heavy rainfall or flooding. Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as [[Ebola virus disease|ebola]]. Melting permafrost also threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for many years, as was the case in August 2016 when a thawed reindeer carcass that was almost a century old infected several individuals in [[Siberia]] with [[anthrax]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.contagionlive.com/news/the-ripple-effect-of-climate-change-on-epidemic-risk|title=The Ripple Effect of Climate Change on Epidemic Risk|website=ContagionLive|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Food scarcity ===\nMany plants have a maximum temperature at which they can grow, and climate change may mean that new pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before.

One example of this is the [[Younger Dryas]], in which a rapid decline in temperature, recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10\u00b0C (7.2 to 18\u00b0F) over just a few decades, is thought to have been caused by the melting of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Stieglitz|first=Jean|date=2017-01-03|title=The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Abrupt Climate Change|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83\u2013104|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|issn=1941-1405}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that recent climate change has caused a 15-20% slowing of the [[Gulf Stream]], a current which transports warm water from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] towards north-west Europe, due to a melting of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/gulf-stream-is-slowing-down-faster-than-ever-scientists-say-10128700.html|title=Gulf Stream is slowing down faster than ever, scientists say|date=|work=Independent|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Although it is likely to continue to slow, it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream could come to a complete halt this century, if ever.

A 200-year drought caused cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] to be abandoned; the [[Khmer Empire]] collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the [[Little Ice Age]] made it more difficult for [[Vikings]] to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMore recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in [[Syria]], leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence.

In other areas rainfall is reduced, and overall the world experiences more extreme floods and droughts as a result of climate change.

It described this as the \"[[Hothouse Earth]]\" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, arguing that decisions taken over the next decade could influence the climate of the planet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies. The report also states that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if the goal outlined in the [[Paris Agreement]] to limit warming to 1.5-2.0\u00b0C (2.7-3.6\u00b0F) is achieved.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Point of collapse ===\nEven in mid-range scenarios of around 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events, large-scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources, and collapsing ecosystems could lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion people who currently live in major coastal cities would need to be relocated due to sea-level rise.

Sea levels increase by 2-3 metres by 2100, with an eventual 25 metres of sea-level rise locked in. Some regions become unlivable due to the intense heat and lack of adaptive capacity and around a billion people are displaced, while two billion people suffer from water shortages.

[[Biomarker|Biomarkers]] and geologic evidence suggests that [[Anoxic event|oxygen-deprived oceans]] resulting from high carbon dioxide concentrations may have contributed to the [[Extinction event|five previous mass extinction events]] in Earth's history. Geoscientists have found that anaerobic microbes would have thrived in these conditions and produced vast amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic, and its lethality increases with temperature. At a critical threshold, this toxic gas would have been released into the atmosphere, causing plant and animal extinctions both in the ocean and on land. Models suggest that this would also have damaged the [[ozone layer]], exposing life on Earth to harmful levels of [[Ultraviolet|UV radiation]]. Deformities found in fossil spores in Greenland provides evidence that this may have occurred during the [[Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event|Permian extinction event]]. At the end of the [[Paleocene\u2013Eocene Thermal Maximum|Paleocene]] and [[Triassic\u2013Jurassic extinction event|Triassic]] eras, mass extinctions occurred at carbon dioxide concentrations of around 1,000 ppm. If these concentrations were reached again in the future, either as a result of anthropogenic or naturally occurring greenhouse gas emissions, it is possible that such an event could be repeated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Peter D.|date=December 2006|title=Impact From the Deep|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/scientificamerican1006-64|journal=Scientific American|volume=295|issue=4|pages=64\u201371|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1006-64|issn=0036-8733|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kump|first=Lee R.|last2=Pavlov|first2=Alexander|last3=Arthur|first3=Michael A.|date=2005-05-01|title=Massive release of hydrogen sulfide to the surface ocean and atmosphere during intervals of oceanic anoxia|url=https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/geology/article-abstract/33/5/397/29629/Massive-release-of-hydrogen-sulfide-to-the-surface|journal=Geology|language=en|volume=33|issue=5|pages=397\u2013400|doi=10.1130/G21295.1|issn=0091-7613}}</ref>\n\n=== Disease ===\nRising temperatures increase the risk of an [[epidemic]] or [[pandemic]].

Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as [[Ebola virus disease|ebola]].

There have been several explanations put forward for these changes, but the prevailing paradigm is that these changes were a result of changes in ocean currents, specifically the northward transport of heat by the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] (AMOC). One example of this is the [[Younger Dryas]], in which a rapid decline in temperature, recorded in Greenland as a drop of 4 to 10\u00b0C (7.2 to 18\u00b0F) over just a few decades, is thought to have been caused by the melting of the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] providing extra freshwater to the North Atlantic and interrupting the AMOC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Stieglitz|first=Jean|date=2017-01-03|title=The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and Abrupt Climate Change|url=https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=9|issue=1|pages=83\u2013104|doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-010816-060415|issn=1941-1405}}</ref>\n\nIt is believed that recent climate change has caused a 15-20% slowing of the [[Gulf Stream]], a current which transports warm water from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] towards north-west Europe, due to a melting of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]] resulting in large amounts of freshwater pouring into the North Atlantic.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/gulf-stream-is-slowing-down-faster-than-ever-scientists-say-10128700.html|title=Gulf Stream is slowing down faster than ever, scientists say|date=|work=Independent|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Although it is likely to continue to slow, it is unproven whether the Gulf Stream could come to a complete halt this century, if ever.

A 200-year drought caused cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] to be abandoned; the [[Khmer Empire]] collapsed as a result of successive droughts and monsoon floods which led to political and social unrest; and a period of cooling called the [[Little Ice Age]] made it more difficult for [[Vikings]] to farm in Greenland, which was one of the reasons that they were forced to abandon their settlements.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMore recently, a severe drought in the late 2000s which is likely to have been intensified by anthropogenic climate change contributed to failing agricultural production in [[Syria]], leading to high unemployment, large amounts of internal displacement, heightened ethnic tensions and increased violence.

In other areas rainfall is reduced, and overall the world experiences more extreme floods and droughts as a result of climate change. Warmer air also results in higher rainfall and less snowfall and an increase in evaporation rates. Different regions will be affected to different degrees, but the IPCC predicts that around one billion people in dry areas of the world may face increasing water scarcity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/30/climate-change-water|title=How will climate change impact on water security?|last=Institute|first=Grantham|date=2012-12-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|last2=London|first2=Imperial College|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/working-group/wg2/|title=Working Group II \u2014 IPCC|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n== Research shortcomings ==\nLarge-scale changes to the Earth system such as tipping points and possible [[abrupt climate change]] are usually not included in climate models and impact assessments.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenfacts.org/en/impacts-global-warming/l-2/index.htm#0|title=Impacts of a 4\u00b0C global warming: 1.

This was labelled the [[Global dimming|global dimming effect]] and has since been proven to have a strong relationship to atmospheric pollution, the particles of which directly absorb energy from the sun before reflecting it back into space. This has many impacts including the cooling of the Earth and oceans leading to lower rainfall and more droughts. These pollutants also lead to the formation of [[smog]] and [[acid rain]] and cause various [[Respiratory disease|respiratory diseases]]. Global dimming may also cause [[Heat wave|heat waves]] and [[Wildfire|runaway fires]], while the decrease of sunlight negatively impacts plant growth, endangering animal populations.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenandgrowing.org/global-dimming-definition-possible-causes-effects/|title=Global Dimming: A Definition, Possible Causes, and Effects|last=Eubanks|first=William E.|date=22 February 2018|website=Green and Growing|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=15 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAs carbon emissions are reduced and the amount of pollution in the atmosphere disappears, the most widely credited studies indicate that there will be an increase of about 0.5\u00b0C in global average temperature, however some studies have indicated that up to 1.1\u00b0C is possible.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Samset|first=B.

It described this as the \"[[Hothouse Earth]]\" scenario and proposed a threshold of around 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, arguing that decisions taken over the next decade could influence the climate of the planet for tens to hundreds of thousands of years and potentially even lead to conditions which are inhospitable to current human societies. The report also states that there is a possibility of a cascade of tipping points being triggered even if the goal outlined in the [[Paris Agreement]] to limit warming to 1.5-2.0\u00b0C (2.7-3.6\u00b0F) is achieved.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Point of collapse ===\nEven in mid-range scenarios of around 3\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, extreme weather events, large-scale loss of agricultural land and freshwater sources, and collapsing ecosystems could lead to widespread suffering and instability and over a billion people who currently live in major coastal cities would need to be relocated due to sea-level rise. One report published by the [[Global Challenges Foundation]] wrote that the potential destruction of high-end scenarios are beyond their capacity to model, but that there is a high likelihood of human civilization coming to an end. The report states that we are currently in a position where we can reduce the risk of civilization collapse due to climate change, and possibly avoid it.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nAlthough runaway climate change may be triggered at 2\u00b0C or even lower, societal collapse in different regions may not happen until later, although there is no consensus as to when this may happen.
