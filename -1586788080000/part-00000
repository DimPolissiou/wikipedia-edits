During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China. Both Manchester United and Barcelona achieved less in their subsequent tour matches in the country in the same year.<ref name=\"Stockport County scores in China's business league\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1462568/Stockport-County-scores-in-Chinas-business-league.html| title=Stockport County scores in China's business league| work=Telegraph|date=22 May 2004 |last=Spencer|first=Richard|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> Stockport were watched by 22,000 in Yingkou against their then sister side Stockport Tiger Star whom they beat 4\u20130.

This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

Flow cytometric analysis on the cell cycle of the 9L rat glioma showed that cAMP can arrest the cells in the G1 phase and induces 9L cells into resting position (G0 cells). On the other hand SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine)-induced p53-sensitive cell death and DNA fragmentation were enhanced and Bcl-2 was decreased by pretreatment with bucladesine (dBc-AMP). Bucladesine induces a decreased Bcl-2 level and enhances MPP+-induced cell death thus dBc-AMP sensitized the cells to induction of apoptosis. Both mechanisms are indicating the role of bucladesine in the p53-apoptosis phenomena. Inhibitory impact of bucladesine on the migration pattern of astrocytes grafted into adult rat brain is shown.

Originally called \"West Urbana\", it was renamed Champaign when it acquired a city charter in 1860. Both the city and county name were derived from [[Champaign County, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ci.champaign.il.us/about-champaign/history/|title=City of Champaign official website \u2013 History |publisher=Ci.champaign.il.us|date=2013-01-24|accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = <!-- Digits only; no \"px\" suffix, please -->\n\n| image1    = ChampaignCountyHistoricalMuseum 20080301 4255.jpg\n| width1    = 195\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n| image2    = ChampaignCountyHistoricalMuseum 20080301 4261.jpg\n| width2    = 150\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n| footer            = The [[Cattle Bank]] building, constructed in 1858, is the oldest surviving building in Champaign.\n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_align      = center\n}}\nDuring February 1969, [[Carl Perkins]] joined with [[Bob Dylan]] to write the song \"Champaign, Illinois\", which Perkins released on his album ''On Top''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/CarlPerkins.html |title=RAB Hall of Fame: Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |date=|accessdate=2013-04-08}}</ref> The band [[Old 97's]] took another Bob Dylan song, \"[[Desolation Row]]\", and combined its melody with new lyrics to make a new song \"Champaign, Illinois\", which they released with Dylan's blessing on their 2010 album ''The Grand Theatre Volume One''. It achieved considerable popularity. The two \"Champaign, Illinois\" songs are not similar to each other, except that Bob Dylan was involved in both of them.\n\nOn September 22, 1985, Champaign hosted the first [[Farm Aid]] concert at the University of Illinois' [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]].

As part of a revitalization effort, One Main Development constructed two new mixed-use buildings: One Main and M2 on Neil.

The growth in the north Prospect area relied, in part, on leapfrogging, moving out to the countryside and developing more remote farm land that eventually connects to the main development. Given the overwhelming success of such suburban shopping areas nationally, new development within any city center represented an alternative to the dominant movement out and away from the cities.\n\n[[File:Downtown Champaign Alley.JPG|thumb|North view of one of several alleyways in Downtown Champaign]]\nIn April 2007, One Main Development broke ground on M2 on Neil, a nine-story, $40 million, mixed-use project \u2013 the largest ever for downtown Champaign \u2013 located at the corner of Neil and Church Street.
