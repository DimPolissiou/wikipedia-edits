Loki is in some sources the son of [[F\u00e1rbauti]] and [[Laufey]], and the brother of [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. By the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], Loki is the father of [[Hel (being)|Hel]], the wolf [[Fenrir]], and the world serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]]. By his wife [[Sigyn]], Loki is the father of [[Narfi and Nari|Narfi and/or Nari]]. By the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], Loki is the mother\u2014giving birth in the form of a [[mare]]\u2014to the eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]]. In addition, Loki is referred to as the father of [[V\u00e1li]] in ''[[Prose Edda]]'', though this source also refers to [[Odin]] as the father of V\u00e1li twice, and V\u00e1li is found mentioned as a Son of Loki only once.\n\nLoki's relation with the gods varies by source; Loki sometimes assists the gods and sometimes behaves in a malicious manner towards them. Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W. G. Collingwood]]]]\n[[Image:Ah, what a lovely maid it is! by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''Ah, what a lovely maid it is!'' (1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''.

In the poem, Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r describes to the hero [[Svipdagr]] that [[Sinmara]] keeps the weapon [[L\u00e6vateinn]] within a chest, locked with [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|nine strong locks]] (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:''Fjolsvith spake:''\n:\"L\u00e6vatein is there, that Lopt with runes\n:Once made by the doors of death;\n:In L\u00e6gjarn's chest by Sinmora lies it,\n:And nine locks fasten it firm.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1936|p=245}}\n|\n:''Fiolsvith.''\n:H\u00e6vatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it,\n:down by the gate of Death.\n:In an iron chest it lies with Sinm\u0153ra,\n:and is with nine strong locks secured.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|pp=96\u201397}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n\n====''Gylfaginning''====\nThe ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'' tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse [[Sleipnir]] and Loki's contest with [[Logi]], fire personified.\n\n'''High's introduction'''\n\nLoki first appears in the ''Prose Edda'' in chapter 20 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where he is referred to as the \"[[\u00c6sir|\u00e1s]] called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] explains to \"Gangleri\" (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of ''Lokasenna''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=21}}\n[[Image:The children of Loki by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|right|\"The children of Loki\" (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]]]]\nLoki is more formally introduced by [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the \u00c6sir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the \u00c6sir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it.

They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard. This figure is sometimes theorized as depicting the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=105}} Discovered in 1870, the stone consists of yellowish-white [[sandstone]], and now sits at the front of the Kirkby Stephen church. A depiction of a similarly horned and round-shouldered figure was discovered in [[Gainford, County Durham]] and is now housed in the [[Durham Cathedral|Durham Cathedral Library]].{{sfnp|Calverley|1899|p=218}}\n\nThe mid-11th century [[Gosforth Cross]] has been interpreted as featuring various figures from Norse mythology and, like the Kirkby Stephen Stone, is also located in Cumbria. The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent. This has been interpreted as Sigyn soothing the bound Loki.{{sfnp|Orchard|1997|p=13}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Kirkby Stephen Stone by Petersen.jpg|The bound figure on the Kirkby Stephen Stone\nFile:Gosforth Cross Loki and Sigyn.jpg|Detail from the [[Gosforth Cross]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Scandinavian folklore==\nThe notion of Loki survived into the modern period in the folklore of Scandinavia. In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}loki is daddy)\\0\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.

Loki is a [[Shapeshifting|shape shifter]] and in separate incidents he appears in the form of a [[salmon]], a [[mare]], a [[Fly (animal)|fly]], and possibly an elderly woman named [[\u00de\u00f6kk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'). Loki's positive relations with the gods end with his role in engineering the death of the god [[Baldr]] and Loki is eventually bound by V\u00e1li with the entrails of one of his sons. In both the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'' and the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', the goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] is responsible for placing a serpent above him while he is bound. The serpent drips venom from above him that Sigyn collects into a bowl; however, she must empty the bowl when it is full, and the venom that drips in the meantime causes Loki to writhe in pain, thereby causing earthquakes. With the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]], Loki is foretold to slip free from his bonds and to fight against the gods among the forces of the [[J\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], at which time he will encounter the god [[Heimdallr]] and the two will slay each other.\n\nLoki is referred to in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the ''Prose Edda'' and ''[[Heimskringla]]'', written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]; the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian Rune Poems]], in the poetry of [[skald]]s, and in Scandinavian folklore. Loki may be depicted on the [[Snaptun Stone]], the [[Loki#Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross|Kirkby Stephen Stone]], and the [[Gosforth Cross]]. Loki's origins and role in Norse mythology, which some scholars have described as that of a [[trickster god]], have been much debated by scholars. Loki has been depicted in or is referenced in a variety of media in modern popular culture.\n\n==Etymology, and alternative names==\nThe [[etymology]] of the name ''Loki'' has been extensively debated. The name has at times been associated with the Old Norse word ''logi'' ('flame'), but there seems not to be a sound linguistic basis for this. Rather, the later Scandinavian variants of the name (such as Faroese ''Lokki'', Danish ''Lokkemand'', Norwegian ''Loke'' and ''Lokke'', Swedish ''Luki'' and ''Luku'', along with Finnish ''Lukki'') point to an origin in the Germanic root *''luk''-, which denoted things to do with loops (like knots, hooks, closed-off rooms, and locks). This corresponds with usages such as the Swedish ''lokkan\u00e4t'' and Faroese ''Lokkanet'' ('cobweb', literally 'Lokke's web') and Faroese ''lokki''~''grindalokki''~''grindalokkur'' ('[[Crane fly|daddy-long-legs]]', associated in pre-modern folk-taxonomy with spiders). Some Eastern Swedish traditions referring to the same figure use forms in ''n''- like ''Nokk(e)'', but this corresponds to the *''luk''- etymology insofar as those dialects consistently used a different root, Germanic *''hnuk''-, in contexts where western varieties used *''luk''-: \"''nokke'' corresponds to ''n\u00f8kkel''\" ('key' in Eastern Scandinavian) \"as ''loki''~''lokke'' to ''lykil''\" ('key' in Western Scandinavian).<ref>Eldar Heide, \"[http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf Loki, the ''V\u00e4tte'', and the Ash Lad: A Study Combining Old Scandinavian and Late Material] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222308/http://eldar-heide.net/Publikasjonar%20til%20heimesida/Loke-artikkel%20til%20nettsida.pdf |date=2013-12-02 }}\", ''Viking and Medieval Scandinavia'', 7 (2011), 63\u2013106 (pp. 65\u201375, quoting p. 75), {{DOI|10.1484/J.VMS.1.102616}}.</ref> While it has been suggested that this association with closing could point to Loki's apocalyptic role at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]],{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=195}} \"there is quite a bit of evidence that Loki in premodern society was thought to be the causer of knots/tangles/loops, or himself a knot/tangle/loop.

The poem begins with a prose introduction detailing that [[\u00c6gir]], a figure associated with the sea, is hosting a feast in his hall for a number of the gods and [[elf|elves]]. There, the gods praise \u00c6gir's servers [[Fimafeng]] and [[Eldir]]. Loki \"could not bear to hear that,\" and kills the servant Fimafeng. In response, the gods grab their shields, shrieking at Loki, and chase him out of the hall and to the woods. The gods then return to the hall, and continue drinking.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n;Entrance and rejection\nLoki comes out of the woods, and meets Eldir outside of the hall. Loki greets Eldir (and the poem itself begins) with a demand that Eldir tell him what the gods are discussing over their ale inside the hall. Eldir responds that they discuss their \"weapons and their prowess in war\" and yet no one there has anything friendly to say about Loki. Loki says that he will go into the feast, and that, before the end of the feast, he will induce quarrelling among the gods, and \"mix their [[mead]] with malice.\" Eldir responds that \"if shouting and fighting you pour out on\" to the gods, \"they'll wipe it off on you.\" Loki then enters the hall, and everyone there falls silent upon noticing him.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=85}}\n\n;Re-entrance and insults\nBreaking the silence, Loki says that, thirsty, he had come to these halls from a long way away to ask the gods for a drink of \"the famous mead.\" Calling the gods arrogant, Loki asks why they are unable to speak, and demands that they assign him a seat and a place for him at the feast, or tell him to leave. The [[skald]]ic god [[Bragi]] is the first to respond to Loki by telling him that Loki will not have a seat and place assigned to him by the gods at the feast, for the gods know what men they should invite.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}} Loki does not respond to Bragi directly, but instead directs his attention to Odin, and states:\n<blockquote>\n:Do you remember, Odin, when in bygone days\n:we mixed our blood together?\n:You said you would never drink ale\n:unless it were brought to both of us.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=86}}\n</blockquote>\nOdin then asks his silent son [[V\u00ed\u00f0arr]] to sit up, so that Loki (here referred to as the \"wolf's father\") may sit at the feast, and so that he may not speak words of blame to the gods in \u00c6gir's hall. V\u00ed\u00f0arr stands and pours a drink for Loki. Prior to drinking, Loki declaims a toast to the gods, with a specific exception for Bragi. Bragi responds that he will give a horse, sword, and ring from his possessions so that he does not repay the gods \"with hatred.\" Loki responds that Bragi will always be short of all of these things, accusing him of being \"wary of war\" and \"shy of shooting.\" Bragi responds that, were they outside of \u00c6gir's hall, Bragi would be holding Loki's head as a reward for his lies. Loki replies that Bragi is brave when seated, calling him a \"bench-ornament,\" and that Bragi would run away when troubled by an angry, spirited man.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=87}}\n\nThe goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] interrupts, asking Bragi, as a service to his relatives and adopted relatives, not to say words of blame to Loki in \u00c6gir's hall. Loki tells I\u00f0unn to be silent, calling her the most \"man-crazed\" of all women, and saying that she placed her washed, bright arms around her brother's slayer. I\u00f0unn says that she won't say words of blame in \u00c6gir's hall, and affirms that she quietened Bragi, who was made talkative by beer, and that she doesn't want the two of them to fight. The goddess [[Gefjun]] asks why the two gods must fight, saying that Loki knows that he is joking, and that \"all living things love him.\" Loki responds to Gefjun by stating that Gefjun's heart was once seduced by a \"white boy\" who gave her a jewel, and who Gefjun laid her thigh over.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=87\u201388}}\n\nOdin says that Loki must be insane to make Gefjun his enemy, as her wisdom about the fates of men may equal Odin's own. Loki says that Odin does a poor job in handing out honor in war to men, and that he's often given victory to the faint-hearted. Odin responds that even if this is true, Loki (in a story otherwise unattested) once spent eight winters beneath the earth as a woman milking cows, and during this time bore children. Odin declares this perverse. Loki counters that Odin once practiced [[sei\u00f0r]] (a type of sorcery) on the island of ''Samsey'' (now [[Sams\u00f8]], Denmark), and, appearing as a wizard, traveled among mankind, which Loki condemns as perverse.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=88\u201389}}\n\n[[Frigg]], a major goddess and Odin's wife, says that what Loki and Odin did in the ancient past should not be spoken of in front of others, and that ancient matters should always remain hidden. Loki brings up that Frigg is the daughter of [[Fj\u00f6rgyn and Fj\u00f6rgynn|Fj\u00f6rgyn]], a personification of the earth, and that she had once taken Odin's brothers [[Vili and V\u00e9]] into her embrace. Frigg responds that if there was a boy like her now-deceased son [[Baldr]] in the hall, Loki would not be able to escape from the wrath of the gods. Loki reminds Frigg that he is responsible for the death of her son Baldr.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=89}}\n\nThe goddess [[Freyja]] declares that Loki must be mad, stating that Frigg knows all fate, yet she does not speak it. Loki claims each of the gods and elves that are present have been Freyja's lover. Freyja replies that Loki is lying, that he just wants to \"yelp about wicked things\" that gods and goddesses are furious with him, and that he will go home thwarted. In response, Loki calls Freyja a malicious witch, and claims that Freyja was once astride her brother [[Freyr]], when all of the other laughing gods surprised her and Freyja then farted. This scenario is otherwise unattested. [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]] (Freyja and Freyr's father) says that it is harmless for a woman to have a lover or \"someone else\" beside her husband, and that what is surprising is a \"pervert god coming here who has borne children.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nLoki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to be silent, recalling Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's status as once having been a hostage from the [[Vanir]] to the [[\u00c6sir]] during the [[\u00c6sir-Vanir War]], that the \"daughters of Hymir\" once used Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"as a pisspot,\" urinating in his mouth (an otherwise unattested comment). Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r responds that this was his reward when he was sent as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and that he fathered his son (Freyr), whom no one hates, and is considered a prince of the \u00c6sir. Loki tells Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r to maintain his moderation, and that he won't keep it secret any longer that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r fathered this son with [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|his sister]] (unnamed), although one would expect him to be worse than he turned out.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Tyr]] defends Freyr, to which Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot \"deal straight with people,\" and points out that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must now wait in shackles until the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this \"injury,\" further calling him a \"wretch.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=91}}\n\nFreyr himself interrupts at this point, and says that he sees a wolf lying before a river mouth, and that, unless Loki is immediately silent, like the wolf, Loki shall also be bound until [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Loki retorts that Freyr purchased his consort [[Ger\u00f0r]] with gold, having given away his sword, which he will lack at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. [[Byggvir]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that if he had as noble a lineage and as an honorable a seat as Freyr, he would grind down Loki, and make all of his limbs lame. Loki refers to Byggvir in terms of a dog, and says that Byggvir is always found at Freyr's ears, or twittering beneath a grindstone. Byggvir says that he's proud to be here by all the gods and men, and that he's said to be speedy. Loki tells him to be silent, that Byggvir does not know how to apportion food among men, and that he hides among the straw and [[dais]] when men go to battle.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201392}}\n\nThe god [[Heimdallr]] says that Loki is drunk and witless, and asks Loki why he won't stop speaking. Loki tells Heimdallr to be silent, that he was fated a \"hateful life,\" that Heimdallr must always have a muddy back, and serve as watchman of the gods. The goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]] says that while Loki now appears light-hearted and \"playing\" with his \"tail-wagging,\" he will soon be bound with his ice-cold son's guts on a sharp rock by the gods. Loki says that, even if this is his fate, that he was \"first and foremost\" with the other gods at the killing of Ska\u00f0i's father, [[\u00dejazi]]. Ska\u00f0i says that, with these events in mind, \"baneful advice\" will always come from her \"sanctuaries and plains\" to Loki. Loki says that Ska\u00f0i was once gentler in speech to him (referring to himself as the \"son of [[Laufey]]\") when Ska\u00f0i once invited him to her bed (an event that is unattested elsewhere), and that such events must be mentioned if they are to recall \"shameful deeds.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=91\u201393}}\n\n[[Sif]], wife of [[Thor]], goes forth and pours Loki a glass of mead into a crystal cup in a prose narrative. Continuing the poem, Sif welcomes Loki and invites him to take a crystal cup filled with ancient mead, and says that among the children of the \u00c6sir, she is singularly blameless. Loki \"takes the horn,\" drinks it, and says that she would be, if it were so, and states that Sif had a lover beside Thor, namely, Loki himself (an event that is otherwise unattested). [[Beyla]] (referred to in the prose introduction to the poem as a servant of Freyr) says that all of the mountains are shaking, that she thinks Thor must be on his way home, and when Thor arrives he will bring peace to those that quarrel there. Loki tells Beyla to be silent, that she is \"much imbued with malice,\" that no worse female has ever been among the \"\u00c6sir's children,\" and calling her a bad \"serving-wench.\"{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=94}}\n\n;The arrival of Thor and the bondage of Loki\n[[File:Loki leaves the hall and threatens the \u00c6sir with fire by Fr\u00f8lich.jpg|thumb|''Loki threatens the \u00c6sir with fire'' (1895) by [[Lorenz Fr\u00f8lich]]]]\n[[Image:Louis Huard - The Punishment of Loki.jpg|thumb|''The Punishment of Loki'' by Louis Huard]]\nThor arrives, and tells Loki to be silent, referring to him as an \"evil creature,\" stating that with his hammer [[Mj\u00f6llnir]] he will silence Loki by hammering his head from his shoulders. Acknowledging that Thor has arrived, Loki asks Thor why he is raging, and says that Thor won't be so bold to fight against the wolf when he swallows Odin at [[Ragnar\u00f6k]]. Thor again tells Loki to be silent, and threatens him with Mj\u00f6llnir, adding that he will throw Loki \"up on the roads to the east,\" and thereafter no one will be able to see Loki. Loki states that Thor should never brag of his journeys to the east, claiming that there Thor crouched cowering in the thumb of a glove, mockingly referring to him as a \"hero,\" and adding that such behaviour was unlike Thor. Thor responds by telling Loki to be silent, threatening him with Mj\u00f6llnir, and adding that every one of Loki's bones will be broken with it. Loki says he intends to live for a long while yet despite Thor's threats, and taunts Thor about an encounter Thor once had with the [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki|Skr\u00fdmir]] ([[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]] in disguise). Thor again commands Loki to be silent, threatens Loki with Mj\u00f6llnir, and says he will send Loki to [[Hel (location)|Hel]], below the gates of [[N\u00e1grind]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nIn response to Thor, Loki says that he \"spoke before the \u00c6sir,\" and \"before the sons of the \u00c6sir\" what his \"spirit urged\" him to say, yet before Thor alone he will leave, as he knows that Thor does strike. Loki ends the poetic verses of ''Lokasenna'' with a final stanza:\n<blockquote>\n:Ale you brewed, \u00c6gir, and you will never again hold a feast;\n:all your possessions which are here inside\u2014\n:may flame play over them,\n:and may your back be burnt!{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=95}}\n</blockquote>\nFollowing this final stanza a prose section details that after Loki left the hall, he disguised himself as a [[salmon]] and hid in the waterfall of [[Franangrsfors]], where the \u00c6sir caught him. The narrative continues that Loki was bound with the entrails of his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Nari]], and his son [[Narfi (son of Loki)|Narfi]] changed into a wolf. Ska\u00f0i fastened a venomous snake over Loki's face, and from it poison dripped. Sigyn, Loki's wife, sat with him holding a basin beneath the dripping venom, yet when the basin became full, she carried the poison away; and during this time the poison dripped on to Loki, causing him to writhe with such violence that all of the earth shook from the force, resulting in what are now known as earthquakes.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=95\u201396}}\n\n====''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a''====\n[[Image:Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim.jpg|thumb|''Loki's flight to J\u00f6tunheim'' (1908) by [[W.

(1902) by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]].]]\nIn the poem ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'', Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, [[Mj\u00f6llnir]], is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess [[Freyja]], and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mj\u00f6llnir. Freyja agrees, saying she'd lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=97}}\n\nIn [[J\u00f6tunheimr]], the j\u00f6tunn [[\u00derymr]] sits on a [[tumulus|burial mound]], plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. \u00derymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the [[\u00c6sir]] and the [[Elf#Norse mythology|Elves]]; why is Loki alone in the J\u00f6tunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the \u00c6sir: that Thor's hammer, Mj\u00f6llnir, is gone. \u00derymr says that he has hidden Mj\u00f6llnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from J\u00f6tunheimr and back to the court of the gods.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=97\u201398}}\n\nThor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he's still in the air as \"tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies.\" Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that \u00derymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to \u00derymr as his wife. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to J\u00f6tunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the \u00c6sir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed [[Br\u00edsingamen]], falls from her. Freyja pointedly refuses.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=98}}\n\nAs a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] to discuss and debate the matter. At the thing, the god [[Heimdallr]] puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women's clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace Br\u00edsingamen. Thor rejects the idea, and Loki (here described as \"son of [[Laufey]]\") interjects that this will be the only way to get back Mj\u00f6llnir, and points out that without Mj\u00f6llnir, the j\u00f6tnar will be able to invade and settle in [[Asgard]]. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his maid, and that the two shall drive to J\u00f6tunheimr together.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=99}}\n\nAfter riding together in Thor's [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|goat-driven chariot]], the two, disguised, arrive in J\u00f6tunheimr. \u00derymr commands the j\u00f6tnar in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to be his wife. \u00derymr recounts his treasured animals and objects, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nEarly in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with \u00derymr and the assembled j\u00f6tnar. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of [[mead]]. \u00derymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before \u00derymr and appearing as a \"very shrewd maid\", makes the excuse that \"Freyja's\" behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. \u00derymr then lifts \"Freyja's\" veil and wants to kiss \"her\" until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because \"Freyja\" had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=100}}\n\nThe \"wretched sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar appears, asks for a bridal gift from \"Freyja\", and the j\u00f6tnar bring out Mj\u00f6llnir to \"sanctify the bride\", to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by \"the hand\" of the goddess [[V\u00e1r]]. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes \u00derymr, beats all of the j\u00f6tnar, and kills the \"older sister\" of the j\u00f6tnar.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=101}}\n\n====''Reginsm\u00e1l''====\nLoki appears in both prose and the first six stanzas of the poem ''Reginsm\u00e1l''. The prose introduction to ''Reginsm\u00e1l'' details that, while the hero [[Sigurd]] was being fostered by [[Regin]], son of [[Hreidmar]], Regin tells him that once the gods Odin, [[H\u0153nir]], and Loki went to Andvara-falls, which contained many fish. Regin, a dwarf, had two brothers; [[Andvari]], who gained food by spending time in the Andvara-falls in the form of a [[Esox|pike]], and [[\u00d3tr]], who would often go to the Andvara-falls in the form of an otter.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nWhile the three gods are at the falls, \u00d3tr (in the form of an otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead \u00d3tr) and show him their catches, including the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar \"seized them and made them ransom their lives\" in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=151}}\n\nLoki is sent to retrieve the gold, and Loki goes to the goddess [[R\u00e1n]], borrows her net, and then goes back to the Andvara-falls. At the falls, Loki spreads his net before Andvari (who is in the form of a pike), which Andvari jumps into. The stanzas of the poem then begin: Loki mocks Andvari, and tells him that he can save his head by telling Loki where his gold is. Andvari gives some background information about himself, including that he was cursed by a \"[[norns|norn]] of misfortune\" in his \"early days\". Loki responds by asking Andvari \"what requital\" does mankind get if \"they wound each other with words\". Andvari responds that lying men receive a \"terrible requital\": having to wade in the river [[Vadgelmir]], and that their suffering will be long.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nLoki looks over the gold that Andvari possesses, and after Andvari hands over all of his gold, Andvari holds on to but a single ring; the ring [[Andvarinaut]], which Loki also takes. Andvari, now in the form of a dwarf, goes into a rock, and tells Loki that the gold will result in the death of two brothers, will cause strife between eight princes, and will be useless to everyone.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki returns, and the three gods give Hreidmar the money from the gold hoard and flatten out the otter skin, stretch out its legs, and heap gold atop it, covering it. Hreidmar looks it over, and notices a single hair that has not been covered. Hreidmar demands that it be covered as well. Odin puts forth the ring Andvarinaut, covering the single hair.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=152}}\n\nLoki states that they have now handed over the gold, and that gold is cursed as Andvari is, and that it will be the death of Hreidmar and Regin both. Hreidmar responds that if he had known this before, he would have taken their lives, yet that he believes those are not yet born whom the curse is intended for, and that he doesn't believe him. Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold for the rest of his life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|pp=152\u2013153}}\n\n====''Baldrs draumar''====\nIn ''Baldr draumar'', Odin has awoken a deceased v\u00f6lva in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], and questions her repeatedly about his son [[Baldr]]'s bad dreams. Loki is mentioned in stanza 14, the final stanza of the poem, where the v\u00f6lva tells Odin to ride home, to be proud of himself, and that no one else will come visit until \"Loki is loose, escaped from his bonds\" and the onset of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=245}}\n\n====''Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0''====\n[[File:Loki finds Gullveigs Heart - John Bauer.jpg|thumb|Loki consumes a roasted heart in a painting (1911) by [[John Bauer (illustrator)|John Bauer]]]]\nLoki is referenced in two stanzas in ''[[V\u00f6lusp\u00e1 hin skamma]]'', found within the poem ''[[Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0]]''. The first stanza notes that Loki produced \"the wolf\" with the j\u00f6tunn [[Angrbo\u00f0a]], that Loki himself gave birth to the horse [[Sleipnir]] by the stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and that Loki (referred to as the \"brother of [[B\u00fdleistr]]\") thirdly gave birth to \"the worst of all marvels\". This stanza is followed by:\n<blockquote>\n:Loki ate some of the heart, the thought-stone of a woman,\n:roasted on a [[Tilia|linden-wood]] fire, he found it half-cooked;\n:Lopt was impregnated by a wicked woman,\n:from whom every ogress on earth is descended.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=258}}\n</blockquote>\nIn the second of the two stanzas, Loki is referred to as ''Lopt''. Loki's consumption of a woman's heart is otherwise unattested.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=296}}\n\n====''Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l''====\nIn the poem ''[[Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l]]'', a stanza mentions Loki (as ''Lopt'') in association with [[runic alphabet|runes]]. In the poem, Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r describes to the hero [[Svipdagr]] that [[Sinmara]] keeps the weapon [[L\u00e6vateinn]] within a chest, locked with [[Numbers in Germanic paganism|nine strong locks]] (due to significant translation differences, two translations of the stanza are provided here):\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:''Fjolsvith spake:''\n:\"L\u00e6vatein is there, that Lopt with runes\n:Once made by the doors of death;\n:In L\u00e6gjarn's chest by Sinmora lies it,\n:And nine locks fasten it firm.\"{{sfnp|Bellows|1936|p=245}}\n|\n:''Fiolsvith.''\n:H\u00e6vatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it,\n:down by the gate of Death.\n:In an iron chest it lies with Sinm\u0153ra,\n:and is with nine strong locks secured.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|pp=96\u201397}}\n|\n|}\n</blockquote>\n\n===''Prose Edda''===\n\n====''Gylfaginning''====\nThe ''Prose Edda'' book ''Gylfaginning'' tells various myths featuring Loki, including Loki's role in the birth of the horse [[Sleipnir]] and Loki's contest with [[Logi]], fire personified.\n\n'''High's introduction'''\n\nLoki first appears in the ''Prose Edda'' in chapter 20 of the book ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', where he is referred to as the \"[[\u00c6sir|\u00e1s]] called Loki\" while the enthroned figure of [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] explains to \"Gangleri\" (King [[Gylfi]] in disguise) the goddess Frigg's prophetic abilities while citing a stanza of ''Lokasenna''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=21}}\n[[Image:The children of Loki by Willy Pogany.png|thumb|right|\"The children of Loki\" (1920) by [[Willy Pogany]]]]\nLoki is more formally introduced by [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] in chapter 34, where he is \"reckoned among the \u00c6sir\", and High states that Loki is called by some \"the \u00c6sir's calumniator\", \"originator of deceits\", and \"the disgrace of all gods and men\". High says that Loki's alternative name is ''Lopt'', that he is the son of the male j\u00f6tunn [[F\u00e1rbauti]], his mother is \"[[Laufey|Laufey or N\u00e1l]]\", and his brothers are [[Helblindi]] and [[B\u00fdleistr]]. High describes Loki as \"pleasing and handsome\" in appearance, malicious in character, \"very capricious in behaviour\", and as possessing \"to a greater degree than others\" learned cunning, and \"tricks for every purpose\", often getting the \u00c6sir into trouble, and then getting them out of it with his trickery. Loki's wife is named Sigyn, and they have a son named \"Nari or Narfi\". Otherwise, Loki had three children with the female j\u00f6tunn Angrbo\u00f0a from [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]; the wolf [[Fenrir]], the serpent [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and the female being [[Hel (being)|Hel]]. The gods realized that these three children were being raised in J\u00f6tunheimr, and expected trouble from them partially due to the nature of Angrbo\u00f0a, but worse yet Loki.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=26\u201327}} In chapter 35, Gangleri comments that Loki produced a \"pretty terrible\"\u2014yet important\u2014family.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}}\n\n'''Loki, Sva\u00f0ilfari, and Sleipnir'''\n\nIn chapter 42, High tells a story set \"right at the beginning of the gods' settlement, when the gods at established [[Midgard]] and built [[Valhalla|Val-Hall]].\" The story is about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the [[S\u00f3l (sun)|sun]], and the [[M\u00e1ni|moon]]. After some debate, the gods agree to these conditions, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons without the help of any man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]], and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks\u2014to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Sva\u00f0ilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of [[Sumarr and Vetr|summer]], the builder is nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figure out who is responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki is to blame (here referred to as ''Loki Laufeyjarson''\u2014his surname derived from his mother's name, ''Laufey'').{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=35}}\n\n[[Image:Loki and Svadilfari by Hardy.jpg|thumb|''Loki and [[Sva\u00f0ilfari]]'' (1909) by Dorothy Hardy]]\nThe gods declare that Loki deserves a horrible death if he cannot find a scheme that will cause the builder to forfeit his payment, and threaten to attack him. Loki, afraid, swears oaths that he will devise a scheme to cause the builder to forfeit the payment, whatever it may cost himself. That night, the builder drives out to fetch stone with his stallion Sva\u00f0ilfari, and out from a wood runs a mare. The mare neighs at Sva\u00f0ilfari, and \"realizing what kind of horse it was,\" Sva\u00f0ilfari becomes frantic, neighs, tears apart his tackle, and runs towards the mare. The mare runs to the wood, Sva\u00f0ilfari follows, and the builder chases after. The two horses run around all night, causing the building to be halted and the builder is then unable to regain the previous momentum of his work.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\nThe builder goes into a rage, and when the \u00c6sir realize that the builder is a [[hrimthurs]], they disregard their previous oaths with the builder, and call for Thor. Thor arrives, and subsequently kills the builder by smashing the builder's skull into shards with the hammer Mj\u00f6llnir. However, Loki \"[[sexual intercourse|had such dealings]]\" with Sva\u00f0ilfari that \"[[Pregnancy|somewhat later]]\" Loki gives birth to a gray [[foal]] with eight legs; the horse [[Sleipnir]]\u2014\"the best horse among gods and men.\"{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=36}}\n\n'''Loki, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, and Logi'''\n\nIn chapter 44, [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|Third]] reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki are riding in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his [[Tanngrisnir and Tanngnj\u00f3str|two goats]]. Loki and Thor stop at the house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them not to break the bones. Afterward, at the suggestion of Loki, the peasant child [[\u00dej\u00e1lfi]] sucks the [[bone marrow]] from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son \u00dej\u00e1lfi and their daughter [[R\u00f6skva]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=37\u201338}}\n[[File:I am the giant Skrymir by Elmer Boyd Smith.jpg|thumb|''I am the giant [[Skrymir]]'' by [[Elmer Boyd Smith]]]]\nMinus the goats, Thor, Loki, and the two children continue east until they arrive at a vast forest in [[J\u00f6tunheimr]]. They continue through the woods until dark. The four seek shelter for the night. They encounter an immense building. Finding shelter in a side room, they experience earthquakes through the night. The earthquakes cause all four but Thor, who grips his hammer in preparation of defense, to be fearful. The building turns out to be the huge glove of [[Skrymir]], who has been snoring throughout the night, causing what seemed to be earthquakes. All four sleep beneath an oak tree near Skrymir in fear.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=38\u201340}}\n\nThor wakes up in the middle of the night, and a series of events occur where Thor twice attempts to kill the sleeping Skr\u00fdmir with his hammer. Skr\u00fdmir awakes after each attempt, only to say that he detected an acorn falling on his head or that he wonders if bits of tree from the branches above have fallen on top of him. The second attempt awakes Skr\u00fdmir. Skr\u00fdmir gives them advice; if they are going to be cocky at the keep of [[\u00datgar\u00f0ar|\u00datgar\u00f0r]] it would be better for them to turn back now, for [[\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki]]'s men there won't put up with it. Skr\u00fdmir throws his knapsack onto his back and abruptly goes into the forest. High comments that \"there is no report that the \u00c6sir expressed hope for a happy reunion\".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=40}}\n\nThe four travelers continue their journey until midday. They find themselves facing a massive castle in an open area. The castle is so tall that they must bend their heads back to their spines to see above it. At the entrance to the castle is a shut gate, and Thor finds that he cannot open it. Struggling, all four squeeze through the bars of the gate, and continue to a large hall. Inside the great hall are two benches, where many generally large people sit on two benches. The four see \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki, the king of the castle, sitting.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=40\u201341}}\n\n\u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says that no visitors are allowed to stay unless they can perform a feat. Loki, standing in the rear of the party, is the first to speak, claiming that he can eat faster than anyone. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of [[Logi]] to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, \u00dej\u00e1lfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=41\u201342}}\n\nThor agrees to compete in a drinking contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what he does, and that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki then calls for his nurse [[Elli]], an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=42\u201344}}\n\nThe next morning the group gets dressed and prepares to leave the keep. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki appears, has his servants prepare a table, and they all merrily eat and drink. As they leave, \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki asks Thor how he thought he fared in the contests. Thor says that he is unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki will now speak negatively about him. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki was in fact the immense Skr\u00fdmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first would have killed Skr\u00fdmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nThe contests, too, were an illusion. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki reveals that Loki had actually competed against wildfire itself (''Logi'', Old Norse \"flame\"), \u00dej\u00e1lfi had raced against thought (''Hugi'', Old Norse \"thought\"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached to the ocean and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in [[tide]]s). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, [[J\u00f6rmungandr]], and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this \"cat\", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (''Elli'', Old Norse \"old age\"), and there is no one that old age cannot bring down. \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki tells Thor that it would be better for \"both sides\" if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at \u00datgar\u00f0a-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=45\u201346}}\n\n===Norwegian rune poem===\n[[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|thumb|50px|The [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]]]\nLoki is mentioned in stanza 13 of the [[Rune Poems|Norwegian rune poem]] in connection with the [[Younger Futhark]] [[Berkanan|Bjarkan]] [[Runic alphabet|rune]]:\n<blockquote>\n{|\n|\n:<small>Old Norse:</small>\n:Bjarkan er laufgr\u00f8nster l\u00edma;\n::Loki bar fl\u00e6r\u00f0a t\u00edma.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=26}}\n|\n:<small>Modern English:</small>\n:[[Birch]] has the greenest leaves of any shrub;\n::Loki was fortunate in his deceit.{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n|}\n</blockquote>\nAccording to Bruce Dickins, the reference to \"Loki's deceit\" in the poem \"is doubtless to Loki's responsibility for Balder's death.\"{{sfnp|Dickins|1915|p=27}}\n\n==Archaeological record==\n\n===Snaptun Stone===\n[[Image:Lokistone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Snaptun Stone]] may feature a depiction of Loki]]\nIn 1950, a semi-circular flat stone featuring a depiction of a mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, [[Denmark]]. Made of [[soapstone]] that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due to his lips, considered a reference to a tale recorded in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'' where [[sons of Ivaldi]] stitch up Loki's lips.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\nThe stone is identified as a [[hearth]] stone; the nozzle of the [[bellows]] would be inserted into the hole in the front of the stone, and the air produced by the bellows pushed flame through the top hole, all the while the bellows were protected from the heat and flame. The stone may point to a connection between Loki and smithing and flames. According to Hans J\u00f8rgen Madsen, the Snaptun Stone is \"the most beautifully made hearth-stone that is known.\" The stone is housed and on display at the [[Moesg\u00e5rd Museum]] near [[Aarhus]], Denmark.{{sfnp|Madsen|1990|p=180}}\n\n===Kirkby Stephen Stone and Gosforth Cross===\nA fragmentary late 10th-century cross located in [[St Stephen's Church, Kirkby Stephen]], [[Cumbria]], [[England]], features a bound figure with horns and a beard.

The bottom portion of the west side of the cross features a depiction of a long-haired female, kneeling figure holding an object above another prostrate, bound figure. Above and to their left is a knotted serpent.

In Denmark, Loki appeared as ''Lokke''. In [[Jutland]], the phrases \"Lokke sl\u00e5r sin havre\" (\"Lokke is reaping his oats\") and \"Lokkemand driver sine geder\" (\"Lokkemand drives his goats\") are thereby recorded in the beginning of the 20th century, the latter with the variation of simply \"Lokke\". In [[Zealand]] the name \"Lokke lejemand\" (\"Lokke the Playing Man\") was used. In his study of Loki's appearance in Scandinavian folklore in the modern period, Danish folklorist [[Axel Olrik]] cites numerous examples of natural phenomena explained by way of Lokke in popular folk tradition, including rising heat. An example from 1841 reads as follows:\n<blockquote>\n:The expressions: \"Lokke (Lokki) s\u00e5r havre i dag\" (Lokke (Lokki) sows oats today), or: \"Lokke driver i dag med sine geder\" (Lokke herds his goats today), are used in several regions of Jutland, for example in Medelsom shire, the [[diocese of Viborg]] etc. ... and stand for the sight in the springtime, when the sunshine generates vapour from the ground, which can be seen as fluttering or shimmering air in the horizon of the flat landscape, similar to the hot steam over a kettle or a burning fire\n</blockquote>\nAnd in [[Thy (district)|Thy]], from the same source: \"... when you look at the horizon in clear weather and sunshine, and the air seems to move in shimmering waves, or like a sheet of water which seems to rise and sink in waves.\" Olrik further cites several different types of plants named after Loki. Olrik detects three major themes in folklore attestations; Lokke appeared as an \"air phenomenon\", connected with the \"home fire\", and as a \"teasing creature of the night\".{{sfnp|Olrik|1909}}\n\n''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' or ''Lokka T\u00e1ttur'' (Faroese \"tale\u2014or ''[[\u00fe\u00e1ttr]]''\u2014of Loki\") is a Faroese ballad dating to the late Middle Ages that features the gods Loki, Odin, and [[H\u0153nir]] helping a farmer and a boy escape the wrath of a bet-winning j\u00f6tunn. The tale notably features Loki as a benevolent god in this story, although his slyness is in evidence as usual.{{sfnp|Hirschfeld|1889|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n==Origin and identification with other figures==\nRegarding scholarship on Loki, scholar [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] comments (1964) that \"more ink has been spilled on Loki than on any other figure in Norse myth. This, in itself, is enough to show how little scholars agree, and how far we are from understanding him.\"{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|p=324}}\n\n===Origin===\nLoki's origins and role in Norse mythology have been much debated by scholars. In 1835, [[Jacob Grimm]] was first to produce a major theory about Loki, in which he advanced the notion of Loki as a \"god of fire\". In 1889, [[Sophus Bugge]] theorized Loki to be variant of [[Lucifer]] of Christianity, an element of Bugge's larger effort to find a basis of Christianity in Norse mythology. After [[World War II]], four scholarly theories dominated. The first of the four theories is that of [[Folke Str\u00f6m]], who in 1956 concluded that Loki is a [[hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis]] of the god [[Odin]]. In 1959, [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] theorized that Loki is a typical example of a [[trickster figure]]. In 1961, by way of excluding all non-Scandinavian mythological parallels in her analysis, [[Anna Birgitta Rooth]] concluded that Loki was originally a [[spider]]. [[Anne Holtsmark]], writing in 1962, concluded that no conclusion could be made about Loki.{{sfnp|von Schnurbein|2000|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\n===Identification with L\u00f3\u00f0urr===\nA popular theory proposed by the scholar [[Ursula Dronke]] is that ''[[L\u00f3\u00f0urr]]'' is \"a third name of Loki/Loptr\". The main argument for this is that the gods Odin, H\u0153nir and Loki occur as a trio in ''[[Haustl\u00f6ng]]'', in the prose prologue to ''[[Reginsm\u00e1l]]'' and also in the ''[[Loka T\u00e1ttur]]'' a [[Faroese people|Faroese]] ballad, an example of Norse deities appearing in later folklore. The Odin-kenning \"L\u00f3\u00f0urr's friend\" furthermore appears to parallel the kenning \"Loptr's friend\" and Loki is similarly referred to as \"H\u0153nir's friend\" in ''Haustl\u00f6ng'', strengthening the trio connection. While many scholars agree with this identification, it is not universally accepted. One argument against it is that Loki appears as a malevolent being later in ''V\u00f6lusp\u00e1'', seemingly conflicting with the image of L\u00f3\u00f0urr as a \"mighty and loving\" figure. Many scholars, including [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] and [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], have also identified L\u00f3\u00f0urr as being the same deity as Loki. Scholar Haukur \u00deorgeirsson suggests that ''Loki'' and ''L\u00f3\u00f0urr'' were different names for the same deity based on that Loki is referred to as L\u00f3\u00f0ur in the r\u00edmur ''[[Lokrur]]''. \u00deorgeirsson argues that the writer must have had information about the identification from either a tradition or that the author drew the conclusion based on the ''Prose Edda'', as Snorri does not mention L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Since the contents of the ''Poetic Edda'' are assumed to have been forgotten around 1400 when the r\u00edmur was written, Haukur argues for a traditional identification. \u00deorgeirsson also points to ''[[\u00derymlur]]'' where the same identification is made with Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr. Haukur says that unless the possible but unlikely idea that the 14th- and 15th-century poets possessed written sources unknown to us is true, the idea must have come from either an unlikely amount of sources from where the poets could have drawn a similar conclusion that Loki and L\u00f3\u00f0urr are identical (like some recent scholars) or that remnants of an oral tradition remained. Haukur concludes that if L\u00f3\u00f0urr was historically considered an independent deity from Loki, then a discussion of when and why he became identified with Loki is appropriate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1793106/Lokrur_Lodurr_and_Late_Evidence|title=Lokrur, L\u00f3\u00f0urr and late evidence|last=\u00deorgeirsson|first=Haukur}}</ref>\n\n===Binding===\nThe scholar [[John Lindow]] highlights the recurring pattern of the [[bound monster]] in Norse mythology as being particularly associated to Loki. Loki and his three children by Angrboda were all bound in some way, and were all destined to break free at Ragnarok to wreak havoc on the world. He suggests a borrowed element from the traditions of the Caucasus region, and identifies a mythological parallel with the \"Christian legend of the bound Antichrist awaiting the Last Judgment\".{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|p=82-83}}\n\n==Modern interpretations and legacy==\n\nIn the 19th century, Loki was depicted in a variety of ways, some strongly at odds with others. According to Stefan Arvidssen, \"the conception of Loki varied during the nineteenth century. Sometimes he was presented as a dark-haired Semitic [[fifth column]]ist among the Nordic Aesir, but sometimes he was described as a Nordic [[Prometheus]], a heroic bearer of culture\".{{sfnp|Arvidsson|2006|p=154}} \n\nLoki appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera cycle [[Ring of the Nibelung]] as ''Loge'' (a play on Old Norse ''loge'', \"fire\"), depicted as an ally of the gods (specifically as [[Wotan]]'s assistant rather than [[Thor|Donner's]]), although he generally dislikes them and thinks of them as greedy, as they refuse to return the Rhine Gold to its rightful owners. In the conclusion of the first opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]'', he reveals his hope to turn into fire and destroy Valhalla, and in the final opera ''[[G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung]]'' Valhalla is set alight, destroying the Gods.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Winder|editor1-last=McConnell|editor2-first=Werner|editor2-last=Wunderlich|editor3-first=Frank|editor3-last=Gentry|editor4-first=Ulrich|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=Mueller|year=2013|title=The Nibelungen Tradition: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|at=\"Loge\" and \"Loki\"|isbn=978-0815317852}}</ref>\n\nAs the myths tell of Loki changing gender on several occasions,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clunies Ross |first1=Margaret |author-link1=Margaret Clunies Ross |year=2002 |editor1-last=Acker |editor1-first=Paul |editor2-last=Larrington |editor2-first=Carolyne |chapter=Reading ''\u00derymskvi\u00f0a'' |title=The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology |pages=194 |isbn=0815316607 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlozzi |first1=Alfred F. |last2=Choate |first2=Kurt T |year=2018 |title=Transgender and Gender Diverse Persons: A Handbook |pages=266 |isbn=1351207091 }}</ref> some modern works interpret or depict the deity as [[genderfluid]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Birkedal |first1=K.

The album was officially announced on 22 October 2013 by the band's frontman, [[Thomas Gabriel Fischer]] (a.k.a. \"Tom Warrior\"), on his official blog.<ref>[http://fischerisdead.blogspot.com.br/2013/10/triptykon-press-release.html Triptykon Press Release, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe title is in [[Greek language|Greek]] (''\u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03a7\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1'') and, according to Fischer, it can be roughly translated as \"black, deep depressions/valleys\" \u2014 or, more literally, \"chasms as [black as] ink\".\n\nThe album's artwork was provided by famous [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] painter [[H.

The album was officially announced on 22 October 2013 by the band's frontman, [[Thomas Gabriel Fischer]] (a.k.a. \"Tom Warrior\"), on his official blog.<ref>[http://fischerisdead.blogspot.com.br/2013/10/triptykon-press-release.html Triptykon Press Release, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe title is in [[Greek language|Greek]] (''\u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac \u03a7\u03ac\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1'') and, according to Fischer, it can be roughly translated as \"black, deep depressions/valleys\" \u2014 or, more literally, \"chasms as [black as] ink\".\n\nThe album's artwork was provided by famous [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] painter [[H. R. Giger]]. It is the third time in his career he has collaborated with Thomas Fischer; Giger also provided artwork for Fischer's former band [[Celtic Frost]]'s first full-length, ''[[To Mega Therion (album)|To Mega Therion]]'', in 1985, and to Triptykon's debut ''[[Eparistera Daimones]]'' in 2010. It was Giger's last album cover before his death, just one month after the album's release.\n\nA [[music video]] for the track \"Aurorae\" was released on 7 August 2014. Another video, to \"Tree of Suffocating Souls\", was released on 17 November 2014.

He was a pupil at Chobham Secondary Modern School in Surrey. After the arrival of the [[Beatles]], Parker and some other 12/13 year olds formed the Deepcut Three, soon renamed the Black Rockers. None of the members actually learned to play their instruments, however, and were merely dress-up bands, adopting Beatle haircuts, black jeans and polo neck sweaters. By the time Parker was 15 he was a fan of soul music, especially [[Otis Redding]], and would go to dance clubs in the nearby towns of [[Woking]] and [[Camberley]] where there was a thriving appreciation of [[soul music]], [[Motown]] and [[ska]]. Parker left school at 16 and went to work at the Animal Virus Research Institute in [[Pirbright]], [[Surrey]], where he bred animals for [[foot-and-mouth disease]] research. At 18 he left the job and moved to [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]] where he took a variety of jobs, picking tomatoes, digging ditches, collecting money from pinball machines, and working in a bakery. In Guernsey he bought an acoustic guitar and began to learn fingerpicking style and began writing songs with lyrics heavily influenced by the psychedelic music of the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nParker returned to England for a year, living in [[Chichester]] in Sussex where he worked at the Chichester Rubber Glove Factory. By 1971, he had left England again and spent time in Paris right at the time of the [[Angela Davis#Arrest and trial|Free Angela Davis]] march through the city. From France, Parker hitchhiked through Spain to Morocco, where he traveled around for a year before moving to [[Gibraltar]]. In Gibraltar he worked on the docks unloading frozen foods, which he then helped deliver to supermarkets. His guitar playing and writing skills were improving, and after playing songs to a few locals in a bar, he found himself on an afternoon show on Gibraltar television where he performed two or three of his own songs. At that time, a strongly psychedelic influenced band named Pegasus often played in the same bar and asked Parker to join them. With Parker in the band playing a borrowed electric guitar, Pegasus played one show in Gibraltar before going to [[Tangier]], Morocco, where they briefly performed in a nightclub. Parker, however, was growing out of the hippie trappings and decided the band needed to learn a few songs that involved major keys (all the songs they played were in A minor) and so taught the members some of the soul numbers he had loved as a youth, including [[Wilson Pickett]]\u2019s \"[[In The Midnight Hour]]\". He also tired of the band's hippie name and renamed them Terry Burbot's Magic Mud.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn late 1972, Parker returned to England and lived with his parents, working at a petrol station around the corner from his childhood home in [[Deepcut]]. By now he was determined to pursue a career in music and worked steadily on improving his guitar playing and song writing. In late 1974 he placed an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' seeking like-minded backing musicians. One of the musicians who answered the ad was Noel Brown, a guitarist who lived in south London. Brown introduced him to [[Paul Riley (musician)|Paul \"Bassman\" Riley]] who had recently been a member of [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]]. (Brown also found Parker a gig at Southern Comfort, a tiny hamburger caf\u00e9 on Seven Sisters Road in [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], London where he played solo, performing a mixture of original songs and covers.) Riley thought Parker should meet Dave Robinson, the manager of the by now defunct [[Brinsley Schwarz]] band. Robinson had a small studio above the [[Hope and Anchor, Islington|Hope & Anchor]] pub in [[Islington]] and began to record Parker, sometimes solo and sometimes with a few musicians behind him.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=933}}</ref>\n\nOne of the songs Parker recorded was \"Between You and Me.\"  This demo version ended up on Parker's first album, ''[[Howlin' Wind]]'', after the Rumour tried to record it but failed to achieve the natural feel of the demo. Another song, \"Nothin\u2019s Gonna Pull Us Apart\" was played, in demo form, on the [[Charlie Gillett]] show \"Honky Tonk\" on [[BBC London 94.9]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> On hearing the song, Nigel Grainge from [[Phonogram Records]] called Gillett and asked who the new singer was. By now Robinson had become Parker's manager and a deal with Phonogram was struck. Robinson then went about recruiting the musicians who would become the Rumour, and recording for ''Howlin\u2019 Wind'' began in the winter of 1975 with [[Nick Lowe]] producing. In 1975, he recorded a few [[demo (music)|demo tracks]] in London with Dave Robinson, who would shortly found [[Stiff Records]] and who connected Parker with his first backing band of note, [[The Rumour]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Parker had one track, \"Back to Schooldays\", released on the [[compilation album]], ''[[A Bunch of Stiff Records]]'' for Stiff Records.\n\nIn the summer of 1975, Parker joined ex-members of three British pub-rock bands to form [[Graham Parker and the Rumour]]: Parker (lead vocals, guitar) with [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]] (lead guitar) and [[Bob Andrews (keyboardist)|Bob Andrews]] (keyboards) (both ex [[Brinsley Schwarz]]), [[Martin Belmont]] (rhythm guitar, ex [[Ducks Deluxe]]) and Andrew Bodnar (bass) and [[Steve Goulding]] (drums).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They began in the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|British pub rock]] scene, often augmented at times by a four-man horn section known as The Rumour Horns: [[John Earle (musician)|John \"Irish\" Earle]] (saxophone), Chris Gower (trombone), Dick Hanson (trumpet), and Ray Beavis (saxophone).\n\nThe band's first album, ''Howlin' Wind'', was released to acclaim in April 1976 and was rapidly followed by the stylistically similar ''[[Heat Treatment]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  A mixture of rock, ballads, and reggae-influenced numbers, these albums reflected Parker's early influences and contained the songs which formed the core of Parker's live shows \u2013 \"Black Honey\", \"Soul Shoes\", \"Lady Doctor\", \"Fool's Gold\", and his early signature tune \"Don't Ask Me Questions\", which hit the Top 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nEstablishing a recording career in early 1976, Parker preceded two other [[New wave music|new wave]] English singer-songwriters with whom he is often compared: [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]. (Costello's first single was released in 1977, and Jackson's first solo single in late 1978).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===New direction (1977)===\nGraham Parker and the Rumour appeared on [[BBC]] television's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1977, performing their version of [[The Trammps]]' \"Hold Back the Night\" from ''The Pink Parker'' [[Extended play|EP]], a Top 30 hit in the UK Singles Chart in March 1977.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> At this point, Parker began to change his songwriting style, hoping to break into the American market. The first fruits of this new direction appeared on ''[[Stick To Me]]'' (1977), which broke the Top 20 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nParker and the Rumour gained a following in Australia thanks to the support of community radio (4ZZZ, 3RRR), Sydney independent rock station [[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]] (2JJ) and the ABC's weekly pop TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', which gave the group nationwide exposure. They made their first tour there in 1978, where they spotted rising Australian band [[The Sports]], who subsequently supported Parker and the Rumour on their early 1979 UK tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memorabletv.com/musicworld/ozrock/stot.htm |title=Australian Rock by Memorable Music |publisher=Memorabletv.com |date=1973-06-01 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409121857/http://www.memorabletv.com/musicworld/ozrock/stot.htm |archivedate=9 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The group made a second Australian tour in late 1979, when Parker appeared on ''Countdown'' as a guest presenter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/tag/countdown |title=Countdown |publisher=TV Tonight |date=2012-04-23 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===''Squeezing Out Sparks'' (1978\u20131979)===\nAn official Graham Parker and The Rumour live album, ''The Parkerilla'', issued in 1978, had nothing new:<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> three sides were live, with versions of previously released songs; the fourth was devoted to a \"disco\" remake of \"Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions\". ''The Parkerilla'' satisfied his contractual obligation to [[Mercury Records]], freeing him to sign with Arista.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Parker had long been dissatisfied with the performance of Mercury Records, finally issuing in 1979 as a single [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] \"Mercury Poisoning\" a song that directly attacked it. The flip side of the single was a cover of the Jackson Five song \"I Want You Back (Alive).\"<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nGraham Parker and The Rumour were one of the four support acts for [[Bob Dylan]] at The Picnic at Blackbushe on 15 July 1978. The band also opened Richard Branson's new club [[The Venue (Victoria Street, London)|The Venue]], London, in November 1978.\n\nEnergized by his new label, [[Arista Records]], and with record producer [[Jack Nitzsche]], Parker wrote the songs that would form the basis for ''[[Squeezing Out Sparks]]'', widely held to be the best album of his career.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> For this album, The Rumour's brass section, prominent on all previous albums, was jettisoned.\n\n''Squeezing Out Sparks'' (1979) was named by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' at No.&nbsp;335<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6599324 |title=News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> on its [[List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. In an early 1987 ''Rolling Stone'' list of their top 100 albums from 1967 to 1987, ''Squeezing Out Sparks'' was ranked at No.&nbsp;45, while ''Howlin' Wind'' came in at No.&nbsp;54.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coastal.edu/library/media/rs100.html |title=Kimbel Library: Media Collection - Rolling Stone Magazine's Top 100 Albums |publisher=Coastal.edu |accessdate=2012-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107180443/http://www.coastal.edu/library/media/rs100.html |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The album also featured singles such as \"[[Local Girls]]\", \"[[Protection (Graham Parker song)|Protection]]\", and \"[[Discovering Japan]]\". The companion live album ''Live Sparks'', was sent to US radio stations as part of a concerted promotional campaign.\n\nThe jettisoned brass section continued to play on other people's records, credited as The Irish Horns (on the album ''[[London Calling]]'' by [[The Clash]]) or The Rumour Brass, most notably on [[Katrina and the Waves]]' 1985 hit \"[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking On Sunshine]]\".\n\n===The end of The Rumour (1980)===\nBob Andrews left The Rumour in early 1980, and was not officially replaced. However, in studio sessions for the next album, [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Danny Federici]] (of [[The E Street Band]]) played keyboards.\n\n1980's ''The Up Escalator'' was Parker's highest-charting album in the UK,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and was produced by [[Jimmy Iovine]] and had guest vocals from [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The front cover of the album credited only Graham Parker, not \"Graham Parker and The Rumour\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  The album was certified Gold in Canada (for over 50,000 copies sold).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum#!/gp_search=graham%20nash|title=Gold Platinum|publisher=Music Canada|accessdate=March 1, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6iYPUE2rD?url=http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum#!/gp_search=graham%20nash|archive-date=26 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''The Up Escalator'' would prove to be Parker's last album with the Rumour until a reunion decades later.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> However, Rumour guitarist [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]]  reunited with Parker in 1983 and play on most of his albums through the decade's end.  Other Rumour members also played with Parker in later years:  bassist Andrew Bodnar would rejoin Parker from 1988 through the mid-1990s, and drummer [[Steve Goulding]] would play on Parker's 2001 album ''Deepcut To Nowhere''.\n\n===Commercial success (1981\u20131990)===\nThe 1980s were Parker's most commercially successful years, with well-financed recordings and radio and video play. His follow-up to ''The Up Escalator'', 1982's ''Another Grey Area'', used [[session musician]]s [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Hugh McCracken]]. This album charted at UK No.&nbsp;40 and US No.&nbsp;51, and spun off a Top 50 UK single in \"[[Temporary Beauty]]\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n1983's ''The Real Macaw'', with drumming by [[Gilson Lavis]] of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] and Brinsley Schwarz on guitar, did not fare as well, hitting US No.&nbsp;59 on the album charts but missing the UK charts altogether. However, Parker's 1985 release ''Steady Nerves'' (credited to '''Graham Parker and The Shot''') was a moderate success and included his only US Top 40 hit \"Wake Up (Next to You)\". The Shot was a four-piece backing band, all of whom had played on either ''The Real Macaw'' or ''Another Grey Area'': Brinsley Schwarz (guitar), George Small (keyboards), Kevin Jenkins (bass) and Michael Braun (drums).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n''Steady Nerves'' was recorded in New York City, and Parker began living mostly in the United States during this time.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nRecord label changes came quickly after the mid-1980s, partly accounting for the number of [[compilation album]]s in Graham Parker's discography. Particularly unproductive was Parker's tenure at [[Atlantic Records]], where he released nothing and signed to [[RCA Records]]. He began producing his own recordings and issued ''[[The Mona Lisa's Sister]]''. The backing band for this album included former Rumour-mates Schwarz and Bodnar; keyboardists James Halliwell and [[Steve Nieve]]; and drummer [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]] (replaced on one cut by Andy Duncan, and two others by [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]], who, like Nieve, was a member of [[Elvis Costello and the Attractions]]).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked ''The Mona Lisa's Sister'' at No.&nbsp;97 on its list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s.\n\n===The 1990s===\nParker continued to record for RCA through the early 1990s. Long-time guitarist Schwarz once again left Parker after the 1990 album ''Human Soul''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Parker's 1991 offering, ''[[Struck by Lightning (album)|Struck By Lightning]]'', had Bodnar and [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]] in the backing band, as well as guest appearances from The Band's [[Garth Hudson]] on keyboards and [[John Sebastian]] on autoharp. However, the album's chart peak of US No.&nbsp;131 saw Parker dropped by the label. 1992's ''Burning Questions'' was released by [[Capitol Records]], who promptly dropped him after the album failed to sell.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nA 1994 Christmas-themed EP release (''Graham Parker's Christmas Cracker'') was issued on Dakota Arts Records, before Parker found a more permanent home on American independent label [[Razor & Tie]]. After the personal ''12 Haunted Episodes'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and 1996's ''Acid Bubblegum'' (featuring [[Jimmy Destri]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] on keyboards), Parker grew quiet in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> However, he continued to play live fairly regularly, often working with backing band [[The Figgs]] (who, like The Rumour, when not backing Parker also issue records as a discrete unit).\n\n===To the present===\n[[File:Graham parker by Steve Bachman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parker at Brit's Pub in [[Minneapolis]], 2003]]\n[[File:Graham Parker.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Parker in [[Chicago]], 2012]]\nParker began a more active period in 2001, with the UK re-release of his early Rumour work, and with his third studio album for [[Razor & Tie]], ''Deepcut to Nowhere''. In 2003, he collaborated with [[Kate Pierson]] of [[the B-52's]] and [[Bill Janovitz]] of [[Buffalo Tom]] to record an album of lesser-known [[John Lennon]]/[[Paul McCartney]] compositions that had never been recorded by [[The Beatles]]. The album, called ''From a Window: Lost Songs of Lennon & McCartney'', was credited to \"Pierson, Parker, Janovitz\". Also in 2003, Parker contributed a solo acoustic version of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\" to the [[compilation album]], ''A Fair Forgery of Pink Floyd''.\n\nNew solo work continued with 2004's ''Your Country'', which saw Parker switch labels to Chicago-based indie [[Bloodshot Records]] and was co-produced by [[John Would]] at Stanley Recording in Venice, California. The album was recorded and mixed in two weeks.\n\n''Songs of No Consequence'' was recorded with The Figgs in 2005. A show from the ensuing tour with the Figgs was broadcast on [[FM radio]] and released as an album in 2006. In March 2007, a new full-length album, ''Don't Tell Columbus'', was released.\n\nIn addition to his records, Parker published an illustrated science fiction novella, ''The Great Trouser Mystery'' in 1980. He published a set of short stories, ''Carp Fishing on Valium'', in June 2000. His third book, the novel ''The Other Life of Brian'', appeared in September 2003.\n\nIn early 2011, Parker reunited with all five original members of The Rumour to record a new album, ''Three Chords Good''. It was released in November 2012. [[Music journalism|Music journalist]], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that the release was \"the rare reunion that simultaneously looks back while living in the present.\"<ref name=\"Three Chords Good\">{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/three-chords-good-mw0002420812 |title=Three Chords Good - Graham Parker, Graham Parker & the Rumour : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Judd Apatow]] film ''[[This Is 40]]'', in which Parker and Rumour play themselves, was released a month later, in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfilmweb.com/2011/09/steve-goulding-graham-parker-mekons-music-documentary/ |title=Graham Parker and the Rumour are back, Judd Apatow's got 'em &#124; The Ask |publisher=Musicfilmweb.com |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref>\n\nThe Parker/Rumour reunion continued into 2015, when their new album ''Mystery Glue'' was issued.  It was followed by a short international tour, after which the reunion ended.\n\nIn April 2018, Parker signed with 100% Records, and released a brand new single titled \"Dreamin'\". Later, in July 2018, Parker announced ''Cloud Symbols'', his brand new studio album to be released on September 21, 2018. The album features Parker's brand new backing band The Goldtops, which consists of Martin Belmont on guitar, Geraint Watkins on keyboards, Simon Edwards on bass, and Roy Dodds on drums. The album also features the Rumour Brass, making this their first appearance on a Graham Parker album since ''Stick to Me'' in 1977 and their first time working with Parker since the Squeezing Out Sparks tour in 1979. The album was initially to be produced by [[Neil Brockbank]], but he died during the recording of the album and production duties for the rest of the album were passed onto Tuck Nelson and Parker himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ItsGrahamParker/status/1021325709740998656 |title= Graham Parker on Twitter|publisher=twitter.com |date=2018-07-23 |accessdate=2018-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ItsGrahamParker/status/1044257419751231489 |title= Graham Parker on Twitter|publisher=twitter.com |date=2018-09-24 |accessdate=2018-09-28}}</ref>\n\nHe announced a solo, acoustic 40th Anniversary version of ''Squeezing Out Sparks'', for an April 13, 2019 release.

He was a pupil at Chobham Secondary Modern School in Surrey. After the arrival of the [[Beatles]], Parker and some other 12/13 year olds formed the Deepcut Three, soon renamed the Black Rockers. None of the members actually learned to play their instruments, however, and were merely dress-up bands, adopting Beatle haircuts, black jeans and polo neck sweaters. By the time Parker was 15 he was a fan of soul music, especially [[Otis Redding]], and would go to dance clubs in the nearby towns of [[Woking]] and [[Camberley]] where there was a thriving appreciation of [[soul music]], [[Motown]] and [[ska]]. Parker left school at 16 and went to work at the Animal Virus Research Institute in [[Pirbright]], [[Surrey]], where he bred animals for [[foot-and-mouth disease]] research. At 18 he left the job and moved to [[Guernsey]] in the [[Channel Islands]] where he took a variety of jobs, picking tomatoes, digging ditches, collecting money from pinball machines, and working in a bakery. In Guernsey he bought an acoustic guitar and began to learn fingerpicking style and began writing songs with lyrics heavily influenced by the psychedelic music of the time.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nParker returned to England for a year, living in [[Chichester]] in Sussex where he worked at the Chichester Rubber Glove Factory. By 1971, he had left England again and spent time in Paris right at the time of the [[Angela Davis#Arrest and trial|Free Angela Davis]] march through the city. From France, Parker hitchhiked through Spain to Morocco, where he traveled around for a year before moving to [[Gibraltar]]. In Gibraltar he worked on the docks unloading frozen foods, which he then helped deliver to supermarkets. His guitar playing and writing skills were improving, and after playing songs to a few locals in a bar, he found himself on an afternoon show on Gibraltar television where he performed two or three of his own songs. At that time, a strongly psychedelic influenced band named Pegasus often played in the same bar and asked Parker to join them. With Parker in the band playing a borrowed electric guitar, Pegasus played one show in Gibraltar before going to [[Tangier]], Morocco, where they briefly performed in a nightclub. Parker, however, was growing out of the hippie trappings and decided the band needed to learn a few songs that involved major keys (all the songs they played were in A minor) and so taught the members some of the soul numbers he had loved as a youth, including [[Wilson Pickett]]\u2019s \"[[In The Midnight Hour]]\". He also tired of the band's hippie name and renamed them Terry Burbot's Magic Mud.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn late 1972, Parker returned to England and lived with his parents, working at a petrol station around the corner from his childhood home in [[Deepcut]]. By now he was determined to pursue a career in music and worked steadily on improving his guitar playing and song writing. In late 1974 he placed an ad in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' seeking like-minded backing musicians. One of the musicians who answered the ad was Noel Brown, a guitarist who lived in south London. Brown introduced him to [[Paul Riley (musician)|Paul \"Bassman\" Riley]] who had recently been a member of [[Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers]]. (Brown also found Parker a gig at Southern Comfort, a tiny hamburger caf\u00e9 on Seven Sisters Road in [[Finsbury Park (area)|Finsbury Park]], London where he played solo, performing a mixture of original songs and covers.) Riley thought Parker should meet Dave Robinson, the manager of the by now defunct [[Brinsley Schwarz]] band. Robinson had a small studio above the [[Hope and Anchor, Islington|Hope & Anchor]] pub in [[Islington]] and began to record Parker, sometimes solo and sometimes with a few musicians behind him.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=933}}</ref>\n\nOne of the songs Parker recorded was \"Between You and Me.\"  This demo version ended up on Parker's first album, ''[[Howlin' Wind]]'', after the Rumour tried to record it but failed to achieve the natural feel of the demo. Another song, \"Nothin\u2019s Gonna Pull Us Apart\" was played, in demo form, on the [[Charlie Gillett]] show \"Honky Tonk\" on [[BBC London 94.9]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> On hearing the song, Nigel Grainge from [[Phonogram Records]] called Gillett and asked who the new singer was. By now Robinson had become Parker's manager and a deal with Phonogram was struck. Robinson then went about recruiting the musicians who would become the Rumour, and recording for ''Howlin\u2019 Wind'' began in the winter of 1975 with [[Nick Lowe]] producing. In 1975, he recorded a few [[demo (music)|demo tracks]] in London with Dave Robinson, who would shortly found [[Stiff Records]] and who connected Parker with his first backing band of note, [[The Rumour]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Parker had one track, \"Back to Schooldays\", released on the [[compilation album]], ''[[A Bunch of Stiff Records]]'' for Stiff Records.\n\nIn the summer of 1975, Parker joined ex-members of three British pub-rock bands to form [[Graham Parker and the Rumour]]: Parker (lead vocals, guitar) with [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]] (lead guitar) and [[Bob Andrews (keyboardist)|Bob Andrews]] (keyboards) (both ex [[Brinsley Schwarz]]), [[Martin Belmont]] (rhythm guitar, ex [[Ducks Deluxe]]) and Andrew Bodnar (bass) and [[Steve Goulding]] (drums).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They began in the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|British pub rock]] scene, often augmented at times by a four-man horn section known as The Rumour Horns: [[John Earle (musician)|John \"Irish\" Earle]] (saxophone), Chris Gower (trombone), Dick Hanson (trumpet), and Ray Beavis (saxophone).\n\nThe band's first album, ''Howlin' Wind'', was released to acclaim in April 1976 and was rapidly followed by the stylistically similar ''[[Heat Treatment]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  A mixture of rock, ballads, and reggae-influenced numbers, these albums reflected Parker's early influences and contained the songs which formed the core of Parker's live shows \u2013 \"Black Honey\", \"Soul Shoes\", \"Lady Doctor\", \"Fool's Gold\", and his early signature tune \"Don't Ask Me Questions\", which hit the Top 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/>\n\nEstablishing a recording career in early 1976, Parker preceded two other [[New wave music|new wave]] English singer-songwriters with whom he is often compared: [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]. (Costello's first single was released in 1977, and Jackson's first solo single in late 1978).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===New direction (1977)===\nGraham Parker and the Rumour appeared on [[BBC]] television's ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1977, performing their version of [[The Trammps]]' \"Hold Back the Night\" from ''The Pink Parker'' [[Extended play|EP]], a Top 30 hit in the UK Singles Chart in March 1977.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> At this point, Parker began to change his songwriting style, hoping to break into the American market. The first fruits of this new direction appeared on ''[[Stick To Me]]'' (1977), which broke the Top 20 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nParker and the Rumour gained a following in Australia thanks to the support of community radio (4ZZZ, 3RRR), Sydney independent rock station [[Double Jay (radio network)|Double Jay]] (2JJ) and the ABC's weekly pop TV show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', which gave the group nationwide exposure. They made their first tour there in 1978, where they spotted rising Australian band [[The Sports]], who subsequently supported Parker and the Rumour on their early 1979 UK tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memorabletv.com/musicworld/ozrock/stot.htm |title=Australian Rock by Memorable Music |publisher=Memorabletv.com |date=1973-06-01 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409121857/http://www.memorabletv.com/musicworld/ozrock/stot.htm |archivedate=9 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The group made a second Australian tour in late 1979, when Parker appeared on ''Countdown'' as a guest presenter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/tag/countdown |title=Countdown |publisher=TV Tonight |date=2012-04-23 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===''Squeezing Out Sparks'' (1978\u20131979)===\nAn official Graham Parker and The Rumour live album, ''The Parkerilla'', issued in 1978, had nothing new:<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> three sides were live, with versions of previously released songs; the fourth was devoted to a \"disco\" remake of \"Hey Lord, Don't Ask Me Questions\". ''The Parkerilla'' satisfied his contractual obligation to [[Mercury Records]], freeing him to sign with Arista.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Parker had long been dissatisfied with the performance of Mercury Records, finally issuing in 1979 as a single [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] \"Mercury Poisoning\" a song that directly attacked it. The flip side of the single was a cover of the Jackson Five song \"I Want You Back (Alive).\"<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nGraham Parker and The Rumour were one of the four support acts for [[Bob Dylan]] at The Picnic at Blackbushe on 15 July 1978. The band also opened Richard Branson's new club [[The Venue (Victoria Street, London)|The Venue]], London, in November 1978.\n\nEnergized by his new label, [[Arista Records]], and with record producer [[Jack Nitzsche]], Parker wrote the songs that would form the basis for ''[[Squeezing Out Sparks]]'', widely held to be the best album of his career.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> For this album, The Rumour's brass section, prominent on all previous albums, was jettisoned.\n\n''Squeezing Out Sparks'' (1979) was named by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' at No.&nbsp;335<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6599324 |title=News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> on its [[List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. In an early 1987 ''Rolling Stone'' list of their top 100 albums from 1967 to 1987, ''Squeezing Out Sparks'' was ranked at No.&nbsp;45, while ''Howlin' Wind'' came in at No.&nbsp;54.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coastal.edu/library/media/rs100.html |title=Kimbel Library: Media Collection - Rolling Stone Magazine's Top 100 Albums |publisher=Coastal.edu |accessdate=2012-11-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130107180443/http://www.coastal.edu/library/media/rs100.html |archivedate=7 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The album also featured singles such as \"[[Local Girls]]\", \"[[Protection (Graham Parker song)|Protection]]\", and \"[[Discovering Japan]]\". The companion live album ''Live Sparks'', was sent to US radio stations as part of a concerted promotional campaign.\n\nThe jettisoned brass section continued to play on other people's records, credited as The Irish Horns (on the album ''[[London Calling]]'' by [[The Clash]]) or The Rumour Brass, most notably on [[Katrina and the Waves]]' 1985 hit \"[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking On Sunshine]]\".\n\n===The end of The Rumour (1980)===\nBob Andrews left The Rumour in early 1980, and was not officially replaced. However, in studio sessions for the next album, [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Danny Federici]] (of [[The E Street Band]]) played keyboards.\n\n1980's ''The Up Escalator'' was Parker's highest-charting album in the UK,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and was produced by [[Jimmy Iovine]] and had guest vocals from [[Bruce Springsteen]]. The front cover of the album credited only Graham Parker, not \"Graham Parker and The Rumour\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>  The album was certified Gold in Canada (for over 50,000 copies sold).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum#!/gp_search=graham%20nash|title=Gold Platinum|publisher=Music Canada|accessdate=March 1, 2015|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6iYPUE2rD?url=http://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum#!/gp_search=graham%20nash|archive-date=26 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n''The Up Escalator'' would prove to be Parker's last album with the Rumour until a reunion decades later.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> However, Rumour guitarist [[Brinsley Schwarz (musician)|Brinsley Schwarz]]  reunited with Parker in 1983 and play on most of his albums through the decade's end.  Other Rumour members also played with Parker in later years:  bassist Andrew Bodnar would rejoin Parker from 1988 through the mid-1990s, and drummer [[Steve Goulding]] would play on Parker's 2001 album ''Deepcut To Nowhere''.\n\n===Commercial success (1981\u20131990)===\nThe 1980s were Parker's most commercially successful years, with well-financed recordings and radio and video play. His follow-up to ''The Up Escalator'', 1982's ''Another Grey Area'', used [[session musician]]s [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Hugh McCracken]]. This album charted at UK No.&nbsp;40 and US No.&nbsp;51, and spun off a Top 50 UK single in \"[[Temporary Beauty]]\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n1983's ''The Real Macaw'', with drumming by [[Gilson Lavis]] of [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]] and Brinsley Schwarz on guitar, did not fare as well, hitting US No.&nbsp;59 on the album charts but missing the UK charts altogether. However, Parker's 1985 release ''Steady Nerves'' (credited to '''Graham Parker and The Shot''') was a moderate success and included his only US Top 40 hit \"Wake Up (Next to You)\". The Shot was a four-piece backing band, all of whom had played on either ''The Real Macaw'' or ''Another Grey Area'': Brinsley Schwarz (guitar), George Small (keyboards), Kevin Jenkins (bass) and Michael Braun (drums).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n''Steady Nerves'' was recorded in New York City, and Parker began living mostly in the United States during this time.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nRecord label changes came quickly after the mid-1980s, partly accounting for the number of [[compilation album]]s in Graham Parker's discography. Particularly unproductive was Parker's tenure at [[Atlantic Records]], where he released nothing and signed to [[RCA Records]]. He began producing his own recordings and issued ''[[The Mona Lisa's Sister]]''. The backing band for this album included former Rumour-mates Schwarz and Bodnar; keyboardists James Halliwell and [[Steve Nieve]]; and drummer [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]] (replaced on one cut by Andy Duncan, and two others by [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]], who, like Nieve, was a member of [[Elvis Costello and the Attractions]]).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked ''The Mona Lisa's Sister'' at No.&nbsp;97 on its list of The 100 Greatest Albums of the 1980s.\n\n===The 1990s===\nParker continued to record for RCA through the early 1990s. Long-time guitarist Schwarz once again left Parker after the 1990 album ''Human Soul''.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Parker's 1991 offering, ''[[Struck by Lightning (album)|Struck By Lightning]]'', had Bodnar and [[Pete Thomas (drummer)|Pete Thomas]] in the backing band, as well as guest appearances from The Band's [[Garth Hudson]] on keyboards and [[John Sebastian]] on autoharp. However, the album's chart peak of US No.&nbsp;131 saw Parker dropped by the label. 1992's ''Burning Questions'' was released by [[Capitol Records]], who promptly dropped him after the album failed to sell.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nA 1994 Christmas-themed EP release (''Graham Parker's Christmas Cracker'') was issued on Dakota Arts Records, before Parker found a more permanent home on American independent label [[Razor & Tie]]. After the personal ''12 Haunted Episodes'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and 1996's ''Acid Bubblegum'' (featuring [[Jimmy Destri]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] on keyboards), Parker grew quiet in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> However, he continued to play live fairly regularly, often working with backing band [[The Figgs]] (who, like The Rumour, when not backing Parker also issue records as a discrete unit).\n\n===To the present===\n[[File:Graham parker by Steve Bachman.jpg|thumb|upright|Parker at Brit's Pub in [[Minneapolis]], 2003]]\n[[File:Graham Parker.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Parker in [[Chicago]], 2012]]\nParker began a more active period in 2001, with the UK re-release of his early Rumour work, and with his third studio album for [[Razor & Tie]], ''Deepcut to Nowhere''. In 2003, he collaborated with [[Kate Pierson]] of [[the B-52's]] and [[Bill Janovitz]] of [[Buffalo Tom]] to record an album of lesser-known [[John Lennon]]/[[Paul McCartney]] compositions that had never been recorded by [[The Beatles]]. The album, called ''From a Window: Lost Songs of Lennon & McCartney'', was credited to \"Pierson, Parker, Janovitz\". Also in 2003, Parker contributed a solo acoustic version of [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Comfortably Numb]]\" to the [[compilation album]], ''A Fair Forgery of Pink Floyd''.\n\nNew solo work continued with 2004's ''Your Country'', which saw Parker switch labels to Chicago-based indie [[Bloodshot Records]] and was co-produced by [[John Would]] at Stanley Recording in Venice, California. The album was recorded and mixed in two weeks.\n\n''Songs of No Consequence'' was recorded with The Figgs in 2005. A show from the ensuing tour with the Figgs was broadcast on [[FM radio]] and released as an album in 2006. In March 2007, a new full-length album, ''Don't Tell Columbus'', was released.\n\nIn addition to his records, Parker published an illustrated science fiction novella, ''The Great Trouser Mystery'' in 1980. He published a set of short stories, ''Carp Fishing on Valium'', in June 2000. His third book, the novel ''The Other Life of Brian'', appeared in September 2003.\n\nIn early 2011, Parker reunited with all five original members of The Rumour to record a new album, ''Three Chords Good''. It was released in November 2012. [[Music journalism|Music journalist]], [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that the release was \"the rare reunion that simultaneously looks back while living in the present.\"<ref name=\"Three Chords Good\">{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/three-chords-good-mw0002420812 |title=Three Chords Good - Graham Parker, Graham Parker & the Rumour : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref> Meanwhile, the [[Judd Apatow]] film ''[[This Is 40]]'', in which Parker and Rumour play themselves, was released a month later, in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfilmweb.com/2011/09/steve-goulding-graham-parker-mekons-music-documentary/ |title=Graham Parker and the Rumour are back, Judd Apatow's got 'em &#124; The Ask |publisher=Musicfilmweb.com |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}</ref>\n\nThe Parker/Rumour reunion continued into 2015, when their new album ''Mystery Glue'' was issued.  It was followed by a short international tour, after which the reunion ended.\n\nIn April 2018, Parker signed with 100% Records, and released a brand new single titled \"Dreamin'\". Later, in July 2018, Parker announced ''Cloud Symbols'', his brand new studio album to be released on September 21, 2018. The album features Parker's brand new backing band The Goldtops, which consists of Martin Belmont on guitar, Geraint Watkins on keyboards, Simon Edwards on bass, and Roy Dodds on drums. The album also features the Rumour Brass, making this their first appearance on a Graham Parker album since ''Stick to Me'' in 1977 and their first time working with Parker since the Squeezing Out Sparks tour in 1979. The album was initially to be produced by [[Neil Brockbank]], but he died during the recording of the album and production duties for the rest of the album were passed onto Tuck Nelson and Parker himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ItsGrahamParker/status/1021325709740998656 |title= Graham Parker on Twitter|publisher=twitter.com |date=2018-07-23 |accessdate=2018-09-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ItsGrahamParker/status/1044257419751231489 |title= Graham Parker on Twitter|publisher=twitter.com |date=2018-09-24 |accessdate=2018-09-28}}</ref>\n\nHe announced a solo, acoustic 40th Anniversary version of ''Squeezing Out Sparks'', for an April 13, 2019 release.

He learnt a number of skills which he would use during his reign against his enemies such as archery and magic. He studied alongside Hiravati and Achak Narayan, the orphaned children of a dead [[Jalpaiguri]] chief and his captive wife, brought to Kamrup by their nurse Mandavi and her son Jhantu.

Govinda and his accompanying sannyasis went to the temple of Hattanath ([[tutelary deity]] of Gour) before launching a surprise attack on the rebels causing them to retreat. Govardhan's wife, Apurna, then thanked the sannyasis and consented for them to rule over Gour as her son, Garuda, who was meant to be Govardhan's heir, was still a minor. Giridhari then informed the royal officers of Govinda's royal lineage, gaining their acceptance, to make his way to the throne. He then changed his name from Govinda Fenchu to Gour Govinda, after his kingdom which he had earned. Govinda appointed [[Mona Rai]] as his chief minister, replacing Govardhan's former chief minister [[Madan Rai]].<ref name=pak/>\n\nGovinda then married his childhood friend, Hiravati. In one occasion, Hiravati suffered from an illness and no one in Srihatta could help in curing her. Govinda then travelled to [[Rarh region|Rarh]] where he met up with a healer by the name of Chakrapani Dutta. The two men then went back to Gour and Dutta was able to cure Hiravati. Govinda, in delight, requested Dutta to live and spend the rest of his life in the Gour Kingdom. However Dutta wanted to return to Rarh. Not wanting to displease Govinda, Dutta gave his youngest son, Mahipati, to live in the kingdom. Dutta stayed for a while in Gour as Govinda's commander-in-chief.

After the marriage of Achak Narayan to the eight-year-old princess Lalasa, Govinda gifted Narayan by appointing him as the feudal ruler of Tungachal (modern-day Habiganj District).

During a war with the [[Khasi people|Khasi]]s, Govinda tied the Khasi Raja to ropes, bringing him to Gour. Govinda demanded a ransom for the release of the Khasi king which was later paid.

[[Brahmins]] from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (possibly [[Deshastha Brahmin]]s), also migrated to Gour and gained some authority, being favoured by Govinda for their orthodoxism. These elitist Brahmins led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over by Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s, or ''untouchables'' of the lowest social status. The Brahmins which King Kesava Deva had welcomed from [[Central India]], were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen who were influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\n== Defeat ==\n[[File:Tea Garden in Malini chora Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPG|thumb|Mulnicherra, now the oldest tea garden in South Asia, is home to the Harong Hurong cave which Govinda supposedly retreated to.]]\n{{Main|Conquest of Gour}}\nThere was also a minority of Muslim families who migrated to Gour and Tungachal, following the short-lived [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Expedition]] in 1254 led by the Governor of Bengal, [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]].<ref name=stewart>{{cite book|title=The History of Bengal|first=Charles|last=Stewart|year=1813|location=[[London]]}}</ref> [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]], who lived in the village of Tultikar, sacrificed a cow for his newborn son's ''[[aqiqah]]'' or celebration of birth.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">{{cite book |last=Hussain |first= M Sahul |year=2014 |chapter= Burhanuddin (R) |chapter-url= http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Burhanuddin_(R)|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Govinda, in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn, Gulzar Alam, killed, as well as having [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]]'s right hand cut off.<ref>EB, Suharwardy Yemani Sylheti, Shaikhul Mashaikh Hazrat Makhdum Ghazi Shaikh Jalaluddin Mujjarad, in Hanif, N.

He is described as a very conservative [[Bengali Hindus|Hindu]] whose reign started in 1260. He was known to be disrespectful and intolerant of other faiths practised in Srihatta, such as Islam, Buddhism and certain [[Hindu denominations]], often getting into war with neighbouring states such as [[Laur Kingdom|Laur]], [[Jaintia Kingdom|Jaintia]] and the [[Khasi people|Khasi]]s.

Govinda, in delight, requested Dutta to live and spend the rest of his life in the Gour Kingdom. However Dutta wanted to return to Rarh. Not wanting to displease Govinda, Dutta gave his youngest son, Mahipati, to live in the kingdom. Dutta stayed for a while in Gour as Govinda's commander-in-chief.

[[Brahmins]] from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] (possibly [[Deshastha Brahmin]]s), also migrated to Gour and gained some authority, being favoured by Govinda for their orthodoxism. These elitist Brahmins led a movement against members of other religions in Gour. They favoured the Brahmins of Brahmachal brought over by Brahmajit. The followers of [[Tantric Buddhism]] were treated as [[dalit]]s, or ''untouchables'' of the lowest social status. The Brahmins which King Kesava Deva had welcomed from [[Central India]], were looked down upon by the Deccan Brahmins as low-class as well, in addition to the Hindu [[Namasudras]], [[Kaivarta]]s and [[Dasa]]s who were viewed as poor wine-sellers and fishermen who were influenced too much by Buddhism.<ref name=back/>\n\n== Defeat ==\n[[File:Tea Garden in Malini chora Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPG|thumb|Mulnicherra, now the oldest tea garden in South Asia, is home to the Harong Hurong cave which Govinda supposedly retreated to.]]\n{{Main|Conquest of Gour}}\nThere was also a minority of Muslim families who migrated to Gour and Tungachal, following the short-lived [[Ajmiriganj Upazila|Azmardan Expedition]] in 1254 led by the Governor of Bengal, [[Malik Ikhtiyaruddin Iuzbak]].<ref name=stewart>{{cite book|title=The History of Bengal|first=Charles|last=Stewart|year=1813|location=[[London]]}}</ref> [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]], who lived in the village of Tultikar, sacrificed a cow for his newborn son's ''[[aqiqah]]'' or celebration of birth.<ref name=\"en.banglapedia.org\">{{cite book |last=Hussain |first= M Sahul |year=2014 |chapter= Burhanuddin (R) |chapter-url= http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Burhanuddin_(R)|title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Govinda, in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege due to his [[Cows in Hinduism|Hindu beliefs]], had the newborn, Gulzar Alam, killed, as well as having [[Burhanuddin (Bangladeshi wali)|Burhanuddin]]'s right hand cut off.<ref>EB, Suharwardy Yemani Sylheti, Shaikhul Mashaikh Hazrat Makhdum Ghazi Shaikh Jalaluddin Mujjarad, in Hanif, N.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\n\n== History and significance ==\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', Stephen Jay Gould compared the \u201canatomical disparity\u201d of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world---one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \u201cBrandon Bridge fauna\u201d---and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\n\n== History and significance ==\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', Stephen Jay Gould compared the \u201canatomical disparity\u201d of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world---one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \u201cBrandon Bridge fauna\u201d---and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.
