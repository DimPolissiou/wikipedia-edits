Confusingly, ''[[Geranium]]'' is the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants (also known as cranesbills). Both genera belong to the [[family (biology)|family]] Geraniaceae. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] originally included all the species in one genus, ''Geranium'', and they were later separated into two genera by [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle|Charles L\u2019H\u00e9ritier]] in 1789.\n\n''Pelargonium'' species are evergreen perennials [[native plant|indigenous]] to temperate and tropical regions of the world, with many species in southern Africa. They are drought and heat tolerant, but can tolerate only minor frosts. Some species are extremely popular garden plants, grown as houseplants and [[bedding (horticulture)|bedding]] plants in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions.They have a long flowering period, with flowers mostly in purple, red and orange, or white.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Pelargon.jpg|thumb|One of hundreds of garden and houseplant cultivars]]\nThe name ''Pelargonium'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2]], ''pelarg\u00f3s'' ([[stork]]), because the seed head looks like a stork's beak. [[Dillenius]] originally suggested the name 'stork', because ''Geranium'' was named after a [[crane (bird)|crane]] \u2014 \"''a'' \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, ''ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania'', \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, ''grus''\" (as ''pelargos'', stork, as we call the ''Gerania'', ''geranos'', crane).{{sfn|Dillenius|1732|loc=[http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/ing/Libro.php?Libro=1386&Pagina=280 De Geraniorum Differentiis]}}{{sfn|Boddy|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=24eoWcnoyfcC&pg=PR2 Introduction p.&nbsp;11]}} Despite the Latin, this should not be confused with the modern-day genus ''[[Ciconia]]'', of birds in the stork family.\n\n== Description ==\n''Pelargonium'' occurs in a large number of [[growth forms]], including [[herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annuals]], [[shrubs]], subshrubs, stem [[succulents]] and [[geophytes]].{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} The erect stems bear five-[[petal]]ed [[flowers]] in [[umbel]]-like clusters, which are occasionally branched. Because not all flowers appear simultaneously but open from the centre outwards, this is a form of inflorescence is referred to as pseudoumbels.\n\nThe flower has a single symmetry plane ([[zygomorphic]]), which distinguishes it from the ''[[Geranium]]'' flower, which has radial symmetry ([[actinomorphic]]). Thus the lower three (anterior) petals are differentiated from the upper two (posterior) petals. The posterior [[sepal]] is fused with the [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] to form a [[hypanthium]] (nectary tube). The nectary tube varies from only a few millimeters, up to several centimeters, and is an important floral characteristic in morphological classification. [[Stamens]] vary from 2 to 7, and their number, position relative to [[staminodes]], and curvature are used to identify individual species. There are five [[stigmata]] in the [[Style (botany)|style]].<ref name=PPage/> For the considerable diversity in flower morphology, see figure 1 of R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.'' (2014){{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n\n[[Leaf|Leaves]] are usually alternate, and [[leaf shape|palmately]] lobed or [[pinnate]], often on long stalks, and sometimes with light or dark patterns.

Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden Vol. 80, No. 3 (1993), pp. 661-671]</ref> However phylogenetic analysis shows only three distinct [[clades]], labelled A, B and C.<ref name=Weng/> In this analysis not all sections were [[monophyletic]] although some were strongly supported including ''Chorisma'', ''Myrrhidium'' and ''Jenkinsonia'', while other sections were more [[paraphyletic]]. This in turn has led to a proposal, informal at this stage of a reformulation of the infrageneric subdivision of ''Pelargonium''.\n\nIn the proposed scheme of Weng ''et al''. there would be two [[subgenera]], based on clades A+B, and C respectively and seven sections based on subclades. Subsequent analysis with an expanded taxa set confirmed this infrageneric subdivision into two groups which also correspond to chromosome length (<1.5 \u03bc, 1.5-3.0\u03bc),{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} but also two subclades within each major clade, suggesting the presence of four subgenera, these correspond to clades A, B, C1 and C2 of the earlier analysis, A being by far the largest clade with 141 taxa. As before the internal structure of the clades supported monophyly of some sections (''Myrrhidium'', ''Chorisma'', ''Reniformia'', ''Pelargonium'', ''Ligularia'' and ''Hoarea'') but paraphyly in others (''Jenkinsonia'', ''Ciconium'', ''Peristera''). A distinct clade could be identified within the paraphyletic ''Polyactium'', designated section ''Magnistipulacea''. As a result, ''Polyactium'' has been split up to provide this new section, which in itself contains two subsections, ''Magnistipulacea'' and ''Schizopetala'', following Knuth's original treatment of ''Polyactium'' as having four subsections.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n[[File:Pelargonium tetragonum.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Magnipetala'' section ''Chorisma'': ''[[Pelargonium tetragonum|P.&nbsp;tetragonum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium cotyledonis03.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Parvulipetala'' section ''Isopetalum'': ''[[Pelargonium cotyledonis|P.&nbsp;cotyledonis]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium acetosum (9344387742).jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Paucisignata'' section ''Ciconium'': ''[[Pelargonium acetosum|P.&nbsp;acetosum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium tricolor hh.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Campylia'': ''[[Pelargonium tricolor|P.&nbsp;tricolor]]'']]\n[[Image:Pelargonium crithmifolium3.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Otidia'': ''[[Pelargonium crithmifolium|P.&nbsp;crithmifolium]]'']]\n\nThus R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.''

It was probably brought to the [[Botanical Garden]] in [[Leiden]] before 1600 on ships which had stopped at the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In 1631, the English gardener [[John Tradescant the elder]] bought seeds from Rene Morin in Paris and introduced the plant to England. By 1724, ''[[Pelargonium inquinans|P. inquinans]]'', ''[[Pelargonium odoratissimum|P. odoratissimum]]'', ''[[Pelargonium peltatum|P. peltatum]]'', ''[[Pelargonium vitifolium|P. vitifolium]]'', and ''[[Pelargonium zonale|P. zonale]]'' had been introduced to Europe.{{sfn|Taylor|2014|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=RWuZBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT207 Pelargonium]}}\n\n=== Cultivars ===\n[[File:Pelargonium zonale (Geraniaceae).jpg|thumb|Zonal pelargonium]]\nThere was little attempt at any rational grouping of ''Pelargonium'' cultivars, the growing of which was revived in the mid-twentieth century, and the origins of many if not most were lost in obscurity. In 1916 the American botanist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858\u20131954) introduced two new terms for zonal and regal pelargoniums. Those pelargoniums which were largely derived from ''[[Pelargonium zonale|P. zonale]]'' he referred to as [[Pelargonium x hortorum|''P.'' \u00d7 ''hortorum'']] (i.e. from the garden), while those from ''[[Pelargonium cucullatum|P. cucullatum]]'' he named [[Pelargonium x domesticum|''P.'' \u00d7 ''domesticum'']] (i.e. from the home).{{sfn|Wilkinson|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6787AwAAQBAJ&pg=PT189 p. 189]}}<ref>{{cite web |last=Handlos |first=Wayne |date=2010 |url=http://www.geraniumsonline.com/lhbailey.htm |title=Connections, Legacies, and Contributions:Liberty Hyde Bailey, Jr. |website=Geraniums Online |publisher=Central Coast Geranium Society |accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In the late 1950s a list (the Spalding List) was produced in the United States, based on nursery listings and the 1897 list of [[Henri Dauthenay]].{{sfn|Dauthenay|1897}} It described seven groups, listing each cultivar with the list of its originator, and in most cases a date. These were Species, Zonals, Variegated-Leaved, Domesticum (Regals), Ivy-Leaved, Scented-Leaved and Old. In the 1970s the British Pelargonium and Geranium Society produced a checklist and the Australian Geranium Society started to produce a register but it was not completed till its author, Jean Llewellyn's death in 1999.

They are grown primarily for the beauty and richness of their flower heads, which are large. Most of those cultivars grown currently are the result of hybridization over the last 50 years.

The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between ''P. crispum'' and a Regal variety in the early part of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with ''P. crispum'' in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called \"pansy-faced\" in the US.

One theory being a derivation from ''P. fulgidum'', but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique\u2019, also known as or \u2018Rollinson\u2019s Crimson\u2019, in the mid-19th century is also claimed.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}} Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, as a result of this cross, are much more floriferous.\n\n; Cultivar:\n* Fiery-flowered Stork's-bill, Scarlet Unique Scented Geranium (''P.'' \u00d7 ''ignescens''){{sfn|Sweet|1822|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/182545#page/25/mode/1up ''Pelargonium ignescens'']}} - a ''P. fulgidum'' hybrid<ref>{{cite web |last=Cornett |first=Peggy |date=2013 |url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/pelargonium-fulgidum-hybrid-scarlet-unique-geranium |title=Pelargonium fulgidum hybrid - Scarlet Unique Geranium |website=Monticello.org |publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== F. Scented-leaved pelargoniums ====\n[[Image:Pelargonium graveolens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium graveolens]]'' (Scented leaf)]]\nShrubby evergreen perennials grown chiefly for their fragrance, may be species or cultivars but all must have a clear and distinct scented foliage. Scent is emitted when the leaves are touched or bruised with some scents aromatic, others pungent and in a few cases, quite unpleasant. Several of the scented leaved pelargoniums are grown for the oil [[geraniol]], which is extracted from the leaves and is an essential oil much used commercially in perfumery. The scent of some species growing in their natural habitat, acts as a deterrent to grazing animals who appear to dislike the emitted scent. Conversely, it also attracts other insect life to visit the bloom and pollinate the plant. The scented leaves can be used for potpourri and they also have a use as flavourings in cooking. Occasionally scented types can be found in some of the other groups mentioned; for example, the Angels, having ''P. crispum'' in their genetic makeup, can often have a strong citrus scent. Leaves are lobed, toothed, incised or variegated. Growth habit is very variable, but the flowers are less prominent than other groups, and most closely resemble the species they originated from.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}\n\nThese include:\n[[Image:Fair Ellen.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]'' 'Fair Ellen' (Scented leaf)]]\n[[Image:Pelargonium ionidiflorum 1.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium ionidiflorum]]'' (Scented leaf)]]\n* Almond - ''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium odoratissimum]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium cordifolium]]''\n* Apple/Mint - ''[[Pelargonium album]]''\n* Apricot/Lemon - ''Pelargonium scabrum''\n* Balsam - ''Pelargonium panduriforme''\n* Camphor - ''Pelargonium betulinum'' \n* Celery - ''Pelargonium ionidiflorum''\n* Cinnamon - ''Pelargonium 'Ardwyck Cinnamon'''\n* Coconut - ''[[Pelargonium grossalarioides]]'' (''Pelargonium parriflorum'')\n* Eau de Cologne - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliantine'''\n* Eucalyptus - ''Pelargonium 'Secret Love'''\n* Grapefruit - ''Pelargonium 'Poquita'''\n* Ginger - ''Pelargonium 'Torrento''' or 'Cola Bottles' which is a variety of ''Pelargonium'' x ''nervosum'' \n* Hazelnut - ''Pelargonium 'Odorata Hazelnut''\n* Lavender - ''Pelargonium 'Lavender Lindy'''\n* Lemon - ''[[Pelargonium crispum]]''\n* Lemon - ''Pelargonium citronellum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Mabel Grey')\n* Lemon Balm - ''Pelargonium x melissinum''\n* Lime - ''Pelargonium x nervosum''\n* Myrrh - ''Pelargonium myrrhifolium''\n* Nutmeg - ''[[Pelargonium x fragrans]]'' \n* Old Spice - ''Variety of Pelargonium x fragrans''\n* Orange - ''Pelargonium x citriodorum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Prince of Orange')\n* Peach - ''Pelargonium 'Peaches and Cream'''\n* Peppermint - ''[[Pelargonium tomentosum]]''\n* Pine - ''Pelargonium denticulatum'' \n* Pineapple - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliant'''\n* Raspberry - ''Pelargonium 'Red Raspberry'''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium graveolens]]'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium roseum'')\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium capitatum]]''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium radens]]''\n* Southernwood - ''Pelargonium abrotanifolium''\n* Spicy - ''[[Pelargonium exstipulatum]]''\n* Strawberry - ''Pelargonium x scarboroviae''\n\n; Cultivars:\n* 'Attar of Roses' - a cultivar of ''P. capitatum''\n* 'Crowfoot Rose' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Dr. Livingston' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Grey Lady Plymouth' - a cultivar of ''P. graveolens''\n* 'Prince Rupert' - a cultivar of ''P. crispum''\n\n==== G. Species pelargoniums ====\nThe species are the forefathers of all the cultivar groups listed above. In general, the definition of a species is that it breeds true, and is to be found doing this in the \"wild\". Species pelargoniums have a large diversity of characteristics in habit, shape, size and colour, which probably accounts for them having retained their popularity for more than 300 years.\n\n==== H. Primary hybrids ====\nA primary hybrid is recognised as being the resultant plant from a first-time cross between two different known species. Examples are ''P.'' \u00d7 ''ardens'' \u2013 from ''P. lobatum'' \u00d7 ''P. fulgidum'' (1810). ''P.'' \u00d7 ''glauciifolium'' \u2013 from ''P. gibbosum'' \u00d7 ''P. lobatum'' (1822).

Confusingly, ''[[Geranium]]'' is the botanical name and common name of a separate genus of related plants (also known as cranesbills). Both genera belong to the [[family (biology)|family]] Geraniaceae. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] originally included all the species in one genus, ''Geranium'', and they were later separated into two genera by [[Charles Louis L'H\u00e9ritier de Brutelle|Charles L\u2019H\u00e9ritier]] in 1789.\n\n''Pelargonium'' species are evergreen perennials [[native plant|indigenous]] to temperate and tropical regions of the world, with many species in southern Africa. They are drought and heat tolerant, but can tolerate only minor frosts. Some species are extremely popular garden plants, grown as houseplants and [[bedding (horticulture)|bedding]] plants in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions.They have a long flowering period, with flowers mostly in purple, red and orange, or white.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Pelargon.jpg|thumb|One of hundreds of garden and houseplant cultivars]]\nThe name ''Pelargonium'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2|\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2]], ''pelarg\u00f3s'' ([[stork]]), because the seed head looks like a stork's beak. [[Dillenius]] originally suggested the name 'stork', because ''Geranium'' was named after a [[crane (bird)|crane]] \u2014 \"''a'' \u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, ''ciconia, sicuti vocamus Gerania'', \u03b3\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2, ''grus''\" (as ''pelargos'', stork, as we call the ''Gerania'', ''geranos'', crane).{{sfn|Dillenius|1732|loc=[http://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/ing/Libro.php?Libro=1386&Pagina=280 De Geraniorum Differentiis]}}{{sfn|Boddy|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=24eoWcnoyfcC&pg=PR2 Introduction p.&nbsp;11]}} Despite the Latin, this should not be confused with the modern-day genus ''[[Ciconia]]'', of birds in the stork family.\n\n== Description ==\n''Pelargonium'' occurs in a large number of [[growth forms]], including [[herbaceous]] [[Annual plant|annuals]], [[shrubs]], subshrubs, stem [[succulents]] and [[geophytes]].{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} The erect stems bear five-[[petal]]ed [[flowers]] in [[umbel]]-like clusters, which are occasionally branched. Because not all flowers appear simultaneously but open from the centre outwards, this is a form of inflorescence is referred to as pseudoumbels.\n\nThe flower has a single symmetry plane ([[zygomorphic]]), which distinguishes it from the ''[[Geranium]]'' flower, which has radial symmetry ([[actinomorphic]]). Thus the lower three (anterior) petals are differentiated from the upper two (posterior) petals. The posterior [[sepal]] is fused with the [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] to form a [[hypanthium]] (nectary tube). The nectary tube varies from only a few millimeters, up to several centimeters, and is an important floral characteristic in morphological classification. [[Stamens]] vary from 2 to 7, and their number, position relative to [[staminodes]], and curvature are used to identify individual species. There are five [[stigmata]] in the [[Style (botany)|style]].<ref name=PPage/> For the considerable diversity in flower morphology, see figure 1 of R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.'' (2014){{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n\n[[Leaf|Leaves]] are usually alternate, and [[leaf shape|palmately]] lobed or [[pinnate]], often on long stalks, and sometimes with light or dark patterns. The leaves of ''[[Pelargonium peltatum]]'' (Ivy-leaved Geranium), have a thick cuticle better adapting them for drought tolerance.<ref>{{cite book|last=Appell|first=Scott D.|title=The Potted Garden: New plants and New approaches for container gardens.|year=2001|isbn=978-1889538228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FhGxmyG5HLMC|page={{page needed|date=March 2014}} }}</ref>\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n[[File:Dillenius Pellargonium.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dillenius]]' introduction of the term 'Pelargonium' in ''Hortus Elthamensis'' 1732]]\n[[File:P inquinans Dillenius.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium inquinans]]'', (''Geranium Afric. arborescens''), ''Hortus Elthamensis'']]\n''Pelargonium'' is the second largest genus (after ''Geranium'') within the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Geraniaceae]], within which it is [[Sister group|sister]] to the remaining genera of the family in its strict sense,<ref name=Price/> ''[[Erodium]]'', ''[[Geranium]]'', and ''[[Monsonia]]'' including ''Sarcocaulon''.

Price and Jeffrey D. Palmer. Phylogenetic Relationships of the Geraniaceae and Geraniales from rbcL Sequence Comparisons. Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden Vol. 80, No. 3 (1993), pp. 661-671]</ref> However phylogenetic analysis shows only three distinct [[clades]], labelled A, B and C.<ref name=Weng/> In this analysis not all sections were [[monophyletic]] although some were strongly supported including ''Chorisma'', ''Myrrhidium'' and ''Jenkinsonia'', while other sections were more [[paraphyletic]]. This in turn has led to a proposal, informal at this stage of a reformulation of the infrageneric subdivision of ''Pelargonium''.\n\nIn the proposed scheme of Weng ''et al''. there would be two [[subgenera]], based on clades A+B, and C respectively and seven sections based on subclades. Subsequent analysis with an expanded taxa set confirmed this infrageneric subdivision into two groups which also correspond to chromosome length (<1.5 \u03bc, 1.5-3.0\u03bc),{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}} but also two subclades within each major clade, suggesting the presence of four subgenera, these correspond to clades A, B, C1 and C2 of the earlier analysis, A being by far the largest clade with 141 taxa. As before the internal structure of the clades supported monophyly of some sections (''Myrrhidium'', ''Chorisma'', ''Reniformia'', ''Pelargonium'', ''Ligularia'' and ''Hoarea'') but paraphyly in others (''Jenkinsonia'', ''Ciconium'', ''Peristera''). A distinct clade could be identified within the paraphyletic ''Polyactium'', designated section ''Magnistipulacea''. As a result, ''Polyactium'' has been split up to provide this new section, which in itself contains two subsections, ''Magnistipulacea'' and ''Schizopetala'', following Knuth's original treatment of ''Polyactium'' as having four subsections.{{sfn|Roschenbleck et al|2014}}\n[[File:Pelargonium tetragonum.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Magnipetala'' section ''Chorisma'': ''[[Pelargonium tetragonum|P.&nbsp;tetragonum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium cotyledonis03.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Parvulipetala'' section ''Isopetalum'': ''[[Pelargonium cotyledonis|P.&nbsp;cotyledonis]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium acetosum (9344387742).jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Paucisignata'' section ''Ciconium'': ''[[Pelargonium acetosum|P.&nbsp;acetosum]]'']]\n[[File:Pelargonium tricolor hh.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Campylia'': ''[[Pelargonium tricolor|P.&nbsp;tricolor]]'']]\n[[Image:Pelargonium crithmifolium3.jpg|thumb|upright|Subgenus ''Pelargonium'' section ''Otidia'': ''[[Pelargonium crithmifolium|P.&nbsp;crithmifolium]]'']]\n\nThus R\u00f6schenbleck ''et al.''

In 1916 the American botanist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858\u20131954) introduced two new terms for zonal and regal pelargoniums.

Regal pelargoniums (''Pelargonium'' \u00d7 ''domesticum'' <small>Bailey</small>) ====\n[[File:Pelargonium karl offenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|'Karl Offenstein' (Regal)]]\nThese are large bush-type [[floriferous]] evergreen pelargoniums. In addition to \"Regals\" they are also known as \u201cShow Pelargoniums\u201d. In the United States they are often known as the \"Martha Washington\" or \u2018\"Lady Washington\" pelargoniums. They are grown primarily for the beauty and richness of their flower heads, which are large. Most of those cultivars grown currently are the result of hybridization over the last 50 years. They are very short-jointed and compact, which results in their requiring very little work in order to create a floriforous and well-rounded plant.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepags.org.uk/about-us/pelargonium-basics Pelargonium Basics]}} Flowers are single, rarely double, in mauve, pink, purple or white. They have rounded, sometimes lobed or partially toothed (serrated) leaves, unlike the Zonal groups, without any type of zoning.\n\nAdditional descriptive terms include;{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}\n\n* Fancy Leaf \u2014leaves with marked variations in colour \n* Decorative Pelargoniums (Decoratives) \u2014 descendants of older, less compact, smaller-flowered varieties that are more suited to outdoor conditions. These have smaller flowers than Regal, but are otherwise similar. ''e.g.'' \u2018Royal Ascot\u2019\n* Miniature \u2014 flowers and leaves similar to Regal, but miniature in form, with compact growth. Other terms include \u201cPansy Geraniums\u201d or \u201cPansy Pelargoniums\u201d. ''e.g.'' \u2018Lara Susan\u2019\n* Oriental pelargoniums \u2014 the result of crosses between Regals and members of the Angel group (see below). Some have bicolour foliage.\n\n==== D. Angel pelargoniums (derived from ''Pelargonium crispum'') ====\n[[File:Angeleyes Randy.jpg|thumb|upright|'Angeleyes Randy' (Angel)]]\nAngel pelargoniums are similar to Regal pelargoniums but more closely resemble ''[[Pelargonium crispum|P. crispum]]'' in leaf shape and growth habit. The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between ''P. crispum'' and a Regal variety in the early part of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with ''P. crispum'' in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called \"pansy-faced\" in the US. Some varieties have bicolour foliage. Other terms include \u2018Langley-Smith Hybrids\u2019.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}\n\n==== E. Unique pelargoniums (derived from ''Pelargonium fulgidum'') ====\n[[Image:Pelargonium White Unique.jpg|thumb|upright|'White Unique' (Unique)]]\nUnique in sense of not fitting into any of the above categories. The parentage of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from ''P. fulgidum'', but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique\u2019, also known as or \u2018Rollinson\u2019s Crimson\u2019, in the mid-19th century is also claimed.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}} Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have bicolour foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, as a result of this cross, are much more floriferous.\n\n; Cultivar:\n* Fiery-flowered Stork's-bill, Scarlet Unique Scented Geranium (''P.'' \u00d7 ''ignescens''){{sfn|Sweet|1822|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/182545#page/25/mode/1up ''Pelargonium ignescens'']}} - a ''P. fulgidum'' hybrid<ref>{{cite web |last=Cornett |first=Peggy |date=2013 |url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/pelargonium-fulgidum-hybrid-scarlet-unique-geranium |title=Pelargonium fulgidum hybrid - Scarlet Unique Geranium |website=Monticello.org |publisher=Thomas Jefferson Encyclopedia |accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== F. Scented-leaved pelargoniums ====\n[[Image:Pelargonium graveolens 2.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium graveolens]]'' (Scented leaf)]]\nShrubby evergreen perennials grown chiefly for their fragrance, may be species or cultivars but all must have a clear and distinct scented foliage. Scent is emitted when the leaves are touched or bruised with some scents aromatic, others pungent and in a few cases, quite unpleasant. Several of the scented leaved pelargoniums are grown for the oil [[geraniol]], which is extracted from the leaves and is an essential oil much used commercially in perfumery. The scent of some species growing in their natural habitat, acts as a deterrent to grazing animals who appear to dislike the emitted scent. Conversely, it also attracts other insect life to visit the bloom and pollinate the plant. The scented leaves can be used for potpourri and they also have a use as flavourings in cooking. Occasionally scented types can be found in some of the other groups mentioned; for example, the Angels, having ''P. crispum'' in their genetic makeup, can often have a strong citrus scent. Leaves are lobed, toothed, incised or variegated. Growth habit is very variable, but the flowers are less prominent than other groups, and most closely resemble the species they originated from.{{sfn|PAGS|2015|loc=[http://thepelargoniumregister.com/horticulture-symbols-and-terms/ Horticultural symbols and terms]}}\n\nThese include:\n[[Image:Fair Ellen.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]'' 'Fair Ellen' (Scented leaf)]]\n[[Image:Pelargonium ionidiflorum 1.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Pelargonium ionidiflorum]]'' (Scented leaf)]]\n* Almond - ''[[Pelargonium quercifolium]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium odoratissimum]]''\n* Apple - ''[[Pelargonium cordifolium]]''\n* Apple/Mint - ''[[Pelargonium album]]''\n* Apricot/Lemon - ''Pelargonium scabrum''\n* Balsam - ''Pelargonium panduriforme''\n* Camphor - ''Pelargonium betulinum'' \n* Celery - ''Pelargonium ionidiflorum''\n* Cinnamon - ''Pelargonium 'Ardwyck Cinnamon'''\n* Coconut - ''[[Pelargonium grossalarioides]]'' (''Pelargonium parriflorum'')\n* Eau de Cologne - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliantine'''\n* Eucalyptus - ''Pelargonium 'Secret Love'''\n* Grapefruit - ''Pelargonium 'Poquita'''\n* Ginger - ''Pelargonium 'Torrento''' or 'Cola Bottles' which is a variety of ''Pelargonium'' x ''nervosum'' \n* Hazelnut - ''Pelargonium 'Odorata Hazelnut''\n* Lavender - ''Pelargonium 'Lavender Lindy'''\n* Lemon - ''[[Pelargonium crispum]]''\n* Lemon - ''Pelargonium citronellum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Mabel Grey')\n* Lemon Balm - ''Pelargonium x melissinum''\n* Lime - ''Pelargonium x nervosum''\n* Myrrh - ''Pelargonium myrrhifolium''\n* Nutmeg - ''[[Pelargonium x fragrans]]'' \n* Old Spice - ''Variety of Pelargonium x fragrans''\n* Orange - ''Pelargonium x citriodorum'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium'' 'Prince of Orange')\n* Peach - ''Pelargonium 'Peaches and Cream'''\n* Peppermint - ''[[Pelargonium tomentosum]]''\n* Pine - ''Pelargonium denticulatum'' \n* Pineapple - ''Pelargonium 'Brilliant'''\n* Raspberry - ''Pelargonium 'Red Raspberry'''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium graveolens]]'' (Synonym - ''Pelargonium roseum'')\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium capitatum]]''\n* Rose - ''[[Pelargonium radens]]''\n* Southernwood - ''Pelargonium abrotanifolium''\n* Spicy - ''[[Pelargonium exstipulatum]]''\n* Strawberry - ''Pelargonium x scarboroviae''\n\n; Cultivars:\n* 'Attar of Roses' - a cultivar of ''P. capitatum''\n* 'Crowfoot Rose' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Dr. Livingston' - a cultivar of ''P. radens''\n* 'Grey Lady Plymouth' - a cultivar of ''P. graveolens''\n* 'Prince Rupert' - a cultivar of ''P. crispum''\n\n==== G. Species pelargoniums ====\nThe species are the forefathers of all the cultivar groups listed above. In general, the definition of a species is that it breeds true, and is to be found doing this in the \"wild\". Species pelargoniums have a large diversity of characteristics in habit, shape, size and colour, which probably accounts for them having retained their popularity for more than 300 years.\n\n==== H. Primary hybrids ====\nA primary hybrid is recognised as being the resultant plant from a first-time cross between two different known species. Examples are ''P.'' \u00d7 ''ardens'' \u2013 from ''P. lobatum'' \u00d7 ''P. fulgidum'' (1810). ''P.'' \u00d7 ''glauciifolium'' \u2013 from ''P. gibbosum'' \u00d7 ''P. lobatum'' (1822).

The Republicans gained open Democratic-held seats in [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], and [[Arkansas]], and defeated incumbent [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] in [[Illinois]]. The only Republican losses were [[Tom Corbett]] of [[Pennsylvania]], who lost to Democrat [[Tom Wolf (politician)|Tom Wolf]], and [[Sean Parnell]] of [[Alaska]], who lost to independent [[Bill Walker (American politician)|Bill Walker]]. This marked the first time since 1846 that an incumbent governor running for re-election in Pennsylvania lost. Democratic Governor [[Neil Abercrombie]] of [[Hawaii]] was defeated in the primary, but the general election was won by a Democrat.\n\nAll totaled, the Republicans had a net gain of two seats (giving them 31 total), the Democrats had a net loss of three seats (leaving them with 18 total), and an independent picked up one seat. Due to no candidate receiving 50% of the vote, the [[Vermont General Assembly]] cast their votes for governor in January 2015, re-electing Governor [[Peter Shumlin]].\n\nAs a result of these races, Republican [[Terry Branstad]] was re-elected to his sixth full 4-year term as governor of [[Iowa]], and thus became the longest-serving governor in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ketv.com/politics/branstad-elected-to-6th-term-as-iowa-governor/29536150|title=Branstad elected to 6th term as Iowa governor|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014|publisher=KETV Omaha}}</ref>\n\n==Race summary==\n\n===States===\nData from ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/results/governor|title=2014 gubernatorial elections|work=NY Times}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The second value is the *net* number of predictions *one* step or more away from the median plus 10, where positive is Republican. The third value is the *net* number *two* steps or more away plus 10, the fourth *three* steps or more, etc, up to the seventh which is *six* steps away. This is necessary to get good sorting behaviour, so that where predictions agree or disagree symmetrically they're moved towards the middle and where they disagree in a particular direction they're moved in that direction. Example: (Tossup, Safe R, Lean D, Likely D, Likely D) -> {{sort|099 10 11 11 11 11 11|Lean D}}. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!

The Republicans gained open Democratic-held seats in [[Massachusetts]], [[Maryland]], and [[Arkansas]], and defeated incumbent [[Pat Quinn (politician)|Pat Quinn]] in [[Illinois]]. The only Republican losses were [[Tom Corbett]] of [[Pennsylvania]], who lost to Democrat [[Tom Wolf (politician)|Tom Wolf]], and [[Sean Parnell]] of [[Alaska]], who lost to independent [[Bill Walker (American politician)|Bill Walker]]. This marked the first time since 1846 that an incumbent governor running for re-election in Pennsylvania lost. Democratic Governor [[Neil Abercrombie]] of [[Hawaii]] was defeated in the primary, but the general election was won by a Democrat.\n\nAll totaled, the Republicans had a net gain of two seats (giving them 31 total), the Democrats had a net loss of three seats (leaving them with 18 total), and an independent picked up one seat. Due to no candidate receiving 50% of the vote, the [[Vermont General Assembly]] cast their votes for governor in January 2015, re-electing Governor [[Peter Shumlin]].\n\nAs a result of these races, Republican [[Terry Branstad]] was re-elected to his sixth full 4-year term as governor of [[Iowa]], and thus became the longest-serving governor in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ketv.com/politics/branstad-elected-to-6th-term-as-iowa-governor/29536150|title=Branstad elected to 6th term as Iowa governor|date=November 4, 2014|accessdate=November 6, 2014|publisher=KETV Omaha}}</ref>\n\n==Race summary==\n\n===States===\nData from ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/results/governor|title=2014 gubernatorial elections|work=NY Times}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The second value is the *net* number of predictions *one* step or more away from the median plus 10, where positive is Republican. The third value is the *net* number *two* steps or more away plus 10, the fourth *three* steps or more, etc, up to the seventh which is *six* steps away. This is necessary to get good sorting behaviour, so that where predictions agree or disagree symmetrically they're moved towards the middle and where they disagree in a particular direction they're moved in that direction. Example: (Tossup, Safe R, Lean D, Likely D, Likely D) -> {{sort|099 10 11 11 11 11 11|Lean D}}. -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n!

As he realized France needed professional reliable troops for ongoing and future conflicts, units were raised by issuing \"ordonnances\" to govern their length of service, composition and payment. These [[Compagnies d'ordonnance]] formed the core of the [[Gendarme (historical)|French Gendarmes] that dominated european battlefields in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. They were stationed throughout France and summoned into larger armies when needed. There were also provisions made for \"Francs-archers\" (units of bowmen) as well as foot soldiers raised from the non-noble classes but these units were disbanded at the end of the [[Hundred Years' War]].<ref>Trevor N. Dupuy, ''Harper Encyclopedia of Military History'' (1993)</ref>\n\nThe bulk of the infantry for warfare was still provided by urban or provincial militias, raised from an area or city to fight locally and named for their recruiting grounds. Gradually these units became more permanent, and in 1480s Swiss instructors were recruited and some of the 'Bandes' (Militia) were combined to form temporary 'Legions' of up to 9000 men. These men would be paid and contracted and receive training.\n\n[[Henry II of France|Henry II]] further regularised the French army by forming standing Infantry regiments to replace the Militia structure. The first of these\u2014the R\u00e9giments de Picardie, Pi\u00e9mont, Navarre and Champagne\u2014were called ''Les Vieux Corps'' (The Old Corps). It was normal policy to disband regiments after a war was over as a cost saving measure with the ''Vieux Corps'' and the King's own Household Troops the [[Maison militaire du roi de France|''Maison du Roi'']] being the only survivors.\n\n====Hungary====\nThe [[Black Army of Hungary|Black Army]], established in 1462 by Hungarian King, [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias Hunyadi]] was the first Central/Eastern European standing army.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Fekete Sereg (The Black Army)|last=P\u00e1l|first=F\u00f6ldi|publisher=Cseng\u0151kert Kiad\u00f3|year=2015|isbn=9786155476839|location=Budapest, Hungary|pages=2\u2013208}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\nThe [[Spanish Empire]] [[tercios]] were the first Spanish standing units composed of professional soldiers. Their [[pike and shot]] composition assured predominace in the European battlefields from the 16th century to the first half of the 17th century. Although other powers adopted the tercio formation, their armies fell short of the fearsome reputation of the Spanish, whose core of professional soldiers gave them an edge that was hard for other states to match.<ref>Lynch, John.

It relied on militia organized by local officials, private forces mobilized by the nobility and hired mercenaries from Europe. This changed during the [[English Civil War]], when Cromwell formed his [[New Model Army]] of 50,000 men. This professional body of soldiers proved more effective than untrained militia, and enabled him to exert control over the country. The army was disbanded by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] following the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] of the Monarchy in 1660, and the Cromwellian model was initially considered a failure due to various logistical and political problems with the force.<ref>Lord Macaulay ''The History of England from the accession of James the Second'' (C.H.

This weakened the incentive for local officials to draw up their own fighting forces, and King Charles II subsequently assembled four regiments of infantry and cavalry, calling them his guards, at a cost of \u00a3122,000 paid out of his regular budget. This became the foundation of the permanent British Army. By 1685 it had grown to 7,500 soldiers in marching regiments, and 1,400 men permanently stationed in garrisons.  The [[Monmouth Rebellion]] in 1685 provided James II with a pretext to increase the size of the force to 20,000 men, and there were 37,000 in 1688, when England played a role in the closing stage of the Franco-Dutch War. In 1689, William III expanded the army to 74,000, and then to 94,000 in 1694.\n\nNervous at the power such a large force afforded the king whilst under his personal command, Parliament reduced the cadre to 7,000 in 1697.  Scotland and Ireland had theoretically separate military establishments, but they were ''de facto'' merged with the English force.
