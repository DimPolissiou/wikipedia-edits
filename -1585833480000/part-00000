When reconstituted with water, [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] (specifically ethanol) in powder form becomes an [[alcoholic drink]]. In March 2015 four product labels for specific powdered alcohol products were approved by the United States Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) which opened the doors for legal product sales.  However, as of January 4, 2016, the product is not yet available for sale and legalization remains controversial due to public-health and other concerns.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.nabca.org/assets/Docs/Research/PowderedAlcoholPaper.pdf|title = Powdered Alcohol:  An Encapsulation|date = |accessdate = January 4, 2016|website = NABCA Research|publisher = National Alcohol Beverage Control Association|last = |first = }}</ref>  Researchers have expressed concern that, should the product go into production, increases in alcohol misuse, abuse, and associated physical harm to its consumers could occur above what has been historically associated with liquid alcohol alone.\n\n==History==\n\n===Invention===\nIn {{release date|df=yes|1966}} Sato Foods Industries Co., Ltd. invented alcohol pulverization.

Test sales began in 1977 under the trade name \"SureShot\".<ref name=\"news of SureShot-1977&1978\"/><ref name=\"news search=powdered alcohol powder\"/>  The product \"Palcohol\" was announced for future release in the U.S. in 2015.\n\n===Customer base===\nOfficially, Sato says that its products are for business use only, for example for the use of food-processing industries or food-and-drink businesses (e.g. restaurant, caf\u00e9, [[confectionery store|sweets shop]], [[bakery|bakery shop]], etc.). Mainly, its products are to be used as food additives. Other than purposes for test sale, research, etc., it has never been sold for eating or drinking, including personal use or home use.<ref name=\"daily SPA!-20140424\"/><ref name=\"PR booklet #7 of NRIB\"/>\n\nIn June 1982, Sato started production and sales for the drinking powdered alcohol, as test case.

Excessive consumption of alcohol can result in acute overdose, intoxication-related accidental injury, compromised judgment, and longer-term negative health consequences including liver disease, cancer, and physiologic dependence.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/ |title = Liquid Alcohol and Public Health |date = |accessdate = January 4, 2016 |website = |publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Consideration for retailers ==\nAs with the public health concerns, the following concerns have been posed but data are not yet available to prove or disprove them.  Because of the unique characteristics of powdered alcohol, introduction in the U.S. could raise significant concerns from alcohol retailers as it will raise the awareness of their customers health and well as a major priority. including such as restaurants, bars, and sporting venues,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Powdered Alcohol Products: New Challenge in an Era of Needed Regulation.|last = Naimi|first = Timothy S|date = July 14, 2015|journal = JAMA|doi = 10.1001/jama.2015.6450 |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Mosher|first2 = James F.|issue = 314(2)|pages = 119\u2013120}}</ref> including:\n* Availability of powdered alcohol could negatively affect retailers' economic interests as customers might now have the ability to purchase less relatively expensive and safer alcohol from those businesses by augmenting their purchased liquid alcohol drinks with cheaper powdered alcohol mixtures purchased elsewhere.\n* Use of powdered alcohol by customers could increase responsibility of these businesses' by increasing the accuracy and abilities to monitor their customers' alcohol consumption - which they are legally required to do to try to prevent the consumption of alcohol by intoxicated or under-age customers.  This could hold them at a greater responsibility out of concern of civil-liability lawsuits (because retailers are held liable for alcohol-attributable harms caused by customers who should not have been served alcohol).\n\n==Production process==\n[[File:Spray Dryer.gif|thumb|right|188px|Schematic illustration of spray drying process.<br /><big>{{Color|#000033|'''&rarr;'''}}</big>:air ({{Color|#CC0033|'''in'''}}={{Color|#CC0033|'''hot'''}}, {{Color|#808080|'''out'''}}={{Color|#808080|'''cool'''}})<br />{{Color|#FFFFFF|'}}{{Color|#FF9900|<big>'''&bull;'''</big>}}{{Color|#FFFFFF|'}}:{{Color|#FF9900|'''sprayed mixture'''}}]]\n[[File:Circle-red.svg|thumb|right|188px|Simplified sectional view of a micro-capsule.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1986\"/><br />{{Color|#000000|'''Black'''}}={{Color|#000000|'''dextrin film'''}}<br />{{Color|#FF0000|'''Red'''}}{{Color|#FFFFFF|--}}={{Color|#FF0000|'''alcohol mixture'''}}]]\nPowdered alcohol is made by a process called [[micro-encapsulation]].\n\nAn auxiliary material for a capsule may be any readily water-soluble substance (e.g. [[carbohydrate]] such as [[dextrin]]s ([[starch]] [[hydrolyzate]]), [[protein]] such as [[gelatin]]). For powdered alcohol, [[maltodextrin]] (a type of dextrin) was chosen.\n\nFor the process to encapsulate, a method called [[spray drying]] was selected.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1982\"/><ref name=\"SprayDry, different from spray dry\"/>\n\nIn this process, a [[mixture]] of dextrin and alcohol is subjected to simultaneous spraying and heating. The spraying converts the liquid to small drops (up to several hundred [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] (micrometers) in diameter), and the heat causes the hydrous dextrin to form a film. When the film dries, the drop becomes a microcapsule containing alcohol and dextrin.\n\nBefore and after drying, comparing the amounts of water and alcohol, about 90% of water is removed and about 10% of ethyl alcohol is lost.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1986\"/> One of the reasons which are considered, is the following.\n\nIn mixtures such as this, the speed of molecule movement is dependent on molecule size and [[carbohydrate]] (in this case, maltodextrin) concentration. Water, the smallest molecule in the mixture, is able to move and evaporate fastest. In higher concentration, by decreasing water, water molecules can move much faster. After the film formed it is less permeable to larger molecules than water. By the time the film is completed, water has evaporated enough. This phenomenon is called \"'''selective diffusion.'''\"<ref name=\"MENTING & HOOGSTAD-196901\"/>\n\nIn general, after sprayed, encapsulation for each drop is completed within about 0.1 second from the very beginning of the process. There is no time for the internal convection in each drop or capsule to occur.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1986\"/>\n\nUltimately, large amounts of microcapsules have been produced. These become the powdery matter called powdered alcohol or alcohol powder. According to Sato's web page, powdered alcohol contains 30.5% ethyl alcohol by volume in the state of powder.<ref name=\"sato-foods.co.jp-powdered alcohol-En\"/>\n\nIn addition to the mixture before drying, if necessary, other additives (e.g. extract, sweetener, spices, coloring matter, etc.) may be added.\n\nAs a result, alcohol powder can be said  to be an alcoholic beverage that is \"''dry''\".\nFor example, a \"dry [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]\" made from alcohol powder may be referred to as a \"''dry'' dry martini\" or \"''dried'' dry martini\".<ref name=\"news of SureShot-1977&1978\"/>\n\nIn the production of alcoholic powder production, other drying methods are not used. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nFor drying foods, there are other methods.<ref name=\"amanofoods.co.jp-techno-En\"/>\n\nTypically, when considering the quality of a powdered product such as [[instant coffee|coffee]], [[freeze drying]] seems to be better than spray drying, but this does not apply to alcohol powder production.  In fact, \"''freeze-dried beer spice''\" was made by university students for their research. [[Carbon dioxide]], water and alcohol have all been lost.<ref name=\"purdue.edu-20020520\"/>\n\nDue to the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of alcohol, relatively higher than water, time-consuming methods, such as freeze drying, should not be used. By selective diffusion, loss of alcohol is relatively small.\n\n===Non-commercial production===\nIn 2014, an article on the website PopSci.com published instructions on how to make pulverized alcohol easily, through a simple mixture of alcohol and dextrin.<ref name=\"popsci.com-20140422\"/>\n\nIn this method, the powder is not encapsulated, and also not yet fully dried.  Consequently, alcohol continues to evaporate from it very rapidly.\n\nDue to flaws in the powdered alcohol produced by this method, this form of powdered alcohol was said to be unsuitable for drinking, carrying, or preserving.\n\nAny production of powdered alcohol without a license is illegal in Japan, even if it is only for personal use, according to the Liquor Tax Act of Japan.\n\n==Market==\n\n===Sale in Japan===\nCurrently, the alcoholic beverage industry in Japan is large and powerful.{{fact|date=October 2019}}{{opinion|date=October 2019}} For example, in fiscal year 2013,  [[Suntory]], one of the country's largest beverage companies, recorded sales of 570.7 billion [[yen]] (about US$4.7 billion) in alcoholic beverages, excluding wine<ref name=\"suntory.co.jp-report2014-Ja\"/>  Currently, the sales revenue from powdered alcohol has been too small to affect the sales of liquid-alcohol companies.  Additionally, powdered alcohol's market share is currently too small to be considered as a statistical item in Japanese tax reports.<ref name=\"nta.go.jp-stat-Ja\"/>\n\nPowdered alcohol is found in some mass production foods, used in small amounts (as are other additives).\n\n===Promotion in the United States===\nIn 1977, the [[Associated Press]] delivered the first news story in the United States about powdered alcohol, which was then an unprecedented product.  Investors were quoted as saying that they \"hope[d] to revolutionize the liquor business with a product that's easy to carry, cheap and potent\".  A test sale of powdered alcohol, called \"SureShot\", was done in the United States.<ref name=\"news of SureShot-1977&1978\"/><ref name=\"news search=powdered alcohol powder\"/><ref name=\"Reading Eagle-19810312\"/>\n\n== Chemical properties ==\nAccording to [[food chemistry|food chemist]] Udo Pollmer of the European Institute of Food and Nutrition Sciences in [[Munich]], alcohol can be absorbed in [[cyclodextrin]]s, a synthetic carbohydrate [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]. In this way, encapsuled in small capsules, the fluid can be handled as a powder. The cyclodextrins can absorb an estimated 60 percent of their own weight in alcohol.<ref>[http://www.wz-newsline.de/sro.php?redid=67450 Alcohol powder: Alcopops from a bag] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000016/http://www.wz-newsline.de/sro.php?redid=67450 |date=27 September 2007 }}, Westdeutsche Zeitung, 28 October 2004 (German)</ref> A US [[food patent|patent]] was registered for the process as early as 1974.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=laQwAAAAEBAJ&dq Preparation of an Alcohol Containing Powder], General Foods Corporation 31 March 1972</ref>\n\n[[Image:Cyclodextrin.svg|thumb|center|700px|<center>Chemical structure of the three main types of cyclodextrins</center>]]\n\n==Routes of administration==\n* Reconstituted: Alcohol powder can be added to water to make an alcoholic beverage.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.iflscience.com/chemistry/powdered-alcohol-coming-us|title=Powdered Alcohol Coming to the US|work=IFLScience|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n* Nebulizer: Alcohol powder produced through molecular encapsulation with [[cyclodextrin]] can be used with a [[nebulizer]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Le | first1 = V.

In the production of powdered alcohol some non-alcoholic ingredients are added which is similar to some liqueurs.  Nonetheless, powdered alcohol became a separate category of alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn May 1981, Sato received the first license to produce alcohol powder commercially. In Japan, powdered alcohol is officially called, {{nihongo|'''funmatsu-shu'''|[[:ja:\u7c89\u672b\u9152]]||lit.

When put into commercial production, it was expected to sell for \u20ac1.50 (approx. [[United States dollar|US$]]1.60) for a 20&nbsp;gram sachet.\n\nThe product's creators and marketers \u2013 Harm van Elderen, Martyn van Nierop, and others at Helicon Vocational Institute in [[Boxtel]] \u2013 claimed to be aiming at the youth market.  They compared the drink to alcopops like [[Bacardi Breezer]] and said they expected the relatively low alcohol content would be popular with the young segment.\n\nBecause of complexities in Dutch laws, powdered alcohol like Booz2Go would not be subject to the Alcohol and [[Horeca]] Code, because it is not literally an alcoholic drink.  This means that anybody of any age could buy it legally.  However, when dissolved in water, it would be subject to the Code, according to Director Wim van Dalen of the Dutch National Foundation for Alcohol Prevention.  Von Dalen commented that while he generally did not support new alcoholic drinks, he doubted the powder would become attractive. A spokesman of the [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport]] said they would not undertake any actions against the product, but added that the label would have to contain a warning about any health risks for the consumer, in accordance with other laws.<ref>[http://www.parool.nl/nieuws/2007/MEI/25/bin3.html Students make alcohol powder], [[Het Parool]], 25 May 2007 (Dutch)</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Booz2go is not yet commercially available.<ref name=\"Smithsonian.com-20140507\"/>\n\n===Russia===\nRussia had plans to ban powdered alcohol in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2866535|title=\u0412 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0442 \"\u0441\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\"|date=1 December 2015|publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442|accessdate=2015-12-01}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one Russian news site, in 2009, a Professor at [[List of higher education and academic institutions in Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg Technological University]] named Yevgeny Moskalev invented and patented a method of creating alcohol powder.

In this method, melted wax ([[stearic acid]]) is stirred, and the alcoholic drink is poured in.  The solution dissipates and becomes drops containing alcohol and wax.  The drops that solidify constitute alcohol powder.\n\nIt was proposed that Moskalev's powdered alcohol could be wrapped in paper and carried around in a pocket or a bag.  In addition, a pill form, containing alcohol, was also made with this method.\n\nProfessor Moskalev responded: \"powdered vodka tastes like a candle\"; \"I did not like vodka in pills\"; and, in conclusion, \"vodka is best consumed the old way\".\n\n===United States===\n\nIn 2008, Pulver Spirits began developing a line of alcohol powder products to be marketed in the United States.

Test sales began in 1977 under the trade name \"SureShot\".<ref name=\"news of SureShot-1977&1978\"/><ref name=\"news search=powdered alcohol powder\"/>  The product \"Palcohol\" was announced for future release in the U.S. in 2015.\n\n===Customer base===\nOfficially, Sato says that its products are for business use only, for example for the use of food-processing industries or food-and-drink businesses (e.g. restaurant, caf\u00e9, [[confectionery store|sweets shop]], [[bakery|bakery shop]], etc.). Mainly, its products are to be used as food additives. Other than purposes for test sale, research, etc., it has never been sold for eating or drinking, including personal use or home use.<ref name=\"daily SPA!-20140424\"/><ref name=\"PR booklet #7 of NRIB\"/>\n\nIn June 1982, Sato started production and sales for the drinking powdered alcohol, as test case.

Excessive consumption of alcohol can result in acute overdose, intoxication-related accidental injury, compromised judgment, and longer-term negative health consequences including liver disease, cancer, and physiologic dependence.<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/ |title = Liquid Alcohol and Public Health |date = |accessdate = January 4, 2016 |website = |publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Consideration for retailers ==\nAs with the public health concerns, the following concerns have been posed but data are not yet available to prove or disprove them.  Because of the unique characteristics of powdered alcohol, introduction in the U.S. could raise significant concerns from alcohol retailers as it will raise the awareness of their customers health and well as a major priority. including such as restaurants, bars, and sporting venues,<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Powdered Alcohol Products: New Challenge in an Era of Needed Regulation.|last = Naimi|first = Timothy S|date = July 14, 2015|journal = JAMA|doi = 10.1001/jama.2015.6450 |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Mosher|first2 = James F.|issue = 314(2)|pages = 119\u2013120}}</ref> including:\n* Availability of powdered alcohol could negatively affect retailers' economic interests as customers might now have the ability to purchase less relatively expensive and safer alcohol from those businesses by augmenting their purchased liquid alcohol drinks with cheaper powdered alcohol mixtures purchased elsewhere.\n* Use of powdered alcohol by customers could increase responsibility of these businesses' by increasing the accuracy and abilities to monitor their customers' alcohol consumption - which they are legally required to do to try to prevent the consumption of alcohol by intoxicated or under-age customers.  This could hold them at a greater responsibility out of concern of civil-liability lawsuits (because retailers are held liable for alcohol-attributable harms caused by customers who should not have been served alcohol).\n\n==Production process==\n[[File:Spray Dryer.gif|thumb|right|188px|Schematic illustration of spray drying process.<br /><big>{{Color|#000033|'''&rarr;'''}}</big>:air ({{Color|#CC0033|'''in'''}}={{Color|#CC0033|'''hot'''}}, {{Color|#808080|'''out'''}}={{Color|#808080|'''cool'''}})<br />{{Color|#FFFFFF|'}}{{Color|#FF9900|<big>'''&bull;'''</big>}}{{Color|#FFFFFF|'}}:{{Color|#FF9900|'''sprayed mixture'''}}]]\n[[File:Circle-red.svg|thumb|right|188px|Simplified sectional view of a micro-capsule.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1986\"/><br />{{Color|#000000|'''Black'''}}={{Color|#000000|'''dextrin film'''}}<br />{{Color|#FF0000|'''Red'''}}{{Color|#FFFFFF|--}}={{Color|#FF0000|'''alcohol mixture'''}}]]\nPowdered alcohol is made by a process called [[micro-encapsulation]].\n\nAn auxiliary material for a capsule may be any readily water-soluble substance (e.g. [[carbohydrate]] such as [[dextrin]]s ([[starch]] [[hydrolyzate]]), [[protein]] such as [[gelatin]]). For powdered alcohol, [[maltodextrin]] (a type of dextrin) was chosen.\n\nFor the process to encapsulate, a method called [[spray drying]] was selected.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1982\"/><ref name=\"SprayDry, different from spray dry\"/>\n\nIn this process, a [[mixture]] of dextrin and alcohol is subjected to simultaneous spraying and heating. The spraying converts the liquid to small drops (up to several hundred [[micrometre|\u03bcm]] (micrometers) in diameter), and the heat causes the hydrous dextrin to form a film. When the film dries, the drop becomes a microcapsule containing alcohol and dextrin.\n\nBefore and after drying, comparing the amounts of water and alcohol, about 90% of water is removed and about 10% of ethyl alcohol is lost.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1986\"/> One of the reasons which are considered, is the following.\n\nIn mixtures such as this, the speed of molecule movement is dependent on molecule size and [[carbohydrate]] (in this case, maltodextrin) concentration. Water, the smallest molecule in the mixture, is able to move and evaporate fastest. In higher concentration, by decreasing water, water molecules can move much faster. After the film formed it is less permeable to larger molecules than water. By the time the film is completed, water has evaporated enough. This phenomenon is called \"'''selective diffusion.'''\"<ref name=\"MENTING & HOOGSTAD-196901\"/>\n\nIn general, after sprayed, encapsulation for each drop is completed within about 0.1 second from the very beginning of the process. There is no time for the internal convection in each drop or capsule to occur.<ref name=\"thesis-Sato-1986\"/>\n\nUltimately, large amounts of microcapsules have been produced. These become the powdery matter called powdered alcohol or alcohol powder. According to Sato's web page, powdered alcohol contains 30.5% ethyl alcohol by volume in the state of powder.<ref name=\"sato-foods.co.jp-powdered alcohol-En\"/>\n\nIn addition to the mixture before drying, if necessary, other additives (e.g. extract, sweetener, spices, coloring matter, etc.) may be added.\n\nAs a result, alcohol powder can be said  to be an alcoholic beverage that is \"''dry''\".\nFor example, a \"dry [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]]\" made from alcohol powder may be referred to as a \"''dry'' dry martini\" or \"''dried'' dry martini\".<ref name=\"news of SureShot-1977&1978\"/>\n\nIn the production of alcoholic powder production, other drying methods are not used. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nFor drying foods, there are other methods.<ref name=\"amanofoods.co.jp-techno-En\"/>\n\nTypically, when considering the quality of a powdered product such as [[instant coffee|coffee]], [[freeze drying]] seems to be better than spray drying, but this does not apply to alcohol powder production.  In fact, \"''freeze-dried beer spice''\" was made by university students for their research. [[Carbon dioxide]], water and alcohol have all been lost.<ref name=\"purdue.edu-20020520\"/>\n\nDue to the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] of alcohol, relatively higher than water, time-consuming methods, such as freeze drying, should not be used. By selective diffusion, loss of alcohol is relatively small.\n\n===Non-commercial production===\nIn 2014, an article on the website PopSci.com published instructions on how to make pulverized alcohol easily, through a simple mixture of alcohol and dextrin.<ref name=\"popsci.com-20140422\"/>\n\nIn this method, the powder is not encapsulated, and also not yet fully dried.  Consequently, alcohol continues to evaporate from it very rapidly.\n\nDue to flaws in the powdered alcohol produced by this method, this form of powdered alcohol was said to be unsuitable for drinking, carrying, or preserving.\n\nAny production of powdered alcohol without a license is illegal in Japan, even if it is only for personal use, according to the Liquor Tax Act of Japan.\n\n==Market==\n\n===Sale in Japan===\nCurrently, the alcoholic beverage industry in Japan is large and powerful.{{fact|date=October 2019}}{{opinion|date=October 2019}} For example, in fiscal year 2013,  [[Suntory]], one of the country's largest beverage companies, recorded sales of 570.7 billion [[yen]] (about US$4.7 billion) in alcoholic beverages, excluding wine<ref name=\"suntory.co.jp-report2014-Ja\"/>  Currently, the sales revenue from powdered alcohol has been too small to affect the sales of liquid-alcohol companies.  Additionally, powdered alcohol's market share is currently too small to be considered as a statistical item in Japanese tax reports.<ref name=\"nta.go.jp-stat-Ja\"/>\n\nPowdered alcohol is found in some mass production foods, used in small amounts (as are other additives).\n\n===Promotion in the United States===\nIn 1977, the [[Associated Press]] delivered the first news story in the United States about powdered alcohol, which was then an unprecedented product.  Investors were quoted as saying that they \"hope[d] to revolutionize the liquor business with a product that's easy to carry, cheap and potent\".  A test sale of powdered alcohol, called \"SureShot\", was done in the United States.<ref name=\"news of SureShot-1977&1978\"/><ref name=\"news search=powdered alcohol powder\"/><ref name=\"Reading Eagle-19810312\"/>\n\n== Chemical properties ==\nAccording to [[food chemistry|food chemist]] Udo Pollmer of the European Institute of Food and Nutrition Sciences in [[Munich]], alcohol can be absorbed in [[cyclodextrin]]s, a synthetic carbohydrate [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]]. In this way, encapsuled in small capsules, the fluid can be handled as a powder.

In the production of powdered alcohol some non-alcoholic ingredients are added which is similar to some liqueurs.  Nonetheless, powdered alcohol became a separate category of alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn May 1981, Sato received the first license to produce alcohol powder commercially. In Japan, powdered alcohol is officially called, {{nihongo|'''funmatsu-shu'''|[[:ja:\u7c89\u672b\u9152]]||lit.

When put into commercial production, it was expected to sell for \u20ac1.50 (approx. [[United States dollar|US$]]1.60) for a 20&nbsp;gram sachet.\n\nThe product's creators and marketers \u2013 Harm van Elderen, Martyn van Nierop, and others at Helicon Vocational Institute in [[Boxtel]] \u2013 claimed to be aiming at the youth market.  They compared the drink to alcopops like [[Bacardi Breezer]] and said they expected the relatively low alcohol content would be popular with the young segment.\n\nBecause of complexities in Dutch laws, powdered alcohol like Booz2Go would not be subject to the Alcohol and [[Horeca]] Code, because it is not literally an alcoholic drink.  This means that anybody of any age could buy it legally.  However, when dissolved in water, it would be subject to the Code, according to Director Wim van Dalen of the Dutch National Foundation for Alcohol Prevention.  Von Dalen commented that while he generally did not support new alcoholic drinks, he doubted the powder would become attractive. A spokesman of the [[Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Netherlands)|Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport]] said they would not undertake any actions against the product, but added that the label would have to contain a warning about any health risks for the consumer, in accordance with other laws.<ref>[http://www.parool.nl/nieuws/2007/MEI/25/bin3.html Students make alcohol powder], [[Het Parool]], 25 May 2007 (Dutch)</ref>\n\nIn 2014, Booz2go is not yet commercially available.<ref name=\"Smithsonian.com-20140507\"/>\n\n===Russia===\nRussia had plans to ban powdered alcohol in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2866535|title=\u0412 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044f\u0442 \"\u0441\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043b\u044c\"|date=1 December 2015|publisher=\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442|accessdate=2015-12-01}}</ref>\n\nAccording to one Russian news site, in 2009, a Professor at [[List of higher education and academic institutions in Saint Petersburg|Saint Petersburg Technological University]] named Yevgeny Moskalev invented and patented a method of creating alcohol powder.

K. Betha and Mason Betha. He grew up with two brothers and three sisters, including his twin sister, Stason, born a few minutes after him. The father left the family when Mase was just three years old. In 1982 his mother moved herself and her children to [[Harlem, New York]], where Mase spent the majority of his childhood. During his early teenage years, Betha began getting into trouble on the streets of Harlem, and when he was 13 his mother sent him back to Jacksonville to live with relatives. While living in Jacksonville, Betha first began attending church. After returning to live in Harlem at age 15, Betha began showing promise as a basketball player, becoming the leading point guard for his team at [[Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics|Manhattan Center]] high school during the 1993 season, where he played alongside Cameron Giles, who went on to be the rapper known as [[Cam'ron]]. He had hopes of joining the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), but was unable to make it into a Division I College due to his poor academic scores. He attended [[State University of New York at Purchase]], where he grew to realize he was unlikely to make the NBA and instead began focusing more on writing music, producing demo tapes and regularly performing at local nightclubs. Betha eventually dropped out of college and focused on his music career full time.<ref name=Revelations/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mase-mn0000386234/biography|title=Mase - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1993-97: Children of the Corn and Bad Boy record deal===\nAfter Betha returned to [[Harlem]], he and his childhood friend [[Cam'ron]] began rapping as a hobby under the names '''Murda Mase''' and Killa Cam, briefly forming a group known as the [[Children of the Corn (group)|Children of the Corn]] (\"corn\" short for \"corner\") with fellow Harlem rappers [[Big L]], [[McGruff (rapper)|Herb McGruff]] and Bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bleek |first=Don |title=Picture Me Dope: Harlem's Rap Group 'Children Of The Corn' |website=Donbleek.com |url=http://www.donbleek.com/2011/03/12/picture-me-dope-harlems-rap-group-children-of-the-corn/ |date=March 12, 2011|accessdate=February 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226192649/http://www.donbleek.com/2011/03/12/picture-me-dope-harlems-rap-group-children-of-the-corn/ |archivedate=February 26, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/forum/topics/street-struck-the-big-l|title=STREET STRUCK \"THE BIG L\" DOCUMENTARY IS COMING SOONER THAN YOU THINK|website=Thisis50.com|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Damon Dash]], a fellow Manhattan Center student, was the group's manager for a while.

He claimed he was \"leading people, friends, kids and others down a path to hell\", stating that he left to find God in his heart and follow him.<ref name=\"tmz.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2014/07/21/mase-church-phoenix-shut-down-rap/|title=Mase -- Losing My Religion ...

The same year, Mase enrolled as a freshman at [[Clark Atlanta University]], a historically black college, and began taking classes on August 19. Unlike other freshmen, Mase was permitted to live off campus and commute, but he is said to have downplayed his past as a rapper and stayed fairly low-key while on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mtv.com/news/gallery/m/mase990830.html|title=Mase Pursues Bachelor's Degree At Clark Atlanta|date=October 12, 1999|website=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 18, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012020718/http://mtv.com/news/gallery/m/mase990830.html|archivedate=October 12, 1999}}</ref>\n\n===2004: Return to music===\nAfter a five-year hiatus from music, during which he became an [[ordained minister]], Mase made his return to music with [[Welcome Back (Mase album)|''Welcome Back'']]<ref name=\"tmz.com\"/> in summer 2004. Before the album's release, Mase was featured on [[Nelly]]'s \"In My Life\" as well as the remix to [[Fat Joe]]'s \"[[Lean Back]]\".\n\n''Welcome Back'' was accompanied by [[Welcome Back (Mase song)|a single of the same name]]<ref name=\"tmz.com\"/> and was released on August 24, 2004, through Bad Boy Records and distributed by [[Universal Music Group]]. It debuted at #4 in the US, selling 188,000 copies in its first week of release, and eventually went gold, selling 559,000 copies in the United States. The album portrayed Mase's new Christian lifestyle and \"cleaner\" image. Mase dubbed himself \"a Bad Boy gone clean\" on the lead single, also titled \"Welcome Back\". This new approach had a mixed reception. Although the album was not as big a commercial success as ''Harlem World'', the singles \"Welcome Back\" and \"[[Breathe, Stretch, Shake]]\" received moderate radio airplay and video play on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] and MTV, with the latter single reaching #28 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Both singles were also certified gold by the [[RIAA]].\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Mase spent time touring and recording with New York hip-hop group [[G-Unit]], and became a mainstay of [[50 Cent]]'s public image during that time, appearing with him on magazine covers, on stage, and in music videos. He has since said that working with the group was not something he regrets, but that the message he was sending was a mistake. He joined G-Unit to appeal to a different audience so they could see that they could change just as he did, thinking that \"in order to get people where I'm at, I have to go back to where I once was\". Under G-Unit, he released ''Crucified 4 The Hood: 10 Years of Hate'', a mixtape from the [[DJ Whoo Kid]] series, but an official album was never released.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===2009: Second comeback===\nFollowing the formula that worked for him years earlier, Mase has begun to appear on R&B artists' remixes. In early June 2009, he was featured on the last verse of \"Uptown Boy\" by Harry O, signed to [[The Inc. Records]], which also features [[Ron Browz]]. Weeks later, Mase appeared on a street remix for [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s \"[[Best I Ever Had (Drake song)|Best I Ever Had]]\". Mase stated that [[Michael Jackson]]'s death influenced him to make a comeback. He appeared on [[WWPR-FM|Power 105.1]] to discuss his comeback with \"The Prince of New York\" DJ Self. Mase used that radio show as his outlet to release new music throughout the rest of the summer, with a new song or feature premiere every Friday on DJ Self's show.\n\nThe first new track featuring Mase was released on July 10, featuring the first verse on \"Get It,\" which was produced by Big Ran and also featured [[Cam'ron]]. Mase released the Ron Browz produced \"Thinkin' 'Bout You\" on July 17, then followed that up by adding a verse to the street remix of [[Teairra Mar\u00ed]] and [[Kanye West]]'s \"Diamonds\", on July 24. Mase used the last Friday in July to \"Shut the City Down,\" which was the title of his second solo release since his comeback began. The song primarily discusses the rapper's legacy and makes reference to the ways in which rap, as a business, has changed since his heyday. He also makes reference to his new [[Batman]]-esque logo, and hints at himself as hip-hop's superhero. Mase released the song \"Radio\" on August 21 as a prelude to his upcoming mixtape \"I Bleed Money.\" On September 11, Mase was one of the featured artists who appeared on the remix to [[Ron Browz]]'s \"Gimme 20 Dollars.\" This was the third time since his comeback that he worked with Browz and his first collaboration with Jim Jones since their falling out years before.\n\nIn October 2009, Mase made an impromptu appearance on a live radio interview with [[Diddy-Dirty Money]] on [[V-103]]. He told the studio staff he brought documentation that would release him from the Bad Boy label and gave the forms to Diddy during the interview. Diddy signed the forms and announced \"[Mase] has the freedom to go do whatever he wants to do.\"<ref name=\"Forms\">{{cite web|title=Mase Asks Diddy To Release Him From Bad Boy |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.9989/title.mase-asks-diddy-to-release-him-from-bad-boy |website= HipHopDX |last= Harling| first= Danielle |date=October 19, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ar6bhAZz?url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.9989/title.mase-asks-diddy-to-release-him-from-bad-boy |archivedate=September 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 21, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was later revealed the forms did not end Mase's contractual obligations to the record label, but rather allowed him to appear on songs with artists from different labels.<ref name=\"Forms\" />\n\n===2010\u2013present: ''Now We Even''===\nIn 2010, [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] offered Mase a one-year release from Bad Boy Records to settle all their differences, with which Mase decided to retire from rap for good although he was to be re-signed to Bad Boy after the year was up. On April 17, 2012, Spiff TV Films \u2013 a production company best known for videos made for [[Rick Ross]]'s [[Maybach Music Group]] releases \u2013 tweeted a photo of Mase, Ross and [[French Montana]], as well as singer [[Omarion]] and producer [[Rico Love]], together in the studio. The picture sparked speculation that Mase would be making his third return to music since his announced retirement to become a pastor in April 1999 and leaving again in 2007. A week after the photo appeared, [[Funkmaster Flex|DJ Funkmaster Flex]] debuted a remix of [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]'s \"Slight Work\" on radio show.\n\nSpeaking during an on-air call following the remix's debut, Mase didn't address rumors about him possibly signing with Warner Brothers imprint [[Maybach Music Group]], rather revealing that Bad Boy artist [[French Montana]] was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. Mase is served as an [[A&R]] representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, ''[[Excuse My French (album)|Excuse My French]]'', as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's \"Everything's a Go\". \"I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make,\" Montana says, \"[but] I would love to see him in my camp.\" In September 2012, Mase appeared on Kanye West's album ''[[Cruel Summer (GOOD Music album)|Cruel Summer]]'', on the track \"Higher\" with [[The-Dream]], [[Pusha T]], and [[Cocaine 80s]].\n\nIn December 2012, Mase announced that he was no longer signed to Bad Boy Records, saying he would not likely sign with a major label anytime soon.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vasquez |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22192/title.mae-leaves-bad-boy-explains-why-g-unit-deal-was-blocked-by-diddy |title=Ma$e Leaves Bad Boy, Explains Why G-Unit Deal Was Blocked By Diddy &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215211421/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22192/title.mae-leaves-bad-boy-explains-why-g-unit-deal-was-blocked-by-diddy |archive-date=December 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He told MTV the only two labels he would consider signing with were Kanye West's [[GOOD Music]] or [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]'s [[OVO Sound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2012/12/mae-says-beef-with-jay-z-was-over-a-girl-recalls-almost-fighting-dame-video/|title=Ma$e Says Beef With Jay-Z Was Over A Woman, Recalls Almost Fighting Dame Dash [Video]|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=December 15, 2012|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=C.

K. Betha and Mason Betha. He grew up with two brothers and three sisters, including his twin sister, Stason, born a few minutes after him. The father left the family when Mase was just three years old. In 1982 his mother moved herself and her children to [[Harlem, New York]], where Mase spent the majority of his childhood. During his early teenage years, Betha began getting into trouble on the streets of Harlem, and when he was 13 his mother sent him back to Jacksonville to live with relatives. While living in Jacksonville, Betha first began attending church. After returning to live in Harlem at age 15, Betha began showing promise as a basketball player, becoming the leading point guard for his team at [[Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics|Manhattan Center]] high school during the 1993 season, where he played alongside Cameron Giles, who went on to be the rapper known as [[Cam'ron]]. He had hopes of joining the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), but was unable to make it into a Division I College due to his poor academic scores. He attended [[State University of New York at Purchase]], where he grew to realize he was unlikely to make the NBA and instead began focusing more on writing music, producing demo tapes and regularly performing at local nightclubs. Betha eventually dropped out of college and focused on his music career full time.<ref name=Revelations/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mase-mn0000386234/biography|title=Mase - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|accessdate=May 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1993-97: Children of the Corn and Bad Boy record deal===\nAfter Betha returned to [[Harlem]], he and his childhood friend [[Cam'ron]] began rapping as a hobby under the names '''Murda Mase''' and Killa Cam, briefly forming a group known as the [[Children of the Corn (group)|Children of the Corn]] (\"corn\" short for \"corner\") with fellow Harlem rappers [[Big L]], [[McGruff (rapper)|Herb McGruff]] and Bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bleek |first=Don |title=Picture Me Dope: Harlem's Rap Group 'Children Of The Corn' |website=Donbleek.com |url=http://www.donbleek.com/2011/03/12/picture-me-dope-harlems-rap-group-children-of-the-corn/ |date=March 12, 2011|accessdate=February 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226192649/http://www.donbleek.com/2011/03/12/picture-me-dope-harlems-rap-group-children-of-the-corn/ |archivedate=February 26, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisis50.com/forum/topics/street-struck-the-big-l|title=STREET STRUCK \"THE BIG L\" DOCUMENTARY IS COMING SOONER THAN YOU THINK|website=Thisis50.com|accessdate=December 18, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Damon Dash]], a fellow Manhattan Center student, was the group's manager for a while.

Unlike other freshmen, Mase was permitted to live off campus and commute, but he is said to have downplayed his past as a rapper and stayed fairly low-key while on campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mtv.com/news/gallery/m/mase990830.html|title=Mase Pursues Bachelor's Degree At Clark Atlanta|date=October 12, 1999|website=[[MTV]]|accessdate=December 18, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991012020718/http://mtv.com/news/gallery/m/mase990830.html|archivedate=October 12, 1999}}</ref>\n\n===2004: Return to music===\nAfter a five-year hiatus from music, during which he became an [[ordained minister]], Mase made his return to music with [[Welcome Back (Mase album)|''Welcome Back'']]<ref name=\"tmz.com\"/> in summer 2004. Before the album's release, Mase was featured on [[Nelly]]'s \"In My Life\" as well as the remix to [[Fat Joe]]'s \"[[Lean Back]]\".\n\n''Welcome Back'' was accompanied by [[Welcome Back (Mase song)|a single of the same name]]<ref name=\"tmz.com\"/> and was released on August 24, 2004, through Bad Boy Records and distributed by [[Universal Music Group]]. It debuted at #4 in the US, selling 188,000 copies in its first week of release, and eventually went gold, selling 559,000 copies in the United States. The album portrayed Mase's new Christian lifestyle and \"cleaner\" image. Mase dubbed himself \"a Bad Boy gone clean\" on the lead single, also titled \"Welcome Back\". This new approach had a mixed reception. Although the album was not as big a commercial success as ''Harlem World'', the singles \"Welcome Back\" and \"[[Breathe, Stretch, Shake]]\" received moderate radio airplay and video play on [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] and MTV, with the latter single reaching #28 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Both singles were also certified gold by the [[RIAA]].\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Mase spent time touring and recording with New York hip-hop group [[G-Unit]], and became a mainstay of [[50 Cent]]'s public image during that time, appearing with him on magazine covers, on stage, and in music videos. He has since said that working with the group was not something he regrets, but that the message he was sending was a mistake. He joined G-Unit to appeal to a different audience so they could see that they could change just as he did, thinking that \"in order to get people where I'm at, I have to go back to where I once was\". Under G-Unit, he released ''Crucified 4 The Hood: 10 Years of Hate'', a mixtape from the [[DJ Whoo Kid]] series, but an official album was never released.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===2009: Second comeback===\nFollowing the formula that worked for him years earlier, Mase has begun to appear on R&B artists' remixes. In early June 2009, he was featured on the last verse of \"Uptown Boy\" by Harry O, signed to [[The Inc. Records]], which also features [[Ron Browz]]. Weeks later, Mase appeared on a street remix for [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]]'s \"[[Best I Ever Had (Drake song)|Best I Ever Had]]\". Mase stated that [[Michael Jackson]]'s death influenced him to make a comeback. He appeared on [[WWPR-FM|Power 105.1]] to discuss his comeback with \"The Prince of New York\" DJ Self. Mase used that radio show as his outlet to release new music throughout the rest of the summer, with a new song or feature premiere every Friday on DJ Self's show.\n\nThe first new track featuring Mase was released on July 10, featuring the first verse on \"Get It,\" which was produced by Big Ran and also featured [[Cam'ron]]. Mase released the Ron Browz produced \"Thinkin' 'Bout You\" on July 17, then followed that up by adding a verse to the street remix of [[Teairra Mar\u00ed]] and [[Kanye West]]'s \"Diamonds\", on July 24. Mase used the last Friday in July to \"Shut the City Down,\" which was the title of his second solo release since his comeback began. The song primarily discusses the rapper's legacy and makes reference to the ways in which rap, as a business, has changed since his heyday. He also makes reference to his new [[Batman]]-esque logo, and hints at himself as hip-hop's superhero. Mase released the song \"Radio\" on August 21 as a prelude to his upcoming mixtape \"I Bleed Money.\" On September 11, Mase was one of the featured artists who appeared on the remix to [[Ron Browz]]'s \"Gimme 20 Dollars.\" This was the third time since his comeback that he worked with Browz and his first collaboration with Jim Jones since their falling out years before.\n\nIn October 2009, Mase made an impromptu appearance on a live radio interview with [[Diddy-Dirty Money]] on [[V-103]]. He told the studio staff he brought documentation that would release him from the Bad Boy label and gave the forms to Diddy during the interview. Diddy signed the forms and announced \"[Mase] has the freedom to go do whatever he wants to do.\"<ref name=\"Forms\">{{cite web|title=Mase Asks Diddy To Release Him From Bad Boy |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.9989/title.mase-asks-diddy-to-release-him-from-bad-boy |website= HipHopDX |last= Harling| first= Danielle |date=October 19, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ar6bhAZz?url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.9989/title.mase-asks-diddy-to-release-him-from-bad-boy |archivedate=September 22, 2012 |accessdate=September 21, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was later revealed the forms did not end Mase's contractual obligations to the record label, but rather allowed him to appear on songs with artists from different labels.<ref name=\"Forms\" />\n\n===2010\u2013present: ''Now We Even''===\nIn 2010, [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] offered Mase a one-year release from Bad Boy Records to settle all their differences, with which Mase decided to retire from rap for good although he was to be re-signed to Bad Boy after the year was up. On April 17, 2012, Spiff TV Films \u2013 a production company best known for videos made for [[Rick Ross]]'s [[Maybach Music Group]] releases \u2013 tweeted a photo of Mase, Ross and [[French Montana]], as well as singer [[Omarion]] and producer [[Rico Love]], together in the studio. The picture sparked speculation that Mase would be making his third return to music since his announced retirement to become a pastor in April 1999 and leaving again in 2007. A week after the photo appeared, [[Funkmaster Flex|DJ Funkmaster Flex]] debuted a remix of [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]'s \"Slight Work\" on radio show.\n\nSpeaking during an on-air call following the remix's debut, Mase didn't address rumors about him possibly signing with Warner Brothers imprint [[Maybach Music Group]], rather revealing that Bad Boy artist [[French Montana]] was the reason Mase was making his third comeback. Mase is served as an [[A&R]] representative on Montana's forthcoming Bad Boy debut, ''[[Excuse My French (album)|Excuse My French]]'', as well as appearing on the remix of Montana's \"Everything's a Go\". \"I'm not sure what kind of decisions he's going to make,\" Montana says, \"[but] I would love to see him in my camp.\" In September 2012, Mase appeared on Kanye West's album ''[[Cruel Summer (GOOD Music album)|Cruel Summer]]'', on the track \"Higher\" with [[The-Dream]], [[Pusha T]], and [[Cocaine 80s]].\n\nIn December 2012, Mase announced that he was no longer signed to Bad Boy Records, saying he would not likely sign with a major label anytime soon.<ref>{{cite web |last=Vasquez |first=Andres |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22192/title.mae-leaves-bad-boy-explains-why-g-unit-deal-was-blocked-by-diddy |title=Ma$e Leaves Bad Boy, Explains Why G-Unit Deal Was Blocked By Diddy &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215211421/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.22192/title.mae-leaves-bad-boy-explains-why-g-unit-deal-was-blocked-by-diddy |archive-date=December 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He told MTV the only two labels he would consider signing with were Kanye West's [[GOOD Music]] or [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]'s [[OVO Sound]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2012/12/mae-says-beef-with-jay-z-was-over-a-girl-recalls-almost-fighting-dame-video/|title=Ma$e Says Beef With Jay-Z Was Over A Woman, Recalls Almost Fighting Dame Dash [Video]|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=December 15, 2012|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=C.

He was twice [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] (1935&ndash;1940, 1951&ndash;1955).\n\nThe son of a London [[solicitor]], Attlee was born into a middle-class family. After attending private schools and the [[University of Oxford]], he practised as a [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister]]. The volunteer work he carried out in [[East End of London|London's East End]] exposed him to poverty and his political views shifted leftwards thereafter. He joined the [[Independent Labour Party]], gave up his legal career, and began lecturing at the [[London School of Economics]]. His work was interrupted by service as an officer in the [[First World War]]. In 1919, he became mayor of [[Stepney]] and in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] was elected [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)|Limehouse]]. Attlee served in the [[First MacDonald ministry|first Labour minority government]] led by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924, and then joined the Cabinet during [[Second MacDonald ministry|MacDonald's second minority]] (1929\u20131931). After retaining his seat in Labour's landslide defeat of [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], he became the party's [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader]]. [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|Elected Leader of the Labour Party]] in 1935, and at first advocating [[pacificism]] and opposing [[British re-armament|re-armament]], he became a critic of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement]] of [[Hitler]] and [[Mussolini]] in the lead-up to the [[Second World War]]. Attlee took Labour into the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition government]] in 1940 and served under [[Winston Churchill]], initially as [[Lord Privy Seal]] and then as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] from 1942.{{refn|group=note|Attlee worked backstage to handle much of the detail and organisational work in Parliament, as Churchill took centre stage with his attention on diplomacy, military policy and broader issues.}}\n\nAfter the end of the war, the coalition was dissolved and Attlee led Labour to a landslide victory at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]],{{refn|group=note|The 12% [[Swing (United Kingdom)|national swing]] from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] to Labour remains the largest achieved by any party at a British general election.}} forming the [[Attlee ministry|first Labour majority government]]. His government's [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian approach to economic management]] aimed to maintain [[full employment]], a [[mixed economy]] and a greatly enlarged system of social services provided by the state. To this end, it undertook the [[nationalisation]] of public utilities and major industries, and implemented wide-ranging social reforms, including the passing of the [[National Insurance Act 1946]] and [[National Assistance Act 1948|National Assistance Act]], the foundation of the [[National Health Service]] (1948) and the enlargement of public subsidies for [[council house]] building. His government also reformed [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] legislation, working practices and children's services; it created the [[National parks of England and Wales|National Parks]] system, passed the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and established the [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|town and country planning system]]. \n\nIn foreign policy, Attlee delegated to [[Ernest Bevin]], but oversaw the [[partition of India]] (1947), the independence of Burma and Ceylon, and the dissolution of the British mandates of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]. He and Bevin encouraged the United States to take a vigorous role in the [[Cold War (1947\u20131953)|Cold War]]; unable to afford military intervention in Greece, he called on Washington to counter Communists there, establishing the [[Truman Doctrine]].<ref>Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' (1983) ch 8</ref> He supported the [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild Western Europe with American money and, in 1949, promoted the [[NATO]] military alliance against the [[Soviet bloc]]. <!--He used 13,000 troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the London dock strike in 1949.--> After leading Labour to a narrow victory at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], he sent British troops to fight in the [[Korean War]].{{refn|group=note|Attlee sent British troops to fight in the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948) and the [[Royal Air Force]] to participate in the [[Berlin Airlift]], and commissioned an [[independent nuclear deterrent]] for the UK.}}\n\nAttlee had inherited a country close to bankruptcy after the Second World War and beset by food, housing and resource shortages; despite his social reforms and economic programme, these problems persisted throughout his premiership, alongside recurrent currency crises and dependence on US aid. His party was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives in the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], despite winning the most votes. He continued as Labour leader but retired after losing the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 election]] and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]]; after a long retirement, he died in 1967. In public, he was modest and unassuming, but behind the scenes his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity and pragmatism proved decisive. Often rated as one of the [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|greatest British prime ministers]], Attlee's reputation among scholars has grown, thanks to his creation of the modern [[welfare state]] and involvement in building the coalition against [[Stalin]] in the Cold War. He remains the longest-serving Labour leader in British history.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAttlee was born on 3 January 1883 in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]] (now part of London), into a [[middle-class]] family, the seventh of eight children. His father was Henry Attlee (1841\u20131908), a [[solicitor]], and his mother was Ellen Bravery Watson (1847\u20131920), daughter of Thomas Simons Watson, secretary for the [[Art Union of London]].<ref>Davies, Edward J. \"The Ancestry of Clement Attlee\", ''Genealogists' Magazine'', 31(2013\u201315): 380\u201387.</ref> He was educated at Northaw School, a boys' preparatory school near [[Pluckley]] in [[Kent]]; [[Haileybury College]]; and [[University College, Oxford]], where in 1904 he graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification|second-class honours]] in [[modern history]].\n\nAttlee then trained as a [[barrister]] at the [[Inner Temple]] and was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in March 1906. He worked for a time at his father's law firm Druces and Attlee but did not enjoy the work, and had no particular ambition to succeed in the legal profession.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||p=17}} He also played football for [[non-League football|non-League]] club [[Fleet Town F.C.|Fleet]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11566133/Why-football-can-be-a-dangerous-game-for-politicians.html Why football can be a dangerous game for politicians] Daily Telegraph, 27 April 2015</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1906, he became a volunteer at Haileybury House, a charitable club for [[working-class]] boys in [[Stepney]] in the [[East End of London]] run by his old school, and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the club's manager. Until then, his political views had been more [[conservative]]. However, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the [[slum]] children, he came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and [[income redistribution]] by the state would have any serious effect. This sparked a process that caused him to convert to [[socialism]]. He subsequently joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) in 1908 and became active in local politics. In 1909, he stood unsuccessfully at his first election, as an ILP candidate for Stepney Borough Council.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=18\u201335}}\n\nHe also worked briefly as a secretary for [[Beatrice Webb]] in 1909, before becoming a secretary for [[Toynbee Hall]]. In 1911, he was employed by the [[UK Government]] as an \"official explainer\"\u2014touring the country to explain [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s [[National Insurance Act]]. He spent the summer of that year touring [[Essex]] and [[Somerset]] on a bicycle, explaining the act at public meetings. A year later, he became a [[lecturer]] at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=34\u201343}}\n\n==Military service during the First World War==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914, Attlee applied to join the [[British Army]]. Initially his application was turned down, as at the age of 31 he was seen as being too old; however, he was finally allowed to join in September, and was commissioned<ref>''London Gazette'' issue 28985, published 24 November 1914. Page 5</ref> in the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] with the 6th (Service) Battalion, [[South Lancashire Regiment]], part of the [[38th Brigade (United Kingdom)|38th Brigade]] of the [[13th (Western) Division]], and was sent to fight in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]]. His decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother Tom, who, as a [[conscientious objector]], spent much of the war in prison.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=43\u201345, 52}}\n\nAfter a period fighting in Gallipoli, he collapsed after falling ill with [[dysentery]] and was put on a ship bound for [[England]] to recover. When he woke up he wanted to get back to action as soon as possible, and asked to be let off the ship in [[Malta]] where he stayed in hospital to recover. His hospitalisation coincided with the [[Battle of Sari Bair]], which saw a large number of his comrades killed. Upon returning to action, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the [[Gallipoli Campaign#Evacuation|evacuation of Suvla]]. As such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from [[Landing at Suvla Bay|Suvla Bay]], the last being General [[Stanley Maude]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=47\u201350}}\n[[File:Attlee, 1916 IWM (crop).png|thumb|left|Attlee (seen in the centre) in 1916, aged 33, whilst serving in Mesopotamia.]]\nThe Gallipoli Campaign had been engineered by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]]. Although it was unsuccessful, Attlee believed that it was a bold strategy, which could have been a success if it had been better implemented on the ground. This gave him an admiration for Churchill as a military strategist, which would make their working relationship in later years productive.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|p=46}}\n\nHe later served in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]] in what is now [[Iraq]], where in April 1916 he was badly wounded, being hit in the leg by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] while storming an enemy trench during the Battle of Hanna. He was sent firstly to [[British India|India]], and then back to the UK to recover. In February 1917, he was promoted to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]],<ref>''London Gazette Issue 30425'', published 11 December 1917<!-- page(s) needed --></ref> leading him to be known as \"Major Attlee\" for much of the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]]. He would spend most of 1917 training soldiers at various locations in England.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=50\u201351}} From 2 to 9 July 1917, he was the temporary commanding officer (CO) of the newly formed L (later 10th) Battalion, the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]] at Bovington Camp, [[Dorset]]. From 9 July, he assumed command of 30th Company of the same battalion; however, he did not deploy to France with it in December 1917.<ref>''The National Archive WO 95/101 War History of 10th Battalion, Tank Corps'', pp. 1\u20132.<!--publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nAfter fully recovering from his injuries, he was sent to France in June 1918 to serve on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the final months of the war. After being discharged from the Army in January 1919, he returned to [[Stepney]], and returned to his old job lecturing part-time at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Marriage and children==\nAttlee met [[Violet Attlee|Violet Millar]] while on a long trip with friends to Italy in 1921.

During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle [[slum]] [[landlord]]s who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, reducing the infant mortality rate, and took action to find work for returning unemployed ex-servicemen.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, ''The Social Worker'', which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:<blockquote>In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways \u2013 they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/socialworker00attliala ''The Social Worker Attlee'' (pg. 30)], archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.</ref></blockquote>\n\nand went on to say at page 75:<blockquote>Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. A right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipient's character, and terminable at his caprice.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/socialworker00attliala ''The Social Worker Attlee'' (pg. 75)], archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1921, [[George Lansbury]], the Labour mayor of the neighbouring borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar|Poplar]], and future Labour Party leader, launched the [[Poplar Rates Rebellion]]; a campaign of disobedience seeking to equalise the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. Attlee, who was a personal friend of Lansbury, strongly supported this. However, [[Herbert Morrison]], the Labour mayor of nearby [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], and one of the main figures in the [[London Labour Party]], strongly denounced Lansbury and the rebellion. During this period, Attlee developed a lifelong dislike of Morrison.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||p=122}}<ref name=\"Attlee\">Howell, David.

At the time, he admired [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and helped him get elected as Labour Party leader at the [[1922 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|1922 leadership election]]. He served as MacDonald's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] for the brief 1922 parliament. His first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the short-lived [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]], led by MacDonald.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nAttlee opposed the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]], believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. However, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike, he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee (although not against the Conservative members who had also supported this). The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay \u00a3300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=80\u201382}}\n\nIn 1927, he was appointed a member of the multi-party [[Simon Commission]], a [[royal commission]] set up to examine the possibility of granting [[Self-governance|self-rule]] to [[British Raj|India]]. Due to the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise MacDonald made to Attlee to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the [[Second Labour Government]], which entered office after the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=83\u201391}} Attlee's service on the Commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to India and many of its political leaders. By 1933 he argued that British rule was alien to India and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for India's progress. He became the British leader most sympathetic to Indian independence (as a dominion), preparing him for his role in deciding on independence in 1947.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brasted Howard, Bridge Carl | year = 1988 | title = The British Labour Party and Indian Nationalism, 1907-1947 | url = | journal = South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 69\u201399 | doi=10.1080/00856408808723113}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1930, Labour MP [[Oswald Mosley]] left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem, and Attlee was given Mosley's post of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. In March 1931, he became [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], a post he held for five months until August, when the [[History of the British Labour Party#Great Depression and the split under MacDonald|Labour government fell]], after failing to agree on how to tackle the financial crisis of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=96\u201399}} That month MacDonald and a few of his allies formed a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], leading them to be expelled from Labour. MacDonald offered Attlee a job in the National Government, but he turned down the offer and opted to stay loyal to the main Labour party.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nAfter Ramsay MacDonald formed the National Government, Labour was deeply divided. Attlee had long been close to MacDonald and now felt betrayed\u2014as did most Labour politicians. During the course of the second Labour government, Attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with MacDonald, whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent, and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography. He would write:<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/PRmacdonald.htm Contains excerpt from Attlee's biography towards the bottom of the page]; accessed 26 July 2017.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In the old days I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine presence and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the [[First World War]] seemed to mark him as a man of character. Despite his mishandling of the [[Zinoviev letter|Red Letter]] episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.</blockquote>\n\n==1930s opposition==\n\n===Deputy Leader===\nThe [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] held later that year was a disaster for the Labour Party, which lost over 200 seats, returning only 52 MPs to Parliament. The vast majority of the party's senior figures, including the Leader [[Arthur Henderson|Arthur]] Henderson, lost their seats. Attlee, however, narrowly retained his Limehouse seat, with his majority being slashed from 7,288 to just 551. He was one of only three Labour MPs who had experience of government to retain their seats, along with [[George Lansbury]] and [[Stafford Cripps]]. Accordingly Lansbury was elected Leader unopposed with Attlee as his deputy.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nMost of the remaining Labour MPs after 1931 were elderly trade union officials who could not contribute much to debates, Lansbury was in his 70s, and Stafford Cripps another main figure of the Labour front bench who had entered Parliament in 1931, was inexperienced. As one of the most capable and experienced of the remaining Labour MPs, Attlee therefore shouldered a lot of the burden of providing an opposition to the National Government in the years 1931\u201335, during this time he had to extend his knowledge of subjects which he had not studied in any depth before, such as finance and foreign affairs in order to provide an effective opposition to the government.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nAttlee effectively served as acting leader for nine months from December 1933, after Lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident, which raised Attlee's public profile considerably. It was during this period, however, that personal financial problems almost forced Attlee to quit politics altogether. His wife had become ill, and at that time there was no separate salary for the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. On the verge of resigning from Parliament, he was persuaded to stay by Stafford Cripps, a wealthy socialist, who agreed to make a donation to party funds to pay him an additional salary until Lansbury could take over again.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nDuring 1932\u201333 Attlee flirted with, and then drew back from radicalism, influenced by Stafford Cripps who was then on the radical wing of the party, he was briefly a member of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], which had been formed by former [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) members, who opposed the ILP's disaffiliation from the main Labour Party in 1932. At one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by Cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act, allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy. He admired [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s strong-armed rule and use of major generals to control England. After looking more closely at Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and even his former colleague Oswald Mosley, leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in Britain, Attlee retreated from his radicalism, and distanced himself from the League, and argued instead that the Labour Party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against [[totalitarianism]] of either the left or right. He always supported the crown, and as Prime Minister was close to King George VI.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Attlee |first=Clement |date=18 February 1952 |title=Tribute from Labor's Attlee to George and the monarchy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA30 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=32 |number=7 |quote=It was my privilege for six years to serve King George as First Minister of the Crown and for five years during the war as Deputy Prime Minister.

Lansbury had strongly opposed the policy, and felt unable to continue leading the party. Taking advantage of the disarray in the Labour Party, the Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] announced on 19 October that a general election would be held on 14 November. With no time for a leadership contest, the party agreed that Attlee should serve as interim leader, on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=116\u2013117}} Attlee therefore led Labour through the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 election]], which saw the party stage a partial comeback from its disastrous 1931 performance, winning 38 per cent of the vote, the highest share Labour had won up to that point, and gaining over one hundred seats.{{sfn|Thomas-Symonds|2012|pp=68\u201370}}\n\nAttlee stood in the subsequent [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]], held soon after, where he was opposed by [[Herbert Morrison]], who had just re-entered parliament in the recent election, and [[Arthur Greenwood]]: Morrison was seen as the favourite, but was distrusted by many sections of the party, especially the left-wing. Arthur Greenwood meanwhile was a popular figure in the party; however, his leadership bid was severely hampered by his [[Alcoholism|alcohol problem]]. Attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure, particularly having already led the party through a general election. He went on to come first in both the first and second ballots, formally being elected Leader of the Labour Party on 3 December 1935.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=121\u2013130}}\n\nThroughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the Labour Party's official policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and [[collective security]] under the [[League of Nations]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Rhiannon Vickers |title=The Labour Party and the World, Volume 1: The Evolution of Labour's Foreign Policy, 1900\u201351 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XbLCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |page=92 |isbn=9781847791313}}</ref> At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, \"We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty.

We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country\".<ref>Talus, ''Your Alternative Government'' (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1945), p. 17.</ref> During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said \"We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system.

Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the [[Soviet Union]], created \"A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1935/may/22/defence-policy|title=Defence Policy|date=22 May 1935|volume=302 cc359-486|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1936, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Neville Chamberlain]], introduced a Budget which increased the amount spent on the armed forces. Attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it, saying:\n{{quote|[The budget] was the natural expression of the character of the present Government. There was hardly any increase allowed for the services which went to build up the life of the people, education and health. Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death. The Chancellor expressed great regret that he should have to spend so much on armaments, but said that it was absolutely necessary and was due only to the actions of other nations. One would think to listen to him that the Government had no responsibility for the state of world affairs. [...] The Government has now resolved to enter upon an arms race, and the people will have to pay for their mistake in believing that it could be trusted to carry out a policy of peace. [...] This is a War Budget. We can look in the future for no advance in Social Legislation. All available resources are to be devoted to armaments.<ref>\"Mr. Attlee on a war budget\", ''The Times'', 23 April 1936, p. 16.</ref>}}\n\nIn June 1936, the Conservative MP [[Duff Cooper]] called for an Anglo-French alliance against possible German aggression and called for all parties to support one. Attlee condemned this: \"We say that any suggestion of an alliance of this kind\u2014an alliance in which one country is bound to another, right or wrong, by some overwhelming necessity\u2014is contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations, is contrary to the Covenant, is contrary to Locarno is contrary to the obligations which this country has undertaken, and is contrary to the professed policy of this Government\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1936/jun/29/mr-duff-cooprrs-speech|title=MR. DUFF COOPER'S SPEECH|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> At the Labour Party conference at Edinburgh in October Attlee reiterated that \"There can be no question of our supporting the Government in its rearmament policy\".<ref>Talus, p. 37.</ref>\n\nHowever, with the rising threat from [[Nazi Germany]], and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, this policy eventually lost credibility. By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose Neville Chamberlain's policy of [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=131\u2013134}}\n\nIn 1938, Attlee opposed the [[Munich Agreement]], in which Chamberlain negotiated with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Sudetenland]]: <blockquote>We all feel relief that war has not come this time. Every one of us has been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt that we are in the midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1938/oct/03/prime-ministers-statement|title=Prime Minister's Statement|volume=339 cc40-162|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|date=3 October 1938|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of 1937, Attlee and a party of three Labour MPs visited Spain and visited the [[British Battalion]] of the [[International Brigades]] fighting in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. One of the companies was named the \"Major Attlee Company\" in his honour.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nIn 1937, Attlee wrote a book entitled ''The Labour Party in Perspective'' that sold fairly well in which he set out some of his views. He argued that there was no point in Labour compromising on its socialist principles in the belief that this would achieve electoral success. He wrote: \"I find that the proposition often reduces itself to this \u2013 that if the Labour Party would drop its socialism and adopt a Liberal platform, many Liberals would be pleased to support it. I have heard it said more than once that if Labour would only drop its policy of [[nationalisation]] everyone would be pleased, and it would soon obtain a majority. I am convinced it would be fatal for the Labour Party.\" He also wrote that there was no point in \"watering down Labour's socialist creed in order to attract new adherents who cannot accept the full socialist faith. On the contrary, I believe that it is only a clear and bold policy that will attract this support\".{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=140\u2013141}} \n\nIn the late 1930s, Attlee sponsored a Jewish mother and her two children, enabling them to leave Germany in 1939 and move to the UK.

Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by [[Winston Churchill]] on 10 May 1940.<ref name=\"Attlee\"/>\n\nAttlee and Churchill quickly agreed that the [[War cabinet#Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] would consist of three Conservatives (initially Churchill, Chamberlain and [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]) and two Labour members (initially himself and [[Arthur Greenwood]]) and that Labour should have slightly more than one third of the posts in the coalition government.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=157\u2013158}} Attlee and Greenwood played a vital role in supporting Churchill during a series of [[May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis|War Cabinet debates]] over whether or not to negotiate peace terms with Hitler following the [[Fall of France]] in May 1940; both supported Churchill and gave him the majority he needed in the War Cabinet to continue Britain's resistance.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=163\u2013164}}<ref name=\"Marr\">Marr, Andrew.

In the [[Churchill war ministry|coalition government]], three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. Churchill chaired the first two, the [[War Cabinet]] and the Defence Committee, with Attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in Parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee himself instituted, and later chaired the third body, the [[Lord President's Committee]], which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs. As Churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men. Attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with Churchill's backing, streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees.

Labour's ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary Conservative Party's defence of individualism, inherited privileges, and income inequality.<ref>Francis, Martin. \"Economics and Ethics: The Nature of Labour's Socialism, 1945\u20131951\", ''Twentieth Century British History'' (1995) 6#2, pp 220\u201343.<!--publisher, ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref> On 5 July 1948, Clement Attlee replied to a letter dated 22 June from [[James Murray (Durham politician)|James Murray]] and ten other MPs who raised concerns about West Indians who arrived on board the {{HMT|Empire Windrush}}.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/attlees-britain/empire-windrush-2/ |title = The National Archives - Homepage}}</ref> As for the prime minister himself, he was not much focused on economic policy, letting others handle the issues.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alec Cairncross|title=Years of Recovery: British Economic Policy 1945\u201351|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UWj_AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA49|year=2013|page=49|isbn=9781136597701}}</ref>\n\n====Health====\n[[File:Trafford General Hospital - geograph.org.uk - 21987.jpg|thumb|[[Trafford General Hospital]], known as the birthplace of the NHS]]\nAttlee's Health Minister, [[Aneurin Bevan]], fought hard against the general disapproval of the medical establishment, including the [[British Medical Association]], by creating the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) in 1948.

The [[Bank of England]] and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946. [[National Coal Board|Coal mining]], the [[British Railways|railways]], road haulage, canals and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]] were nationalised in 1947, and electricity and gas followed in 1948.

By 1951 about 20 per cent of the British economy had been taken into [[public ownership]].<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/>\n\nNationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked.

Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialists relationships in the workplace.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/></blockquote>\n\n====Agriculture====\nThe Attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the [[Agriculture Act 1947]] established a more generous subsidy system for farmers.{{sfn|Morgan|1984}} Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/farming-agriculture-acts.htm|title=The Cabinet Papers &#124; Farming and the Agriculture Acts|publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref><ref>Self, Peter & Herbert J.

This reform was eventually carried out by [[Harold Wilson's]] government. During its time in office, the Attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent, from \u00a36.5&nbsp;billion to \u00a310&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Beech|Lee|2008}}\n\n====Economy====\nThe most significant problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the [[war effort]] had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of her national wealth.{{clarify|date=December 2019}}{{cn|date=December 2019}} Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the [[balance of trade]]. This resulted in strict [[rationing]] of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its financial state.\n\nThe abrupt end of the American [[Lend-Lease]] program in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. Some relief was provided by the [[Anglo-American loan]], negotiated in December 1945. The conditions attached to the loan included making the [[pound sterling|pound]] fully [[convertibility|convertible]] to the US dollar. When this was introduced in July 1947, it led to a [[currency crisis]] and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/> The UK benefited from the American [[Marshall Aid]] program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. Another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Stafford Cripps]], into devaluation of the pound.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/>\n\nDespite these problems, one of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near [[full employment]]. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3 per cent of the total workforce.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/> Labour shortages proved a more frequent problem. The inflation rate was also kept low during his term.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2 per cent during Attlee's time in office, whilst there was no hard-core of long-term unemployed. Both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment, while the average working week was shortened.<ref>Thompson, David. ''England in the Twentieth Century (1914\u201363)''.<!--publisher, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nThe government was less successful in housing, which was the responsibility of [[Aneurin Bevan]]. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the Attlee government's housing policies. Between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.{{sfn|Morgan|1984}}\n\nWhen the Attlee government was voted out of office in 1951, the economy had been improved compared to 1945. The period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards, which increased by about 10 per cent each year. During that same period, the economy grew by 3 per cent a year, and by 1951 the UK had \"the best economic performance in Europe, while output per person was increasing faster than in the United States\".<ref>''Ten Years of New Labour'' (edited by Matt Beech and Simon Lee)<!--publisher, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref> Careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery, and that unemployment stayed at very low levels.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In addition, the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3&nbsp;million to 5&nbsp;million from 1945 to 1951, and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before.{{sfn|Hill|1970}} A Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act was passed in 1948, which allowed for investigations of restrictive practices and monopolies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PX0oAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA210&dq=united+kingdom+Superannuation+(Miscellaneous+Provisions)+Act+1948#v=onepage&q=united%20kingdom%20Superannuation%20(Miscellaneous%20Provisions)%20Act%201948&f=false|title=Pension and Widows' and Orphans' Funds|accessdate=9 January 2016|isbn=9781107621749|last1=Crabbe|first1=R.

The [[Ministry of Fuel and Power|Minister of Fuel and Power]], [[Emanuel Shinwell]] was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks, and soon resigned from his post. The Conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan 'Starve with Strachey and shiver with Shinwell' (referring to the Minister of Food [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Sandbrook, Dominic|url=http://www.jubileeriver.co.uk/100110%20-%20winter%20of%201947.htm|title=Winter of 1947|publisher=Jubileeriver.co.uk|date=9 January 2010|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by [[Hugh Dalton]] to replace Attlee as Prime Minister with [[Ernest Bevin]].

Byrnes]] upon his arrival at National Airport in Washington, 1945]]\n\n====Europe and the Cold War====\n\nIn foreign affairs, the Attlee government was concerned with four main issues; post-war Europe, the onset of the Cold War, the establishment of the United Nations, and decolonisation. The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]]. Attlee also attended the later stages of the [[Potsdam Conference]], where he negotiated with President [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britain's former war-time ally, Stalin and the [[Soviet Union]]. Ernest Bevin was a passionate [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. Bevin's initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary was \"wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile\".{{sfn|Morgan|1984}} Attlee himself sought warm relations with Stalin. He put his trust in the United Nations, rejected notions that the Soviet Union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating Moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. This put Attlee at sword's point with his foreign minister, the Foreign Office, and the military who all saw the Soviets as a growing threat to Britain's role in the Middle East. Suddenly in January 1947, Attlee reversed his position and agreed with Bevin on a hard-line anti-Soviet policy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith Raymond, Zametica John |year=1985 |title=The Cold Warrior: Clement Attlee reconsidered, 1945\u20137 |url= |journal=International Affairs |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=237\u201352 |doi=10.2307/2617482 |jstor=2617482}}</ref>\n\nIn an early \"good-will\" gesture that was later heavily criticised, the Attlee government allowed the Soviets to purchase, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR [[Trade pact|Trade Agreement]], a total of 25 [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] [[jet engine]]s in September 1947 and March 1948. The agreement included an agreement not to use them for military purposes. The price was fixed under a commercial contract; a total of 55 jet engines were sold to the USSR in 1947.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/nov/22/jet-engines-foreign-sales \"Jet Engines (Foreign Sales)\"]. {{ukhansard |house=HC |date=22 November 1948 |vol=458 |cc=839-41}}</ref> However, the [[Cold War]] intensified during this period and the Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Nene and installed their own version in the [[Mikoyan\u2013Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] interceptor.

The Attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful [[NATO]] defence alliance to protect Western Europe against any Soviet expansion.{{sfnm |1a1=Morgan |1y=1984 |1loc=ch.&nbsp;6 |2a1=Thomas-Symonds |2y=2012 |2pp=2\u20134, 127}} In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war Europe, Attlee's Cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American [[Marshall Plan]] for the economic recovery of Europe. He called it, one of the \"most bold, enlightened and good-natured acts in the history of nations\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Field|title=Attlee's Great Contemporaries: The Politics of Character|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5-6BwAAQBAJ&pg=PR38|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury |page=38|isbn=9781441129444}}</ref>\n\nA group of Labour MPs, organised under the banner of \"[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]\" urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of a \"third force\" of European powers to stand between the US and USSR. However, deteriorating relations between Britain and the USSR, as well as Britain's economic reliance on America following the Marshall Plan, steered policy towards supporting the US.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/> In January 1947, fear of both Soviet and American nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the Cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of Britain's independent [[nuclear deterrent]], an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party. Britain's first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after Attlee had left office.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/>\n\nThe London dock strike of July 1949, led by Communists, was suppressed when the Attlee government sent in 13,000 Army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike. His response reveals Attlee's growing concern that Soviet expansionism, supported by the British Communist Party, was a genuine threat to national security, and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by Moscow. He noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances, but to help communist unions who were on strike in Canada. Attlee agreed with MI5 that he faced \"a very present menace\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Deery Phillip | year = 1998 | title = 'A Very Present Menace'?

It kept open consulates in Communist-controlled areas and rejected the Chinese Nationalists' requests that British citizens assist in the defence of Shanghai. By December, the government concluded that although British property in China would likely be nationalised, British traders would benefit in the long run from a stable, industrialising Communist China. Retaining [[Hong Kong]] was especially important; although the Chinese Communists promised to not interfere with its rule, Britain reinforced the [[Hong Kong Garrison]] during 1949. When the victorious Chinese Communists government declared on 1 October 1949 that it would exchange diplomats with any country that ended relations with the Chinese Nationalists, Britain became the first western country to formally recognise the [[People's Republic of China]] in January 1950.<ref name=\"jstor260389\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = David C. | year = 1983 | title = 'To Secure a Convenience': Britain Recognizes China - 1950 | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 299\u2013326 | jstor = 260389\n | format =  | doi=10.1177/002200948301800207}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, a Labour Party delegation including Attlee visited China at the invitation of then Foreign Minister [[Zhou Enlai]].

He set up the [[Cripps Mission]] in 1942, which tried and failed to bring the factions together.

Congress, led by Nehru and Gandhi, demanded immediate independence and full control by Congress of all of India. That demand was rejected by the British, and Congress opposed the war effort with its \"[[Quit India]] campaign\". The Raj immediately responded in 1942 by imprisoning the major national, regional and local Congress leaders for the duration. Attlee did not object.<ref>Herman, ''Gandhi & Churchill'' (2008) p 486-95.</ref> By contrast, the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], and also the Sikh community, strongly supported the war effort. They greatly enlarged their membership and won favour from London for their decision. Attlee retained a fondness for Congress and until 1946, accepted their thesis that they were a non-religious party that accepted Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and everyone else.<ref>Kenneth Harris, ''Attlee'' (1982) pp 362\u201364</ref>\n\n[[File:Partition of India.PNG|thumb|Four nations ([[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Dominion of Ceylon]], and [[Union of Burma]]) that gained independence in 1947 and 1948]]\nThe Muslim league insisted that it was the only true representative of all of the Muslims of India, and by 1946 Attlee had come to agree with them.  With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. Viceroy Wavell said he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. No divisions were available; independence was the only option.<ref>David Chandler, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 331</ref> Given the demands of the Muslim league, independence implied a partition that set off heavily Muslim Pakistan from the main portion of India.<ref>Harris, ''Attlee'' (1982) pp 367\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947.

It had become too troublesome and much too expensive to handle. British policies there were perceived by the [[Zionist]] movement and the Truman Administration as pro-Arab and anti-Jewish. In the face of an armed revolt of Jewish militant groups and increasing violence of the local Arab population, Britain had found itself unable to control events. This was a very unpopular commitment, and the evacuation of British troops and subsequent handing over of the issue to the United Nations was widely supported by the British public.<ref>Ellen Jenny Ravndal, \"Exit Britain: British Withdrawal From the Palestine Mandate in the Early Cold War, 1947\u20131948\".

[[Aneurin Bevan]] resigned to protest against the new charges for \"teeth and spectacles\" in the National Health Service introduced by that Budget, and was joined in this action by several senior ministers, including the future Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], then the [[President of the Board of Trade]].

The first operational [[Operation Hurricane|British A Bomb]] was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office. Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US [[McMahon Act]], which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US\u2013UK collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries.

He thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing.

He was twice [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] (1935&ndash;1940, 1951&ndash;1955).\n\nThe son of a London [[solicitor]], Attlee was born into a middle-class family. After attending private schools and the [[University of Oxford]], he practised as a [[Barristers in England and Wales|barrister]]. The volunteer work he carried out in [[East End of London|London's East End]] exposed him to poverty and his political views shifted leftwards thereafter. He joined the [[Independent Labour Party]], gave up his legal career, and began lecturing at the [[London School of Economics]]. His work was interrupted by service as an officer in the [[First World War]]. In 1919, he became mayor of [[Stepney]] and in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]] was elected [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)|Limehouse]]. Attlee served in the [[First MacDonald ministry|first Labour minority government]] led by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924, and then joined the Cabinet during [[Second MacDonald ministry|MacDonald's second minority]] (1929\u20131931). After retaining his seat in Labour's landslide defeat of [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931]], he became the party's [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader]]. [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|Elected Leader of the Labour Party]] in 1935, and at first advocating [[pacificism]] and opposing [[British re-armament|re-armament]], he became a critic of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement]] of [[Hitler]] and [[Mussolini]] in the lead-up to the [[Second World War]]. Attlee took Labour into the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition government]] in 1940 and served under [[Winston Churchill]], initially as [[Lord Privy Seal]] and then as [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] from 1942.{{refn|group=note|Attlee worked backstage to handle much of the detail and organisational work in Parliament, as Churchill took centre stage with his attention on diplomacy, military policy and broader issues.}}\n\nAfter the end of the war, the coalition was dissolved and Attlee led Labour to a landslide victory at the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]],{{refn|group=note|The 12% [[Swing (United Kingdom)|national swing]] from [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] to Labour remains the largest achieved by any party at a British general election.}} forming the [[Attlee ministry|first Labour majority government]]. His government's [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian approach to economic management]] aimed to maintain [[full employment]], a [[mixed economy]] and a greatly enlarged system of social services provided by the state. To this end, it undertook the [[nationalisation]] of public utilities and major industries, and implemented wide-ranging social reforms, including the passing of the [[National Insurance Act 1946]] and [[National Assistance Act 1948|National Assistance Act]], the foundation of the [[National Health Service]] (1948) and the enlargement of public subsidies for [[council house]] building. His government also reformed [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] legislation, working practices and children's services; it created the [[National parks of England and Wales|National Parks]] system, passed the [[New Towns Act 1946]] and established the [[Town and country planning in the United Kingdom|town and country planning system]]. \n\nIn foreign policy, Attlee delegated to [[Ernest Bevin]], but oversaw the [[partition of India]] (1947), the independence of Burma and Ceylon, and the dissolution of the British mandates of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]. He and Bevin encouraged the United States to take a vigorous role in the [[Cold War (1947\u20131953)|Cold War]]; unable to afford military intervention in Greece, he called on Washington to counter Communists there, establishing the [[Truman Doctrine]].<ref>Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' (1983) ch 8</ref> He supported the [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild Western Europe with American money and, in 1949, promoted the [[NATO]] military alliance against the [[Soviet bloc]]. <!--He used 13,000 troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the London dock strike in 1949.--> After leading Labour to a narrow victory at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], he sent British troops to fight in the [[Korean War]].{{refn|group=note|Attlee sent British troops to fight in the [[Malayan Emergency]] (1948) and the [[Royal Air Force]] to participate in the [[Berlin Airlift]], and commissioned an [[independent nuclear deterrent]] for the UK.}}\n\nAttlee had inherited a country close to bankruptcy after the Second World War and beset by food, housing and resource shortages; despite his social reforms and economic programme, these problems persisted throughout his premiership, alongside recurrent currency crises and dependence on US aid. His party was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives in the [[1951 United Kingdom general election|1951 general election]], despite winning the most votes. He continued as Labour leader but retired after losing the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 election]] and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]]; after a long retirement, he died in 1967. In public, he was modest and unassuming, but behind the scenes his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity and pragmatism proved decisive. Often rated as one of the [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|greatest British prime ministers]], Attlee's reputation among scholars has grown, thanks to his creation of the modern [[welfare state]] and involvement in building the coalition against [[Stalin]] in the Cold War. He remains the longest-serving Labour leader in British history.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAttlee was born on 3 January 1883 in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]] (now part of London), into a [[middle-class]] family, the seventh of eight children. His father was Henry Attlee (1841\u20131908), a [[solicitor]], and his mother was Ellen Bravery Watson (1847\u20131920), daughter of Thomas Simons Watson, secretary for the [[Art Union of London]].<ref>Davies, Edward J. \"The Ancestry of Clement Attlee\", ''Genealogists' Magazine'', 31(2013\u201315): 380\u201387.</ref> He was educated at Northaw School, a boys' preparatory school near [[Pluckley]] in [[Kent]]; [[Haileybury College]]; and [[University College, Oxford]], where in 1904 he graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification|second-class honours]] in [[modern history]].\n\nAttlee then trained as a [[barrister]] at the [[Inner Temple]] and was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in March 1906. He worked for a time at his father's law firm Druces and Attlee but did not enjoy the work, and had no particular ambition to succeed in the legal profession.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||p=17}} He also played football for [[non-League football|non-League]] club [[Fleet Town F.C.|Fleet]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11566133/Why-football-can-be-a-dangerous-game-for-politicians.html Why football can be a dangerous game for politicians] Daily Telegraph, 27 April 2015</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1906, he became a volunteer at Haileybury House, a charitable club for [[working-class]] boys in [[Stepney]] in the [[East End of London]] run by his old school, and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the club's manager. Until then, his political views had been more [[conservative]]. However, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the [[slum]] children, he came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and [[income redistribution]] by the state would have any serious effect. This sparked a process that caused him to convert to [[socialism]]. He subsequently joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) in 1908 and became active in local politics. In 1909, he stood unsuccessfully at his first election, as an ILP candidate for Stepney Borough Council.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=18\u201335}}\n\nHe also worked briefly as a secretary for [[Beatrice Webb]] in 1909, before becoming a secretary for [[Toynbee Hall]]. In 1911, he was employed by the [[UK Government]] as an \"official explainer\"\u2014touring the country to explain [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s [[National Insurance Act]]. He spent the summer of that year touring [[Essex]] and [[Somerset]] on a bicycle, explaining the act at public meetings. A year later, he became a [[lecturer]] at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=34\u201343}}\n\n==Military service during the First World War==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914, Attlee applied to join the [[British Army]]. Initially his application was turned down, as at the age of 31 he was seen as being too old; however, he was finally allowed to join in September, and was commissioned<ref>''London Gazette'' issue 28985, published 24 November 1914. Page 5</ref> in the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] with the 6th (Service) Battalion, [[South Lancashire Regiment]], part of the [[38th Brigade (United Kingdom)|38th Brigade]] of the [[13th (Western) Division]], and was sent to fight in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]]. His decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother Tom, who, as a [[conscientious objector]], spent much of the war in prison.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=43\u201345, 52}}\n\nAfter a period fighting in Gallipoli, he collapsed after falling ill with [[dysentery]] and was put on a ship bound for [[England]] to recover. When he woke up he wanted to get back to action as soon as possible, and asked to be let off the ship in [[Malta]] where he stayed in hospital to recover. His hospitalisation coincided with the [[Battle of Sari Bair]], which saw a large number of his comrades killed. Upon returning to action, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the [[Gallipoli Campaign#Evacuation|evacuation of Suvla]]. As such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from [[Landing at Suvla Bay|Suvla Bay]], the last being General [[Stanley Maude]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=47\u201350}}\n[[File:Attlee, 1916 IWM (crop).png|thumb|left|Attlee (seen in the centre) in 1916, aged 33, whilst serving in Mesopotamia.]]\nThe Gallipoli Campaign had been engineered by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]]. Although it was unsuccessful, Attlee believed that it was a bold strategy, which could have been a success if it had been better implemented on the ground. This gave him an admiration for Churchill as a military strategist, which would make their working relationship in later years productive.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|p=46}}\n\nHe later served in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]] in what is now [[Iraq]], where in April 1916 he was badly wounded, being hit in the leg by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] while storming an enemy trench during the Battle of Hanna. He was sent firstly to [[British India|India]], and then back to the UK to recover. In February 1917, he was promoted to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]],<ref>''London Gazette Issue 30425'', published 11 December 1917<!-- page(s) needed --></ref> leading him to be known as \"Major Attlee\" for much of the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]]. He would spend most of 1917 training soldiers at various locations in England.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=50\u201351}} From 2 to 9 July 1917, he was the temporary commanding officer (CO) of the newly formed L (later 10th) Battalion, the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]] at Bovington Camp, [[Dorset]]. From 9 July, he assumed command of 30th Company of the same battalion; however, he did not deploy to France with it in December 1917.<ref>''The National Archive WO 95/101 War History of 10th Battalion, Tank Corps'', pp. 1\u20132.<!--publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nAfter fully recovering from his injuries, he was sent to France in June 1918 to serve on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the final months of the war. After being discharged from the Army in January 1919, he returned to [[Stepney]], and returned to his old job lecturing part-time at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Marriage and children==\nAttlee met [[Violet Attlee|Violet Millar]] while on a long trip with friends to Italy in 1921.

During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle [[slum]] [[landlord]]s who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, reducing the infant mortality rate, and took action to find work for returning unemployed ex-servicemen.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, ''The Social Worker'', which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:<blockquote>In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways \u2013 they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/socialworker00attliala ''The Social Worker Attlee'' (pg. 30)], archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.</ref></blockquote>\n\nand went on to say at page 75:<blockquote>Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. A right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipient's character, and terminable at his caprice.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/socialworker00attliala ''The Social Worker Attlee'' (pg. 75)], archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1921, [[George Lansbury]], the Labour mayor of the neighbouring borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar|Poplar]], and future Labour Party leader, launched the [[Poplar Rates Rebellion]]; a campaign of disobedience seeking to equalise the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. Attlee, who was a personal friend of Lansbury, strongly supported this. However, [[Herbert Morrison]], the Labour mayor of nearby [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], and one of the main figures in the [[London Labour Party]], strongly denounced Lansbury and the rebellion. During this period, Attlee developed a lifelong dislike of Morrison.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||p=122}}<ref name=\"Attlee\">Howell, David.

At the time, he admired [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and helped him get elected as Labour Party leader at the [[1922 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|1922 leadership election]]. He served as MacDonald's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] for the brief 1922 parliament. His first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the short-lived [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]], led by MacDonald.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nAttlee opposed the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]], believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. However, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike, he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee (although not against the Conservative members who had also supported this). The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay \u00a3300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=80\u201382}}\n\nIn 1927, he was appointed a member of the multi-party [[Simon Commission]], a [[royal commission]] set up to examine the possibility of granting [[Self-governance|self-rule]] to [[British Raj|India]]. Due to the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise MacDonald made to Attlee to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the [[Second Labour Government]], which entered office after the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=83\u201391}} Attlee's service on the Commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to India and many of its political leaders. By 1933 he argued that British rule was alien to India and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for India's progress.

In March 1931, he became [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], a post he held for five months until August, when the [[History of the British Labour Party#Great Depression and the split under MacDonald|Labour government fell]], after failing to agree on how to tackle the financial crisis of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=96\u201399}} That month MacDonald and a few of his allies formed a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], leading them to be expelled from Labour. MacDonald offered Attlee a job in the National Government, but he turned down the offer and opted to stay loyal to the main Labour party.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nAfter Ramsay MacDonald formed the National Government, Labour was deeply divided. Attlee had long been close to MacDonald and now felt betrayed\u2014as did most Labour politicians. During the course of the second Labour government, Attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with MacDonald, whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent, and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography. He would write:<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/PRmacdonald.htm Contains excerpt from Attlee's biography towards the bottom of the page]; accessed 26 July 2017.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In the old days I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine presence and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the [[First World War]] seemed to mark him as a man of character. Despite his mishandling of the [[Zinoviev letter|Red Letter]] episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.</blockquote>\n\n==1930s opposition==\n\n===Deputy Leader===\nThe [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] held later that year was a disaster for the Labour Party, which lost over 200 seats, returning only 52 MPs to Parliament. The vast majority of the party's senior figures, including the Leader [[Arthur Henderson|Arthur]] Henderson, lost their seats. Attlee, however, narrowly retained his Limehouse seat, with his majority being slashed from 7,288 to just 551. He was one of only three Labour MPs who had experience of government to retain their seats, along with [[George Lansbury]] and [[Stafford Cripps]]. Accordingly Lansbury was elected Leader unopposed with Attlee as his deputy.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nMost of the remaining Labour MPs after 1931 were elderly trade union officials who could not contribute much to debates, Lansbury was in his 70s, and Stafford Cripps another main figure of the Labour front bench who had entered Parliament in 1931, was inexperienced. As one of the most capable and experienced of the remaining Labour MPs, Attlee therefore shouldered a lot of the burden of providing an opposition to the National Government in the years 1931\u201335, during this time he had to extend his knowledge of subjects which he had not studied in any depth before, such as finance and foreign affairs in order to provide an effective opposition to the government.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nAttlee effectively served as acting leader for nine months from December 1933, after Lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident, which raised Attlee's public profile considerably. It was during this period, however, that personal financial problems almost forced Attlee to quit politics altogether. His wife had become ill, and at that time there was no separate salary for the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. On the verge of resigning from Parliament, he was persuaded to stay by Stafford Cripps, a wealthy socialist, who agreed to make a donation to party funds to pay him an additional salary until Lansbury could take over again.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nDuring 1932\u201333 Attlee flirted with, and then drew back from radicalism, influenced by Stafford Cripps who was then on the radical wing of the party, he was briefly a member of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], which had been formed by former [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) members, who opposed the ILP's disaffiliation from the main Labour Party in 1932. At one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by Cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act, allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy. He admired [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s strong-armed rule and use of major generals to control England. After looking more closely at Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and even his former colleague Oswald Mosley, leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in Britain, Attlee retreated from his radicalism, and distanced himself from the League, and argued instead that the Labour Party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against [[totalitarianism]] of either the left or right. He always supported the crown, and as Prime Minister was close to King George VI.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Attlee |first=Clement |date=18 February 1952 |title=Tribute from Labor's Attlee to George and the monarchy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA30 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=32 |number=7 |quote=It was my privilege for six years to serve King George as First Minister of the Crown and for five years during the war as Deputy Prime Minister.

Lansbury had strongly opposed the policy, and felt unable to continue leading the party. Taking advantage of the disarray in the Labour Party, the Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] announced on 19 October that a general election would be held on 14 November. With no time for a leadership contest, the party agreed that Attlee should serve as interim leader, on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=116\u2013117}} Attlee therefore led Labour through the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 election]], which saw the party stage a partial comeback from its disastrous 1931 performance, winning 38 per cent of the vote, the highest share Labour had won up to that point, and gaining over one hundred seats.{{sfn|Thomas-Symonds|2012|pp=68\u201370}}\n\nAttlee stood in the subsequent [[1935 Labour Party leadership election|leadership election]], held soon after, where he was opposed by [[Herbert Morrison]], who had just re-entered parliament in the recent election, and [[Arthur Greenwood]]: Morrison was seen as the favourite, but was distrusted by many sections of the party, especially the left-wing. Arthur Greenwood meanwhile was a popular figure in the party; however, his leadership bid was severely hampered by his [[Alcoholism|alcohol problem]]. Attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure, particularly having already led the party through a general election. He went on to come first in both the first and second ballots, formally being elected Leader of the Labour Party on 3 December 1935.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=121\u2013130}}\n\nThroughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the Labour Party's official policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and [[collective security]] under the [[League of Nations]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Rhiannon Vickers |title=The Labour Party and the World, Volume 1: The Evolution of Labour's Foreign Policy, 1900\u201351 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XbLCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Manchester University Press]] |page=92 |isbn=9781847791313}}</ref> At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, \"We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country\".<ref>Talus, ''Your Alternative Government'' (London: Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1945), p. 17.</ref> During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said \"We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system.

Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the [[Soviet Union]], created \"A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1935/may/22/defence-policy|title=Defence Policy|date=22 May 1935|volume=302 cc359-486|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1936, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Neville Chamberlain]], introduced a Budget which increased the amount spent on the armed forces. Attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it, saying:\n{{quote|[The budget] was the natural expression of the character of the present Government. There was hardly any increase allowed for the services which went to build up the life of the people, education and health. Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death. The Chancellor expressed great regret that he should have to spend so much on armaments, but said that it was absolutely necessary and was due only to the actions of other nations. One would think to listen to him that the Government had no responsibility for the state of world affairs. [...] The Government has now resolved to enter upon an arms race, and the people will have to pay for their mistake in believing that it could be trusted to carry out a policy of peace. [...] This is a War Budget. We can look in the future for no advance in Social Legislation. All available resources are to be devoted to armaments.<ref>\"Mr. Attlee on a war budget\", ''The Times'', 23 April 1936, p. 16.</ref>}}\n\nIn June 1936, the Conservative MP [[Duff Cooper]] called for an Anglo-French alliance against possible German aggression and called for all parties to support one. Attlee condemned this: \"We say that any suggestion of an alliance of this kind\u2014an alliance in which one country is bound to another, right or wrong, by some overwhelming necessity\u2014is contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations, is contrary to the Covenant, is contrary to Locarno is contrary to the obligations which this country has undertaken, and is contrary to the professed policy of this Government\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1936/jun/29/mr-duff-cooprrs-speech|title=MR. DUFF COOPER'S SPEECH|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> At the Labour Party conference at Edinburgh in October Attlee reiterated that \"There can be no question of our supporting the Government in its rearmament policy\".<ref>Talus, p. 37.</ref>\n\nHowever, with the rising threat from [[Nazi Germany]], and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, this policy eventually lost credibility. By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose Neville Chamberlain's policy of [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=131\u2013134}}\n\nIn 1938, Attlee opposed the [[Munich Agreement]], in which Chamberlain negotiated with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Sudetenland]]: <blockquote>We all feel relief that war has not come this time. Every one of us has been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt that we are in the midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1938/oct/03/prime-ministers-statement|title=Prime Minister's Statement|volume=339 cc40-162|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|date=3 October 1938|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of 1937, Attlee and a party of three Labour MPs visited Spain and visited the [[British Battalion]] of the [[International Brigades]] fighting in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. One of the companies was named the \"Major Attlee Company\" in his honour.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nIn 1937, Attlee wrote a book entitled ''The Labour Party in Perspective'' that sold fairly well in which he set out some of his views. He argued that there was no point in Labour compromising on its socialist principles in the belief that this would achieve electoral success. He wrote: \"I find that the proposition often reduces itself to this \u2013 that if the Labour Party would drop its socialism and adopt a Liberal platform, many Liberals would be pleased to support it. I have heard it said more than once that if Labour would only drop its policy of [[nationalisation]] everyone would be pleased, and it would soon obtain a majority. I am convinced it would be fatal for the Labour Party.\" He also wrote that there was no point in \"watering down Labour's socialist creed in order to attract new adherents who cannot accept the full socialist faith. On the contrary, I believe that it is only a clear and bold policy that will attract this support\".{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=140\u2013141}} \n\nIn the late 1930s, Attlee sponsored a Jewish mother and her two children, enabling them to leave Germany in 1939 and move to the UK.

Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by [[Winston Churchill]] on 10 May 1940.<ref name=\"Attlee\"/>\n\nAttlee and Churchill quickly agreed that the [[War cabinet#Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] would consist of three Conservatives (initially Churchill, Chamberlain and [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]) and two Labour members (initially himself and [[Arthur Greenwood]]) and that Labour should have slightly more than one third of the posts in the coalition government.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=157\u2013158}} Attlee and Greenwood played a vital role in supporting Churchill during a series of [[May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis|War Cabinet debates]] over whether or not to negotiate peace terms with Hitler following the [[Fall of France]] in May 1940; both supported Churchill and gave him the majority he needed in the War Cabinet to continue Britain's resistance.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=163\u2013164}}<ref name=\"Marr\">Marr, Andrew.

In the [[Churchill war ministry|coalition government]], three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. Churchill chaired the first two, the [[War Cabinet]] and the Defence Committee, with Attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in Parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee himself instituted, and later chaired the third body, the [[Lord President's Committee]], which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs. As Churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men. Attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with Churchill's backing, streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees. He also acted as a concilliator in the government, smoothing over tensions which frequently arose between Labour and Conservative Ministers.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|p=164}}<ref name=\"Attlee\"/><ref name=\"govclem\">{{cite web|title=Clement Attlee: enigmatic, out of time \u2013 and formidable|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/11/clement-attlee-enigmatic-out-of-time-and-formidable/|first=Robert|last= Crowcroft|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany Labour activists were baffled by the top leadership role for a man they regarded as having little charisma; [[Beatrice Webb]] wrote in her diary in early 1940:\n:He looked and spoke like an insignificant elderly clerk, without distinction in the voice, manner or substance of his discourse.

The [[Bank of England]] and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946. [[National Coal Board|Coal mining]], the [[British Railways|railways]], road haulage, canals and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]] were nationalised in 1947, and electricity and gas followed in 1948.

By 1951 about 20 per cent of the British economy had been taken into [[public ownership]].<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/>\n\nNationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked.

Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialists relationships in the workplace.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/></blockquote>\n\n====Agriculture====\nThe Attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the [[Agriculture Act 1947]] established a more generous subsidy system for farmers.{{sfn|Morgan|1984}} Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/farming-agriculture-acts.htm|title=The Cabinet Papers &#124; Farming and the Agriculture Acts|publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref><ref>Self, Peter & Herbert J.

This reform was eventually carried out by [[Harold Wilson's]] government. During its time in office, the Attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent, from \u00a36.5&nbsp;billion to \u00a310&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Beech|Lee|2008}}\n\n====Economy====\nThe most significant problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the [[war effort]] had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of her national wealth.{{clarify|date=December 2019}}{{cn|date=December 2019}} Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the [[balance of trade]]. This resulted in strict [[rationing]] of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its financial state.\n\nThe abrupt end of the American [[Lend-Lease]] program in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. Some relief was provided by the [[Anglo-American loan]], negotiated in December 1945. The conditions attached to the loan included making the [[pound sterling|pound]] fully [[convertibility|convertible]] to the US dollar. When this was introduced in July 1947, it led to a [[currency crisis]] and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/> The UK benefited from the American [[Marshall Aid]] program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. Another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Stafford Cripps]], into devaluation of the pound.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/>\n\nDespite these problems, one of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near [[full employment]]. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3 per cent of the total workforce.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/> Labour shortages proved a more frequent problem. The inflation rate was also kept low during his term.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2 per cent during Attlee's time in office, whilst there was no hard-core of long-term unemployed. Both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment, while the average working week was shortened.<ref>Thompson, David. ''England in the Twentieth Century (1914\u201363)''.<!--publisher, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nThe government was less successful in housing, which was the responsibility of [[Aneurin Bevan]]. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the Attlee government's housing policies. Between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.{{sfn|Morgan|1984}}\n\nWhen the Attlee government was voted out of office in 1951, the economy had been improved compared to 1945. The period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards, which increased by about 10 per cent each year. During that same period, the economy grew by 3 per cent a year, and by 1951 the UK had \"the best economic performance in Europe, while output per person was increasing faster than in the United States\".<ref>''Ten Years of New Labour'' (edited by Matt Beech and Simon Lee)<!--publisher, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref> Careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery, and that unemployment stayed at very low levels.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> In addition, the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3&nbsp;million to 5&nbsp;million from 1945 to 1951, and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before.{{sfn|Hill|1970}} A Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act was passed in 1948, which allowed for investigations of restrictive practices and monopolies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PX0oAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA210&dq=united+kingdom+Superannuation+(Miscellaneous+Provisions)+Act+1948#v=onepage&q=united%20kingdom%20Superannuation%20(Miscellaneous%20Provisions)%20Act%201948&f=false|title=Pension and Widows' and Orphans' Funds|accessdate=9 January 2016|isbn=9781107621749|last1=Crabbe|first1=R.

The [[Ministry of Fuel and Power|Minister of Fuel and Power]], [[Emanuel Shinwell]] was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks, and soon resigned from his post. The Conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan 'Starve with Strachey and shiver with Shinwell' (referring to the Minister of Food [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]).<ref>{{cite web|author=Sandbrook, Dominic|url=http://www.jubileeriver.co.uk/100110%20-%20winter%20of%201947.htm|title=Winter of 1947|publisher=Jubileeriver.co.uk|date=9 January 2010|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by [[Hugh Dalton]] to replace Attlee as Prime Minister with [[Ernest Bevin]].

Byrnes]] upon his arrival at National Airport in Washington, 1945]]\n\n====Europe and the Cold War====\n\nIn foreign affairs, the Attlee government was concerned with four main issues; post-war Europe, the onset of the Cold War, the establishment of the United Nations, and decolonisation. The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]]. Attlee also attended the later stages of the [[Potsdam Conference]], where he negotiated with President [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britain's former war-time ally, Stalin and the [[Soviet Union]]. Ernest Bevin was a passionate [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. Bevin's initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary was \"wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile\".{{sfn|Morgan|1984}} Attlee himself sought warm relations with Stalin. He put his trust in the United Nations, rejected notions that the Soviet Union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating Moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. This put Attlee at sword's point with his foreign minister, the Foreign Office, and the military who all saw the Soviets as a growing threat to Britain's role in the Middle East. Suddenly in January 1947, Attlee reversed his position and agreed with Bevin on a hard-line anti-Soviet policy.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith Raymond, Zametica John |year=1985 |title=The Cold Warrior: Clement Attlee reconsidered, 1945\u20137 |url= |journal=International Affairs |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=237\u201352 |doi=10.2307/2617482 |jstor=2617482}}</ref>\n\nIn an early \"good-will\" gesture that was later heavily criticised, the Attlee government allowed the Soviets to purchase, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR [[Trade pact|Trade Agreement]], a total of 25 [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] [[jet engine]]s in September 1947 and March 1948. The agreement included an agreement not to use them for military purposes. The price was fixed under a commercial contract; a total of 55 jet engines were sold to the USSR in 1947.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/nov/22/jet-engines-foreign-sales \"Jet Engines (Foreign Sales)\"]. {{ukhansard |house=HC |date=22 November 1948 |vol=458 |cc=839-41}}</ref> However, the [[Cold War]] intensified during this period and the Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Nene and installed their own version in the [[Mikoyan\u2013Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] interceptor.

The Attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful [[NATO]] defence alliance to protect Western Europe against any Soviet expansion.{{sfnm |1a1=Morgan |1y=1984 |1loc=ch.&nbsp;6 |2a1=Thomas-Symonds |2y=2012 |2pp=2\u20134, 127}} In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war Europe, Attlee's Cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American [[Marshall Plan]] for the economic recovery of Europe. He called it, one of the \"most bold, enlightened and good-natured acts in the history of nations\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank Field|title=Attlee's Great Contemporaries: The Politics of Character|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-5-6BwAAQBAJ&pg=PR38|year=2009|publisher=Bloomsbury |page=38|isbn=9781441129444}}</ref>\n\nA group of Labour MPs, organised under the banner of \"[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]\" urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of a \"third force\" of European powers to stand between the US and USSR. However, deteriorating relations between Britain and the USSR, as well as Britain's economic reliance on America following the Marshall Plan, steered policy towards supporting the US.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/> In January 1947, fear of both Soviet and American nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the Cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of Britain's independent [[nuclear deterrent]], an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party. Britain's first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after Attlee had left office.<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/>\n\nThe London dock strike of July 1949, led by Communists, was suppressed when the Attlee government sent in 13,000 Army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike. His response reveals Attlee's growing concern that Soviet expansionism, supported by the British Communist Party, was a genuine threat to national security, and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by Moscow. He noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances, but to help communist unions who were on strike in Canada. Attlee agreed with MI5 that he faced \"a very present menace\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Deery Phillip | year = 1998 | title = 'A Very Present Menace'?

It kept open consulates in Communist-controlled areas and rejected the Chinese Nationalists' requests that British citizens assist in the defence of Shanghai. By December, the government concluded that although British property in China would likely be nationalised, British traders would benefit in the long run from a stable, industrialising Communist China. Retaining [[Hong Kong]] was especially important; although the Chinese Communists promised to not interfere with its rule, Britain reinforced the [[Hong Kong Garrison]] during 1949. When the victorious Chinese Communists government declared on 1 October 1949 that it would exchange diplomats with any country that ended relations with the Chinese Nationalists, Britain became the first western country to formally recognise the [[People's Republic of China]] in January 1950.<ref name=\"jstor260389\">{{cite journal | last1 = Wolf | first1 = David C. | year = 1983 | title = 'To Secure a Convenience': Britain Recognizes China - 1950 | journal = Journal of Contemporary History | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 299\u2013326 | jstor = 260389\n | format =  | doi=10.1177/002200948301800207}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, a Labour Party delegation including Attlee visited China at the invitation of then Foreign Minister [[Zhou Enlai]].

He set up the [[Cripps Mission]] in 1942, which tried and failed to bring the factions together.

Congress, led by Nehru and Gandhi, demanded immediate independence and full control by Congress of all of India. That demand was rejected by the British, and Congress opposed the war effort with its \"[[Quit India]] campaign\". The Raj immediately responded in 1942 by imprisoning the major national, regional and local Congress leaders for the duration. Attlee did not object.<ref>Herman, ''Gandhi & Churchill'' (2008) p 486-95.</ref> By contrast, the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] led by [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], and also the Sikh community, strongly supported the war effort. They greatly enlarged their membership and won favour from London for their decision. Attlee retained a fondness for Congress and until 1946, accepted their thesis that they were a non-religious party that accepted Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and everyone else.<ref>Kenneth Harris, ''Attlee'' (1982) pp 362\u201364</ref>\n\n[[File:Partition of India.PNG|thumb|Four nations ([[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Dominion of Ceylon]], and [[Union of Burma]]) that gained independence in 1947 and 1948]]\nThe Muslim league insisted that it was the only true representative of all of the Muslims of India, and by 1946 Attlee had come to agree with them.  With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. Viceroy Wavell said he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. No divisions were available; independence was the only option.<ref>David Chandler, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 331</ref> Given the demands of the Muslim league, independence implied a partition that set off heavily Muslim Pakistan from the main portion of India.<ref>Harris, ''Attlee'' (1982) pp 367\u201369.</ref>\n\nThe Labour government gave independence to India and Pakistan in an unexpectedly quick move in 1947.

It had become too troublesome and much too expensive to handle. British policies there were perceived by the [[Zionist]] movement and the Truman Administration as pro-Arab and anti-Jewish. In the face of an armed revolt of Jewish militant groups and increasing violence of the local Arab population, Britain had found itself unable to control events. This was a very unpopular commitment, and the evacuation of British troops and subsequent handing over of the issue to the United Nations was widely supported by the British public.<ref>Ellen Jenny Ravndal, \"Exit Britain: British Withdrawal From the Palestine Mandate in the Early Cold War, 1947\u20131948\".

[[Aneurin Bevan]] resigned to protest against the new charges for \"teeth and spectacles\" in the National Health Service introduced by that Budget, and was joined in this action by several senior ministers, including the future Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]], then the [[President of the Board of Trade]].

The first operational [[Operation Hurricane|British A Bomb]] was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office. Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US [[McMahon Act]], which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US\u2013UK collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries.

He thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing.

The term can refer to the surrounding area as well as the island. William Randolph's residence overlooked Turkey Island, and he is buried near the site of the house.<ref name=\"Sankey, Margaret D. 1711\">Sankey, Margaret D. \"Randolph, William (1650\u20131711), colonist in America\"</ref>\n\n[[Curles Neck]] Plantation is west of Turkey Island.  It was owned by Nathaniel Bacon, who rebelled against the governor in 1676.  The property was forfeited to the colonial government and William Randolph purchased it.\n\n[[Wolfiporia extensa|Tuckahoe]] is the American English name of an edible plant, borrowed from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] Native American language. It is also the name of several streams and places in eastern Virginia, including [[Tuckahoe Plantation]], established by William Randolph's son, Thomas. \"[[Tuckahoe and Cohee|Tuckahoe]]\" later became a pejorative nickname for eastern Virginians, used mainly by western Virginians. \n\n[[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] is the headland of a shingle beach in Kent, England, which must be rounded to approach the Thames Estuary. The founder of Dungeness Plantation, Isham Randolph, spent several years of his adult life as a ship's captain, and therefore was familiar with the feature. The name may have been chosen to evoke the drama of a turning point in a long voyage. The similar headland at the western tip of Cornwall, [[Land's End]], has inspired the names of several enterprises, including two plantations.\n\nBremo was the name for a tract between Turkey Island and Curles plantations\nThe name comes from a Germanic word meaning \"edge\", in this case the edge of a river.

His account of the disaster was published in multiple newspapers.\n\n[[Robert Daniel|Robert Williams Daniel, Jr.]], 3x great grandson of Edmund Randolph was a Virginia farmer, businessman, teacher, and politician who served five terms in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].

The term can refer to the surrounding area as well as the island. William Randolph's residence overlooked Turkey Island, and he is buried near the site of the house.<ref name=\"Sankey, Margaret D. 1711\">Sankey, Margaret D. \"Randolph, William (1650\u20131711), colonist in America\"</ref>\n\n[[Curles Neck]] Plantation is west of Turkey Island.  It was owned by Nathaniel Bacon, who rebelled against the governor in 1676.  The property was forfeited to the colonial government and William Randolph purchased it.\n\n[[Wolfiporia extensa|Tuckahoe]] is the American English name of an edible plant, borrowed from an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] Native American language. It is also the name of several streams and places in eastern Virginia, including [[Tuckahoe Plantation]], established by William Randolph's son, Thomas. \"[[Tuckahoe and Cohee|Tuckahoe]]\" later became a pejorative nickname for eastern Virginians, used mainly by western Virginians. \n\n[[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] is the headland of a shingle beach in Kent, England, which must be rounded to approach the Thames Estuary. The founder of Dungeness Plantation, Isham Randolph, spent several years of his adult life as a ship's captain, and therefore was familiar with the feature. The name may have been chosen to evoke the drama of a turning point in a long voyage. The similar headland at the western tip of Cornwall, [[Land's End]], has inspired the names of several enterprises, including two plantations.\n\nBremo was the name for a tract between Turkey Island and Curles plantations\nThe name comes from a Germanic word meaning \"edge\", in this case the edge of a river. The root also occurs in the English word \"brim\".  The extant [[Bremo Historic District|Bremo]] Plantation was established in the early 19th century in [[Fluvanna County]], far to the west.\n\nThese plantations are shown on the 1751 [[Fry-Jefferson map]].\n\n==Historic homes==\nHistoric homes associated with the family include [[Tuckahoe (plantation)|Tuckahoe]] in [[Goochland County, Virginia|Goochland]] and [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico]] counties, the [[Peyton Randolph House]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], the [[Wilton House Museum]] and the [[John Marshall House]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], [[Monticello]] near [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Stratford Hall (plantation)|Stratford Hall]] in [[Westmoreland, Westmoreland County, Virginia|Westmoreland]], [[Lower Brandon Plantation|Brandon Plantation]] in [[Prince George County, Virginia|Prince George]] and [[Burgh Westra]] in [[Gloucester, Virginia]] .\n\n==Freed slaves==\nRandolphs who freed slaves and fought Virginia's growing dependence on the \"peculiar institution\" in the early Republic are less known, but include [[Ryland Randolph]] of Turkey Island and [[Ann Cary Randolph Morris]], who later married founding father (and anti-slavery advocate) [[Gouverneur Morris]] of New York<ref>http://www.humanitiesweb.org/spa/slc/ID/1374/o/blank</ref> Jacob Randolph of Isle of Wight County, Virginia, freed 13 slaves in 1783.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/virginiafreeafter1782.htm|title=Virginia Slaves Freed in Virginia after 1782|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[John Randolph of Roanoke]] freed nearly 400 slaves in his will, [[probate]]d in 1833 and upheld more than a decade later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenrule4everyone.com/library/american-negro-slavery/xxi-free-negroes-part-1/|title=\u5a5a\u6d3b\u6700\u524d\u7dda|accessdate=31 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902124351/http://www.goldenrule4everyone.com/library/american-negro-slavery/xxi-free-negroes-part-1/|archivedate=2 September 2013}}</ref><ref>F.N.

[[Pocahontas]] was directly related to members of the Randolph family through marriages of [[Robert Bolling]]'s two granddaughters, Lucille and Jane Bolling. Some evidence suggests that famous [[American frontier]]sman, politician and hero [[Davy Crockett]] was of Randolph descent. Actor [[Lee Marvin]] and actress and producer [[Kimberley Kates]] are also Randolph descendants, in her case through her paternal grandmother. World War I fighter ace [[Hamilton Coolidge]] was a direct descendant of the marriage of a Randolph to the daughter of U.S. President [[Thomas Jefferson]].\n\nIn 1926, [[Jessie Harlan Lincoln]], the granddaughter of [[Abraham Lincoln]] married her third husband, Robert John Randolph of this Randolph family.<ref name=\"NYTWedd\">{{cite news|last1=Staff|title=MRS.
