It was the Buckeyes' 127th overall, the 104th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and third as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was led by [[Urban Meyer]], in his fifth year as head coach, and played its home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nOhio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2016/07/ohio_state_picked_to_win_big_t_1.html|title=Ohio State picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2016 preseason poll|website=Cleveland.com|date=July 22, 2016|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> and were ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and in double overtime against then-No. 8 [[2016 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and rose to second in the AP Poll. However, the next week they suffered their first loss at [[2016 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in a [[White Out (Penn State)|White Out]] game at [[Beaver Stadium]]. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against third-ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

With both teams ranked in the top ten of both major college football polls, [[ESPN]] had chosen [[Madison, Wisconsin]] as the host of [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]. This was Wisconsin's second appearance on GameDay for 2016 and Ohio State's first. Ohio State extended their current win streak over the Badgers to five, dating back to 2011. Ohio State coach [[Urban Meyer]] is 4\u20130 versus Wisconsin and this was Badgers' coach [[Paul Chryst]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeyes started the game off slow by gaining only 23 yards on their first two drives, both resulting in punts, while allowing 147 yards for the Badger's offense on their first two drives that resulted in a ten-point lead for #8 Wisconsin. Neither team could find the endzone for the remainder of the first half and both settled for two additional field goals apiece for a halftime score of 16\u20136 favoring the Badgers.\n\nThe Silver Bullet Buckeye defense came out strong in the second half forcing two Wisconsin turnovers and a three-and-out, on Wisconsin's first three possessions. Though the Buckeyes threw an interception on their first possession, they followed it up with two consecutive touchdowns, both [[J. T. Barrett]] runs. On Barrett's second touchdown, Ohio State took their first lead of the night at the 14:09 mark of the fourth quarter, and the Buckeyes led 20\u201316. The next drive, Wisconsin drove 81 yards to take back the lead with 7:54 left in the game. The Buckeyes followed that score with a field goal to tie the game at 23 with 3:57 to go. The Badger offense drove 25 yards on their last possession, but come up short of field goal range and had to punt to the Buckeyes with 0:14 left. The Buckeyes with the ball on their 17-yard line decided to run out the clock and force overtime.\n\nOhio State would get the ball first in overtime and would score a touchdown on a [[J. T. Barrett]] pass to Noah Brown on third and two from the Wisconsin 7, which gave them a 30\u201323 lead. On Wisconsin's attempt, quarterback Alex Hornibrook would throw a 21-yard pass on Wisconsin's second play which got the Badgers to the Ohio State 4. After two [[Corey Clement]] runs for no gain and an incomplete pass, the game came down to a fourth and goal from the Ohio State four. Wisconsin opted for a pass and Hornibrook was sacked by [[Tyquan Lewis]] to preserve Ohio State's unbeaten status.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led by Barrett who had 226 yards passing and 92 yards rushing and three total touchdowns (two rushing, one passing). Barrett was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his 318 total yard performance.<ref name=\"btn.com\">http://btn.com/2016/10/17/check-out-who-won-week-7-big-ten-football-honors/</ref> He was also named  Davey O\u2019Brien National Quarterback of the Week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101816aae.html|title=J.T.

On third and three at the MSU 16, [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]] fumbled the ball giving Ohio State no chance to attempt a field goal. Ohio State and Michigan State went into halftime tied at ten.\n\nBoth teams punted twice to start the second half until Ohio State formed a four-play 69-yard drive that resulted in another touchdown, giving them a 17\u201310 advantage.

After neither team scored in the first quarter, Michigan opened the scoring in the second quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Kenny Allen. Ohio State responded with a 16-yard interception return from Malik Hooker. Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, Ohio State scored via a seven-yard touchdown run from [[J. T. Barrett]]. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown pass from Speight to Amara Darboh to force double overtime. In double overtime, Michigan scored via a 37-yard field goal from Allen. On a controversial 4th and 1 play, J.T Barrett ran up the middle and was tackled in such a way that the forward progress made it difficult to determine where the ball would be spotted. The result was ultimately that the officials gave Ohio State the first down. The next play, [[Curtis Samuel]] recorded a 15-yard touchdown run to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan-Ohio State Box Score|publisher=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400869650}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Adolph]] served as honorary captain for both Michigan and Ohio State.

It was the Buckeyes' 127th overall, the 104th as a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]], and third as a member of the Eastern Division. The team was led by [[Urban Meyer]], in his fifth year as head coach, and played its home games at [[Ohio Stadium]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nOhio State was the preseason favorite to win the Big Ten,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cleveland.com/osu/2016/07/ohio_state_picked_to_win_big_t_1.html|title=Ohio State picked to win Big Ten in cleveland.com 2016 preseason poll|website=Cleveland.com|date=July 22, 2016|first=Doug|last=Lesmerises}}</ref> and were ranked sixth in the preseason [[AP Poll]]. They began the year with six straight victories, including on the road against then-No. 14 [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] and in double overtime against then-No. 8 [[2016 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]], and rose to second in the AP Poll. However, the next week they suffered their first loss at [[2016 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]] in a [[White Out (Penn State)|White Out]] game at [[Beaver Stadium]]. The team won its remaining regular season games, and finished conference play with an overtime victory against third-ranked [[2016 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]]. Penn State and Ohio State both finished with conference records of 8\u20131, and Penn State advanced to the [[2016 Big Ten Football Championship Game]] due to the head-to-head victory. Despite this, and Penn State's victory over Wisconsin in that game, Ohio State was ranked ahead of Penn State at third in the final [[2016 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings#CFP rankings|College Football Playoff rankings]], earning them a spot in the national semi-final [[2016 Fiesta Bowl (December)|Fiesta Bowl]] against second-ranked [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]]. The Buckeyes were shutout in that game 31\u20130 and ended the year at 11\u20132.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led on offense by quarterback [[J.T. Barrett]], who finished with 2,555 passing yards and 24 touchdowns. Running back [[Mike Weber]] led the team with 1,096 rushing yards and nine touchdowns. Center [[Pat Elflein]] was named a [[2016 College Football All-America Team|unanimous first-team All-American]] and was the recipient of the [[Rimington Trophy]] as the nation's top [[center (gridiron football)|center]]. On defense, cornerback [[Malik Hooker]] led the Big Ten with seven interceptions (three returned for a touchdown) and was also a unanimous first-team All-American.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n|

Ohio State struck first, midway through the first quarter on a [[Curtis Samuel]] 36-yard touchdown run. On Oklahoma's next possession, Ohio State's Jerome Baker intercepted [[Baker Mayfield]]'s pass to score a touchdown on a 68-yard interception return. This was Ohio State's fourth defensive score in their first three games. During the ensuing kickoff, Oklahoma's Joe Mixon returned the kick for a 97-yard touchdown, to make the score 14\u20137, Ohio State. Though not caught, Mixon dropped the ball before he crossed the goal line and fumbled into the end zone. Ohio State scored another two touchdowns and Oklahoma made a field goal to make the score 28\u201310. With six minutes to go in the half, Oklahoma scored on a 35-yard Mayfield pass to A.D.

With both teams ranked in the top ten of both major college football polls, [[ESPN]] had chosen [[Madison, Wisconsin]] as the host of [[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]. This was Wisconsin's second appearance on GameDay for 2016 and Ohio State's first. Ohio State extended their current win streak over the Badgers to five, dating back to 2011. Ohio State coach [[Urban Meyer]] is 4\u20130 versus Wisconsin and this was Badgers' coach [[Paul Chryst]]'s first game against the Buckeyes.\n\nThe Buckeyes started the game off slow by gaining only 23 yards on their first two drives, both resulting in punts, while allowing 147 yards for the Badger's offense on their first two drives that resulted in a ten-point lead for #8 Wisconsin. Neither team could find the endzone for the remainder of the first half and both settled for two additional field goals apiece for a halftime score of 16\u20136 favoring the Badgers.\n\nThe Silver Bullet Buckeye defense came out strong in the second half forcing two Wisconsin turnovers and a three-and-out, on Wisconsin's first three possessions. Though the Buckeyes threw an interception on their first possession, they followed it up with two consecutive touchdowns, both [[J. T. Barrett]] runs. On Barrett's second touchdown, Ohio State took their first lead of the night at the 14:09 mark of the fourth quarter, and the Buckeyes led 20\u201316. The next drive, Wisconsin drove 81 yards to take back the lead with 7:54 left in the game. The Buckeyes followed that score with a field goal to tie the game at 23 with 3:57 to go. The Badger offense drove 25 yards on their last possession, but come up short of field goal range and had to punt to the Buckeyes with 0:14 left. The Buckeyes with the ball on their 17-yard line decided to run out the clock and force overtime.\n\nOhio State would get the ball first in overtime and would score a touchdown on a [[J. T. Barrett]] pass to Noah Brown on third and two from the Wisconsin 7, which gave them a 30\u201323 lead. On Wisconsin's attempt, quarterback Alex Hornibrook would throw a 21-yard pass on Wisconsin's second play which got the Badgers to the Ohio State 4. After two [[Corey Clement]] runs for no gain and an incomplete pass, the game came down to a fourth and goal from the Ohio State four. Wisconsin opted for a pass and Hornibrook was sacked by [[Tyquan Lewis]] to preserve Ohio State's unbeaten status.\n\nThe Buckeyes were led by Barrett who had 226 yards passing and 92 yards rushing and three total touchdowns (two rushing, one passing). Barrett was named Big Ten Co-Offensive Player of the Week for his 318 total yard performance.<ref name=\"btn.com\">http://btn.com/2016/10/17/check-out-who-won-week-7-big-ten-football-honors/</ref> He was also named  Davey O\u2019Brien National Quarterback of the Week.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ohiostatebuckeyes.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/101816aae.html|title=J.T.

The next score came from Michigan State on a 1-yard LJ Scott run. The Spartans opted to go for a two-point conversion with only 4:41 left in the game to attempt to take the lead. Tyler O'Connor's pass was intercepted in the end zone and the Buckeyes maintained the lead, 17\u201316. Ohio State got the ball back and ran 2:37 off the clock on six plays, but punted with 2:04 left in the game. Tyler O'Connor was sacked on the first play by Tyquan Lewis for a loss of ten yards, the following play, Gareon Conley intercepted O'Connor's pass to seal the Buckeyes' 17\u201316 victory.\n\nMike Weber was named Big Ten Freshman of the Week for his performance and for the second time this season.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n'''Statistics'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MSU\n|-\n|Total yards\n|310\n|334\n|-\n|Passing yards\n|86\n|127\n|-\n|Rushing yards\n|224\n|207\n|-\n|Penalties\n|4\u201340\n|6\u201360\n|-\n|Turnovers\n|1\n|2\n|-\n|Time of possession\n|30:53\n|29:07\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Statistic\n!OSU\n!MSU\n|-\n|Passing\n|[[J.

After neither team scored in the first quarter, Michigan opened the scoring in the second quarter via a 28-yard field goal from Kenny Allen. Ohio State responded with a 16-yard interception return from Malik Hooker. Michigan closed the scoring in the first half via a one-yard touchdown run from Khalid Hill, which made the score 10\u20137 in favor of Michigan at halftime. Michigan extended their lead in the third quarter via an eight-yard touchdown pass from [[Wilton Speight]] to Hill. Ohio State reduced Michigan's lead to three points via a one-yard touchdown run from [[Mike Weber (American football)|Mike Weber]], before Tyler Durbin recorded a 23-yard field goal as time expired in the fourth quarter to tie the game and force overtime. In overtime, Ohio State scored via a seven-yard touchdown run from [[J. T. Barrett]]. Michigan responded with a five-yard touchdown pass from Speight to Amara Darboh to force double overtime. In double overtime, Michigan scored via a 37-yard field goal from Allen. On a controversial 4th and 1 play, J.T Barrett ran up the middle and was tackled in such a way that the forward progress made it difficult to determine where the ball would be spotted. The result was ultimately that the officials gave Ohio State the first down. The next play, [[Curtis Samuel]] recorded a 15-yard touchdown run to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michigan-Ohio State Box Score|publisher=ESPN|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=November 26, 2016|date=November 26, 2016|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game?gameId=400869650}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Adolph]] served as honorary captain for both Michigan and Ohio State. The game marked the 11th time that Michigan and Ohio State took the field both in the nation's top-five rankings; and is just the second time that both programs were ranked in the nation's top three. The other was the No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in [[2006 Michigan vs. Ohio State football game|2006]] at Ohio Stadium. The game also marked the first overtime in the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry. Michigan's defense recorded a season-best eight sacks against Ohio State.

Darboh caught eight passes for 68 receiving yards, upping his career total to 2,026. Darboh has recorded a reception in 32 consecutive games, earning a share of the fourth spot among Michigan's all-time leaders in the category. He is tied with [[Marquise Walker]] (1998\u20132001).<ref name=OhioStateNotes/>\n\n[[Raekwon McMillan]] was named the conference Defensive Player of the Week for his performance.

{"title_page": "Scantext", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n'''Scantext''' was a professional [[code-driven]] [[Digital data|digital]] [[typesetting]] system popular in the 1980s, rendered obsolete by the popularity of the personal computer and desktop publishing software. It was developed and built by [[Scangraphic]], a division of Dr. B\u00f6ger Duplomat Apparate GmbH & Co.KG, based in Wedel near Hamburg, Germany. \n\n==System==\n\nThe Scantext 1000 system comprised a [[CPU]] with multiple 8\" disk drives, keyboard and monitor, the latter dispaying coordinates and codes defining a page layout. The left-hand drive was intended for recording document data; the second for required font data. In the early years, no preview was available, the operator seeing only typesetting codes (\"working blind\"). Later, a non-interactive (green) monochrome preview display was introduced.\n\nThe Scantext 1000 system ran under the operating system [[CP/M]] and used [[Intel 8080/85]] processors.\n\nThe 1000 system also featured an optional [[font]] editing package, allowing not only modification of existing fonts but the creation of entirely new designs. This software displayed individual font characters for [[pixel]]-based editing, in conjunction with an attached [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]]. An optional drum [[Image scanner|scanner]] facilitated the input of new designs to create new fonts or pi characters.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of differently-sized master character images (as implemented in Monotype's Monophoto system, for instance), proportional scaling was implemented: the larger the type size specified, the tighter the spacing (an automatic feature). (For pi fonts and connecting scripts this was over-ridden by implementing a font number beginning with the figure 5, cancelling auto letterspacing.)\n\nThe Scantext 1000 system was completed by a filmsetter unit using CRT technology.\n\nFor the [[Scantext 2000]] system a new hardware platform was defined. It made use of the [[Motorola 68000]] processor series and 3.5\" disk drives. The operating system was a Unix-derivate called [[OS-9]]. The workstation Scantext 2000 Commander featured a monochrome page preview display, plus additions to the page description language which allowed the creation of graphic primitives. The [[2000 Commander]] also implemented the incorporation and display of bitmap images in conjunction with the optional flatbed scanner.\n\nThe system was completed by the filmsetter unit, a drum-based laser imagesetter with a (then massive) [[10Mb]] [[hard drive]].\n\n==Autotabs==\n\nThe Scantext system had some features which present-day typesetting software would do well to emulate: autotabs in particular were a feature ahead of their time.\nScangraphic featured both horizontal and vertical tabs which could be defined as a percentage of page size, it therefore being possible to create layouts which reconfigured themselves to new page sizes.\n\n==Vertical autotabs==\n\nThe Scantext system allowed a vertical autotab to be created at any point: at any ''ad hoc'' point in a column a command could be issued to close the current vertical tab; it was then possible, for instance, to type a command to box-in or to scribe vertical rules to fill the current working tab, even though its dimensions were unknown.\n\n==Fonts==\n\nScantext Bodytypes were scanned with a video camera at a typical resolution of 512 lines. It is worth noting that, although font editing was pixel-based, character outlines were vectorized in software, thus allowing continuous scaling of any character up to 72 point / 18&nbsp;mm cap height. \nFor headline setting, Scangraphic introduced a separate range of headline fonts (marketed as Supertypes) with very tight spacing (as was the style at the time). The digital outlines of these fonts were originated by the digital type foundry [[Unternehmensberatung Rubow Weber|URW]] in [[Ikarus (typography software)|Ikarus Format]] and tailored by the Scangraphic type studio. The Supertype font format itself used short vectors (multiple edit points, a legacy of Ikarus encoding, as opposed to the more minimal PostScript vectorization technique). These fonts could be scaled up to a capital height of 90&nbsp;mm. By 1991, Scangraphic had released its Supertype font library in Adobe\u2019s PostScript Type1 font format for the Apple Macintosh. This range of designs is still available today.\n\n==Barcodes==\nThe Scantext system possessed the then-unique capability to generate EAN/UPC-compliant barcodes in position on the imaged page. This was accomplished by the use of a proprietary EAN/UPC (5-numbered non-proportional) font which assigned elements of the upper and lower halves of the barcode to specific positions on the Scantext keyboard. The barcode was thus constructed in two parts (upper and lower), the operator being entirely responsible for ensuring that the correct bars were used in the correct position. This required knowledge of the three bar sets used in EAN/UPC encoding, the correct encoding sequence for each country and the computation of the required check digit.\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.scangraphic-fonts.com/shopdata/pdf/pdf_en/SG_We_about_us.pdf\n* Article on the history of the company of Scangraphic by LucDevroye with contributions by Albert-Jan Pool\n* http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/ext20.html\n* [http://www.global-type.org/Main-broch.661.0.html Company brochure presenting Scantext 2000]\n\n[[Category:Typesetting software]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n'''Scantext''' was a professional [[code-driven]] [[Digital data|digital]] [[typesetting]] system popular in the 1980s, rendered obsolete by the popularity of the personal computer and desktop publishing software.

Together with [[Moshe Koppel]] and others, he has shown how statistical analysis of word usage can determine an author's age, sex, native language, and personality type with high accuracy in English-language texts.<ref>Argamon, Shlomo, Moshe Koppel, Jonathan Fine, and Anat Rachel Shimoni. \"Gender, genre, and writing style in formal written texts.\" ''Text'' 23, no. 3 (2003): 321-346.</ref><ref>Argamon, Shlomo, Moshe Koppel, James W.

Text mining gender difference in French literature.\" Digital Humanities Quarterly 3, no. 2 (2009).</ref><ref>Argamon, Shlomo, Russell Horton, Mark Olsen, and Sterling Stuart Stein. \"Gender, Race, and Nationality in BlackDrama, 1850-2000: Mining Differences in Language Use in Authors and their Characters.\" Proceedings of Digital Humanities (2007).</ref><ref>Hota, Sobhan R., Shlomo Argamon, and Rebecca Chung. \"Gender in Shakespeare: Automatic stylistics gender character classification using syntactic, lexical and lemma features.\" Proc. Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science (DHCS) (2006).</ref> \n\nHe has also developed computational stylistic methods that provide insights into the meaning of stylistic differences. One of Argamon's key innovations for this purpose is the development of computational stylistic analysis using [[systemic functional linguistics]].<ref>Argamon, Shlomo, Casey Whitelaw, Paul Chase, Sobhan Raj Hota, Navendu Garg, and Shlomo Levitan. \"Stylistic text classification using functional lexical features.\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 58, no. 6 (2007): 802-822.</ref><ref>Argamon, Shlomo, and Moshe Koppel. \"The rest of the story: Finding meaning in stylistic variation.\" In ''The Structure of Style'', pp. 79-112.

Together with [[Moshe Koppel]] and others, he has shown how statistical analysis of word usage can determine an author's age, sex, native language, and personality type with high accuracy in English-language texts.<ref>Argamon, Shlomo, Moshe Koppel, Jonathan Fine, and Anat Rachel Shimoni. \"Gender, genre, and writing style in formal written texts.\" ''Text'' 23, no. 3 (2003): 321-346.</ref><ref>Argamon, Shlomo, Moshe Koppel, James W.

Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science (DHCS) (2006).</ref> \n\nHe has also developed computational stylistic methods that provide insights into the meaning of stylistic differences. One of Argamon's key innovations for this purpose is the development of computational stylistic analysis using [[systemic functional linguistics]].<ref>Argamon, Shlomo, Casey Whitelaw, Paul Chase, Sobhan Raj Hota, Navendu Garg, and Shlomo Levitan. \"Stylistic text classification using functional lexical features.\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 58, no. 6 (2007): 802-822.</ref><ref>Argamon, Shlomo, and Moshe Koppel. \"The rest of the story: Finding meaning in stylistic variation.\" In ''The Structure of Style'', pp. 79-112.

A sister network, [[Weatherscan]], is a [[digital cable]] and satellite service that offers 24-hour automated local forecasts and [[Doppler weather radar|radar]] imagery.\n\nThe Weather Channel's former parent company, [[the Weather Company]] (part of [[IBM]] since 2016), also provides forecasts for terrestrial and [[satellite radio]] stations, [[newspaper]]s, [[mobile app]]s and [[website]]s, including an extensive online presence at [[weather.com]].<ref name=\"IBMpurchase\">{{cite news|title=IBM Finalizes Deal for Weather Channel Product and Tech Business|url=https://www.thewrap.com/ibm-finalizes-deal-for-weather-channel-product-and-tech-business/|work=[[The Wrap]]|date=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"nameofco\">{{cite news|title=The Weather Channel's Parent Company is Renamed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/business/media/weather-channels-parent-company-is-renamed.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 22, 2012|first=Brian|last=Stelter}}</ref> The Weather Channel continues to license its brand assets and weather data from IBM.<ref name=\"IBMpurchase\" />\n\n{{As of|September 2018}}, the Weather Channel was received by approximately 79.128 million households that subscribe to a pay television service throughout the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen coverage estimates for September see gains at ESPN networks, NBCSN, and NBA TV, drops at MLBN and NFLN (Cable Network Coverage Area Household Universe Estimates: September 2018)|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn-nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html|author=Andrew Bucholtz|website=Awful Announcing|publisher=[[NESN|NESN Digital]]|date=September 10, 2018|accessdate=September 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of The Weather Channel}}\nThe Weather Channel was founded on July 18, 1980,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">USPTO filings: First Use (not First Use in Commerce date on various filings, including filing w/ serial number 73369821)</ref> by television meteorologist [[John Coleman (meteorologist)|John Coleman]] (who, at the time of the channel's founding, had formerly served as a chief meteorologist at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WLS-TV]] in [[Chicago]] and as a forecaster for ''[[Good Morning America]]'') and [[Frank Batten]], then-president of the channel's original owner Landmark Communications (now [[Landmark Media Enterprises]]). The channel launched at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on May 2, 1982.  Originally, regional and local information was obtained by the [[National Weather Service]] for broadcast.  Since 2002, all forecasting has been done on-site in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pLV1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1453|title=Encyclopedia of Journalism|editor=Christopher H.

The original [[WeatherStar]] technology has been upgraded on larger cable systems to the [[IntelliStar]], which incorporates \"Vocal Local\" to announce current conditions, weather bulletins and detailed local forecasts. Subscribers of satellite, [[IPTV]] and some smaller cable providers originally saw only a roundup of local TWC-sourced forecasts for major cities across the U.S., as well as national and regional [[weather satellite|satellite]] and radar images, and severe weather watch and warning maps when active. However, satellite customers with newer systems or [[interactive TV]] receivers have the choice of \"roundups\" or localized forecasts. For both cable and satellite viewers, popular music (formerly [[smooth jazz]]) plays in the background during these segments. Some older WeatherStar units were still in use by small cable companies that couldn't afford to upgrade to the IntelliStar. The WeatherStar units are also able to overlay text-based local contact information over the national feed during certain business advertisements aired on the channel.\n\nThe Weather Channel operates a service based on modified versions of the WeatherStar technology called [[Weatherscan]], a separate non-network [[TV channel]] which constantly displays local and regional conditions and forecasts, and on some cable systems, advertisements.\n\nThe Weather Channel also runs websites in [[Latin America]] (''Canal de Tiempo''), [[Brazil]] (''Canal do Tempo''), the [[United Kingdom]] (''Weather Channel''), [[France]] (''M\u00e9t\u00e9o 123'') and [[Germany]] (''Wetter 123''). TWC only runs its U.S. channel, although it does produce international forecasts. The Weather Channel also has Weather stations in national universities of the USA (MIT, [[University of California]]), UK ([[University of Oxford]], [[Lancaster University]]) and Global Meteo Station at the [[North Pole]] and [[International Space Station]].\n\nA definitive history of the network, ''The Weather Channel: The Improbable Rise of a Media Phenomenon'', by Jeffrey L. Cruikshank and network co-founder Frank Batten, was published by Harvard Business Press in May 2002, in honor of TWC's 20th anniversary.\n\n====Sale to NBCUniversal, Bain, and Blackstone====\nOn January 3, 2008, [[Landmark Communications]] put the Weather Channel and its assets up for sale.<ref name=\"landmarksale\">{{cite web|author=The Guardian|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6595811.html|title=The forecast is good for The Weather Channel, on sale for $5bn|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref> On July 6, 2008, [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]], [[Bain Capital]] and [[Blackstone Group]] agreed to jointly purchase the Weather Channel from Landmark, making it the channel's first ownership change in 26 years.<ref name=\"b&c\">{{cite web|author=Robert Marich|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6595811.html|title=The Weather Channel Sale Wraps|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> The sale was finalized on September 12, 2008.

With the exception of Deon, all had been on the air for more than ten years, and three of them had been employed by the network for more than twenty years. In July 2010, the Weather Channel terminated Bill Keneely, the last of the original on-camera meteorologists who appeared on the network's first broadcasts in 1982. In December of that year, the network also laid off on-camera meteorologist [[Nicole Mitchell (meteorologist)|Nicole Mitchell]], who later would file a lawsuit against the Weather Channel in 2012, alleging that she had been terminated because the channel's new owners disapproved of the time required by her simultaneous duties as a Captain in the [[U.S. Air Force Reserve]] as one of the \"[[Hurricane Hunters]]\" team;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/18857115/article-Suit-alleges-Weather-Channel-Star-was-fired-for-military-service |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128125024/http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/18857115/article-Suit-alleges-Weather-Channel-Star-was-fired-for-military-service |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Marietta Daily Journal - Suit alleges Weather Channel Star was fired for military service |publisher=[[Marietta Daily Journal|MDJ Online]] |date=June 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}</ref> such reserve duties are protected by U.S. law (Mitchell later served as the chief meteorologist at [[Al Jazeera America]], which for a time also employed Eboni Deon).\n\nInevitably, the merger of NBC on-air meteorologists began in May 2009. Former NBC Weather Plus meteorologist Todd Santos joined the Weather Channel on May 2 of that year. [[Al Roker]] of NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' began hosting a one-hour morning program called ''[[Wake Up With Al]]'', alongside meteorologist Stephanie Abrams later in the summer. However, for New York City-based forecasting operations (those utilized for forecasts on [[MSNBC]] and [[CNBC]], for instance), the former NBC Weather Plus forecasting, radar and graphics systems remain in place, with banners changed to fit the Weather Channel's graphics scheme.

On March 10, 2015, Verizon [[FiOS]] dropped the Weather Channel and WeatherScan for their rival [[AccuWeather]].\n\nOn September 9, 2015, the channel announced a phased overhaul of its programming schedule during 2016, in which the channel would gradually shift its focus back towards a forecast-based lineup; the channel cancelled ''Wake Up with Al'' (citing high production costs as it was produced in New York city rather than Atlanta) and announced that ''AMHQ'' would be reformatted as a weather-focused program (eliminating lifestyle segments), with [[Stephanie Abrams]] taking over as host while original host Sam Champion would become a contributor for its prime time schedule starting November 2. The network also announced it would no longer greenlight original long-form programming, and expand live forecast programming on its schedule throughout 2016 once all remaining long-form programs already in development conclude their runs. In a memo sent out to network staff by Weather Company CEO David Kenny, it cited the refocusing towards weather-based programs was done on the basis that \"our most passionate fans come to us for the weather and the science behind the weather, not our original shows.\" Around 50 TWC employees \u2013 including production, engineering, and financial staff \u2013 were laid off, and the television channel's budget was reduced to focus investments on the company's Internet and mobile properties.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sam Champion loses show in major Weather Channel shakeup|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/09/media/weather-channel-sam-champion/index.html|author=Brian Stelter|website=CNN Money|publisher=Time Warner|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Champion-to-primetime\">{{cite news|title=Weather Channel\u2019s Sam Champion moving to primetime; Stephanie Abrams joining AMHQ|url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/09/weather-channels-sam-champion-moving-to-primetime-stephanie-abrams-joining-amhq/|author=Rodney Ho|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|publisher=Cox Enterprises|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Channel Cuts Shows, Personnel, In Stormy Operating Climate|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/weather-channel-sam-champion-1201588748/|author=Brian Steinberg|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"TWC cuts shows\">{{cite news|title=Weather Channel cuts shows and staff amid uncertain future|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-weather-channel-cuts-20150909-story.html|author=Stephen Battaglio|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe channel's original format was akin to that of a news and information cable network. Since the creation of the series ''[[Atmospheres (TV series)|Atmospheres]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Storm Stories]]'' in 2003, the Weather Channel had seen a gradual transition toward a mix of weather forecast programming and weather-related entertainment programming that paralleled the launch of sister network [[Weatherscan]], the evolution of the always-on \"L\" bar/weather ticker, the development of weather.com and popular branded mobile phone applications, and the increased viewing and interest in documentary programs on the topic of weather. In November 2013, the channel introduced a new initiative of \"weather all the time\" in response to the criticism; all original programming \u2013 which was rebranded under the tagline ''Natural Drama'' \u2013 now had direct relevance to weather-related subjects, and the network reemphasized its promise to interrupt original programming either regionally or nationally during major weather events; in addition, the Weather Channel extended the display of its [[lower third|lower display line]] (which also experienced a design revamp as part of the introduction of a new graphics package) to commercial breaks and through entire broadcasts of its original programs.<ref name=wp-backtoweather>{{cite news |title=The Weather Channel is getting back to weather, sort of|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/11/14/the-weather-channel-is-getting-back-to-weather-sort-of/|author=Jason Samenow|work=Washington Post|date=November 14, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, reports surfaced that the Weather Company's owners were considering a sale of all or part of the venture, having hired [[Morgan Stanley]] and PJT Partners to explore their options.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weather Channel Owners Hire Banks To Explore Sale \u2013 Report|url=https://deadline.com/2015/08/weather-channel-sale-possible-nbcuniversal-bain-capital-1201502017/|author=Erik Pedersen|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> On October 28, 2015, it was announced that [[IBM]] would acquire most of the Weather Company's assets, including weather.com, Weather Underground, the related mobile applications, and their underlying data platforms, for an undisclosed amount.<ref name=nyt-ibmtwc /> IBM plans to leverage its [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] technology as part of the acquisition, foreseeing its use for weather analytics and predictions.

TWC also operates websites that provide localized forecasts in [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Latin America]] and the [[United Kingdom]], but some of these sites apparently have not been developed further since 2003. the Weather Channel also shares radar imagery and forecasts with [[the Weather Network]] in Canada, particularly for the Weather Channel's Canadian forecasts.\n* A U.K. version of the Weather Channel operated from September 1, 1996 to January 30, 1998, when it was shut down due to low viewership. It shared channel space with [[Sky Movies Gold]]/[[Sky Box Office|Sky Box Office 2]], [[The Racing Channel]] and [[Galavisi\u00f3n (USA)|Galavision]], airing for five hours a day. It was designed for cable as it had local weather information for specific regions; in some areas, it was carried on cable providers 24 hours a day.\n* TWC also operated [[the Weather Channel Latin America]], a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] network serving [[Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[South America]]. This network launched in 1996 and an accompanying [[Brazil]]ian [[Brazilian Portuguese|Portuguese]]-language feed launched in 1998; it ceased operations on December 20, 2002 due to budget cuts. The channel's three original on-camera weather presenters were Paola Elorza, Sal Morales, and Mari Carmen Ramos; all three left the channel within a year of its launch and respectively went on to work for [[Univision]] in Miami, [[Telemundo]] in Los Angeles, and [[CNN International]] in Atlanta.\n\n==Local on the 8s==\n{{Main|Local on the 8s}}\nSince its inception, the Weather Channel has broadcast segments providing local weather observations and forecasts generated by [[WeatherStar]] systems (\"STAR\" being an acronym for Satellite Transponder Addressable Receiver), proprietary computer units that are installed at the [[cable television headend|headends]] of individual cable providers. Until 1995, the forecast segments aired at various times each hour, but are currently shown at times ending in \"8\" \u2013 as such, in 1996 (although it would not be used full-time until 2002), the channel adopted \"Local on the 8s\" as the title for the segments (though local forecast segments aired on the channel are reduced to once per half-hour whenever non-forecast programs air). With the introduction of the IntelliStar system (the sixth-generation STAR system, which was introduced in 2002), traffic information was also generated that provided roadway flow, construction and accident information for [[metropolitan area]]s where [[traffic.com]] (via its TrafficPulse service) provides traffic data; however, this feature was eliminated from the IntelliStar's programmed \"flavors\" (the arrangements of specialized segments played during individual local forecasts) when traffic.com ended its content agreement with TWC in 2010.\n\nThe WeatherStar systems also utilize a Lower Display Line (LDL) that appears at the bottom of the screen during all programming (until November 2013, it had been limited to only local forecasts and national programming, while being removed from the screen during commercial breaks), providing current conditions for a specific location and two or three towns within 15 miles, almanac data and forecasts on cable headends using the IntelliStar system, and only current conditions and forecasts on cable headends using STAR models from [[WeatherStar XL]] and older. WeatherStar units also allow cable providers to scroll [[text messaging|text messages]] when in use, including the capability to broadcast severe weather advisories and warnings in effect for the jurisdiction in which the WeatherStar system's cable headend is located and its immediate surrounding area.\n\n==Related services==\n===Television===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n! style=\"background:darkRed;\"| Service\n! style=\"background:darkRed;\"| Description\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:200pt;\"|'''The Weather Channel HD''' || The Weather Channel launched a [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[simulcast]] feed \u2013 which broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format \u2013 on September 26, 2007, initially available on [[DirecTV]]. {{As of|2014}}, all of the network's programming is currently produced in high definition (with the exception of ''[[It Could Happen Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Full Force Nature]]'' and older episodes of ''[[Storm Stories]]''), which is presented on the [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] channel in a modified [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] format that fills space that would usually be filled by black bars with weather information provided by the Lower Display Line at the bottom of the screen. The Weather Channel HD is carried on most major cable and satellite providers (such as [[Comcast Xfinity]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cox Communications]], [[Cablevision]], [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Charter Communications]], [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]]), many of which added the HD feed throughout the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.\n\nWhen the HD feed was launched, none of the channel's programming was actually presented in high definition, outside of a national \"satellite\" version of the \"Local on the 8s\" segment; ''[[Epic Conditions]]'' and ''[[WeatherVentures]]'' became the channel's first two programs to be presented in HD, when they premiered on October 1, 2007. TWC began broadcasting studio programming in high definition on June 2, 2008, with the introduction of a new studio that features various environmentally friendly technologies.\n\nThe IntelliStar 2, the seventh-generation STAR system and the first to generate graphical weather data in HD, was officially released in July 2010 (although similar to previous recent STAR systems, among its modifications include an animated Lower Display Line and a Vocal Local narration track recorded by TWC meteorologist [[Jim Cantore]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The system was gradually rolled out to major U.S. cable providers strictly for use on the HD feed, and would not replace existing operational STAR units from IntelliStar and older used on TWC's standard definition feed or Weatherscan, making it one of the few channels which by necessity does not have an \"autotune to HD\" version for providers that utilize set-top boxes allowing HD tuning to standard definition channel positions, unless the HD version has local forecast capabilities. As of August 2015, some providers (such as Comcast) are using the IntelliStar 2 on the standard definition channel in some locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Channels-and-Programming/No-local-information-on-The-Weather-Channel/m-p/2562153/highlight/true#M62512|title=No local information on The Weather Channel|publisher=[[Comcast]] (official forum)|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> DirecTV began carrying the \"Local on the 8s\" segment in HD via an app on set-top boxes on September 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/356939-DirecTV_Goes_HD_With_Weather_Channel_s_Interactive_Apps.php|author=Todd Spangler |title=Multichannel News October 6, 2009 DirecTV Goes HD With Weather Channel's Interactive Apps \u2013 Operator Says SD Version Has Generated Almost 1 billion Impressions In One Year|magazine=[[Multichannel News]]|date=October 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:200pt;\"|'''The Weather Channel on Demand''' || The Weather Channel on Demand is the channel's [[video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, offering a selection of episodes of its original series and original [[television special|specials]] to digital cable and IPTV providers. Unlike the linear television channel and its sister website, the service does not provide national or local weather forecasts.\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:200pt;\"|'''[[Weatherscan]]''' || Weatherscan (originally called Weatherscan Local until 2003) is a companion digital cable and satellite channel that was launched in 1999, which maintains a format consisting of local weather forecasts in a continuous loop uninterrupted by commercials. Available in fewer markets than the Weather Channel, it is primarily available on the digital tiers of some cable providers (however, certain systems carry Weatherscan on a basic tier, where the Weather Channel is traditionally carried); a separate feed for satellite subscribers launched on [[Dish Network]] in the summer of 2010. Weatherscan's forecast products are generated by an IntelliStar unit at the cable provider's headend, which is configured differently than those systems used by the Weather Channel; the systems feature different graphics and include additional weather products. Weatherscan displays an \"L\"-bar (similar to that used by the now-defunct NBC Weather Plus) that provides current conditions and weather forecasts for a particular location and its surrounding area at all times during programming, with weather information also being shown on the top right two-thirds of the screen.\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:200pt;\"|'''[[Local Now]]''' || Local Now is a companion [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] channel that launched on January 25, 2016. Similar in format to Weatherscan, the service maintains a format consisting of local weather forecasts, traffic reports, and news headlines as well as local news and sports in a continuous loop.

Both services run regional forecasts on a single station, and operate several individual stations providing combined local weather and traffic information for major metropolitan areas.\n\nTWC also maintains content partnerships with a number of local U.S. radio stations to provide local forecasts, using announcers separate from the meteorologists seen on the television channel. For some affiliates, the Weather Channel provides a limited amount of live coverage during local [[severe weather]] events (with the Georgia-based announcers connected via [[ISDN]]). Distribution of TWC radio content is currently handled by [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]].\n\nSimilarly, the Weather Channel also provides weather reports for a number of newspapers around the United States. This included a half-page national forecast for ''[[USA Today]]'', for which TWC provided content until September 2012, when rival [[AccuWeather]] replaced the Weather Channel as the paper's forecast provider<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/usa-today-accuweather-partnership/73810|title=AccuWeather Announces New Partnership With USA Today|publisher=[[AccuWeather]]|date=September 17, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}</ref> with TWC's forecasts being replaced with AccuWeather's on the USAToday.com website one month later.\n\n===Online services===\n{{see also|weather.com}}\nTWC provided numerous customized forecasts for online users through its website, weather.com, including home and garden, and event planning forecasts.

Cell phone customers could also receive local forecasts from TWC sent to their mobile handsets via [[Short message service|SMS]] by sending a [[text message]] with their [[ZIP code]] to 42278 (which spells \"4cast\"). The Weather Channel also provided weather forecasts for other online services including [[Yahoo!]].<ref>{{cite web|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|url= http://weather.yahoo.com|title=CNN, Weather Channel win on the Web|author=Kristi E. Swartz|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, The Weather Channel maintained apps for the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Apple TV]], [[Kindle Fire]], and [[Windows]] mobile and tablet platforms. TWC formerly maintained two versions of its mobile applications: a free version that incorporates advertising and a pay version called \"TWC Max\" that does not feature advertising, [http://feedback.weather.com/knowledgebase/articles/279577-end-of-life-cancellation-notice-desktop-max the latter was discontinued in favor of an all ad-supported model on January 6, 2014]. Aside from location-based weather forecast information, the apps provided radar maps, and tropical and seasonal updates, as well as [[social media]] related functions that track weather-related [[Twitter]] messages and allow users to send [[Facebook]] friends severe weather alerts. The channel also disseminated severe weather information, and photos and videos submitted by meteorologists and viewers, on its Twitter feed ([https://www.twitter.com/twcbreaking @TWCBreaking], which also served as a [[hashtag]] usable for posts).\n\nIn July 2012, [[the Weather Company]] (former owner of the Weather Channel) purchased competing weather website [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]]. While the Weather Channel already had success with its own mobile apps, it planned to use Weather Underground's large network of digital forecasting and tracking websites to bolster its digital growth. Weather Underground operates separately from the Weather Channel and continues to provide its own forecasts, though its website incorporates some weather news and video content from TWC.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2143|title=Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog : Wunderground.com sold to The Weather Channel Companies &#124; Weather Underground|publisher=[[Weather Underground (weather service)|Wunderground]]|date=July 2, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe website [[weather.com]] and most of the Weather Channel's digital assets were sold to [[IBM]] in January 2016.<ref name=\"IBMpurchase\" />\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by The Weather Channel}}\nWeather forecast programming made up TWC's entire schedule prior to its incorporation of weather-related original programming \u2013 referred in network promotional materials and press releases as \"long-form programming\" \u2013 in 2000 (with few breakaways from its forecast programs prior to then, outside of educational program ''[[The Weather Classroom]]'', an original program produced as part of the cable television industry's [[Cable in the Classroom]] initiative). The number of hours devoted to TWC's in-studio forecast programs have steadily eroded since then. The network's live studio programs are aired regularly from 5:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays and 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekends and holidays. ''[[America's Morning Headquarters|AMHQ]]'' airs weekdays between 5:00 and 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time; these are followed by the Weather Channel's flagship program, ''[[Weather Center Live]]'' which is aired from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern, and the network's evening program, ''Weather Underground'', which airs from 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern. On weekends, ''AMHQ'' is aired from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;a.m., followed by ''Weekend Recharge'' from 9:00&nbsp;am to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. On April 21, 2018, Weekend Recharge began airing for an additional hour until 1:00&nbsp;p.m, following the previous week's TV end to Weather Geeks, which is now done in the form of a podcast.\n\nThe Weather Channel also broadcast original weather-related documentary/entertainment series and [[television special|specials]]. These programs ran throughout the rest of the schedule. During severe weather events affecting portions of the United States, the Weather Channel may preempt original programming in favor of airing extended coverage under the umbrella title ''Weather Center Live'' (which move the color of the word \"LIVE\" from blue to red) to provide long-form coverage and analysis until its aftermath; in some events, the on-air graphics (including Lower Display Line) can go black-and-red (similar to colors that WCL uses); pre-emptions vary between local (isolated to viewers in the region affected by a particular weather event) and nationwide, depending upon the impact of the weather phenomenon/story and if a local provider utilizes a later model WeatherStar unit that allows the use of dual feeds that can substitute programming with long-form weather coverage in a given area. TWC normally utilizes a different music theme for these events, dubbed \"Storm Alert Mode\", used for both WCL and LOT8's.\n\n===Movies===\nIn a move that caused controversy with many longtime viewers, the Weather Channel began airing weather-related movies on Friday nights on October 30, 2009. The first feature to be broadcast by the channel was the 2000 film ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/tvbizwire/2009/10/the-weather-channel-to-begin-s.php|title=October 21, 2009 It's Always Fair Weather... on The Weather Channel|magazine=[[TVWeek]]|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter December 2009, these weekly movies were discontinued for the time being in favor of running ''[[Weather Center (2009)|Weather Center]]'', which already aired throughout primetime during the rest of the work week. Despite the controversy, the Friday night film block resumed on March 26, 2010 under the title \"Flick and a Forecast,\" co-hosted by the Weather Channel meteorologist Jen Carfagno and MSNBC contributor [[Tour\u00e9]], with the documentary ''[[Into Thin Air|Into Thin Air: Deaths on Everest]]''. During the broadcasts, the Lower Display Line that normally appears on TWC shows to provide local weather information (with breakaways during forecast and most long-form programs only for commercial breaks) was removed, appearing only a few times each hour during the film as a substitute for the standard \"Local on the 8s\" segments, with a translucent TWC logo bug appearing at other times during the film when the LDL was not on-screen.\n\nWhile the films shown within the \"Flick and a Forecast\" block were weather-related in some form, some films featured (such as ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' and ''[[Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)|Deep Blue Sea]]'') had only a minimal tie to weather. On May 31, 2010, ''[http://www.newsblues.com NewsBlues]'' reported the Weather Channel's decision to cancel the movie block, due in part to viewer criticism of movies being shown on what is intended as a news and information channel, as well as a snafu that occurred during an April 2010 tornado outbreak that led to a scheduled movie being aired instead of wall-to-wall severe weather coverage. The \"Flick and a Forecast\" presentations were then replaced by an additional hour of ''Weather Center'' and a two-hour block of long-form original programs.\n\n==Notable current personalities==\n<!-- Only those with articles can be listed per WP:LISTPEOPLE. -->\n\n===On-camera meteorologists===\n* [[Stephanie Abrams]]: ''[[AMHQ]]'' (2003\u2013present)\n* [[Mike Bettes]]: Meteorologist, anchor of ''Weather Underground'' and lead tornado tracker (2003\u2013present)\n* [[Jen Carfagno]]: ''[[AMHQ]]'' (2003\u2013present)\n* Kelly Cass: ''AMHQ Weekend'' (2000\u2013present)\n* [[Paul Goodloe]]: ''Weekend Recharge'' (1999\u2013present)\n* [[Reynolds Wolf]]: ''AMHQ Weekend'' (2012\u2013present)\n\n===Specialists===\n* [[Jim Cantore]]: Storm specialist, ''AMHQ'' co-anchor (1986\u2013present)\n* [[Gregory S.

This logo was revised in 1996, with the corners becoming less rounded and the logo becoming slightly flat. The ''weather.com'' URL text was permanently added underneath the logo in 1999. On August 15, 2005, the logo was overhauled again; the logo became a straight-edged square with no white trim on the edge and \"The Weather Channel\" text became oriented in title-case and left-justified, similar to its Canadian sister channel [[the Weather Network]]. A 25th-anniversary logo used in 2007 featured a white square edged in blue connected to the current logo with the text \"25 YEARS\" inside it in blue.\n\nWhen NBCUniversal acquired the network in 2008, the network has participated in the \"Green is Universal\" campaign, which occurs twice a year, usually during April and November. The network's logo changes to a shade of green as part of the campaign promoting environmental conservation. Since 2014, the network has utilized a red-colored version of the logo during hurricane coverage; the red logo has also appeared during severe tornado outbreaks.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=200 | height=80 | lines=2\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:The Weather Channel original logo.png|\n alt1=First logo\n |May 2, 1982\u2013October 1996\n|File:The Weather Channel logo 1996-2005.svg|\n alt2=Second logo\n |October 1996\u2013August 15, 2005\n|File:The Weather Channel logo 2005-present.svg|\n alt3=Logo for \"Green is Universal\" and \"Earth Week\" campaigns\n |August 15, 2005\u2013present\n|File:The Weather Channel Green Logo.png|\n alt4=Third logo\n |''Green is Universal''/''Earth Week'' logo\n|File:TWC HD logo.svg|\n alt5=Logo for HD simulcast feed\n |The Weather Channel HD logo, 2008\u2013present\n}}\n\n===Slogans===\n* '''1982\u20131983''': We Take the Weather Seriously, But Not Ourselves\n* '''1983\u20131984''': The Cable Television Network for America's Lifestyle\n* '''1984\u20131986''': Weatherproofing America\n* '''1986\u20131991''': You Need Us, the Weather Channel, for Everything You Do\n* '''1991\u20131996''': Weather You Can Always Turn To\n* '''1996\u20131998''': No Place on Earth Has Better Weather\n* '''1998\u20132001''': Keeping You Ahead of the Storm\n* '''2001\u20132005''': Live By It\n* '''2005\u20132008''': Bringing Weather to Life\n* '''June 2\u2013late 2008''': The Weather Has Never Looked Better\n* '''2009\u2013early 2010''': The Sounds of Weather.

FiOS customers have enjoyed a bundle of services from the Weather Channel including the network, Weatherscan, On-Demand, a Weather Widget and streaming on mobile devices.

This coverage resulted in the Weather Channel being the only major cable network to grow in February.\"\n\nThe Weather Channel had earlier signed renewal agreements with major providers that are members of the National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC), including [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Cox Communications]]. However, representatives for the channel claimed to be shocked that \"Verizon FiOS would deny their subscribers access to the best live weather coverage and expertise that only the Weather Channel can provide.\" While Verizon claimed it was a long-term business decision (instead of a carriage dispute) that it made, the Weather Channel launched a campaign, originally urging viewers to contact FiOS about restoring the cable channel and its services.

The channel launched at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on May 2, 1982.  Originally, regional and local information was obtained by the [[National Weather Service]] for broadcast.  Since 2002, all forecasting has been done on-site in Atlanta.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pLV1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1453|title=Encyclopedia of Journalism|editor=Christopher H.

The original [[WeatherStar]] technology has been upgraded on larger cable systems to the [[IntelliStar]], which incorporates \"Vocal Local\" to announce current conditions, weather bulletins and detailed local forecasts. Subscribers of satellite, [[IPTV]] and some smaller cable providers originally saw only a roundup of local TWC-sourced forecasts for major cities across the U.S., as well as national and regional [[weather satellite|satellite]] and radar images, and severe weather watch and warning maps when active. However, satellite customers with newer systems or [[interactive TV]] receivers have the choice of \"roundups\" or localized forecasts. For both cable and satellite viewers, popular music (formerly [[smooth jazz]]) plays in the background during these segments. Some older WeatherStar units were still in use by small cable companies that couldn't afford to upgrade to the IntelliStar. The WeatherStar units are also able to overlay text-based local contact information over the national feed during certain business advertisements aired on the channel.\n\nThe Weather Channel operates a service based on modified versions of the WeatherStar technology called [[Weatherscan]], a separate non-network [[TV channel]] which constantly displays local and regional conditions and forecasts, and on some cable systems, advertisements.\n\nThe Weather Channel also runs websites in [[Latin America]] (''Canal de Tiempo''), [[Brazil]] (''Canal do Tempo''), the [[United Kingdom]] (''Weather Channel''), [[France]] (''M\u00e9t\u00e9o 123'') and [[Germany]] (''Wetter 123''). TWC only runs its U.S. channel, although it does produce international forecasts. The Weather Channel also has Weather stations in national universities of the USA (MIT, [[University of California]]), UK ([[University of Oxford]], [[Lancaster University]]) and Global Meteo Station at the [[North Pole]] and [[International Space Station]].\n\nA definitive history of the network, ''The Weather Channel: The Improbable Rise of a Media Phenomenon'', by Jeffrey L. Cruikshank and network co-founder Frank Batten, was published by Harvard Business Press in May 2002, in honor of TWC's 20th anniversary.\n\n====Sale to NBCUniversal, Bain, and Blackstone====\nOn January 3, 2008, [[Landmark Communications]] put the Weather Channel and its assets up for sale.<ref name=\"landmarksale\">{{cite web|author=The Guardian|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6595811.html|title=The forecast is good for The Weather Channel, on sale for $5bn|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref> On July 6, 2008, [[NBCUniversal|NBC Universal]], [[Bain Capital]] and [[Blackstone Group]] agreed to jointly purchase the Weather Channel from Landmark, making it the channel's first ownership change in 26 years.<ref name=\"b&c\">{{cite web|author=Robert Marich|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6595811.html|title=The Weather Channel Sale Wraps|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|accessdate=September 26, 2008}}</ref> The sale was finalized on September 12, 2008.

With the exception of Deon, all had been on the air for more than ten years, and three of them had been employed by the network for more than twenty years. In July 2010, the Weather Channel terminated Bill Keneely, the last of the original on-camera meteorologists who appeared on the network's first broadcasts in 1982. In December of that year, the network also laid off on-camera meteorologist [[Nicole Mitchell (meteorologist)|Nicole Mitchell]], who later would file a lawsuit against the Weather Channel in 2012, alleging that she had been terminated because the channel's new owners disapproved of the time required by her simultaneous duties as a Captain in the [[U.S. Air Force Reserve]] as one of the \"[[Hurricane Hunters]]\" team;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/18857115/article-Suit-alleges-Weather-Channel-Star-was-fired-for-military-service |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128125024/http://www.mdjonline.com/view/full_story/18857115/article-Suit-alleges-Weather-Channel-Star-was-fired-for-military-service |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Marietta Daily Journal - Suit alleges Weather Channel Star was fired for military service |publisher=[[Marietta Daily Journal|MDJ Online]] |date=June 5, 2012 |accessdate=September 22, 2012 }}</ref> such reserve duties are protected by U.S. law (Mitchell later served as the chief meteorologist at [[Al Jazeera America]], which for a time also employed Eboni Deon).\n\nInevitably, the merger of NBC on-air meteorologists began in May 2009. Former NBC Weather Plus meteorologist Todd Santos joined the Weather Channel on May 2 of that year. [[Al Roker]] of NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' began hosting a one-hour morning program called ''[[Wake Up With Al]]'', alongside meteorologist Stephanie Abrams later in the summer. However, for New York City-based forecasting operations (those utilized for forecasts on [[MSNBC]] and [[CNBC]], for instance), the former NBC Weather Plus forecasting, radar and graphics systems remain in place, with banners changed to fit the Weather Channel's graphics scheme.

On March 10, 2015, Verizon [[FiOS]] dropped the Weather Channel and WeatherScan for their rival [[AccuWeather]].\n\nOn September 9, 2015, the channel announced a phased overhaul of its programming schedule during 2016, in which the channel would gradually shift its focus back towards a forecast-based lineup; the channel cancelled ''Wake Up with Al'' (citing high production costs as it was produced in New York city rather than Atlanta) and announced that ''AMHQ'' would be reformatted as a weather-focused program (eliminating lifestyle segments), with [[Stephanie Abrams]] taking over as host while original host Sam Champion would become a contributor for its prime time schedule starting November 2. The network also announced it would no longer greenlight original long-form programming, and expand live forecast programming on its schedule throughout 2016 once all remaining long-form programs already in development conclude their runs. In a memo sent out to network staff by Weather Company CEO David Kenny, it cited the refocusing towards weather-based programs was done on the basis that \"our most passionate fans come to us for the weather and the science behind the weather, not our original shows.\" Around 50 TWC employees \u2013 including production, engineering, and financial staff \u2013 were laid off, and the television channel's budget was reduced to focus investments on the company's Internet and mobile properties.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sam Champion loses show in major Weather Channel shakeup|url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/09/media/weather-channel-sam-champion/index.html|author=Brian Stelter|website=CNN Money|publisher=Time Warner|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Champion-to-primetime\">{{cite news|title=Weather Channel\u2019s Sam Champion moving to primetime; Stephanie Abrams joining AMHQ|url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/09/weather-channels-sam-champion-moving-to-primetime-stephanie-abrams-joining-amhq/|author=Rodney Ho|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|publisher=Cox Enterprises|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Weather Channel Cuts Shows, Personnel, In Stormy Operating Climate|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/weather-channel-sam-champion-1201588748/|author=Brian Steinberg|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"TWC cuts shows\">{{cite news|title=Weather Channel cuts shows and staff amid uncertain future|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-weather-channel-cuts-20150909-story.html|author=Stephen Battaglio|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=September 9, 2015|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe channel's original format was akin to that of a news and information cable network. Since the creation of the series ''[[Atmospheres (TV series)|Atmospheres]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Storm Stories]]'' in 2003, the Weather Channel had seen a gradual transition toward a mix of weather forecast programming and weather-related entertainment programming that paralleled the launch of sister network [[Weatherscan]], the evolution of the always-on \"L\" bar/weather ticker, the development of weather.com and popular branded mobile phone applications, and the increased viewing and interest in documentary programs on the topic of weather. In November 2013, the channel introduced a new initiative of \"weather all the time\" in response to the criticism; all original programming \u2013 which was rebranded under the tagline ''Natural Drama'' \u2013 now had direct relevance to weather-related subjects, and the network reemphasized its promise to interrupt original programming either regionally or nationally during major weather events; in addition, the Weather Channel extended the display of its [[lower third|lower display line]] (which also experienced a design revamp as part of the introduction of a new graphics package) to commercial breaks and through entire broadcasts of its original programs.<ref name=wp-backtoweather>{{cite news |title=The Weather Channel is getting back to weather, sort of|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/11/14/the-weather-channel-is-getting-back-to-weather-sort-of/|author=Jason Samenow|work=Washington Post|date=November 14, 2013|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2015, reports surfaced that the Weather Company's owners were considering a sale of all or part of the venture, having hired [[Morgan Stanley]] and PJT Partners to explore their options.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weather Channel Owners Hire Banks To Explore Sale \u2013 Report|url=https://deadline.com/2015/08/weather-channel-sale-possible-nbcuniversal-bain-capital-1201502017/|author=Erik Pedersen|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=August 19, 2015}}</ref> On October 28, 2015, it was announced that [[IBM]] would acquire most of the Weather Company's assets, including weather.com, Weather Underground, the related mobile applications, and their underlying data platforms, for an undisclosed amount.<ref name=nyt-ibmtwc /> IBM plans to leverage its [[Watson (computer)|Watson]] technology as part of the acquisition, foreseeing its use for weather analytics and predictions.

TWC also operates websites that provide localized forecasts in [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Latin America]] and the [[United Kingdom]], but some of these sites apparently have not been developed further since 2003. the Weather Channel also shares radar imagery and forecasts with [[the Weather Network]] in Canada, particularly for the Weather Channel's Canadian forecasts.\n* A U.K. version of the Weather Channel operated from September 1, 1996 to January 30, 1998, when it was shut down due to low viewership. It shared channel space with [[Sky Movies Gold]]/[[Sky Box Office|Sky Box Office 2]], [[The Racing Channel]] and [[Galavisi\u00f3n (USA)|Galavision]], airing for five hours a day. It was designed for cable as it had local weather information for specific regions; in some areas, it was carried on cable providers 24 hours a day.\n* TWC also operated [[the Weather Channel Latin America]], a [[Spanish language|Spanish-language]] network serving [[Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[South America]]. This network launched in 1996 and an accompanying [[Brazil]]ian [[Brazilian Portuguese|Portuguese]]-language feed launched in 1998; it ceased operations on December 20, 2002 due to budget cuts. The channel's three original on-camera weather presenters were Paola Elorza, Sal Morales, and Mari Carmen Ramos; all three left the channel within a year of its launch and respectively went on to work for [[Univision]] in Miami, [[Telemundo]] in Los Angeles, and [[CNN International]] in Atlanta.\n\n==Local on the 8s==\n{{Main|Local on the 8s}}\nSince its inception, the Weather Channel has broadcast segments providing local weather observations and forecasts generated by [[WeatherStar]] systems (\"STAR\" being an acronym for Satellite Transponder Addressable Receiver), proprietary computer units that are installed at the [[cable television headend|headends]] of individual cable providers. Until 1995, the forecast segments aired at various times each hour, but are currently shown at times ending in \"8\" \u2013 as such, in 1996 (although it would not be used full-time until 2002), the channel adopted \"Local on the 8s\" as the title for the segments (though local forecast segments aired on the channel are reduced to once per half-hour whenever non-forecast programs air). With the introduction of the IntelliStar system (the sixth-generation STAR system, which was introduced in 2002), traffic information was also generated that provided roadway flow, construction and accident information for [[metropolitan area]]s where [[traffic.com]] (via its TrafficPulse service) provides traffic data; however, this feature was eliminated from the IntelliStar's programmed \"flavors\" (the arrangements of specialized segments played during individual local forecasts) when traffic.com ended its content agreement with TWC in 2010.\n\nThe WeatherStar systems also utilize a Lower Display Line (LDL) that appears at the bottom of the screen during all programming (until November 2013, it had been limited to only local forecasts and national programming, while being removed from the screen during commercial breaks), providing current conditions for a specific location and two or three towns within 15 miles, almanac data and forecasts on cable headends using the IntelliStar system, and only current conditions and forecasts on cable headends using STAR models from [[WeatherStar XL]] and older. WeatherStar units also allow cable providers to scroll [[text messaging|text messages]] when in use, including the capability to broadcast severe weather advisories and warnings in effect for the jurisdiction in which the WeatherStar system's cable headend is located and its immediate surrounding area.\n\n==Related services==\n===Television===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; background:#fff;\"\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n! style=\"background:darkRed;\"| Service\n! style=\"background:darkRed;\"| Description\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:200pt;\"|'''The Weather Channel HD''' || The Weather Channel launched a [[High-definition television|high definition]] [[simulcast]] feed \u2013 which broadcasts in the [[1080i]] resolution format \u2013 on September 26, 2007, initially available on [[DirecTV]]. {{As of|2014}}, all of the network's programming is currently produced in high definition (with the exception of ''[[It Could Happen Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Full Force Nature]]'' and older episodes of ''[[Storm Stories]]''), which is presented on the [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] channel in a modified [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] format that fills space that would usually be filled by black bars with weather information provided by the Lower Display Line at the bottom of the screen. The Weather Channel HD is carried on most major cable and satellite providers (such as [[Comcast Xfinity]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cox Communications]], [[Cablevision]], [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Charter Communications]], [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]]), many of which added the HD feed throughout the fourth quarter of 2007 and the first quarter of 2008.\n\nWhen the HD feed was launched, none of the channel's programming was actually presented in high definition, outside of a national \"satellite\" version of the \"Local on the 8s\" segment; ''[[Epic Conditions]]'' and ''[[WeatherVentures]]'' became the channel's first two programs to be presented in HD, when they premiered on October 1, 2007. TWC began broadcasting studio programming in high definition on June 2, 2008, with the introduction of a new studio that features various environmentally friendly technologies.\n\nThe IntelliStar 2, the seventh-generation STAR system and the first to generate graphical weather data in HD, was officially released in July 2010 (although similar to previous recent STAR systems, among its modifications include an animated Lower Display Line and a Vocal Local narration track recorded by TWC meteorologist [[Jim Cantore]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The system was gradually rolled out to major U.S. cable providers strictly for use on the HD feed, and would not replace existing operational STAR units from IntelliStar and older used on TWC's standard definition feed or Weatherscan, making it one of the few channels which by necessity does not have an \"autotune to HD\" version for providers that utilize set-top boxes allowing HD tuning to standard definition channel positions, unless the HD version has local forecast capabilities. As of August 2015, some providers (such as Comcast) are using the IntelliStar 2 on the standard definition channel in some locations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/Channels-and-Programming/No-local-information-on-The-Weather-Channel/m-p/2562153/highlight/true#M62512|title=No local information on The Weather Channel|publisher=[[Comcast]] (official forum)|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 25, 2015}}</ref> DirecTV began carrying the \"Local on the 8s\" segment in HD via an app on set-top boxes on September 29, 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/356939-DirecTV_Goes_HD_With_Weather_Channel_s_Interactive_Apps.php|author=Todd Spangler |title=Multichannel News October 6, 2009 DirecTV Goes HD With Weather Channel's Interactive Apps \u2013 Operator Says SD Version Has Generated Almost 1 billion Impressions In One Year|magazine=[[Multichannel News]]|date=October 6, 2009 |accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:200pt;\"|'''The Weather Channel on Demand''' || The Weather Channel on Demand is the channel's [[video on demand|video-on-demand]] service, offering a selection of episodes of its original series and original [[television special|specials]] to digital cable and IPTV providers.

For some affiliates, the Weather Channel provides a limited amount of live coverage during local [[severe weather]] events (with the Georgia-based announcers connected via [[ISDN]]). Distribution of TWC radio content is currently handled by [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]].\n\nSimilarly, the Weather Channel also provides weather reports for a number of newspapers around the United States. This included a half-page national forecast for ''[[USA Today]]'', for which TWC provided content until September 2012, when rival [[AccuWeather]] replaced the Weather Channel as the paper's forecast provider<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/usa-today-accuweather-partnership/73810|title=AccuWeather Announces New Partnership With USA Today|publisher=[[AccuWeather]]|date=September 17, 2012 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}</ref> with TWC's forecasts being replaced with AccuWeather's on the USAToday.com website one month later.\n\n===Online services===\n{{see also|weather.com}}\nTWC provided numerous customized forecasts for online users through its website, weather.com, including home and garden, and event planning forecasts. Third-party [[web analytics]] providers [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] and [[SimilarWeb]] rated the site as the 146th and 244th most visited website in the world respectively, as of July 2015.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/weather.com | title=Weather.com Site Overview | publisher=Alexa | accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"similar\">{{cite web | url=http://www.similarweb.com/website/weather.com | title=Weather.com Analytics | publisher=SimilarWeb | accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref> SimilarWeb rates the site as the second most visited weather website globally, attracting more than 126 million visitors per month.<ref name=\"similar\" /><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.similarweb.com/category/news_and_media/weather | title=Top 50 sites in the world for News And Media > Weather | publisher=SimilarWeb | accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIt also provided [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] access for mobile phone users, [[desktop widget]]s for quick reference by computer users, and customized weather feeds for individual websites. Cell phone customers could also receive local forecasts from TWC sent to their mobile handsets via [[Short message service|SMS]] by sending a [[text message]] with their [[ZIP code]] to 42278 (which spells \"4cast\").

Swartz|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, The Weather Channel maintained apps for the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Apple TV]], [[Kindle Fire]], and [[Windows]] mobile and tablet platforms. TWC formerly maintained two versions of its mobile applications: a free version that incorporates advertising and a pay version called \"TWC Max\" that does not feature advertising, [http://feedback.weather.com/knowledgebase/articles/279577-end-of-life-cancellation-notice-desktop-max the latter was discontinued in favor of an all ad-supported model on January 6, 2014]. Aside from location-based weather forecast information, the apps provided radar maps, and tropical and seasonal updates, as well as [[social media]] related functions that track weather-related [[Twitter]] messages and allow users to send [[Facebook]] friends severe weather alerts. The channel also disseminated severe weather information, and photos and videos submitted by meteorologists and viewers, on its Twitter feed ([https://www.twitter.com/twcbreaking @TWCBreaking], which also served as a [[hashtag]] usable for posts).\n\nIn July 2012, [[the Weather Company]] (former owner of the Weather Channel) purchased competing weather website [[Weather Underground (weather service)|Weather Underground]]. While the Weather Channel already had success with its own mobile apps, it planned to use Weather Underground's large network of digital forecasting and tracking websites to bolster its digital growth. Weather Underground operates separately from the Weather Channel and continues to provide its own forecasts, though its website incorporates some weather news and video content from TWC.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2143|title=Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog : Wunderground.com sold to The Weather Channel Companies &#124; Weather Underground|publisher=[[Weather Underground (weather service)|Wunderground]]|date=July 2, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe website [[weather.com]] and most of the Weather Channel's digital assets were sold to [[IBM]] in January 2016.<ref name=\"IBMpurchase\" />\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by The Weather Channel}}\nWeather forecast programming made up TWC's entire schedule prior to its incorporation of weather-related original programming \u2013 referred in network promotional materials and press releases as \"long-form programming\" \u2013 in 2000 (with few breakaways from its forecast programs prior to then, outside of educational program ''[[The Weather Classroom]]'', an original program produced as part of the cable television industry's [[Cable in the Classroom]] initiative). The number of hours devoted to TWC's in-studio forecast programs have steadily eroded since then. The network's live studio programs are aired regularly from 5:00&nbsp;a.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekdays and 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time on weekends and holidays. ''[[America's Morning Headquarters|AMHQ]]'' airs weekdays between 5:00 and 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time; these are followed by the Weather Channel's flagship program, ''[[Weather Center Live]]'' which is aired from 9:00&nbsp;a.m. to 5:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern, and the network's evening program, ''Weather Underground'', which airs from 5:00&nbsp;p.m. to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern. On weekends, ''AMHQ'' is aired from 6:00&nbsp;a.m. to 9:00&nbsp;a.m., followed by ''Weekend Recharge'' from 9:00&nbsp;am to 1:00&nbsp;p.m. On April 21, 2018, Weekend Recharge began airing for an additional hour until 1:00&nbsp;p.m, following the previous week's TV end to Weather Geeks, which is now done in the form of a podcast.\n\nThe Weather Channel also broadcast original weather-related documentary/entertainment series and [[television special|specials]]. These programs ran throughout the rest of the schedule. During severe weather events affecting portions of the United States, the Weather Channel may preempt original programming in favor of airing extended coverage under the umbrella title ''Weather Center Live'' (which move the color of the word \"LIVE\" from blue to red) to provide long-form coverage and analysis until its aftermath; in some events, the on-air graphics (including Lower Display Line) can go black-and-red (similar to colors that WCL uses); pre-emptions vary between local (isolated to viewers in the region affected by a particular weather event) and nationwide, depending upon the impact of the weather phenomenon/story and if a local provider utilizes a later model WeatherStar unit that allows the use of dual feeds that can substitute programming with long-form weather coverage in a given area. TWC normally utilizes a different music theme for these events, dubbed \"Storm Alert Mode\", used for both WCL and LOT8's.\n\n===Movies===\nIn a move that caused controversy with many longtime viewers, the Weather Channel began airing weather-related movies on Friday nights on October 30, 2009. The first feature to be broadcast by the channel was the 2000 film ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvweek.com/blogs/tvbizwire/2009/10/the-weather-channel-to-begin-s.php|title=October 21, 2009 It's Always Fair Weather... on The Weather Channel|magazine=[[TVWeek]]|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter December 2009, these weekly movies were discontinued for the time being in favor of running ''[[Weather Center (2009)|Weather Center]]'', which already aired throughout primetime during the rest of the work week. Despite the controversy, the Friday night film block resumed on March 26, 2010 under the title \"Flick and a Forecast,\" co-hosted by the Weather Channel meteorologist Jen Carfagno and MSNBC contributor [[Tour\u00e9]], with the documentary ''[[Into Thin Air|Into Thin Air: Deaths on Everest]]''. During the broadcasts, the Lower Display Line that normally appears on TWC shows to provide local weather information (with breakaways during forecast and most long-form programs only for commercial breaks) was removed, appearing only a few times each hour during the film as a substitute for the standard \"Local on the 8s\" segments, with a translucent TWC logo bug appearing at other times during the film when the LDL was not on-screen.\n\nWhile the films shown within the \"Flick and a Forecast\" block were weather-related in some form, some films featured (such as ''[[Misery (film)|Misery]]'' and ''[[Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)|Deep Blue Sea]]'') had only a minimal tie to weather. On May 31, 2010, ''[http://www.newsblues.com NewsBlues]'' reported the Weather Channel's decision to cancel the movie block, due in part to viewer criticism of movies being shown on what is intended as a news and information channel, as well as a snafu that occurred during an April 2010 tornado outbreak that led to a scheduled movie being aired instead of wall-to-wall severe weather coverage. The \"Flick and a Forecast\" presentations were then replaced by an additional hour of ''Weather Center'' and a two-hour block of long-form original programs.\n\n==Notable current personalities==\n<!-- Only those with articles can be listed per WP:LISTPEOPLE. -->\n\n===On-camera meteorologists===\n* [[Stephanie Abrams]]: ''[[AMHQ]]'' (2003\u2013present)\n* [[Mike Bettes]]: Meteorologist, anchor of ''Weather Underground'' and lead tornado tracker (2003\u2013present)\n* [[Jen Carfagno]]: ''[[AMHQ]]'' (2003\u2013present)\n* Kelly Cass: ''AMHQ Weekend'' (2000\u2013present)\n* [[Paul Goodloe]]: ''Weekend Recharge'' (1999\u2013present)\n* [[Reynolds Wolf]]: ''AMHQ Weekend'' (2012\u2013present)\n\n===Specialists===\n* [[Jim Cantore]]: Storm specialist, ''AMHQ'' co-anchor (1986\u2013present)\n* [[Gregory S.

This logo was revised in 1996, with the corners becoming less rounded and the logo becoming slightly flat. The ''weather.com'' URL text was permanently added underneath the logo in 1999. On August 15, 2005, the logo was overhauled again; the logo became a straight-edged square with no white trim on the edge and \"The Weather Channel\" text became oriented in title-case and left-justified, similar to its Canadian sister channel [[the Weather Network]]. A 25th-anniversary logo used in 2007 featured a white square edged in blue connected to the current logo with the text \"25 YEARS\" inside it in blue.\n\nWhen NBCUniversal acquired the network in 2008, the network has participated in the \"Green is Universal\" campaign, which occurs twice a year, usually during April and November. The network's logo changes to a shade of green as part of the campaign promoting environmental conservation. Since 2014, the network has utilized a red-colored version of the logo during hurricane coverage; the red logo has also appeared during severe tornado outbreaks.\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=\n|width=200 | height=80 | lines=2\n|align=center\n|footer=\n|File:The Weather Channel original logo.png|\n alt1=First logo\n |May 2, 1982\u2013October 1996\n|File:The Weather Channel logo 1996-2005.svg|\n alt2=Second logo\n |October 1996\u2013August 15, 2005\n|File:The Weather Channel logo 2005-present.svg|\n alt3=Logo for \"Green is Universal\" and \"Earth Week\" campaigns\n |August 15, 2005\u2013present\n|File:The Weather Channel Green Logo.png|\n alt4=Third logo\n |''Green is Universal''/''Earth Week'' logo\n|File:TWC HD logo.svg|\n alt5=Logo for HD simulcast feed\n |The Weather Channel HD logo, 2008\u2013present\n}}\n\n===Slogans===\n* '''1982\u20131983''': We Take the Weather Seriously, But Not Ourselves\n* '''1983\u20131984''': The Cable Television Network for America's Lifestyle\n* '''1984\u20131986''': Weatherproofing America\n* '''1986\u20131991''': You Need Us, the Weather Channel, for Everything You Do\n* '''1991\u20131996''': Weather You Can Always Turn To\n* '''1996\u20131998''': No Place on Earth Has Better Weather\n* '''1998\u20132001''': Keeping You Ahead of the Storm\n* '''2001\u20132005''': Live By It\n* '''2005\u20132008''': Bringing Weather to Life\n* '''June 2\u2013late 2008''': The Weather Has Never Looked Better\n* '''2009\u2013early 2010''': The Sounds of Weather.

During the 2012\u201313 season, the Weather Channel named 27 winter storms ([[November 2012 nor'easter|Athena]], Brutus, Caesar, [[December 17\u201322, 2012 North American blizzard|Draco]], [[Late December 2012 North American storm complex|Euclid]], Freyr, Gandolf, Helen, Iago, Jove, Khan, Luna, Magnus, [[February 2013 nor'easter|Nemo]], Orko, Plato, Q, [[February 2013 Great Plains blizzard|Rocky]], [[March 2013 nor'easter|Saturn]], Triton, [[Late March 2013 North American winter storm|Ukko]], Virgil, Walda, Xerxes, Yogi, Zeus and Achilles).<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter 2012-13: Named Storms from 'A' to 'Z' (and 'A' Again)|url=http://www.weather.com/news/weather-winter/named-winter-storms-2012-2013-a-to-z-20130318|work=weather.com|publisher=The Weather Channel|accessdate=June 18, 2013}}</ref> During the 2013-14 season, the Weather Channel named 26 winter storms (Atlas, Boreas, Cleon, Dion, Electra, Falco, Gemini, Hercules, Ion, Janus, Kronos, Leon, Maximus, Nika, Orion, [[Mid-February 2014 North American winter storm|Pax]], Seneca, Titan, Ulysses, Vulcan, Wiley, Xenia, Yona and Zephyr). Multiple factors are taken into consideration when deciding whether to name a winter storm. This includes, but is not limited to, predicted snowfall and other precipitation, wind speeds, and the timing of the storm.<ref name=\"why names\"/>\n\nThe Weather Channel has provided the criteria behind their decisions to name certain storms, in particular Athena,<ref name=\"TWC-Athena\"/> Brutus,<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Storm Brutus: Why We Named

commentators have suggested that naming winter storms may give them undue importance in the public eye by drawing parallels to official names given to [[Tropical cyclone|Tropical Storms]], which are
