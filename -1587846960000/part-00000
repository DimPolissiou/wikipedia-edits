Ed questions Madeline's devotion to him when she continues to complain about seeing Nathan with Bonnie all the time, and Madeline is further disturbed when Bonnie takes Abigail, Madeline's oldest daughter, to [[Planned Parenthood]]. Nathan tries to come to a peaceful resolution with Ed about their parenting of Abigail, but Ed senses Nathan trying to intimidate him and stands firm.

At therapy, Perry claims his outbursts are out of fear that Celeste does not love him, which Celeste attempts to deny. When Abigail's academic performance begins to decline, her guidance counselor suggests it is being caused by stress at home, so she decides to live with Nathan, much to Madeline's dismay. Jane gets Ziggy involved with more extracurricular activities and helps him construct a family tree for school with Madeline's help. However, Jane opposes Ziggy\u2019s insistence upon putting his father's name on the tree, and she ultimately confides to Madeline that Ziggy was the result of rape by a man named Saxon Banks, whom she has not seen since.\n |LineColor = F1659B\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = Push Comes to Shove\n |DirectedBy = Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\n |WrittenBy = David E.

Renata forgives Jane and reveals her plan to schedule play-dates with each of Amabella's classmates to discover who is hurting her. Celeste's therapist advises her to prepare to leave Perry by renting an apartment and disclosing the abuse to friends. Later, Perry tries to initiate sex with Celeste, who defensively fractures his penis with a tennis racket.

Ziggy confesses to Jane that it was Max, one of Celeste's sons, who choked Amabella. Madeline talks to Joseph about his wife knowing about their affair, and Jane woefully tells Celeste that her son is the bully. Celeste realizes that Max was emulating Perry\u2019s abuse, having overheard it while he was playing a video game. When preparing to leave for trivia night, Perry sees a text message on Celeste's phone from the landlady of her new apartment. He confronts her on the way to the party, but is interrupted by Renata. At the party, Celeste tells Renata that Max is the bully and Amabella framed Ziggy out of fear of Max. Meanwhile, a drunk Madeline runs away during Ed's singing performance after realizing just how much he loves her and how little she gives him in return.

Celeste joins the women, followed by Perry. Bonnie follows them and watches the group from afar. Jane sees Perry and realizes that he is Saxon Banks. Perry pleads with Celeste to come back home with him and when she declines, he viciously attacks her.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will.

Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship while still trying to care for Joyce.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization.<ref name=\"nytimes interview\" /> Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot lines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough unresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.<ref name=\"variety maybes2\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-season-two-netflix-1201824880/ |title='Stranger Things' EPs on Season 2: 'We Could Explore It If Netflix Wanted To' |first=Debra |last=Brinbaum |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nRegarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb.<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> Joyce was fashioned after [[Richard Dreyfuss]]' character Roy Neary in ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', as she appears \"absolutely bonkers\" to everyone else as she tries to find Will.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:David Harbour by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Duffer Brothers cast [[David Harbour]] as Chief Hopper believing this was his opportunity to portray a lead character.]]\nIn June 2015, it was announced that [[Winona Ryder]] and [[David Harbour]] had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.<ref name=\"June2015TVL\" /> The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\".

violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s [[Amblin Entertainment]] films drove the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Addition of PG-13 rating|PG-13 movie rating]]. It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season.<ref name=\"empire\" /> The brothers had wanted to avoid any [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with [[practical effect]]s, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g13305063/stranger-things-trivia/?slide=24 |title=50 Things You Didn't Know About 'Stranger Things' |date=November 6, 2017 |work=Harper's BAZAAR |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/tv/2016/07/20/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-6/ |title='Stranger Things': How the Duffer Brothers created their monster |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref> However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rodney |last=Ho |date=July 19, 2016 |url=http://radiotvtalk.blog.ajc.com/2015/08/28/netflix-new-drama-series-stranger-things-to-shoot-in-atlanta/ |title=New Netflix drama series ''Stranger Things'' to shoot in Atlanta |newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |accessdate=January 27, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/04/02/us-netflix-streaming-original-series-idUSKBN0MT1X220150402 |title=Netflix to premiere original series ''Montauk'' in 2016 |date=April 2, 2015 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.

''Stranger Things'' came about as it sounded similar to another King novel, ''[[Needful Things]]'', though Matt noted they still had a \"lot of heated arguments\" over this final title.<ref name=\"daily beast\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/07/inside-stranger-things-the-duffer-bros-on-how-they-made-the-tv-hit-of-the-summer.html |title=Inside 'Stranger Things': The Duffer Bros. on How They Made the TV Hit of the Summer |first=Melissa |last=Leon |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2017 |website=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref>\n\nTo pitch the series, the Duffer Brothers showcased images, footage and music from classic 1970s and 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'', ''[[Hellraiser]]'', ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', ''[[Firestarter (film)|Firestarter]]'', ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' and ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', in order to establish the tone of the series.<ref name=\"Miyamoto\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nThe idea of ''Stranger Things'' started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film ''[[Prisoners (2013 film)|Prisoners]]'', detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://frightfind.com/stranger-things-netflix-homage/ |title=Stranger Things is an Homage to the Greats |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |website=FrightFind |date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> crafting it in the realm of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/stranger-things-and-the-get-down-reviews |title=On Television: \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down\" |first=Emily |last=Nassbaum |date=August 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: [[Stephen King]] novels; films produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven]],<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/duffer-brothers-talk-stranger-things-916180 |title=The Duffer Brothers Talk 'Stranger Things' Influences, 'It' Dreams and Netflix Phase 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"screenertv\">{{cite web |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/stranger-things-stephen-king-steven-spielberg-cinematic-influences/ |title=The cinematic influences behind Netflix's 'Stranger Things' |date=July 18, 2016 |work=ScreenerTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/13/how-netflixs-stranger-things-channels-steven-spielberg-john-carpenter-and-stephen-king/ |title=How Netflix's ''Stranger Things'' Channels Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King |first=Sarene |last=Leeds |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Guillermo del Toro]];<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"screenertv\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/stranger-things-all-the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-references-in-p/stand-by-me/ |title=Stranger Things: all the hidden (and not-so-hidden) movie, TV and book references |website=The Telegraph |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Japanese [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> and several [[video game]]s including ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, Stranger Things' Upside Down was totally inspired by Silent Hill |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-stranger-things-upside-down-was-totally-inspired-by-silent-hill/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=How Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us Influenced Stranger Things |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/how-silent-hill-dark-souls-and-the-last-of-us-influenced-stranger-things |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including ''[[Beyond the Black Rainbow]]'' and ''[[D.A.R.Y.L.]]'', discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.<ref name=\"hwr montauk\" /> Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-21-80s-relics-weve-spotted-so-far-photos/ |title=''Stranger Things'': 21 '80s Relics We've Spotted So Far |first=Meriah |last=Doty |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html |title=A ''Stranger Things'' Glossary: Every Major Film Reference in the Show, From A\u2013Z |last=Tobias |first=Scott |website=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomhowdy.com/filmtv/stranger-things-influences/ |title=Strange Influences: Our Favorite Movie References From ''Stranger Things'' |first=Tyree |last=Kimber |website=Boomhowdy.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18481-netflix-stranger-things-80s-pop-culture-references-spielberg |title=Every '80s Pop Culture References in ''Stranger Things'' |first=Sean |last=Hutchinson |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach.

Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The [[Antarctic ice sheet]], which contains 61\u00a0% of all fresh water on Earth, is visible at the bottom. Condensed atmospheric water can be seen as clouds, contributing to the Earth's [[albedo]].]]\n\nHydrology is the study of the movement, distribution, and quality of water throughout the Earth. The study of the distribution of water is [[hydrography]]. The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is [[hydrogeology]], of glaciers is [[glaciology]], of inland waters is [[limnology]] and distribution of oceans is [[oceanography]]. Ecological processes with hydrology are in focus of [[ecohydrology]].\n\nThe collective mass of water found on, under, and over the surface of a planet is called the [[hydrosphere]]. Earth's approximate water volume (the total water supply of the world) is 1.386 \u00d7 10<sup>9</sup> cubic kilometres.<ref name=b1 />\n\nLiquid water is found in [[body of water|bodies of water]], such as an ocean, sea, lake, river, stream, [[canal]], pond, or [[puddle]]. The majority of water on Earth is [[sea water]]. Water is also present in the atmosphere in solid, liquid, and vapor states. It also exists as groundwater in [[aquifer]]s.\n\nWater is important in many geological processes. Groundwater is present in most [[rock (geology)|rocks]], and the pressure of this groundwater affects patterns of [[fault (geology)|faulting]]. Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].\n\n===Water cycle===\n{{Main|Water cycle}}\n[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]\n\nThe [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and plants.\n\nWater moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of the following transfer processes:\n* [[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into the air.\n* [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to the earth or ocean.\n* [[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the sea.\nMost water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&nbsp;Tt per year.

A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.\n\n===Fresh water storage===\n{{Main|Water resources}}\nWater occurs as both \"stocks\" and \"flows.\" Water can be stored as lakes, water vapor, groundwater or \"aquifers,\" and ice and snow. Of the total volume of global freshwater, an estimated 69 percent is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover; 30 percent is in groundwater; and the remaining 1 percent in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere, and biota.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Water in Crisis |last=Gleick |first=Peter H. |date=1993 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=019507627-3 |edition=1 |location=New York |publication-date=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waterincrisisgui00glei/page/13 13] |url=https://archive.org/details/waterincrisisgui00glei/page/13 }}</ref> The length of time water remains in storage is highly variable: some aquifers consist of water stored over thousands of years but lake volumes may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, decreasing during dry periods and increasing during wet ones.

The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about -1.9\u00a0\u00b0C) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7\u00a0% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0\u00a0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340\u00a0%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n{{gallery\n| title = The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide and low tide\n| width = 150\n| align = center\n|File:Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg\n |High tide\n|File:Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg\n |Low tide\n}}\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|upright|Overview of [[photosynthesis]] <span style=\"color:green;\">(green)</span> and [[cellular respiration|respiration]] <span style=\"color:red;\">(red)</span>.]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n{{gallery\n|align=center\n|File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG\n  |Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]\n|File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg\n  |Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group\n}}\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380\u00a0% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155\u201311162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanization and biofuel crops.

A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water.

The scale is an [[absolute temperature]] scale with the same increment as the Celsius temperature scale, which was originally defined according to the [[boiling point]] (set to 100\u00a0\u00b0C) and [[melting point]] (set to 0\u00a0\u00b0C) of water.\n\nNatural water consists mainly of the isotopes hydrogen-1 and oxygen-16, but there is also a small quantity of heavier isotopes oxygen-18, oxygen-17, and hydrogen-2 ([[deuterium]]). The percentage of the heavier isotopes is very small, but it still affects the properties of water. Water from rivers and lakes tends to contain less heavy isotopes than seawater.

Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of litres per day per person in developed countries.\n\n====Transportation====\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\nThe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.\n\n====Chemical uses====\nWater is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\nThe [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n{{gallery\n|align=center\n|File:Water carrier in India.jpg\n  |A water-carrier in India, 1882.

Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n[[File:Sterilewater.jpg|thumb|upright|Sterile water for injection]]\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations. One [[mole (unit)|mole]] of sucrose (sugar) per kilogram of water raises the boiling point of water by 0.51\u00a0\u00b0C, and one mole of salt per kg raises the boiling point by 1.02\u00a0\u00b0C; similarly, increasing the number of dissolved particles lowers water's freezing point.<ref name=\"vaclacik\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Food Science |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iCCsvwZrguUC&printsec=frontcover |year=2007 |author1=Vaclavik, Vickie A. |author2=Christian, Elizabeth W |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-387-69939-4}}</ref>\n\nSolutes in water also affect water activity that affects many chemical reactions and the growth of microbes in food.<ref name=\"deman\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=kDYJ7a1HbD0C&pg=PA434 |title=Principles of Food Chemistry |year=1999 |author=DeMan, John M |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-0-8342-1234-3}}</ref> Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water.<ref name=\"vaclacik\" /> Solutes in water lower water activity\u2014this is important to know because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity.<ref name=\"deman\" /> Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.\n\n[[Water hardness]] is also a critical factor in food processing and may be altered or treated by using a chemical ion exchange system. It can dramatically affect the quality of a product, as well as playing a role in sanitation. Water hardness is classified based on concentration of calcium carbonate the water contains.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |title=Search Results |website=International Water Management Institute (IWMI) |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605124732/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30\u00a0%. 40\u00a0% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought. In 2004, the UK charity [[WaterAid]] reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of [[sewage]] disposal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOrganizations concerned with water protection include the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[WaterAid]], [[Water 1st]], and the American Water Resources Association.

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008).

[[James Legge]]'s 1891 translation of the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' states, \"The highest excellence is like (that of) water.

However, oxygen is more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] (holds on to its electrons more tightly) than most other elements, so the oxygen atom retains a negative charge while the hydrogen atoms are positively charged. Along with the bent structure, this gives the molecule an [[electrical dipole moment]] and it is classified as a [[polar molecule]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ball|2001|p=169}}</ref>\n\nWater is a good polar [[solvent]], that dissolves many [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and [[hydrophilic]] organic molecules such as sugars and simple alcohols such as [[ethanol]].

In addition, many substances in living organisms, such as [[protein]]s, [[DNA]] and [[polysaccharide]]s, are dissolved in water. The interactions between water and the subunits of these biomacromolecules shape [[protein folding]], [[Base pairing|DNA base pairing]], and other phenomena crucial to life ([[hydrophobic effect]]).\n\nMany organic substances (such as [[lipids|fats and oils]] and [[alkanes]]) are [[hydrophobic]], that is, insoluble in water.

Hydrogen bonds are about ten times as strong as the [[Van der Waals force]] that attracts molecules to each other in most liquids. This is the reason why the melting and boiling points of water are much higher than those of [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|other analogous compounds]] like hydrogen sulfide. They also explain its exceptionally high [[specific heat capacity]] (about 4.2 [[Joule|J]]/g/K), [[heat of fusion]] (about 333 J/g), [[heat of vaporization]] ({{nowrap|2257 J/g}}), and [[thermal conductivity]] (between 0.561 and 0.679 W/m/K). These properties make water more effective at moderating Earth's [[climate]], by storing heat and transporting it between the oceans and the atmosphere.

Water in the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] is responsible for the melt that produces [[volcano]]es at [[subduction zone]]s. On the surface of the Earth, water is important in both chemical and physical [[weathering]] processes. Water, and to a lesser but still significant extent, ice, are also responsible for a large amount of [[sediment transport]] that occurs on the surface of the earth. [[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] of transported sediment forms many types of [[sedimentary rock]]s, which make up the [[geologic record]] of [[History of the Earth|Earth history]].\n\n===Water cycle===\n{{Main|Water cycle}}\n[[File:Water cycle.png|thumb|[[Water cycle]]]]\n\nThe [[water cycle]] (known scientifically as the hydrologic cycle) refers to the continuous exchange of water within the [[hydrosphere]], between the [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[soil]] water, [[surface water]], [[groundwater]], and plants.\n\nWater moves perpetually through each of these regions in the ''water cycle'' consisting of the following transfer processes:\n* [[evaporation]] from oceans and other water bodies into the air and [[transpiration]] from land plants and animals into the air.\n* [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], from water vapor condensing from the air and falling to the earth or ocean.\n* [[runoff (water)|runoff]] from the land usually reaching the sea.\nMost water vapor over the oceans returns to the oceans, but winds carry water vapor over land at the same rate as runoff into the sea, about 47&nbsp;[[Metric tonne unit|Tt]] per year. Over land, evaporation and transpiration contribute another 72&nbsp;Tt per year. Precipitation, at a rate of 119 Tt per year over land, has several forms: most commonly rain, snow, and [[hail]], with some contribution from [[fog]] and [[dew]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Water in Crisis: A Guide to the World's Freshwater Resources |editor=Gleick, P.H. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |page=15, Table 2.3 |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408091921/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/EarthSciences/Oceanography/?view=usa&ci=9780195076288 |archivedate=8 April 2013  }}</ref> Dew is small drops of water that are condensed when a high density of water vapor meets a cool surface.

A mathematical model used to simulate river or stream flow and calculate water quality parameters is a [[hydrological transport model]]. Some water is diverted to [[irrigation]] for agriculture. Rivers and seas offer opportunity for travel and commerce. Through [[erosion]], runoff shapes the environment creating river [[valley]]s and [[river delta|deltas]] which provide rich soil and level ground for the establishment of population centers. A flood occurs when an area of land, usually low-lying, is covered with water. It is when a river overflows its banks or flood comes from the sea. A drought is an extended period of months or years when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply. This occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation.\n\n===Fresh water storage===\n{{Main|Water resources}}\nWater occurs as both \"stocks\" and \"flows.\" Water can be stored as lakes, water vapor, groundwater or \"aquifers,\" and ice and snow. Of the total volume of global freshwater, an estimated 69 percent is stored in glaciers and permanent snow cover; 30 percent is in groundwater; and the remaining 1 percent in lakes, rivers, the atmosphere, and biota.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Water in Crisis |last=Gleick |first=Peter H. |date=1993 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=019507627-3 |edition=1 |location=New York |publication-date=1993 |page=[https://archive.org/details/waterincrisisgui00glei/page/13 13] |url=https://archive.org/details/waterincrisisgui00glei/page/13 }}</ref> The length of time water remains in storage is highly variable: some aquifers consist of water stored over thousands of years but lake volumes may fluctuate on a seasonal basis, decreasing during dry periods and increasing during wet ones. A substantial fraction of the water supply for some regions consists of water extracted from water stored in stocks, and when withdrawals exceed recharge, stocks decrease. By some estimates, as much as 30 percent of total water used for irrigation comes from unsustainable withdrawals of groundwater, causing groundwater depletion.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Yoshihide|last1=Wada |first2=L.P.H.|last2=Van Beek|first3=Marc FP |last3=Bierkens|title=Nonsustainable groundwater sustaining irrigation: A global assessment|journal=Water Resources Research |date= 2012 |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=W00L06 |doi=10.1029/2011WR010562|bibcode=2012WRR....48.0L06W }}</ref>\n\n===Sea water and tides===\n{{Main|Seawater|Tides}}\n[[Seawater|Sea water]] contains about 3.5% [[sodium chloride]] on average, plus smaller amounts of other substances. The physical properties of sea water differ from fresh water in some important respects. It freezes at a lower temperature (about {{convert|-1.9|C}}) and its density increases with decreasing temperature to the freezing point, instead of reaching maximum density at a temperature above freezing. The salinity of water in major seas varies from about 0.7% in the [[Baltic Sea]] to 4.0% in the [[Red Sea]]. (The [[Dead Sea]], known for its ultra-high salinity levels of between 30\u201340%, is really a [[salt lake]].)\n\n[[Tide]]s are the cyclic rising and falling of local sea levels caused by the [[tidal force]]s of the Moon and the Sun acting on the oceans. Tides cause changes in the depth of the marine and [[estuary|estuarine]] water bodies and produce oscillating currents known as tidal streams. The changing tide produced at a given location is the result of the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the [[Coriolis effect|effects of Earth rotation]] and the local [[bathymetry]]. The strip of seashore that is submerged at high tide and exposed at low tide, the [[intertidal zone]], is an important ecological product of ocean tides.\n{{gallery\n| title = The [[Bay of Fundy]] at high tide and low tide\n| width = 150\n| align = center\n|File:Bay of Fundy High Tide.jpg\n |High tide\n|File:Bay of Fundy Low Tide.jpg\n |Low tide\n}}\n\n==Effects on life==\n[[File:Auto-and heterotrophs.svg|thumb|upright|Overview of [[photosynthesis]] <span style=\"color:green;\">(green)</span> and [[cellular respiration|respiration]] <span style=\"color:red;\">(red)</span>.]]\n\nFrom a [[biology|biological]] standpoint, water has many distinct properties that are critical for the proliferation of life. It carries out this role by allowing [[organic compound]]s to react in ways that ultimately allow [[Self-replication|replication]]. All known forms of life depend on water. Water is vital both as a [[solvent]] in which many of the body's solutes dissolve and as an essential part of many [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes within the body. Metabolism is the sum total of [[anabolism]] and [[catabolism]]. In anabolism, water is removed from molecules (through energy requiring enzymatic chemical reactions) in order to grow larger molecules (e.g., starches, triglycerides and proteins for storage of fuels and information). In catabolism, water is used to break bonds in order to generate smaller molecules (e.g., glucose, fatty acids and amino acids to be used for fuels for energy use or other purposes). Without water, these particular metabolic processes could not exist.\n\nWater is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to split off water's hydrogen from oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Hydrogen is combined with CO<sub>2</sub> (absorbed from air or water) to form glucose and release oxygen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All living cells use such fuels and oxidize the hydrogen and carbon to capture the sun's energy and reform water and CO<sub>2</sub> in the process (cellular respiration).\n\nWater is also central to acid-base neutrality and enzyme function. An acid, a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>, that is, a proton) donor, can be neutralized by a base, a proton acceptor such as a hydroxide ion (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) to form water. Water is considered to be neutral, with a [[pH]] (the negative log of the hydrogen ion concentration) of 7. [[Acids]] have pH values less than 7 while [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] have values greater than 7.\n\n===Aquatic life forms===\n{{Further|Hydrobiology|Marine life|Aquatic plant}}\nEarth surface waters are filled with life. The earliest life forms appeared in water; nearly all fish live exclusively in water, and there are many types of marine mammals, such as dolphins and whales. Some kinds of animals, such as [[amphibian]]s, spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Plants such as [[kelp]] and [[algae]] grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. [[Plankton]] is generally the foundation of the ocean [[food chain]].\n\nAquatic vertebrates must obtain oxygen to survive, and they do so in various ways. Fish have [[gills]] instead of [[lungs]], although some species of fish, such as the [[lungfish]], have both. [[Marine mammal]]s, such as dolphins, whales, [[otter]]s, and [[pinniped|seals]] need to surface periodically to breathe air. Some amphibians are able to absorb oxygen through their skin. Invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters including breathing tubes (see [[Siphon (insect)|insect]] and [[Siphon (mollusc)|mollusc siphons]]) and [[gills]] (''[[Carcinus]]''). However as invertebrate life evolved in an aquatic habitat most have little or no specialization for respiration in water.\n{{gallery\n|align=center\n|File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG\n  |Some of the [[biodiversity]] of a [[coral reef]]\n|File:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg\n  |Some marine [[diatom]]s \u2013 a key [[phytoplankton]] group\n}}\n\n==Effects on human civilization==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Longwood Gardens-Italian Garden.jpg|thumb|right|Water [[fountain]]]]\n\nCivilization has historically flourished around rivers and major waterways; [[Mesopotamia]], the so-called cradle of civilization, was situated between the major rivers [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]; the ancient society of the [[Egyptians]] depended entirely upon the [[Nile]]. Rome was also founded on the banks of the Italian river [[Tiber]]. Large [[metropolis]]es like [[Rotterdam]], London, Montreal, Paris, New York City, [[Buenos Aires]], Shanghai, Tokyo, Chicago, and Hong Kong owe their success in part to their easy accessibility via water and the resultant expansion of trade. Islands with safe water ports, like Singapore, have flourished for the same reason. In places such as North Africa and the Middle East, where water is more scarce, access to clean drinking water was and is a major factor in human development.\n\n===Health and pollution===\n[[File:Field Trip- water sampling.jpg|thumb|An environmental science program \u2013 a student from [[Iowa State University]] sampling water]]\nWater fit for human consumption is called [[drinking water]] or potable water. Water that is not potable may be made potable by filtration or [[distillation]], or by a range of [[Water treatment|other methods]].\n\nWater that is not fit for drinking but is not harmful for humans when used for swimming or bathing is called by various names other than potable or drinking water, and is sometimes called [[safe water]], or \"safe for bathing\". Chlorine is a skin and mucous membrane irritant that is used to make water safe for bathing or drinking. Its use is highly technical and is usually monitored by government regulations (typically 1 part per million (ppm) for drinking water, and 1\u20132 ppm of chlorine not yet reacted with impurities for bathing water). Water for bathing may be maintained in satisfactory microbiological condition using chemical disinfectants such as [[chlorine]] or [[ozone]] or by the use of [[ultraviolet]] light.\n\nIn the US, non-potable forms of [[wastewater]] generated by humans may be referred to as [[greywater]], which is treatable and thus easily able to be made potable again, and [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], which generally contains [[sewage]] and other forms of waste which require [[Sewage treatment|further treatment]] in order to be made reusable. Greywater composes 50\u201380% of residential wastewater generated by a household's sanitation equipment ([[sink]]s, showers and kitchen runoff, but not toilets, which generate blackwater.) These terms may have different meanings in other countries and cultures.\n\nThis natural resource is becoming scarcer in certain places, and its availability is a major social and economic concern. Currently, about a billion people around the world routinely drink unhealthy water. In 2000, the [[United Nations]] established the [[Millennium Development Goals]] for water to halve by 2015 the proportion of people worldwide without access to safe water and [[sanitation]]. Progress toward that goal was uneven, and in 2015 the UN committed to the following targets set by the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] of achieving universal access to safe and affordable water and sanitation by 2030. Poor [[water quality]] and bad sanitation are deadly; some five million deaths a year are caused by water-related diseases. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that [[safe water]] could prevent 1.4 million child deaths from [[diarrhea]] each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/qa/70/en/ |title=World Health Organization.

At the time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and ate less meat, so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for the fixed amount of water resources is much more intense, giving rise to the concept of [[peak water]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Gleick |first=P.H. |title=Peak Water |url=http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |accessdate=11 October 2011 |year=2010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004812107 |pmid=20498082 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=107 |issue=125 |pages=11155\u201311162 |last2=Palaniappan |first2=M. |bibcode=2010PNAS..10711155G |pmc=2895062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108224340/http://www.pacinst.org/press_center/press_releases/peak_water_pnas.pdf |archive-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> This is because there are now nearly eight billion people on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from industry, urbanization and biofuel crops.

Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.</ref> It assessed the current availability of water for agriculture on a global scale and mapped out locations suffering from water scarcity. It found that a fifth of the world's people, more than 1.2 billion, live in areas of [[physical water scarcity]], where there is not enough water to meet all demands. A further 1.6 billion people live in areas experiencing [[economic water scarcity]], where the lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity make it impossible for authorities to satisfy the demand for water. The report found that it would be possible to produce the food required in future, but that continuation of today's food production and environmental trends would lead to crises in many parts of the world.

Water is excreted from the body in multiple forms; through [[urine]] and [[feces]], through [[sweat]]ing, and by exhalation of water vapor in the breath. With physical exertion and heat exposure, water loss will increase and daily fluid needs may increase as well.\n\nHumans require water with few impurities.

Washing is also an important component of several aspects of personal [[body hygiene]]. Most of personal water use is due to [[shower]]ing, doing the [[laundry]] and [[dishwashing]], reaching hundreds of liters per day per person in developed countries.\n\n====Transportation====\n{{Main|Ship transport}}\nThe use of water for transportation of materials through rivers and canals as well as the international shipping lanes is an important part of the world economy.\n\n====Chemical uses====\nWater is widely used in chemical reactions as a [[solvent]] or [[reactant]] and less commonly as a [[solution|solute]] or [[catalyst]]. In inorganic reactions, water is a common solvent, dissolving many ionic compounds, as well as other polar compounds such as [[ammonia]] and [[Hydrogen chalcogenide|compounds closely related to water]]. In organic reactions, it is not usually used as a reaction solvent, because it does not dissolve the reactants well and is [[amphoteric]] (acidic ''and'' basic) and [[nucleophilic]]. Nevertheless, these properties are sometimes desirable. Also, acceleration of [[Diels-Alder reaction]]s by water has been observed. [[Supercritical water]] has recently been a topic of research. Oxygen-saturated supercritical water combusts organic pollutants efficiently. Water vapor is used for some processes in the chemical industry. An example is the production of acrylic acid from acrolein, propylene and propane.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The reaction network in propane oxidation over phase-pure MoVTeNb M1 oxide catalysts|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2014|volume=311|pages=369\u2013385|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2013.12.008|last1=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first1=Raoul|last2=Csepei|first2=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last3=H\u00e4vecker|first3=Michael|last4=Girgsdies|first4=Frank|last5=Schuster|first5=Manfred E|last6=Schl\u00f6gl|first6=Robert|last7=Trunschke|first7=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0014-F434-5|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215104605/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1896844:6/component/escidoc:1896843/JCAT-13-716_revised_06Dec2013.pdf|archive-date=15 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Surface chemistry of phase-pure M1 MoVTeNb oxide during operation in selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid|journal=Journal of Catalysis|date=2012|volume=285|pages=48\u201360|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.012|last1=H\u00e4vecker|first1=Michael|last2=Wrabetz|first2=Sabine|last3=Kr\u00f6hnert|first3=Jutta|last4=Csepei|first4=Lenard-Istvan|last5=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first5=Raoul|last6=Kolen'Ko|first6=Yury V|last7=Girgsdies|first7=Frank|last8=Schl\u00f6gl|first8=Robert|last9=Trunschke|first9=Annette|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-1BEB-F|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030003154/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1108560:8/component/escidoc:1402724/1108560.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Kinetic studies of propane oxidation on Mo and V based mixed oxide catalysts|date=2011|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220044522/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1199619:5/component/escidoc:1199618/csepei_lenard.pdf|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Multifunctionality of Crystalline MoV(TeNb) M1 Oxide Catalysts in Selective Oxidation of Propane and Benzyl Alcohol|journal=ACS Catalysis|date=2013|volume=3|issue=6|pages=1103\u20131113|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|doi=10.1021/cs400010q|last1=Amakawa|first1=Kazuhiko|last2=Kolen'Ko|first2=Yury V|last3=Villa|first3=Alberto|last4=Schuster|first4=Manfred E/|last5=Csepei|first5=L\u00e9n\u00e1rd-Istv\u00e1n|last6=Weinberg|first6=Gisela|last7=Wrabetz|first7=Sabine|last8=Naumann d'Alnoncourt|first8=Raoul|last9=Girgsdies|first9=Frank|last10=Prati|first10=Laura|last11=Schl\u00f6gl|first11=Robert|last12=Trunschke|first12=Annette|access-date=14 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181022030814/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278196177|archive-date=22 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The possible effect of water in these reactions includes the physical-, chemical interaction of water with the catalyst and the chemical reaction of water with the reaction intermediates.\n\n====Heat exchange====\nWater and steam are a common fluid used for [[heat exchanger|heat exchange]], due to its availability and high [[Heat capacity of water|heat capacity]], both for cooling and heating. Cool water may even be naturally available from a lake or the sea. It's especially effective to transport heat through [[vaporization]] and [[condensation]] of water because of its large [[latent heat of vaporization]]. A disadvantage is that metals commonly found in industries such as steel and copper are [[oxidation|oxidized]] faster by untreated water and steam. In almost all [[thermal power station]]s, water is used as the working fluid (used in a closed loop between boiler, steam turbine and condenser), and the coolant (used to exchange the waste heat to a water body or carry it away by [[evaporation]] in a [[cooling tower]]). In the United States, cooling power plants is the largest use of water.<ref name=\"Water Use in the United States\">[http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html Water Use in the United States], National Atlas.gov  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814045418/http://nationalatlas.gov/articles/water/a_wateruse.html |date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nIn the [[nuclear power]] industry, water can also be used as a [[neutron moderator]]. In most [[nuclear reactor]]s, water is both a coolant and a moderator. This provides something of a passive safety measure, as removing the water from the reactor also [[void coefficient|slows the nuclear reaction down]]. However other methods are favored for stopping a reaction and it is preferred to keep the nuclear core covered with water so as to ensure adequate cooling.\n\n====Fire considerations====\n[[File:MH-60S Helicopter dumps water onto Fire.jpg|right|thumb|Water is used for [[fire fighting|fighting]] [[wildfire]]s.]]\nWater has a high heat of vaporization and is relatively inert, which makes it a good [[Fire fighting#Use of water|fire extinguishing]] fluid. The evaporation of water carries heat away from the fire. It is dangerous to use water on fires involving oils and organic solvents, because many organic materials float on water and the water tends to spread the burning liquid.\n\nUse of water in fire fighting should also take into account the hazards of a [[steam explosion]], which may occur when water is used on very hot fires in confined spaces, and of a hydrogen explosion, when substances which react with water, such as certain metals or hot carbon such as coal, [[charcoal]], or [[coke (fuel)|coke]] graphite, decompose the water, producing [[water gas]].\n\nThe power of such explosions was seen in the [[Chernobyl disaster]], although the water involved did not come from fire-fighting at that time but the reactor's own water cooling system. A steam explosion occurred when the extreme overheating of the core caused water to flash into steam. A hydrogen explosion may have occurred as a result of reaction between steam and hot [[zirconium]].\n\nSome metallic oxides, most notably those of [[alkali metals]] and [[alkaline earth metals]], produce so much heat on reaction with water that a fire hazard can develop. The alkaline earth oxide [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] is a mass-produced substance which is often transported in paper bags. If these are soaked through, they may ignite as their contents react with water.<ref>{{cite web |title=Material Safety Data Sheet: Quicklime |url=https://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |publisher=Lhoist North America |date=6 August 2012 |accessdate=24 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160705030051/http://www.lhoist.com/sites/lhoist/files/lna_msds_quicklime_2012-3.pdf |archive-date=5 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Recreation====\n{{Main|Water sport (recreation)}}\n[[File:Johny Cay.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andr\u00e9s island]], [[Colombia]].]]\n\nHumans use water for many recreational purposes, as well as for exercising and for sports. Some of these include swimming, [[waterskiing]], [[boating]], [[surfing]] and [[Underwater diving|diving]]. In addition, some sports, like [[ice hockey]] and [[ice skating]], are played on ice. Lakesides, beaches and [[water park]]s are popular places for people to go to relax and enjoy recreation. Many find the sound and appearance of flowing water to be calming, and fountains and other water features are popular decorations. Some keep fish and other life in [[aquarium]]s or ponds for show, fun, and companionship. Humans also use water for snow sports i.e. [[skiing]], [[sledding]], [[snowmobiling]] or [[snowboarding]], which require the water to be frozen.\n\n====Water industry====\nThe [[water industry]] provides drinking water and [[wastewater]] services (including [[sewage treatment]]) to households and industry. [[Water supply]] facilities include [[water well]]s, [[cistern]]s for [[rainwater harvesting]], [[water supply network]]s, and [[water purification]] facilities, [[water tank]]s, [[water tower]]s, [[water pipe]]s including old [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]]. [[Atmospheric water generator]]s are in development.\n\nDrinking water is often collected at [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], extracted from artificial [[Boring (earth)|borings]] (wells) in the ground, or pumped from lakes and rivers. Building more wells in adequate places is thus a possible way to produce more water, assuming the aquifers can supply an adequate flow. Other water sources include rainwater collection. Water may require purification for human consumption. This may involve removal of undissolved substances, dissolved substances and harmful [[microbe]]s. Popular methods are [[filter (water)|filtering]] with sand which only removes undissolved material, while [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] and [[boiling]] kill harmful microbes. [[Distillation]] does all three functions. More advanced techniques exist, such as [[reverse osmosis]]. [[Desalination]] of abundant [[seawater]] is a more expensive solution used in coastal [[arid]] [[climate]]s.\n\nThe distribution of drinking water is done through [[municipal water system]]s, tanker delivery or as [[bottled water]]. Governments in many countries have programs to distribute water to the needy at no charge.\n\nReducing usage by using drinking (potable) water only for human consumption is another option. In some cities such as Hong Kong, sea water is extensively used for flushing toilets citywide in order to [[Water conservation|conserve fresh water resources]].\n\n[[Water pollution|Polluting water]] may be the biggest single misuse of water; to the extent that a pollutant limits other uses of the water, it becomes a waste of the resource, regardless of benefits to the polluter. Like other types of pollution, this does not enter standard accounting of market costs, being conceived as [[externality|externalities]] for which the market cannot account. Thus other people pay the price of water pollution, while the private firms' profits are not redistributed to the local population, victims of this pollution. [[Pharmaceuticals]] consumed by humans often end up in the waterways and can have detrimental effects on [[marine biology|aquatic]] life if they [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] and if they are not [[biodegradable]].\n\nMunicipal and industrial wastewater are typically treated at [[wastewater treatment plant]]s. Mitigation of polluted [[surface runoff]] is addressed through a variety of prevention and treatment techniques. (''See'' [[Surface runoff#Mitigation and treatment]].)\n{{gallery\n|align=center\n|File:Water carrier in India.jpg\n  |A water-carrier in India, 1882.

Processes such as [[mining]], [[chemical pulping]], [[pulp bleaching]], [[paper manufacturing]], textile production, dyeing, printing, and cooling of power plants use large amounts of water, requiring a dedicated water source, and often cause significant water pollution.\n\nWater is used in [[power generation]]. [[Hydroelectricity]] is electricity obtained from [[hydropower]]. Hydroelectric power comes from water driving a water turbine connected to a generator. Hydroelectricity is a low-cost, non-polluting, renewable energy source. The energy is supplied by the motion of water. Typically a dam is constructed on a river, creating an artificial lake behind it. Water flowing out of the lake is forced through turbines that turn generators.\n\n{{wide image|200407-sandouping-sanxiadaba-4.med.jpg|800px|[[Three Gorges Dam]] is the [[List of the largest hydroelectric power stations|largest hydro-electric power station]].}}\n\nPressurized water is used in [[Hydrodemolition|water blasting]] and [[water jet cutter]]s. Also, very high pressure water guns are used for precise cutting. It works very well, is relatively safe, and is not harmful to the environment. It is also used in the cooling of machinery to prevent overheating, or prevent saw blades from overheating.\n\nWater is also used in many industrial processes and machines, such as the [[steam turbine]] and [[heat exchanger]], in addition to its use as a chemical [[solvent]]. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is [[water pollution|pollution]]. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and discharged coolant water ([[thermal pollution]]). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge.\n\n====Food processing====\n[[File:Cuisson des pates.jpg|thumb|Water can be used to cook foods such as [[noodles]]]]\n[[File:Sterilewater.jpg|thumb|upright|Sterile water for injection]]\n[[Boiling]], [[steaming]], and [[simmering]] are popular cooking methods that often require immersing food in water or its gaseous state, steam.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xZHUAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA54|title=A Course in Household Arts: Part I|last=Duff|first=Sister Loretto Basil|date=1916|publisher=Whitcomb & Barrows}}</ref> Water is also used for [[dishwashing]]. Water also plays many critical roles within the field of [[food science]].\n\n[[Solution|Solutes]] such as salts and sugars found in water affect the physical properties of water. The boiling and freezing points of water are affected by solutes, as well as [[air pressure]], which is in turn affected by altitude. Water boils at lower temperatures with the lower air pressure that occurs at higher elevations.

Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily about knowing what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work in the developed world to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the [[International Water Management Institute]] of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |title=Search Results |website=International Water Management Institute (IWMI) |accessdate=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605124732/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx |archive-date=5 June 2013 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[UN World Water Development Report]] (WWDR, 2003) from the [[World Water Assessment Program]] indicates that, in the next 20 years, the quantity of water available to everyone is predicted to decrease by 30%. 40% of the world's inhabitants currently have insufficient fresh water for minimal [[hygiene]]. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from [[waterborne diseases]] (related to the consumption of contaminated water) or drought. In 2004, the UK charity [[WaterAid]] reported that a child dies every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases; often this means lack of [[sewage]] disposal.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nOrganizations concerned with water protection include the [[International Water Association]] (IWA), [[WaterAid]], [[Water 1st]], and the American Water Resources Association.

Faiths that incorporate ritual washing ([[Ritual purification|ablution]]) include [[Christianity]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], the [[Rastafari movement]], [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], and [[Wicca]]. Immersion (or [[aspersion]] or [[affusion]]) of a person in water is a central [[sacrament]] of Christianity (where it is called [[baptism]]); it is also a part of the practice of other religions, including Islam (''[[Ghusl]]''), Judaism (''[[mikvah]]'') and [[Sikhism]] (''[[Amrit Sanskar]]''). In addition, a ritual bath in pure water is performed for the dead in many religions including Islam and Judaism. In Islam, the five daily prayers can be done in most cases after completing washing certain parts of the body using clean water (''[[wudu]]''), unless water is unavailable (see ''[[Tayammum]]''). In Shinto, water is used in almost all rituals to cleanse a person or an area (e.g., in the ritual of ''[[misogi]]'').\n\nIn Christianity, [[holy water]] is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of [[baptism]], the [[Blessing (Roman Catholic Church)|blessing]] of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.<ref>''Chambers's encyclop\u00e6dia'', Lippincott & Co (1870). p. 394.</ref><ref>Altman, Nathaniel (2002) ''Sacred water: the spiritual source of life''. pp. 130\u2013133. {{ISBN|1-58768-013-0}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[Zoroastrianism]], water (''[[aban|\u0101b]]'') is respected as the source of life.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0100B i.

[[Thales]], who was portrayed by Aristotle as an astronomer and an engineer, theorized that the earth, which is denser than water, emerged from the water. Thales, a [[monist]], believed further that all things are made from water. Plato believed the shape of water is an [[icosahedron]] which accounts for why it is able to flow easily compared to the cube-shaped earth.<ref>Lindberg, D. (2008).

[[James Legge]]'s 1891 translation of the ''[[Dao De Jing]]'' states, \"The highest excellence is like (that of) water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving (to the contrary), the low place which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to (that of) the [[Tao]]\" and \"There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it\u2014for there is nothing (so effectual) for which it can be changed.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |title=Internet Sacred Text Archive Home |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100712103909/http://www.sacred-texts.com/tao/taote.htm |archive-date=12 July 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' in the \"Shui di\" \u6c34\u5730 chapter further elaborates on the symbolism of water, proclaiming that \"man is water\" and attributing natural qualities of the people of different Chinese regions to the character of local water resources.<ref>[http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di Guanzi : Shui Di \u2013 Chinese Text Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20141106133901/http://ctext.org/guanzi/shui-di |date=6 November 2014 }}.

The American and European partners each provided twenty-five 12-metre diameter antennas, that compose the main array. The participating East Asian countries are contributing 16 antennas (four 12-metre diameter and twelve 7-metre diameter antennas) in the form of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA), which is part of the enhanced ALMA.\n\nBy using smaller antennas than the main ALMA array, larger fields of view can be imaged at a given frequency using ACA.  Placing the antennas closer together enables the imaging of sources of larger angular extent. The ACA works together with the main array in order to enhance the latter's wide-field imaging capability.\n\n===History===\n[[Image:Ten ALMA Antennas Chajnantor.jpg|thumb|left|On 4 March 2011, ten antennas are installed at Chajnantor.]]\n\nALMA has its conceptual roots in three astronomical projects&nbsp;\u2014 the Millimetre Array (MMA) of the United States, the Large Southern Array (LSA) of Europe, and the Large Millimetre Array (LMA) of Japan.\n\nThe first step toward the creation of what would become ALMA came in 1997, when the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (NRAO) and the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) agreed to pursue a common project that merged the MMA and LSA. The merged array combined the sensitivity of the LSA with the frequency coverage and superior site of the MMA. ESO and NRAO worked together in technical, science, and management groups to define and organize a joint project between the two observatories with participation by Canada and Spain (the latter became a member of ESO later).\n\nA series of resolutions and agreements led to the choice of \"Atacama Large Millimeter Array\", or ALMA, as the name of the new array in March 1999 and the signing of the ALMA Agreement on 25 February 2003, between the North American and European parties. (\"Alma\" means \"soul\" in Spanish and \"learned\" or \"knowledgeable\" in Arabic.) Following mutual discussions over several years, the ALMA Project received a proposal from the [[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan]] (NAOJ) whereby Japan would provide the ACA (Atacama Compact Array) and three additional receiver bands for the large array, to form Enhanced ALMA. Further discussions between ALMA and NAOJ led to the signing of a high-level agreement on 14 September 2004 that makes Japan an official participant in Enhanced ALMA, to be known as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 6, 2003 and the ALMA logo was unveiled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/121-ground-breaking-ceremony-for-the-atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma|title=Ground breaking ceremony for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)|author=Alejandro Peredo|accessdate=15 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111161008/http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/121-ground-breaking-ceremony-for-the-atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma|archivedate=11 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring an early stage of the planning of ALMA, it was decided to employ ALMA antennas designed and constructed by known companies in North America, Europe, and Japan, rather than using one single design.

At the end of 2009, a team of ALMA astronomers and engineers successfully linked three antennas at the 5\u00a0000 metre elevation observing site thus finishing the first stage of assembly and integration of the fledgling array. Linking three antennas allows corrections of errors that can arise when only two antennas are used, thus paving the way for precise, high-resolution imaging. With this key step, commissioning of the instrument began 22 January 2010.\n\nOn 28 July 2011, the first European antenna for ALMA arrived at the Chajnantor plateau, 5\u00a0000 metres above sea level, to join 15 antennas already in place from the other international partners. This was the number of antennas specified for ALMA to begin its first science observations, and was therefore an important milestone for the project.<ref>{{cite news|title=European ALMA antenna brings total on Chajnantor to 16|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1127/|accessdate=29 July 2011|newspaper=ESO Organisation Release|date=28 July 2011}}</ref> In October 2012, 43 of the 66 antennas had been set up.\n\n==Scientific results==\n\n===Images from initial testing===\n[[Image:Antennae Galaxies composite of ALMA and Hubble observations.jpg|thumb|[[Antennae Galaxies]] composite of ALMA and [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] observations]]\n[[File:HL_Tau_protoplanetary_disk.jpg|thumb|[[HL Tauri]] protoplanetary disk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://public.nrao.edu/news/pressreleases/planet-formation-alma|title=Birth of Planets Revealed in Astonishing Detail in ALMA's 'Best Image Ever' - NRAO: Revealing the Hidden Universe|work=nrao.edu}}</ref>]]\n\nBy the summer of 2011, sufficient telescopes were operational during the extensive program of testing prior to the Early Science phase for the first images to be captured.<ref>{{cite news|title=ALMA Opens its Eyes|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/297-alma-opens-its-eyes|accessdate=4 October 2011|newspaper=ALMA Press Release|date=3 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005042527/http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/297-alma-opens-its-eyes|archivedate=5 October 2011}}</ref> These early images give a first glimpse of the potential of the new array that will produce much better quality images in the future as the scale of the array continues to increase.\n\nThe target of the observation was a pair of colliding galaxies with dramatically distorted shapes, known as the [[Antennae Galaxies]]. Although ALMA did not observe the entire galaxy merger, the result is the best submillimetre-wavelength image ever made of the Antennae Galaxies, showing the clouds of dense cold gas from which new stars form, which cannot be seen using visible light.\n\n===Comet studies===\nOn 11 August 2014, astronomers released studies, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for the first time, that detailed the distribution of [[Hydrogen cyanide|HCN]], [[Hydrogen isocyanide|HNC]], [[Formaldehyde|H<sub>2</sub>CO]], and [[dust]] inside the [[Coma (cometary)|comae]] of [[comet]]s [[C/2012 F6 (Lemmon)]] and [[Comet ISON|C/2012 S1 (ISON)]].<ref name=\"NASA-20140811\">{{cite web |last=Zubritsky |first=Elizabeth |last2=Neal-Jones |first2=Nancy |title=RELEASE 14-038 - NASA's 3-D Study of Comets Reveals Chemical Factory at Work |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/august/goddard/nasa-s-3-d-study-of-comets-reveals-chemical-factory-at-work |date=11 August 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=12 August 2014 }}</ref><ref name=\"AJL-20140811\">{{cite journal |author=Cordiner, M.A. |title=Mapping the Release of Volatiles in the Inner Comae of Comets C/2012 F6 (Lemmon) and C/2012 S1 (ISON) Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array |date=11 August 2014 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=792 |number=1  |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/792/1/L2 |display-authors=etal|arxiv = 1408.2458 |bibcode = 2014ApJ...792L...2C |page=L2}}</ref>\n\n===Planetary formation===\nAn image of the protoplanetary disk surrounding [[HL Tauri]] (a very young [[T Tauri star]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=In Search of HL Tauri |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |first1=David A. |last1=Weintraub |first2=Joel H. |last2=Kastner |first3=Barbara A. |last3=Whitney |volume=452 |issue=2 |pages=L141\u2013L145 |date=October 1995 |bibcode=1995ApJ...452L.141W |doi=10.1086/309720|doi-access=free }}</ref> in the constellation [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]) was made public in 2014, showing a series of concentric bright rings separated by gaps, indicating protoplanet formation. {{As of|2014}}, most theories did not expect planetary formation in such a young (100,000-1,000,000-year-old) system, so the new data spurred renewed theories of protoplanetary development.

The American and European partners each provided twenty-five 12-meter diameter antennas, that compose the main array. The participating East Asian countries are contributing 16 antennas (four 12-meter diameter and twelve 7-meter diameter antennas) in the form of the Atacama Compact Array (ACA), which is part of the enhanced ALMA.\n\nBy using smaller antennas than the main ALMA array, larger fields of view can be imaged at a given frequency using ACA.  Placing the antennas closer together enables the imaging of sources of larger angular extent. The ACA works together with the main array in order to enhance the latter's wide-field imaging capability.\n\n===History===\n[[Image:Ten ALMA Antennas Chajnantor.jpg|thumb|left|On 4 March 2011, ten antennas are installed at Chajnantor.]]\n\nALMA has its conceptual roots in three astronomical projects&nbsp;\u2014 the Millimeter Array (MMA) of the United States, the Large Southern Array (LSA) of Europe, and the Large Millimeter Array (LMA) of Japan.\n\nThe first step toward the creation of what would become ALMA came in 1997, when the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] (NRAO) and the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) agreed to pursue a common project that merged the MMA and LSA. The merged array combined the sensitivity of the LSA with the frequency coverage and superior site of the MMA. ESO and NRAO worked together in technical, science, and management groups to define and organize a joint project between the two observatories with participation by Canada and Spain (the latter became a member of ESO later).\n\nA series of resolutions and agreements led to the choice of \"Atacama Large Millimeter Array\", or ALMA, as the name of the new array in March 1999 and the signing of the ALMA Agreement on 25 February 2003, between the North American and European parties. (\"Alma\" means \"soul\" in Spanish and \"learned\" or \"knowledgeable\" in Arabic.) Following mutual discussions over several years, the ALMA Project received a proposal from the [[National Astronomical Observatory of Japan]] (NAOJ) whereby Japan would provide the ACA (Atacama Compact Array) and three additional receiver bands for the large array, to form Enhanced ALMA. Further discussions between ALMA and NAOJ led to the signing of a high-level agreement on 14 September 2004 that makes Japan an official participant in Enhanced ALMA, to be known as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 6, 2003 and the ALMA logo was unveiled.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/121-ground-breaking-ceremony-for-the-atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma|title=Ground breaking ceremony for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)|author=Alejandro Peredo|accessdate=15 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111161008/http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/121-ground-breaking-ceremony-for-the-atacama-large-millimeter-array-alma|archivedate=11 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring an early stage of the planning of ALMA, it was decided to employ ALMA antennas designed and constructed by known companies in North America, Europe, and Japan, rather than using one single design.

At the end of 2009, a team of ALMA astronomers and engineers successfully linked three antennas at the {{convert|5000|m|adj=on}} elevation observing site thus finishing the first stage of assembly and integration of the fledgling array. Linking three antennas allows corrections of errors that can arise when only two antennas are used, thus paving the way for precise, high-resolution imaging. With this key step, commissioning of the instrument began 22 January 2010.\n\nOn 28 July 2011, the first European antenna for ALMA arrived at the Chajnantor plateau, 5,000 meters above sea level, to join 15 antennas already in place from the other international partners. This was the number of antennas specified for ALMA to begin its first science observations, and was therefore an important milestone for the project.<ref>{{cite news|title=European ALMA antenna brings total on Chajnantor to 16|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1127/|accessdate=29 July 2011|newspaper=ESO Organisation Release|date=28 July 2011}}</ref> In October 2012, 43 of the 66 antennas had been set up.\n\n==Scientific results==\n\n===Images from initial testing===\n[[Image:Antennae Galaxies composite of ALMA and Hubble observations.jpg|thumb|[[Antennae Galaxies]] composite of ALMA and [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]] observations]]\n[[File:HL_Tau_protoplanetary_disk.jpg|thumb|[[HL Tauri]] protoplanetary disk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://public.nrao.edu/news/pressreleases/planet-formation-alma|title=Birth of Planets Revealed in Astonishing Detail in ALMA's 'Best Image Ever' - NRAO: Revealing the Hidden Universe|work=nrao.edu}}</ref>]]\n\nBy the summer of 2011, sufficient telescopes were operational during the extensive program of testing prior to the Early Science phase for the first images to be captured.<ref>{{cite news|title=ALMA Opens its Eyes|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/297-alma-opens-its-eyes|accessdate=4 October 2011|newspaper=ALMA Press Release|date=3 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005042527/http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/press-room/press-releases/297-alma-opens-its-eyes|archivedate=5 October 2011}}</ref> These early images give a first glimpse of the potential of the new array that will produce much better quality images in the future as the scale of the array continues to increase.\n\nThe target of the observation was a pair of colliding galaxies with dramatically distorted shapes, known as the [[Antennae Galaxies]].

Assuming no zero error, this is also the measurement.]]\n[[File:Micrometers.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Outside, inside, and depth micrometers]]\n\nA '''micrometer''', sometimes known as a '''micrometer screw gauge''', is a device incorporating a calibrated [[screw]] widely used for [[Accuracy and precision|accurate]] measurement of components<ref>Encyclopedia Americana (1988) \"Micrometer\" Encyclopedia Americana 19: 500 {{ISBN|0-7172-0119-8}} (set)</ref> in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[machining]] as well as most mechanical trades, along with other [[Metrology|metrological]] instruments such as [[Caliper#Dial caliper|dial]], [[Caliper#Vernier caliper|vernier]], and [[Caliper#Digital caliper|digital calipers]]. Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of [[caliper]]s (opposing ends joined by a frame). The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.\n\nMicrometers are also used in telescopes or microscopes to measure the apparent diameter of celestial bodies or microscopic objects. The micrometer used with a telescope was invented about 1638 by [[ William Gascoigne (scientist)| William Gascoigne]], an English astronomer. <ref name=\"SGMicrometer\">{{cite web |title=What is a Micrometer & How it Historically Develops? |publisher=SG Micrometer. |url=http://sgmicrometer.com/micrometer-historically-develops-82.html}}</ref>\n\n==History of the device and its name==\n[[File:Gascoigne's micrometer as drawn by Robert Hooke.JPG|thumb|right|Gascoigne's Micrometer, as drawn by [[Robert Hooke]]]]\n \nThe word ''micrometer'' is a [[classical compound|neoclassical coinage]] {{ety|gre|micros|small||metron|measure}}. The ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary''<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|micrometer}}</ref> says that English got it from French and that its first known appearance in English writing was in 1670. Neither the [[metre]] nor the [[micrometre]] (\u03bcm) nor the micrometer (device) as we know them today existed at that time. However, the people of that time did have much need for, and interest in, the ability to measure small things and small differences. The word was no doubt coined in reference to this endeavor, even if it did not refer specifically to its present-day senses.\n\nThe first ever micrometric screw was invented by [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] in the 17th century, as an enhancement of the [[vernier scale|vernier]]; it was used in a telescope to measure angular distances between stars and the relative sizes of celestial objects.\n\n[[Henry Maudslay]] built a bench micrometer in the early 19th century that was [[wikt:jocular#Adjective|jocularly]] nicknamed \"the Lord Chancellor\" among his staff because it was the final judge on measurement [[accuracy and precision]] in the firm's work. In 1844, details of [[Joseph Whitworth|Whitworth]]'s workshop micrometer were published.<ref>\"Whitworth's workshop micrometer\", The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's magazine, Nov 1844, pp43-44</ref> This was described as having a strong frame of cast iron, the opposite ends of which were two highly finished steel cylinders, which traversed longitudinally by action of screws. The ends of the cylinders where they met was of hemispherical shape. One screw was fitted with a wheel graduated to measure to the ten thousandth of an inch. His object was ''to furnish ordinary mechanics with an instrument which, while it afforded very accurate indications, was yet not very liable to be deranged by the rough handling of the workshop''.\n\nThe first documented development of handheld micrometer-screw [[caliper]]s was by [[Jean Laurent Palmer]] of [[Paris]] in 1848;<ref>[https://archive.org/details/englishandameri01roegoog <!-- quote=wickham roe 1916. --> Roe 1916:212.]</ref> the device is therefore often called ''palmer'' in French, ''tornillo de Palmer'' (\"Palmer screw\") in Spanish, and ''calibro Palmer'' (\"Palmer caliper\") in Italian. (Those languages also use the ''micrometer'' cognates: ''microm\u00e8tre, micr\u00f3metro, micrometro''.) The micrometer caliper was introduced to the mass market in anglophone countries by [[Brown & Sharpe]] in 1867,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/englishandameri01roegoog <!-- quote=wickham roe 1916. --> Roe 1916:210-213, 215.]</ref> allowing the penetration of the instrument's use into the average machine shop. Brown & Sharpe were inspired by several earlier devices, one of them being Palmer's design. In 1888, [[Edward W. Morley]] added to the precision of micrometric measurements and proved their accuracy in a complex series of experiments.\n\nThe culture of [[toolroom]] accuracy and precision, which started with [[interchangeable parts|interchangeability]] pioneers including [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Gribeauval]], [[Louis de Tousard|Tousard]], [[Simeon North|North]], [[John H. Hall (soldier)|Hall]], [[Eli Whitney|Whitney]], and [[Samuel Colt|Colt]], and continued through leaders such as Maudslay, Palmer, [[Joseph Whitworth|Whitworth]], Brown, Sharpe, [[Francis A. Pratt|Pratt]], [[Amos Whitney|Whitney]], [[Henry M. Leland|Leland]], and others, grew during the [[Machine Age]] to become an important part of combining [[applied science]] with [[technology]]. Beginning in the early 20th century, one could no longer truly master [[tool and die maker|tool and die making]], [[machine tool]] building, or [[engineering]] without some knowledge of the science of metrology, as well as the sciences of chemistry and physics (for [[metallurgy]], [[kinematics]]/[[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], and [[quality (business)|quality]]).\n\n==Types==\n\n===Basic types===\n[[File:Micrometer--large--Woodworth 1908 p204.png|thumb|upright|Large micrometer caliper]]\n\n===Specialized types===\n[[File:Machining Turning.jpg|thumb|Another large micrometer in use.]]\nEach type of micrometer caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and spindle tips for particular measuring tasks. For example, the anvil may be shaped in the form of a segment of [[screw thread]], in the form of a v-block, or in the form of a large disc.\n* '''Universal micrometer sets''' come with interchangeable anvils, such as flat, spherical, spline, disk, blade, point, and knife-edge. The term '''universal micrometer''' may also refer to a type of micrometer whose frame has modular components, allowing one micrometer to function as outside mic, depth mic, step mic, etc. (often known by the brand names Mul-T-Anvil and Uni-Mike).\n* '''Blade micrometers''' have a matching set of narrow tips (blades). They allow, for example, the measuring of a narrow [[o-ring|o-ring groove]].\n* '''Pitch-diameter micrometers''' (aka '''thread mics''') have a matching set of thread-shaped tips for measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads.\n* '''Limit mics''' have two anvils and two spindles, and are used like a [[Go-NoGo gauge#Snap gauge|snap gauge]]. The part being checked must pass through the first gap and must stop at the second gap in order to be within specification. The two gaps accurately reflect the top and bottom of the [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] range.\n* '''Bore micrometer''', typically a three-anvil head on a micrometer base used to accurately measure inside diameters.\n* '''Tube micrometers''' have a cylindrical anvil positioned perpendicularly to a spindle and is used to measure the thickness of tubes.\n* '''Micrometer stops''' are micrometer heads that are mounted on the table of a manual milling machine, bedways of a lathe, or other machine tool, in place of simple stops. They help the operator to position the table or carriage precisely. Stops can also be used to actuate kickout mechanisms or limit switches to halt an automatic feed system.\n* '''Ball micrometers''' have ball-shaped ([[sphere|spherical]]) anvils. They may have one flat and one ball anvil, in which case they are used for measuring tube wall thickness, distance of a hole to an edge, and other distances where one anvil must be placed against a rounded surface. They differ in application from tube micrometers in that they may be used to measure against rounded surfaces which are not tubes, but the ball anvil may also not be able to fit into smaller tubes as easily as a tube micrometer. Ball micrometers with a pair of balls can be used when single-tangential-point contact is desired on both sides. The most common example is in measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads (which is also done [[Threading (manufacturing)#Inspection|with conical anvils or the 3-wire method]], the latter of which uses similar geometry as the pair-of-balls approach).\n* '''Bench micrometers''' are tools for [[inspection]] use whose [[accuracy and precision]] are around half a micrometre (20 millionths of an inch, \"a fifth of a tenth\" in machinist jargon) and whose [[repeatability]] is around a quarter micrometre (\"a tenth of a tenth\"). An example is the [[Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt & Whitney]] Supermicrometer brand.\n* '''Digit mics''' are the type with mechanical digits that roll over.\n* '''Digital mics''' are the type that uses an encoder to detect the distance and displays the result on a digital screen.\n* '''V mics''' are outside mics with a small V-block for an anvil. They are useful for measuring the diameter of a circle from three points evenly spaced around it (versus the two points of a standard outside micrometer).

The accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread-forms that are central to the core of its design. In some cases it is a [[differential screw]]. The basic operating principles of a micrometer are as follows:\n# The amount of rotation of an accurately made screw can be directly and precisely correlated to a certain amount of axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the screw's ''[[screw thread#Lead, pitch, and starts|lead]]'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8li\u02d0d/}}). A screw's ''lead'' is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360[[Degree (angle)|\u00b0]]). (In most threads [that is, in all single-start threads], ''lead'' and ''pitch'' refer to essentially the same concept.)\n# With an appropriate lead and major diameter of the screw, a given amount of axial movement will be ''amplified'' in the resulting circumferential movement.\n\nFor example, if the lead of a screw is 1&nbsp;mm, but the major diameter (here, outer diameter) is 10&nbsp;mm, then the circumference of the screw is 10\u03c0, or about 31.4&nbsp;mm. Therefore, an axial movement of 1&nbsp;mm is amplified (magnified) to a circumferential movement of 31.4&nbsp;mm. This amplification allows a small difference in the sizes of two similar measured objects to correlate to a larger difference in the position of a micrometer's thimble. In some micrometers, even greater accuracy is obtained by using a [[differential screw]] adjuster to move the thimble in much smaller increments than a single thread would allow.<ref>{{US patent reference\n | number = 343478\n | y = 1880\n | m = 02\n | d = 08\n | inventor = McArthur, Duncan\n | title = Micrometer Calipers\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=M.M.

A [[vernier scale]] is often included, which allows the position to be read to a fraction of the smallest scale mark. In digital micrometers, an electronic readout displays the length digitally on an [[LCD]] on the instrument. There also exist mechanical-digit versions, like the style of car [[odometer]]s where [[:File:Odometer2.jpg|the numbers \"roll over\"]].\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Micrometer caliper parts 0001.png|thumb|right|The parts of a micrometer caliper.

It is thick because it needs to minimize flexion, expansion, and contraction, which would distort the measurement.{{paragraph}}The frame is heavy and consequently has a high thermal mass, to prevent substantial heating up by the holding hand/fingers. It is often covered by insulating plastic plates which further reduce heat transference.{{paragraph}}Explanation: if one holds the frame long enough so that it heats up by 10&nbsp;\u00b0C, then the increase in length of any 10&nbsp;cm linear piece of steel is of magnitude 1/100&nbsp;mm. For micrometers this is their typical accuracy range.{{paragraph}}Micrometers typically have a specified temperature at which the measurement is correct (often 20&nbsp;\u00b0C [68&nbsp;\u00b0F], which is generally considered \"[[room temperature]]\" in a room with [[HVAC]]). [[Toolroom]]s are generally kept at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C [68&nbsp;\u00b0F].\n; Anvil: The shiny part that the spindle moves toward, and that the sample rests against.\n; Sleeve, barrel, or stock: The stationary round component with the linear scale on it, sometimes with vernier markings.

The 25 graduations on the thimble allow the 0.025&nbsp;inch to be further divided, so that turning the thimble through one division moves the spindle axially 0.001&nbsp;inch (0.025 \u00f7 25 = 0.001). Thus, the reading is given by the number of whole divisions that are visible on the scale of the sleeve, multiplied by 25 (the number of [[thousandth of an inch|thousandths of an inch]] that each division represents), plus the number of that division on the thimble which coincides with the axial zero line on the sleeve. The result will be the diameter expressed in thousandths of an inch. As the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., appear below every fourth sub-division on the sleeve, indicating hundreds of thousandths, the reading can easily be taken.\n\nSuppose the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 2, and three additional sub-divisions, were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 1 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading would then be 0.2000 + 0.075 + 0.001, or 0.276&nbsp;inch.\n\n===Metric system===\n[[File:578metric-micrometer.jpg|thumb|Micrometer thimble with a reading of 5.78{{nbsp}}\u00b1{{nbsp}}0.005{{nbsp}}mm.]]\n\nThe spindle of an ordinary metric micrometer has 2 threads per millimetre (a pitch of 0.5&nbsp;mm), and thus one complete revolution moves the spindle through a distance of 0.5 millimetres. The longitudinal line on the sleeve is graduated with 1 millimetre divisions and 0.5 millimetre subdivisions. The thimble has 50 graduations, each being 0.01 millimetre (one-hundredth of a millimetre). Thus, the reading is given by the number of millimetre divisions visible on the scale of the sleeve plus the particular division on the thimble which coincides with the axial line on the sleeve.\n\nSuppose that the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 5, and one additional 0.5 subdivision were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 28 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading then would be 5.00 + 0.5 + 0.28 = 5.78&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Vernier micrometers===\n[[File:5783metric-micrometer.jpg|thumb|Vernier micrometer reading 5.783{{nbsp}}\u00b1{{nbsp}}0.001{{nbsp}}mm, comprising 5.5{{nbsp}}mm on main screw lead scale, 0.28{{nbsp}}mm on screw rotation scale, and 0.003{{nbsp}}mm added from vernier.]]\nSome micrometers are provided with a [[vernier scale]] on the sleeve in addition to the regular graduations. These permit measurements within 0.001{{nbsp}}millimetre to be made on metric micrometers, or 0.0001&nbsp;inches on inch-system micrometers.\n\nThe additional digit of these micrometers is obtained by finding the line on the sleeve vernier scale which exactly coincides with one on the thimble. The number of this coinciding vernier line represents the additional digit.\n\nThus, the reading for metric micrometers of this type is the number of whole millimetres (if any)  and the number of hundredths of a millimetre, as with an ordinary micrometer, and the number of thousandths of a millimetre given by the coinciding vernier line on the sleeve vernier scale.\n\nFor example, a measurement of 5.783{{nbsp}}millimetres would be obtained by reading 5.5{{nbsp}}millimetres on the sleeve, and then adding 0.28{{nbsp}}millimetre as determined by the thimble. The vernier would then be used to read the 0.003 (as shown in the image).\n\nInch micrometers are read in a similar fashion.\n\nNote: 0.01 millimetre = 0.000393&nbsp;inch, and 0.002{{nbsp}}millimetre = 0.000078&nbsp;inch (78 millionths) or alternatively, 0.0001&nbsp;inch = 0.00254{{nbsp}}millimetres. Therefore, metric micrometers provide smaller measuring increments than comparable inch unit micrometers\u2014the smallest graduation of an ordinary inch reading micrometer is 0.001&nbsp;inch; the vernier type has graduations down to 0.0001&nbsp;inch (0.00254&nbsp;mm). When using either a metric or inch micrometer, without a vernier, smaller readings than those graduated may of course be obtained by visual interpolation between graduations.\n\n==Torque repeatability via torque-limiting ratchets or sleeves==\n{{original research|section|date=September 2016}}\nA micrometer reading is not accurate if the thimble is over- or under-[[torque]]d. A useful feature of many micrometers is the inclusion of a torque-limiting device on the thimble\u2014either a spring-loaded ratchet or a friction sleeve. Without this device, workers may overtighten the micrometer on the work, causing the mechanical advantage of the screw to tighten the screw threads or squeeze the material, giving an inaccurate measurement. However, with a thimble that will ratchet or friction slip at a certain torque, the micrometer will not continue to advance once sufficient resistance is encountered. This results in greater accuracy and repeatability of measurements\u2014most especially for low-skilled or semi-skilled workers, who may not have developed the light, consistent touch of a skilled user.\n\n{{Anchor|Low but consistent torque}} It might seem that there would be no such thing as too ''little'' torque on the thimble, because if zero tightening of the threads is the goal, then the less torque, the better. However, there is a practical limit on this ideal. Some tiny amount of torque, although very slight, is involved in the normal hand movements of well-practiced micrometer use. It is light but not truly zero, because zero is impractical for a skillful feel of how the contact is being made. And the [[#Calibration: testing and adjusting|calibration]] reflects this amount, as tiny as it is. If one then changes to an \"afraid to even touch it\" sort of [[wikt:gingerliness#Noun|gingerliness]], one is being inconsistent with the norm that the calibration reflects, resulting in a reading that is 1 to 3 [[thousandth of an inch#Tenths|tenths]] too big (on a typical metal part).\n\nRelated to this torque topic is interuser variation in what is normal. It is important to try not to have an [[wikt:idiosyncratic#Adjective|idiosyncratic]] touch, because although it works perfectly well for intrauser consistency, it interferes with interuser consistency. Some people use a rather heavy touch as a matter of habit, and this is fine in that they can get highly accurate readings as long as they calibrate their micrometer accordingly. The problem arises when they use someone else's micrometer, or when someone uses theirs. The heavy-touch user gets false-small readings, and the normal-touch user gets false-big readings. This may not arise in one-person shops, but teams of workers sharing company-owned instruments must be capable of interpersonal consistency to do close-tolerance work successfully. There is a good and easy way to synchronize on this topic: it is simply to get used to the \"feel\" of how much torque it takes to slip the typical friction sleeve or click the typical ratchet thimble\u2014and then incorporate that same feel into every use of a micrometer, even those that have no sleeve or ratchet. This is proper training for the machining trade, although it is not uncommon to encounter coworkers who were not well trained on this point. In many cases it seems that in drilling the \"don't overtorque\" idea into trainees' heads, an opposite extreme is mistakenly taught, where the user thinks the goal is to compete with everyone else on who can generate the lightest touch. Individuals naturally differ in their touch, so such a competition is not as effective at generating interuser consistency as is \"imagining that every thimble has a sleeve to slip.\"\n\nBench micrometers of the \"super-mic\" class entirely obviate this interuser variation by having the user dial the handwheel until a needle reads zero on a gauge, producing the same pressure on every reading.\n\n==Calibration: testing and adjusting==\n\n===Zeroing===\nOn most micrometers, a small [[wrench#spanner wrench|pin spanner]] is used to turn the sleeve relative to the barrel, so that its zero line is repositioned relative to the markings on the thimble. There is usually a small hole in the sleeve to accept the spanner's pin. This calibration procedure will cancel a zero error: the problem that the micrometer reads nonzero when its jaws are closed.\n\n===Testing===\nA standard one-inch micrometer has readout divisions of 0.001&nbsp;inch and a rated accuracy of \u00b10.0001&nbsp;inch<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starrett.com/download/222_p1_5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132738/http://www.starrett.com/download/222_p1_5.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}\nGENERAL MICROMETER INFORMATION</ref> (\"[[thou (length)#In machining|one tenth]]\", in machinist parlance). \nBoth the measuring instrument and the object being measured should be at room temperature for an accurate measurement; dirt, abuse, and low operator skill are the main sources of error.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahr.de/index.php?NodeID=13120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060139/http://www.mahr.de/index.php?NodeID=13120 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}\nMICROMETER ACCURACY: Drunken Threads and Slip-sticks</ref>\n\nThe accuracy of micrometers is checked by using them to measure [[gauge block]]s,<ref>BS EN ISO 3650: \"Geometrical product specifications (GPS). Length standards. Gauge blocks\" (1999)</ref> rods, or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known. If the gauge block is known to be 0.75000{{nbsp}}\u00b1{{nbsp}}0.00005{{nbsp}}inch (\"seven-fifty plus or minus fifty millionths\", that is, \"seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth\"), then the micrometer should measure it as 0.7500{{nbsp}}inch. If the micrometer measures 0.7503{{nbsp}}inch, then it is out of calibration. Cleanliness and [[#Low but consistent torque|low (but consistent) torque]] are especially important when calibrating\u2014each tenth (that is, ten-thousandth of an inch), or hundredth of a millimetre, \"counts\"; each is important. A mere speck of dirt, or a mere bit too much squeeze, obscure the truth of whether the instrument is able to read correctly. The solution is simply [[wikt:conscientious#Adjective|conscientiousness]]\u2014cleaning, patience, due care and attention, and repeated measurements (good repeatability assures the calibrator that his/her technique is working correctly).\n\nCalibration typically checks the error at 3 to 5 points along the range. Only one can be adjusted to zero. If the micrometer is in good condition, then they are all ''so near to zero'' that the instrument seems to read essentially \"-on\" all along its range; no noticeable error is seen at any locale. In contrast, on a worn-out micrometer (or one that was poorly made to begin with), one can \"chase the error up and down the range\", that is, ''move'' it up or down to any of various locales along the range, by adjusting the sleeve, but one cannot ''eliminate'' it from all locales at once.\n\nCalibration can also include the condition of the tips (flat and parallel), any ratchet, and linearity of the scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ittc.sname.org/2006_recomm_proc/7.6-02-04.res.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005092058/http://ittc.sname.org/2006_recomm_proc/7.6-02-04.res.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 }} ITTC \u2013 Recommended Procedures : Sample Work Instructions Calibration of Micrometers.</ref> Flatness and parallelism are typically measured with a gauge called an optical flat, a disc of glass or plastic ground with extreme accuracy to have flat, parallel faces, which allows light bands to be counted when the micrometer's anvil and spindle are against it, revealing their amount of geometric inaccuracy.\n\nCommercial machine shops, especially those that do certain categories of work (military or commercial aerospace, nuclear power industry, medical, and others), are required by various [[standards organization]]s (such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]],<ref name=\"B89.1.13 - Micrometers\">[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/b89113-2013-micrometers ASME B89.1.13 - 2013 Micrometers].</ref> [[ASTM International|ASTM]], [[SAE International|SAE]], [[Aerospace Industries Association|AIA]], [[United States Military Standard|the U.S. military]], and others) to calibrate micrometers and other gauges on a schedule (often annually), to affix a label to each gauge that gives it an ID number and a calibration expiration date, to keep a record of all the gauges by ID number, and to specify in inspection reports which gauge was used for a particular measurement.\n\nNot all calibration is an affair for metrology labs. A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, at least in the most basic and important way (if not comprehensively), by measuring a high-grade gauge block and adjusting to match. Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two, if they are used daily. They usually will check out OK as needing no adjustment.\n\nThe accuracy of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a master standard such as the [[International prototype of the metre|international prototype of the meter]]. This bar of metal, like the [[:File:CGKilogram.jpg|international prototype of the kilogram]], is maintained under controlled conditions at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] headquarters in France, which is one of the principal [[measurement standards laboratory|measurement standards laboratories]] of the world. These master standards have extreme-accuracy regional copies (kept in the national laboratories of various countries, such as [[NIST]]), and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons. Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength, the international prototype of the meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was. But such master gauges are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment. Equipment described as \"NIST traceable\" means that its comparison against master gauges, and their comparison against others, can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs. Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense, which is why NIST-traceable equipment is more expensive than non-NIST-traceable. But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost.\n\n===Adjustment===\nA micrometer that has been zeroed and tested and found to be off might be restored to accuracy by further adjustment. If the error originates from the parts of the micrometer being worn out of shape and size, then restoration of accuracy by this means is not possible; rather, repair (grinding, lapping, or replacing of parts) is required. For standard kinds of instruments, in practice it is easier and faster, and often no more expensive, to buy a new one rather than pursue refurbishment\n\n==See also==\n* [[Filar micrometer]]\n* [[Vernier scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{citation |last=Roe |first=Joseph Wickham |date=1916 |title=English and American Tool Builders |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |lccn=16011753 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage}}.

Micrometers are usually, but not always, in the form of [[caliper]]s (opposing ends joined by a frame). The spindle is a very accurately machined screw and the object to be measured is placed between the spindle and the anvil. The spindle is moved by turning the ratchet knob or thimble until the object to be measured is lightly touched by both the spindle and the anvil.\n\nMicrometers are also used in telescopes or microscopes to measure the apparent diameter of celestial bodies or microscopic objects. The micrometer used with a telescope was invented about 1638 by [[ William Gascoigne (scientist)| William Gascoigne]], an English astronomer. <ref name=\"SGMicrometer\">{{cite web |title=What is a Micrometer & How it Historically Develops? |publisher=SG Micrometer. |url=http://sgmicrometer.com/micrometer-historically-develops-82.html}}</ref>\n\n==History of the device and its name==\n[[File:Gascoigne's micrometer as drawn by Robert Hooke.JPG|thumb|right|Gascoigne's Micrometer, as drawn by [[Robert Hooke]]]]\n \nThe word ''micrometer'' is a [[classical compound|neoclassical coinage]] {{ety|gre|micros|small||metron|measure}}. The ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary''<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|micrometer}}</ref> says that English got it from French and that its first known appearance in English writing was in 1670. Neither the [[metre]] nor the [[micrometre]] (\u03bcm) nor the micrometer (device) as we know them today existed at that time. However, the people of that time did have much need for, and interest in, the ability to measure small things and small differences. The word was no doubt coined in reference to this endeavor, even if it did not refer specifically to its present-day senses.\n\nThe first ever micrometric screw was invented by [[William Gascoigne (scientist)|William Gascoigne]] in the 17th century, as an enhancement of the [[vernier scale|vernier]]; it was used in a telescope to measure angular distances between stars and the relative sizes of celestial objects.\n\n[[Henry Maudslay]] built a bench micrometer in the early 19th century that was [[wikt:jocular#Adjective|jocularly]] nicknamed \"the Lord Chancellor\" among his staff because it was the final judge on measurement [[accuracy and precision]] in the firm's work. In 1844, details of [[Joseph Whitworth|Whitworth]]'s workshop micrometer were published.<ref>\"Whitworth's workshop micrometer\", The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's magazine, Nov 1844, pp43-44</ref> This was described as having a strong frame of cast iron, the opposite ends of which were two highly finished steel cylinders, which traversed longitudinally by action of screws. The ends of the cylinders where they met was of hemispherical shape. One screw was fitted with a wheel graduated to measure to the ten thousandth of an inch. His object was ''to furnish ordinary mechanics with an instrument which, while it afforded very accurate indications, was yet not very liable to be deranged by the rough handling of the workshop''.\n\nThe first documented development of handheld micrometer-screw [[caliper]]s was by [[Jean Laurent Palmer]] of [[Paris]] in 1848;<ref>[https://archive.org/details/englishandameri01roegoog <!-- quote=wickham roe 1916. --> Roe 1916:212.]</ref> the device is therefore often called ''palmer'' in French, ''tornillo de Palmer'' (\"Palmer screw\") in Spanish, and ''calibro Palmer'' (\"Palmer caliper\") in Italian. (Those languages also use the ''micrometer'' cognates: ''microm\u00e8tre, micr\u00f3metro, micrometro''.) The micrometer caliper was introduced to the mass market in anglophone countries by [[Brown & Sharpe]] in 1867,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/englishandameri01roegoog <!-- quote=wickham roe 1916. --> Roe 1916:210-213, 215.]</ref> allowing the penetration of the instrument's use into the average machine shop. Brown & Sharpe were inspired by several earlier devices, one of them being Palmer's design. In 1888, [[Edward W. Morley]] added to the precision of micrometric measurements and proved their accuracy in a complex series of experiments.\n\nThe culture of [[toolroom]] accuracy and precision, which started with [[interchangeable parts|interchangeability]] pioneers including [[Jean-Baptiste Vaquette de Gribeauval|Gribeauval]], [[Louis de Tousard|Tousard]], [[Simeon North|North]], [[John H.

Pratt|Pratt]], [[Amos Whitney|Whitney]], [[Henry M. Leland|Leland]], and others, grew during the [[Machine Age]] to become an important part of combining [[applied science]] with [[technology]]. Beginning in the early 20th century, one could no longer truly master [[tool and die maker|tool and die making]], [[machine tool]] building, or [[engineering]] without some knowledge of the science of metrology, as well as the sciences of chemistry and physics (for [[metallurgy]], [[kinematics]]/[[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], and [[quality (business)|quality]]).\n\n==Types==\n\n===Basic types===\n[[File:Micrometer--large--Woodworth 1908 p204.png|thumb|upright|Large micrometer caliper]]\n\n===Specialized types===\n[[File:Machining Turning.jpg|thumb|Another large micrometer in use.]]\nEach type of micrometer caliper can be fitted with specialized anvils and spindle tips for particular measuring tasks. For example, the anvil may be shaped in the form of a segment of [[screw thread]], in the form of a v-block, or in the form of a large disc.\n* '''Universal micrometer sets''' come with interchangeable anvils, such as flat, spherical, spline, disk, blade, point, and knife-edge. The term '''universal micrometer''' may also refer to a type of micrometer whose frame has modular components, allowing one micrometer to function as outside mic, depth mic, step mic, etc. (often known by the brand names Mul-T-Anvil and Uni-Mike).\n* '''Blade micrometers''' have a matching set of narrow tips (blades). They allow, for example, the measuring of a narrow [[o-ring|o-ring groove]].\n* '''Pitch-diameter micrometers''' (aka '''thread mics''') have a matching set of thread-shaped tips for measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads.\n* '''Limit mics''' have two anvils and two spindles, and are used like a [[Go-NoGo gauge#Snap gauge|snap gauge]]. The part being checked must pass through the first gap and must stop at the second gap in order to be within specification. The two gaps accurately reflect the top and bottom of the [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]] range.\n* '''Bore micrometer''', typically a three-anvil head on a micrometer base used to accurately measure inside diameters.\n* '''Tube micrometers''' have a cylindrical anvil positioned perpendicularly to a spindle and is used to measure the thickness of tubes.\n* '''Micrometer stops''' are micrometer heads that are mounted on the table of a manual milling machine, bedways of a lathe, or other machine tool, in place of simple stops. They help the operator to position the table or carriage precisely. Stops can also be used to actuate kickout mechanisms or limit switches to halt an automatic feed system.\n* '''Ball micrometers''' have ball-shaped ([[sphere|spherical]]) anvils. They may have one flat and one ball anvil, in which case they are used for measuring tube wall thickness, distance of a hole to an edge, and other distances where one anvil must be placed against a rounded surface. They differ in application from tube micrometers in that they may be used to measure against rounded surfaces which are not tubes, but the ball anvil may also not be able to fit into smaller tubes as easily as a tube micrometer. Ball micrometers with a pair of balls can be used when single-tangential-point contact is desired on both sides. The most common example is in measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads (which is also done [[Threading (manufacturing)#Inspection|with conical anvils or the 3-wire method]], the latter of which uses similar geometry as the pair-of-balls approach).\n* '''Bench micrometers''' are tools for [[inspection]] use whose [[accuracy and precision]] are around half a micrometre (20 millionths of an inch, \"a fifth of a tenth\" in machinist jargon) and whose [[repeatability]] is around a quarter micrometre (\"a tenth of a tenth\"). An example is the [[Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt & Whitney]] Supermicrometer brand.\n* '''Digit mics''' are the type with mechanical digits that roll over.\n* '''Digital mics''' are the type that uses an encoder to detect the distance and displays the result on a digital screen.\n* '''V mics''' are outside mics with a small V-block for an anvil. They are useful for measuring the diameter of a circle from three points evenly spaced around it (versus the two points of a standard outside micrometer). An example of when this is necessary is measuring the diameter of 3-flute endmills and twist drills.\n\n==Operating principles==\n\n[[File:Micrometer no zero error.gif|thumb|Animation of a micrometer in use.

The accuracy of a micrometer derives from the accuracy of the thread-forms that are central to the core of its design. In some cases it is a [[differential screw]]. The basic operating principles of a micrometer are as follows:\n# The amount of rotation of an accurately made screw can be directly and precisely correlated to a certain amount of axial movement (and vice versa), through the constant known as the screw's ''[[screw thread#Lead, pitch, and starts|lead]]'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8li\u02d0d/}}). A screw's ''lead'' is the distance it moves forward axially with one complete turn (360[[Degree (angle)|\u00b0]]). (In most threads [that is, in all single-start threads], ''lead'' and ''pitch'' refer to essentially the same concept.)\n# With an appropriate lead and major diameter of the screw, a given amount of axial movement will be ''amplified'' in the resulting circumferential movement.\n\nFor example, if the lead of a screw is 1&nbsp;mm, but the major diameter (here, outer diameter) is 10&nbsp;mm, then the circumference of the screw is 10\u03c0, or about 31.4&nbsp;mm. Therefore, an axial movement of 1&nbsp;mm is amplified (magnified) to a circumferential movement of 31.4&nbsp;mm. This amplification allows a small difference in the sizes of two similar measured objects to correlate to a larger difference in the position of a micrometer's thimble. In some micrometers, even greater accuracy is obtained by using a [[differential screw]] adjuster to move the thimble in much smaller increments than a single thread would allow.<ref>{{US patent reference\n | number = 343478\n | y = 1880\n | m = 02\n | d = 08\n | inventor = McArthur, Duncan\n | title = Micrometer Calipers\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=M.M.

A [[vernier scale]] is often included, which allows the position to be read to a fraction of the smallest scale mark. In digital micrometers, an electronic readout displays the length digitally on an [[LCD]] on the instrument. There also exist mechanical-digit versions, like the style of car [[odometer]]s where [[:File:Odometer2.jpg|the numbers \"roll over\"]].\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Micrometer caliper parts 0001.png|thumb|right|The parts of a micrometer caliper. Note the addition of a [[unit conversion]] chart etched onto the frame, useful for converting between [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] [[inch]] measurements and their [[decimal]] equivalents.]]\n\nA micrometer is composed of:\n\n; Frame: The C-shaped body that holds the anvil and barrel in constant relation to each other. It is thick because it needs to minimize flexion, expansion, and contraction, which would distort the measurement.{{paragraph}}The frame is heavy and consequently has a high thermal mass, to prevent substantial heating up by the holding hand/fingers. It is often covered by insulating plastic plates which further reduce heat transference.{{paragraph}}Explanation: if one holds the frame long enough so that it heats up by 10&nbsp;\u00b0C, then the increase in length of any 10&nbsp;cm linear piece of steel is of magnitude 1/100&nbsp;mm. For micrometers this is their typical accuracy range.{{paragraph}}Micrometers typically have a specified temperature at which the measurement is correct (often 20&nbsp;\u00b0C [68&nbsp;\u00b0F], which is generally considered \"[[room temperature]]\" in a room with [[HVAC]]). [[Toolroom]]s are generally kept at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C [68&nbsp;\u00b0F].\n; Anvil: The shiny part that the spindle moves toward, and that the sample rests against.\n; Sleeve, barrel, or stock: The stationary round component with the linear scale on it, sometimes with vernier markings. In some instruments the scale is marked on a tight-fitting but movable cylindrical sleeve fitting over the internal fixed barrel.

It is inside the barrel. This references the fact that the usual name for the device in German is ''Messschraube'', literally \"measuring screw\".\n; Spindle: The shiny cylindrical component that the thimble causes to move toward the anvil.\n; Thimble: The component that one's thumb turns. Graduated markings.\n; Ratchet stop: (Not illustrated) Device on end of handle that limits applied pressure by slipping at a calibrated torque.\n\n==Reading==\n\n===Customary/Imperial system===\n[[File:276inch-micrometer.jpg|thumb|Micrometer thimble showing a reading of 0.2760&nbsp;\u00b1{{nbsp}}0.0005&nbsp;in.]]\nThe spindle of a micrometer graduated for the [[Imperial and US customary measurement systems]] has 40 threads per inch, so that one turn moves the spindle axially 0.025&nbsp;inch (1 \u00f7 40 = 0.025), equal to the distance between adjacent graduations on the sleeve. The 25 graduations on the thimble allow the 0.025&nbsp;inch to be further divided, so that turning the thimble through one division moves the spindle axially 0.001&nbsp;inch (0.025 \u00f7 25 = 0.001). Thus, the reading is given by the number of whole divisions that are visible on the scale of the sleeve, multiplied by 25 (the number of [[thousandth of an inch|thousandths of an inch]] that each division represents), plus the number of that division on the thimble which coincides with the axial zero line on the sleeve. The result will be the diameter expressed in thousandths of an inch. As the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc., appear below every fourth sub-division on the sleeve, indicating hundreds of thousandths, the reading can easily be taken.\n\nSuppose the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 2, and three additional sub-divisions, were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 1 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading would then be 0.2000 + 0.075 + 0.001, or 0.276&nbsp;inch.\n\n===Metric system===\n[[File:578metric-micrometer.jpg|thumb|Micrometer thimble with a reading of 5.78{{nbsp}}\u00b1{{nbsp}}0.005{{nbsp}}mm.]]\n\nThe spindle of an ordinary metric micrometer has 2 threads per millimetre, and thus one complete revolution moves the spindle through a distance of 0.5 millimeter. The longitudinal line on the sleeve is graduated with 1 millimetre divisions and 0.5 millimetre subdivisions. The thimble has 50 graduations, each being 0.01 millimetre (one-hundredth of a millimetre). Thus, the reading is given by the number of millimetre divisions visible on the scale of the sleeve plus the particular division on the thimble which coincides with the axial line on the sleeve.\n\nSuppose that the thimble were screwed out so that graduation 5, and one additional 0.5 subdivision were visible on the sleeve (as shown in the image), and that graduation 28 on the thimble coincided with the axial line on the sleeve. The reading then would be 5.00 + 0.5 + 0.28 = 5.78&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Vernier micrometers===\n[[File:5783metric-micrometer.jpg|thumb|Vernier micrometer reading 5.783{{nbsp}}\u00b1{{nbsp}}0.001{{nbsp}}mm, comprising 5.5{{nbsp}}mm on main screw lead scale, 0.28{{nbsp}}mm on screw rotation scale, and 0.003{{nbsp}}mm added from vernier.]]\nSome micrometers are provided with a [[vernier scale]] on the sleeve in addition to the regular graduations. These permit measurements within 0.001{{nbsp}}millimetre to be made on metric micrometers, or 0.0001&nbsp;inches on inch-system micrometers.\n\nThe additional digit of these micrometers is obtained by finding the line on the sleeve vernier scale which exactly coincides with one on the thimble. The number of this coinciding vernier line represents the additional digit.\n\nThus, the reading for metric micrometers of this type is the number of whole millimeters (if any)  and the number of hundredths of a millimeter, as with an ordinary micrometer, and the number of thousandths of a millimeter given by the coinciding vernier line on the sleeve vernier scale.\n\nFor example, a measurement of 5.783{{nbsp}}millimetres would be obtained by reading 5.5{{nbsp}}millimetres on the sleeve, and then adding 0.28{{nbsp}}millimetre as determined by the thimble. The vernier would then be used to read the 0.003 (as shown in the image).\n\nInch micrometers are read in a similar fashion.\n\nNote: 0.01 millimeter = 0.000393&nbsp;inch, and 0.002{{nbsp}}millimeter = 0.000078&nbsp;inch (78 millionths) or alternatively, 0.0001&nbsp;inch = 0.00254{{nbsp}}millimeters. Therefore, metric micrometers provide smaller measuring increments than comparable inch unit micrometers\u2014the smallest graduation of an ordinary inch reading micrometer is 0.001&nbsp;inch; the vernier type has graduations down to 0.0001&nbsp;inch (0.00254&nbsp;mm). When using either a metric or inch micrometer, without a vernier, smaller readings than those graduated may of course be obtained by visual interpolation between graduations.\n\n==Torque repeatability via torque-limiting ratchets or sleeves==\n{{original research|section|date=September 2016}}\nA micrometer reading is not accurate if the thimble is over- or under-[[torque]]d. A useful feature of many micrometers is the inclusion of a torque-limiting device on the thimble\u2014either a spring-loaded ratchet or a friction sleeve. Without this device, workers may overtighten the micrometer on the work, causing the mechanical advantage of the screw to tighten the screw threads or squeeze the material, giving an inaccurate measurement. However, with a thimble that will ratchet or friction slip at a certain torque, the micrometer will not continue to advance once sufficient resistance is encountered. This results in greater accuracy and repeatability of measurements\u2014most especially for low-skilled or semi-skilled workers, who may not have developed the light, consistent touch of a skilled user.\n\n{{Anchor|Low but consistent torque}} It might seem that there would be no such thing as too ''little'' torque on the thimble, because if zero tightening of the threads is the goal, then the less torque, the better. However, there is a practical limit on this ideal. Some tiny amount of torque, although very slight, is involved in the normal hand movements of well-practiced micrometer use. It is light but not truly zero, because zero is impractical for a skillful feel of how the contact is being made. And the [[#Calibration: testing and adjusting|calibration]] reflects this amount, as tiny as it is. If one then changes to an \"afraid to even touch it\" sort of [[wikt:gingerliness#Noun|gingerliness]], one is being inconsistent with the norm that the calibration reflects, resulting in a reading that is 1 to 3 [[thousandth of an inch#Tenths|tenths]] too big (on a typical metal part).\n\nRelated to this torque topic is interuser variation in what is normal. It is important to try not to have an [[wikt:idiosyncratic#Adjective|idiosyncratic]] touch, because although it works perfectly well for intrauser consistency, it interferes with interuser consistency. Some people use a rather heavy touch as a matter of habit, and this is fine in that they can get highly accurate readings as long as they calibrate their micrometer accordingly. The problem arises when they use someone else's micrometer, or when someone uses theirs. The heavy-touch user gets false-small readings, and the normal-touch user gets false-big readings. This may not arise in one-person shops, but teams of workers sharing company-owned instruments must be capable of interpersonal consistency to do close-tolerance work successfully. There is a good and easy way to synchronize on this topic: it is simply to get used to the \"feel\" of how much torque it takes to slip the typical friction sleeve or click the typical ratchet thimble\u2014and then incorporate that same feel into every use of a micrometer, even those that have no sleeve or ratchet. This is proper training for the machining trade, although it is not uncommon to encounter coworkers who were not well trained on this point. In many cases it seems that in drilling the \"don't overtorque\" idea into trainees' heads, an opposite extreme is mistakenly taught, where the user thinks the goal is to compete with everyone else on who can generate the lightest touch. Individuals naturally differ in their touch, so such a competition is not as effective at generating interuser consistency as is \"imagining that every thimble has a sleeve to slip.\"\n\nBench micrometers of the \"super-mic\" class entirely obviate this interuser variation by having the user dial the handwheel until a needle reads zero on a gauge, producing the same pressure on every reading.\n\n==Calibration: testing and adjusting==\n\n===Zeroing===\nOn most micrometers, a small [[wrench#spanner wrench|pin spanner]] is used to turn the sleeve relative to the barrel, so that its zero line is repositioned relative to the markings on the thimble. There is usually a small hole in the sleeve to accept the spanner's pin. This calibration procedure will cancel a zero error: the problem that the micrometer reads nonzero when its jaws are closed.\n\n===Testing===\nA standard one-inch micrometer has readout divisions of 0.001&nbsp;inch and a rated accuracy of \u00b10.0001&nbsp;inch<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starrett.com/download/222_p1_5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716132738/http://www.starrett.com/download/222_p1_5.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}\nGENERAL MICROMETER INFORMATION</ref> (\"[[thou (length)#In machining|one tenth]]\", in machinist parlance). \nBoth the measuring instrument and the object being measured should be at room temperature for an accurate measurement; dirt, abuse, and low operator skill are the main sources of error.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahr.de/index.php?NodeID=13120 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719060139/http://www.mahr.de/index.php?NodeID=13120 |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}\nMICROMETER ACCURACY: Drunken Threads and Slip-sticks</ref>\n\nThe accuracy of micrometers is checked by using them to measure [[gauge block]]s,<ref>BS EN ISO 3650: \"Geometrical product specifications (GPS). Length standards. Gauge blocks\" (1999)</ref> rods, or similar standards whose lengths are precisely and accurately known. If the gauge block is known to be 0.75000{{nbsp}}\u00b1{{nbsp}}0.00005{{nbsp}}inch (\"seven-fifty plus or minus fifty millionths\", that is, \"seven hundred fifty thou plus or minus half a tenth\"), then the micrometer should measure it as 0.7500{{nbsp}}inch. If the micrometer measures 0.7503{{nbsp}}inch, then it is out of calibration. Cleanliness and [[#Low but consistent torque|low (but consistent) torque]] are especially important when calibrating\u2014each tenth (that is, ten-thousandth of an inch), or hundredth of a millimeter, \"counts\"; each is important. A mere speck of dirt, or a mere bit too much squeeze, obscure the truth of whether the instrument is able to read correctly. The solution is simply [[wikt:conscientious#Adjective|conscientiousness]]\u2014cleaning, patience, due care and attention, and repeated measurements (good repeatability assures the calibrator that his/her technique is working correctly).\n\nCalibration typically checks the error at 3 to 5 points along the range. Only one can be adjusted to zero. If the micrometer is in good condition, then they are all ''so near to zero'' that the instrument seems to read essentially \"-on\" all along its range; no noticeable error is seen at any locale. In contrast, on a worn-out micrometer (or one that was poorly made to begin with), one can \"chase the error up and down the range\", that is, ''move'' it up or down to any of various locales along the range, by adjusting the sleeve, but one cannot ''eliminate'' it from all locales at once.\n\nCalibration can also include the condition of the tips (flat and parallel), any ratchet, and linearity of the scale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ittc.sname.org/2006_recomm_proc/7.6-02-04.res.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005092058/http://ittc.sname.org/2006_recomm_proc/7.6-02-04.res.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-05 }} ITTC \u2013 Recommended Procedures : Sample Work Instructions Calibration of Micrometers.</ref> Flatness and parallelism are typically measured with a gauge called an optical flat, a disc of glass or plastic ground with extreme accuracy to have flat, parallel faces, which allows light bands to be counted when the micrometer's anvil and spindle are against it, revealing their amount of geometric inaccuracy.\n\nCommercial machine shops, especially those that do certain categories of work (military or commercial aerospace, nuclear power industry, medical, and others), are required by various [[standards organization]]s (such as [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]], [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]],<ref name=\"B89.1.13 - Micrometers\">[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/b89113-2013-micrometers ASME B89.1.13 - 2013 Micrometers].</ref> [[ASTM International|ASTM]], [[SAE International|SAE]], [[Aerospace Industries Association|AIA]], [[United States Military Standard|the U.S. military]], and others) to calibrate micrometers and other gauges on a schedule (often annually), to affix a label to each gauge that gives it an ID number and a calibration expiration date, to keep a record of all the gauges by ID number, and to specify in inspection reports which gauge was used for a particular measurement.\n\nNot all calibration is an affair for metrology labs. A micrometer can be calibrated on-site anytime, at least in the most basic and important way (if not comprehensively), by measuring a high-grade gauge block and adjusting to match. Even gauges that are calibrated annually and within their expiration timeframe should be checked this way every month or two, if they are used daily. They usually will check out OK as needing no adjustment.\n\nThe accuracy of the gauge blocks themselves is traceable through a chain of comparisons back to a master standard such as the [[International prototype of the metre|international prototype of the meter]]. This bar of metal, like the [[:File:CGKilogram.jpg|international prototype of the kilogram]], is maintained under controlled conditions at the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] headquarters in France, which is one of the principal [[measurement standards laboratory|measurement standards laboratories]] of the world. These master standards have extreme-accuracy regional copies (kept in the national laboratories of various countries, such as [[NIST]]), and metrological equipment makes the chain of comparisons. Because the definition of the meter is now based on a light wavelength, the international prototype of the meter is not quite as indispensable as it once was. But such master gauges are still important for calibrating and certifying metrological equipment. Equipment described as \"NIST traceable\" means that its comparison against master gauges, and their comparison against others, can be traced back through a chain of documentation to equipment in the NIST labs. Maintaining this degree of traceability requires some expense, which is why NIST-traceable equipment is more expensive than non-NIST-traceable. But applications needing the highest degree of quality control mandate the cost.\n\n===Adjustment===\nA micrometer that has been zeroed and tested and found to be off might be restored to accuracy by further adjustment. If the error originates from the parts of the micrometer being worn out of shape and size, then restoration of accuracy by this means is not possible; rather, repair (grinding, lapping, or replacing of parts) is required. For standard kinds of instruments, in practice it is easier and faster, and often no more expensive, to buy a new one rather than pursue refurbishment\n\n==See also==\n* [[Filar micrometer]]\n* [[Vernier scale]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{citation |last=Roe |first=Joseph Wickham |date=1916 |title=English and American Tool Builders |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Connecticut |lccn=16011753 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-EJAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage}}.
