In 1918, The Cambridge School for Girls merged with the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-based [[Haskell School (Boston, Massachusetts)|Haskell School]], and was renamed The Cambridge-Haskell School. [[Lebanon|Lebanese]]-born poet [[Kahlil Gibran]], an \u201cintimate friend\u201d of headmistress [[Mary Haskell (educator)|Mary Haskell]], designed a ring for her students depicting a \u201cflower\u201d \u201cgrowing\u201d in an open \u201chand.\u201d<ref>[http://www.csw.org/page/about/history/1886 The Cambridge School of Weston- About CSW- History- 1886\u20131918] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406193203/http://www.csw.org/page/about/history/1886 |date=April 6, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, the school was moved {{convert|20|mi|km}} to its present campus in Weston under the direction of then-head of school John French, became [[coeducational]], and was renamed a final time as The Cambridge School of Weston (CSW). A follower of educational reformer [[John Dewey]], French put in place many of the [[progressive education]]al underpinnings that still guide the school, such as a focus on the whole student, [[experiential learning]], community involvement, and a low student-to-faculty ratio. In 1939, the school implemented a form of community self-governance modeled after the traditional [[New England]] [[town meeting]]. Following [[Robert's Rules of Order]], the entire school community, including students, meet to propose and debate school rules and policies, elect representatives to school committees, and decide on other relevant topics to the community. The Cambridge School Town Meeting continues to be a central part of the school's [[community governance]] to the present day.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe school has gained recognition as a pioneer of the [[Modular scheduling|Module System]], implemented in 1973 by then Head of School Bob Sandoe.\n\nThe goal of the Module, or \"Mod\" System, is to provide a framework to allow students to focus on fewer subjects more intensively during a given term. The academic year is divided into six terms (known as modules) of six weeks apiece. A school day consists of four class blocks of 90 minutes each, with some classes spanning several consecutive blocks. Students take up to three academic and one extracurricular class per mod. Some classes, such as those in mathematics or a foreign language, continue for multiple mods. No two students have the same schedule; every student's schedule is unique to themselves. Students submit what classes they would like to enroll in, and the faculty works on their schedule to fit their electives into their schedule, along with the required classes each class must participate in.\n\n== Tuition ==\nThe Cambridge School of Weston's tuition for the 2019-2020 school year is $63,000 for boarding and $50,900 for day students.<ref>https://www.csw.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/tuition-and-fees</ref> About 25% of students receive financial aid.<ref>https://www.csw.org/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/faqs</ref>\n\n==Initiatives==\nThe Cambridge School of Weston finished building a Green building called the Garthwaite Center for Science and Art, with a dedication ceremony and day of environmental education events on October 20, 2007. \n\n== Athletics ==\n\nThe Cambridge School of Weston offers the following interscholastic sports:<ref>https://www.csw.org/athletics/interscholastic-sports</ref>\n* [[Association football|Soccer]]\n* [[Cross country running]]\n* [[Field hockey]]\n* [[Basketball]]\n* [[Baseball]]\n* [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate]]\n* [[Volleyball]]\n* [[Tennis]]\n* Girls' [[lacrosse]]\n\nAdditional fitness courses offered include:<ref>https://www.csw.org/athletics/recreation-and-wellness-activities</ref>\n\n* [[Yoga]]\n* [[Rock climbing]]\n* [[Fencing]]\n* [[Bicycling]]\n* [[Weight training]] \n* [[Golf]] \n* [[Table tennis]]\n* [[Dance]] \n* [[Martial arts]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [Ella Williams[Squirrel Flower]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Wet (band)]], lead singer\n* [[Miguel Arteta]], director\n*[[Hilaria Baldwin]]\n* [[Louisa Bertman]], illustrator\n* [[Josh Clayton-Felt]], singer-songwriter\n* [[Andras Jones]], actor, singer-songwriter\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]], actress\n* [[Robert M.

{"title_page": "High-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles", "text_new": "[[File:Classics HD banner.png|thumb|right|Official Collection and Classics HD banners used on PlayStation game covers.]]\nSony has released a number of previously released [[PlayStation]] [[video game]]s, remastered in high-definition (HD) for their newer consoles, a form of [[porting]]. A number of related programs exist, the most prominent two being \"Classics HD\" (also known as \"HD Collection\") and \"PSP Remasters\". The former consists of multiple [[PlayStation 2]] games compiled on one [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The latter are individual [[PlayStation Portable]] games republished on Blu-ray. These games are not direct ports, but remastered versions in high-definition, to take advantage of the newer consoles' capabilities. The remastering of the games include updated graphics, new textures, and [[PlayStation Network#Trophies|Trophy]] support, and some of the remastered games released on [[PlayStation 3]] have included [[Stereoscopy|3D]] and [[PlayStation Move]] support. Some HD remasters have also been released individually or in bundles as downloads on the [[PlayStation Store]]; others are released exclusively as downloads.\n\nThis remastering began in 2009 with the release of ''[[God of War Collection]]''; it originally started as only PlayStation 2 (PS2) games being remastered for PlayStation 3 (PS3). PlayStation Portable (PSP) games began being remastered for the latter in 2011; ''[[Monster Hunter Portable 3rd|Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD ver.]]'' was the first of these. After the release of the [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2012, several of the remastered PS2 and PSP games began being released for this platform. Some original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (PS1) games also began being remastered. With the launch of the [[PlayStation 4]] (PS4) in 2013, Vita and PS3 games, in addition to the older platforms' games, began being remastered for it. Developers have also remastered games that were not originally released on a PlayStation console and remastered them for PlayStation platforms, in addition to releasing them for other non-PlayStation platforms.\n\nClassics HD is the official name given for these compilations in Europe; no equivalent of such name exists in North America or Japan. However, these games include the subtitle \"Remastered in High Definition\" or \"HD Collection\" on the North American cover. PSP Remasters is the official name given by Sony for collections featuring remasters of PSP games.<ref name=\"game_revolution_pspremasters\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/sony-releases-psp-engine-for-easy-psptops3-porting-6497 |title=Sony Releases 'PSP Engine' for Easy PSP-to-PS3 Porting |last=Severino |first=Anthony |date=30 June 2011 |website=[[Game Revolution]] |access-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909050233/http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/sony-releases-psp-engine-for-easy-psptops3-porting-6497 |archive-date=9 September 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The PSP Remasters line includes the same features as the Classics HD line, as well as cross-platform play and shareable saves between the two versions, however, PSP Remasters do not include Trophy support.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/05/23/psp-remaster-series-wont-include-ps3-trophy-support/ |title=PSP Remaster Series Won\u2019t Include PS3 Trophy Support |date=23 May 2011 |website=Siliconera |access-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827233955/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/05/23/psp-remaster-series-wont-include-ps3-trophy-support/ |archive-date=27 August 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Remastered games released on the PlayStation 4 will sometimes have the subtitle \"HD Remaster\", \"Remastered\", or \"Definitive Edition\". PlayStation 4 remasters have all the same features as remastered collections on PS3, but do not feature 3D or PlayStation Move support, though later releases could potentially support Move; 3D, however, is not a feature of the PlayStation 4 like it was on PlayStation 3.\n\n==Overview==\nThe first remastered collection to be released was ''[[God of War video game collections#God of War Collection|God of War Collection]]'', which consisted of ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]'' and ''[[God of War II]]''. This collection was released before the official line of Classics HD games. ''God of War Collection'' was brought about from feedback in anticipation for ''[[God of War III]]'' and what type of content fans would like to see in a special edition of that game. From this feedback, Sony released the collection separate from ''God of War III'' as a way to introduce new players to the franchise.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/08/31/god-of-war-collection-blu-ray-disc-compilation-available-this-holiday-season/ |title=God of War Collection \u2013 Blu-ray Disc Compilation Available This Holiday Season! |last=Caiazzo |first=Anthony |date=31 August 2010 |website=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |access-date=15 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CMK3qoZy?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/08/31/god-of-war-collection-blu-ray-disc-compilation-available-this-holiday-season/ |archivedate=22 November 2012 }}</ref> The success of ''God of War Collection'' prompted Sony to make a new line of games that would be bannered Classics HD in [[PAL regions]] (North American copies simply have the subtitle \"Remastered in High Definition\" or \"HD Collection\").

Developer [[Vicarious Visions]] coined the term \"remaster plus\" in describing whether or not the ''N. Sane Trilogy'' was a remaster or a remake. They said that they did not consider it a remake, because they did not \"fully remake [the games]\". They said that they used [[Naughty Dog]]'s original level geometry to rebuild the ''Crash'' gameplay from scratch. As the levels were coming together, they also added their own art, animation, and audio.<ref name=\"firstscreens\"/>\nIn 2018 Sega's Shenmue I and II collection was released for PS4 to prepare for [[Shenmue 3]].\n\n===Additional content===\nAlong with [[PlayStation Network#Trophies|Trophies]], 3D support, and HD upgrades, the various compilations also boast various other extras to accompany them. ''God of War Collection'', for example, contains bonus materials for ''God of War II'' that were originally released as a DVD in the ''God of War II'' two-disc set on PS2; early copies also included the ''[[God of War III]]'' demo. ''God of War: Origins Collection'' included the documentary, ''[[God of War (franchise)#Film and documentaries|God of War - Game Directors Live]]'', the Kratos Legionnaire bonus skin, and the Forest of the Forgotten combat arena, which were all originally released as a download via the ''Ghost of Sparta'' pre-order package. In Japan, the PS3 version of ''Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker: HD Edition'' is standalone and includes a code to download the PSP version while ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' and ''Metal Gear Solid 3'' are packaged separately in ''Metal Gear Solid HD'' and come instead with a download code for the original ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''. In North America and Europe, the three HD games are packaged together in ''Metal Gear Solid HD Collection'' with no downloadable games. ''Tekken Hybrid'' not only includes an HD upgrade of ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament]]'' and a prologue based on ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]'', but also comes with the 3D CGI film ''[[Tekken: Blood Vengeance]]''. Though the actual games are not included, ''Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix'' includes the cut scenes from ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', remastered in high definition, and cut scenes from ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded'' are included in the ''Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix'', also remastered in high definition.\n\nTo help showcase the addition of the PlayStation Move, ''The Sly Collection'' includes various additional minigames as well. ''The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection'' features bonus content, including two XMB Dynamic Themes and exclusive video content for ''Ico'', ''Shadow of the Colossus'', and ''[[The Last Guardian]]''; a demo for the latter was considered for inclusion, but was not. The collection also features the original PlayStation 2 cover arts for both games on the inner side of the case. The ''Silent Hill Collection'' includes both original and new recorded dialog for ''Silent Hill 2''.\n\nA notable feature with the ''PSP Remasters'' is that players can import saved games between the PSP version and the PS3 version and vice versa.\n\n==Games==\nThis following three lists contains games that have been remastered and released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4 consoles. Some games are part of the original Classics HD and PSP Remasters line, which were PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games, remastered and released exclusively on the PlayStation 3, followed by PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. Developers have extended the remastering of games to titles that were not PlayStation originals, and remastered releases have been released on platforms other than PlayStation. Originally, multiple games were remastered into collections, such as ''[[God of War Collection]]'', featuring remastered versions of ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]'' and ''[[God of War II]]''. Developers have since also remastered and released games individually, such as ''[[Killzone HD]]'', which is a remastered version of ''[[Killzone (video game)|Killzone]]''.\n\n===PlayStation 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:40%;\"|Title\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Game(s)\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|Prev.

"[[File:Classics HD banner.png|thumb|right|Official Collection and Classics HD banners used on PlayStation game covers.]]\nSony has released a number of previously released [[PlayStation]] [[video game]]s, remastered in high-definition (HD) for their newer consoles, a form of [[porting]]. A number of related programs exist, the most prominent two being \"Classics HD\" (also known as \"HD Collection\") and \"PSP Remasters\". The former consists of multiple [[PlayStation 2]] games compiled on one [[Blu-ray Disc]]. The latter are individual [[PlayStation Portable]] games republished on Blu-ray. These games are not direct ports, but remastered versions in high-definition, to take advantage of the newer consoles' capabilities. The remastering of the games include updated graphics, new textures, and [[PlayStation Network#Trophies|Trophy]] support, and some of the remastered games released on [[PlayStation 3]] have included [[Stereoscopy|3D]] and [[PlayStation Move]] support. Some HD remasters have also been released individually or in bundles as downloads on the [[PlayStation Store]]; others are released exclusively as downloads.\n\nThis remastering began in 2009 with the release of ''[[God of War Collection]]''; it originally started as only PlayStation 2 (PS2) games being remastered for PlayStation 3 (PS3). PlayStation Portable (PSP) games began being remastered for the latter in 2011; ''[[Monster Hunter Portable 3rd|Monster Hunter Portable 3rd HD ver.]]'' was the first of these. After the release of the [[PlayStation Vita]] in 2012, several of the remastered PS2 and PSP games began being released for this platform. Some original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (PS1) games also began being remastered. With the launch of the [[PlayStation 4]] (PS4) in 2013, Vita and PS3 games, in addition to the older platforms' games, began being remastered for it. Developers have also remastered games that were not originally released on a PlayStation console and remastered them for PlayStation platforms, in addition to releasing them for other non-PlayStation platforms.\n\nClassics HD is the official name given for these compilations in Europe; no equivalent of such name exists in North America or Japan. However, these games include the subtitle \"Remastered in High Definition\" or \"HD Collection\" on the North American cover. PSP Remasters is the official name given by Sony for collections featuring remasters of PSP games.<ref name=\"game_revolution_pspremasters\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/sony-releases-psp-engine-for-easy-psptops3-porting-6497 |title=Sony Releases 'PSP Engine' for Easy PSP-to-PS3 Porting |last=Severino |first=Anthony |date=30 June 2011 |website=[[Game Revolution]] |access-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909050233/http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/sony-releases-psp-engine-for-easy-psptops3-porting-6497 |archive-date=9 September 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The PSP Remasters line includes the same features as the Classics HD line, as well as cross-platform play and shareable saves between the two versions, however, PSP Remasters do not include Trophy support.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/05/23/psp-remaster-series-wont-include-ps3-trophy-support/ |title=PSP Remaster Series Won\u2019t Include PS3 Trophy Support |date=23 May 2011 |website=Siliconera |access-date=15 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827233955/http://www.siliconera.com/2011/05/23/psp-remaster-series-wont-include-ps3-trophy-support/ |archive-date=27 August 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Remastered games released on the PlayStation 4 will sometimes have the subtitle \"HD Remaster\", \"Remastered\", or \"Definitive Edition\". PlayStation 4 remasters have all the same features as remastered collections on PS3, but do not feature 3D or PlayStation Move support, though later releases could potentially support Move; 3D, however, is not a feature of the PlayStation 4 like it was on PlayStation 3.\n\n==Overview==\nThe first remastered collection to be released was ''[[God of War video game collections#God of War Collection|God of War Collection]]'', which consisted of ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]'' and ''[[God of War II]]''. This collection was released before the official line of Classics HD games. ''God of War Collection'' was brought about from feedback in anticipation for ''[[God of War III]]'' and what type of content fans would like to see in a special edition of that game. From this feedback, Sony released the collection separate from ''God of War III'' as a way to introduce new players to the franchise.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/08/31/god-of-war-collection-blu-ray-disc-compilation-available-this-holiday-season/ |title=God of War Collection \u2013 Blu-ray Disc Compilation Available This Holiday Season! |last=Caiazzo |first=Anthony |date=31 August 2010 |website=[[PlayStation Blog]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |access-date=15 November 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CMK3qoZy?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/08/31/god-of-war-collection-blu-ray-disc-compilation-available-this-holiday-season/ |archivedate=22 November 2012 }}</ref> The success of ''God of War Collection'' prompted Sony to make a new line of games that would be bannered Classics HD in [[PAL regions]] (North American copies simply have the subtitle \"Remastered in High Definition\" or \"HD Collection\").

Sane Trilogy]]'' at the [[PlayStation Experience#2016|PlayStation Experience]] event on December 3, 2016, which also revealed that it would release in 2017. Developer [[Vicarious Visions]] coined the term \"remaster plus\" in describing whether or not the ''N. Sane Trilogy'' was a remaster or a remake. They said that they did not consider it a remake, because they did not \"fully remake [the games]\". They said that they used [[Naughty Dog]]'s original level geometry to rebuild the ''Crash'' gameplay from scratch. As the levels were coming together, they also added their own art, animation, and audio.<ref name=\"firstscreens\"/>\nIn 2018 Sega's Shenmue I and II collection was released for PS4 to prepare for [[Shenmue 3]].\n\n===Additional content===\nAlong with [[PlayStation Network#Trophies|Trophies]], 3D support, and HD upgrades, the various compilations also boast various other extras to accompany them. ''God of War Collection'', for example, contains bonus materials for ''God of War II'' that were originally released as a DVD in the ''God of War II'' two-disc set on PS2; early copies also included the ''[[God of War III]]'' demo. ''God of War: Origins Collection'' included the documentary, ''[[God of War (franchise)#Film and documentaries|God of War - Game Directors Live]]'', the Kratos Legionnaire bonus skin, and the Forest of the Forgotten combat arena, which were all originally released as a download via the ''Ghost of Sparta'' pre-order package. In Japan, the PS3 version of ''Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker: HD Edition'' is standalone and includes a code to download the PSP version while ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' and ''Metal Gear Solid 3'' are packaged separately in ''Metal Gear Solid HD'' and come instead with a download code for the original ''[[Metal Gear Solid (1998 video game)|Metal Gear Solid]]''. In North America and Europe, the three HD games are packaged together in ''Metal Gear Solid HD Collection'' with no downloadable games. ''Tekken Hybrid'' not only includes an HD upgrade of ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament]]'' and a prologue based on ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]'', but also comes with the 3D CGI film ''[[Tekken: Blood Vengeance]]''. Though the actual games are not included, ''Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix'' includes the cut scenes from ''Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days'', remastered in high definition, and cut scenes from ''Kingdom Hearts Re:Coded'' are included in the ''Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix'', also remastered in high definition.\n\nTo help showcase the addition of the PlayStation Move, ''The Sly Collection'' includes various additional minigames as well. ''The Ico & Shadow of the Colossus Collection'' features bonus content, including two XMB Dynamic Themes and exclusive video content for ''Ico'', ''Shadow of the Colossus'', and ''[[The Last Guardian]]''; a demo for the latter was considered for inclusion, but was not. The collection also features the original PlayStation 2 cover arts for both games on the inner side of the case. The ''Silent Hill Collection'' includes both original and new recorded dialog for ''Silent Hill 2''.\n\nA notable feature with the ''PSP Remasters'' is that players can import saved games between the PSP version and the PS3 version and vice versa.\n\n==Games==\nThis following three lists contains games that have been remastered and released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation 4 consoles. Some games are part of the original Classics HD and PSP Remasters line, which were PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable games, remastered and released exclusively on the PlayStation 3, followed by PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4. Developers have extended the remastering of games to titles that were not PlayStation originals, and remastered releases have been released on platforms other than PlayStation. Originally, multiple games were remastered into collections, such as ''[[God of War Collection]]'', featuring remastered versions of ''[[God of War (2005 video game)|God of War]]'' and ''[[God of War II]]''. Developers have since also remastered and released games individually, such as ''[[Killzone HD]]'', which is a remastered version of ''[[Killzone (video game)|Killzone]]''.\n\n===PlayStation 3===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:40%;\"|Title\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Game(s)\n! style=\"width:10%;\"|Prev.

It is also often incorrectly applied to normal dysfluency rather than dysfluency from a disorder.  Cluttered speech is exhibited by normal speakers, and is often referred to as stuttering. This is especially true when the speaker is nervous, where nervous speech more closely resembles cluttering than stuttering.\n\nCluttering is sometimes confused with stuttering. Both communication disorders break the normal flow of speech, but they are distinct. A stutterer has a coherent pattern of thoughts, but may have a difficult time vocally expressing those thoughts; in contrast, a clutterer has no problem putting thoughts into words, but those thoughts become disorganized during speaking. Cluttering affects not only speech, but also thought patterns, writing, typing, and conversation.<ref>[http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html When speech is too cluttered - British Stammering Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511151645/http://www.stammering.org/cluttered.html |date=2008-05-11 }}</ref>\n\nStutterers are usually dysfluent on initial sounds, when beginning to speak, and become more fluent towards the ends of utterances.

It belongs to the family [[Pieridae]], which is the white and sulphurs.  These butterflies are mostly seen in the eastern United States, and in [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. They eat the nectar of violets and mustards. They tend to live in open, wet woods along waterways, in open swamps, and less often in dry woods and ridgetops.  This species is a true springtime butterfly, being on the wing from April to May (March to May in southern Texas).\n\n==Description==\nThe tip of the upper side of the male's forewing is orange; females, however, lack this. Both have a round black spot located in the cell. The underside of the hindwing usually has intricate green marbling. The orangetips have a wingspan of around 3.5-4.5 centimeters.\n\n==Similar species==\n[[File:Male Falcate Orangetip, Megan McCarty99.jpg|thumb|left|Underside of the wings]]\nThe only similar species in the falcate orangetip's range is the Olympia marble (''[[Euchloe olympia]]'').  The upper side of the Olympia marble's forewing has a grayish-black apex and the underside of the hindwing has yellow-green marbling.\n\n==Life cycle==\nMales [[Hill-topping (biology)|patrol hilltops]] and flats all day seeking females.  Females lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] singly on host plant flowers.  The eggs are yellow green but turn red just before hatching.  The [[larva]]e feed mainly at night and prefer to eat flowers, flower buds, and seed pods rather than leaves.  They are also [[cannibalistic]], devouring smaller larvae that may be feeding on the same plant.  The larva is olive green with a yellow mid-dorsal stripe.  There is a white spiracular stripe that runs the length of the body.  The body has short hairs and is covered with tiny black dots.  It can grow up to 3 centimeters long.

It belongs to the family [[Pieridae]], which is the white and sulphurs.  These butterflies are mostly seen in the eastern United States, particularly in [[Texas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. They eat the nectar of violets and mustards. They tend to live in open, wet woods along waterways, in open swamps, and less often in dry woods and ridgetops.  This species is a true springtime butterfly, being on the wing from April to May (March to May in southern Texas).\n\n==Description==\nThe tip of the upper side of the male's forewing is orange; females, however, lack this. Both have a round black spot located in the cell. The underside of the hindwing usually has intricate green marbling. The orangetips have a wingspan of around 3.5-4.5 centimeters.\n\n==Similar species==\n[[File:Male Falcate Orangetip, Megan McCarty99.jpg|thumb|left|Underside of the wings]]\nThe only similar species in the falcate orangetip's range is the Olympia marble (''[[Euchloe olympia]]'').  The upper side of the Olympia marble's forewing has a grayish-black apex and the underside of the hindwing has yellow-green marbling.\n\n==Life cycle==\nMales [[Hill-topping (biology)|patrol hilltops]] and flats all day seeking females.  Females lay their [[egg (biology)|eggs]] singly on host plant flowers.  The eggs are yellow green but turn red just before hatching.  The [[larva]]e feed mainly at night and prefer to eat flowers, flower buds, and seed pods rather than leaves.  They are also [[cannibalistic]], devouring smaller larvae that may be feeding on the same plant.  The larva is olive green with a yellow mid-dorsal stripe.  There is a white spiracular stripe that runs the length of the body.  The body has short hairs and is covered with tiny black dots.  It can grow up to 3 centimeters long.  The larvae pupate in mid-June.  The chrysalis is a yellowish color and is covered with black spots.  It also has a spike-like projection on the head which makes it look somewhat like a thorn.  The chrysalis may [[overwinter]] for two or more years.  This species has one brood per year.\n\n==Host plants==\nHost plants used by the falcate orangetip:\n\n* ''[[Arabis glabra]]''\n* ''[[Arabidopsis lyrata]]''\n* ''[[Arabis serotina]]''\n* ''[[Barbarea verna]]''\n* ''[[Boechera canadensis]]''\n* ''[[Boechera grahamii]]''\n* ''[[Boechera laevigata]]''\n* ''[[Cardamine angustata]]''\n* ''[[Cardamine bulbosa]]''\n* ''[[Cardamine concatenata]]''\n* ''[[Cardamine diphylla]]''\n* ''[[Cardamine hirsuta]]''\n* ''[[Cardamine parviflora]]''\n* ''[[Lepidium densiflorum]]''\n\n==References==\n*James A.

on the [[World Trade Center site|same site]] that were destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]].  The site is being rebuilt with up to six new skyscrapers, four of which have been completed; a [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum|memorial and museum]] to those killed in the attacks; the elevated [[Liberty Park]] adjacent to the site, containing the [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]] and [[Vehicular Security Center]]; and a [[World Trade Center (PATH station)#World Trade Center Transportation Hub|transportation hub]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"status\"/> The 104-story [[One World Trade Center]], the tallest building in the [[Western Hemisphere]], is the lead building for the new complex.\n\nThe buildings are among many created by the [[World Trade Centers Association]].

They were destroyed on the morning of September 11, 2001, when [[al-Qaeda]]-affiliated hijackers flew two [[Boeing 767]] jets into the complex in a coordinated act of [[terrorism]]. The attacks on the World Trade Center killed 2,753 people. The resulting [[collapse of the World Trade Center]] caused structural failure in the surrounding buildings as well. The [[Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks|process of cleaning up and recovery]] at the [[World Trade Center site]] took eight months, after which rebuilding of the site commenced.\n\nAfter years of delay and controversy, reconstruction at the [[World Trade Center site]] started. The new complex includes One World Trade Center, [[3 World Trade Center]], [[4 World Trade Center]], [[7 World Trade Center]], and one other high-rise office building being planned at [[2 World Trade Center]]. The new World Trade Center complex also includes a museum and memorial, and a transportation hub building that is similar in size to [[Grand Central Terminal]]. 7 World Trade Center opened on May 23, 2006, making it the first of five skyscrapers to have been completed in the World Trade Center complex. 4 World Trade Center, the first building completed as part of the site's master plan, opened on November 12, 2013. The National September 11 Memorial opened on September 11, 2011, while the Museum opened on May 21, 2014. One World Trade Center was opened on November 3, 2014. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened to the public on March 4, 2016, and 3 World Trade Center opened on June 11, 2018. 2 World Trade Center's full construction was placed on hold in 2009, with a new design announced in 2015.\n\n=={{anchor|Original towers}}Original complex and 9/11==\n{{Main|World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|September 11 attacks}}\n[[File:World Trade Center, New York City - aerial view (March 2001).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original World Trade Center in March 2001]]\n\nThe original World Trade Center featured the landmark Twin Towers, which opened on April 4, 1973,<ref name=\"nydn19730405\">{{cite web | title=World Trade Center is dedicated in 1973 | website=NY Daily News | date=April 5, 1973 |last=Moritz |first=Owen | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/world-trade-center-dedicated-1973-article-1.2170930 | access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref> and were the [[History of the tallest buildings in the world#Tallest buildings (from 1901)|tallest buildings]] in the world at their completion.

Center''' is a mostly completed complex of buildings in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[United States|U.S.]], replacing [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|the original seven buildings]] on the [[World Trade Center site|same site]] that were destroyed in the [[September 11 attacks]].  The site is being rebuilt with up to six new skyscrapers, four of which have been completed; a [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum|memorial and museum]] to those killed in the attacks; the elevated [[Liberty Park]] adjacent to the site, containing the [[St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church]] and [[Vehicular Security Center]]; and a [[World Trade Center (PATH station)#World Trade Center Transportation Hub|transportation hub]].<ref group=\"note\" name=\"status\"/> The 104-story [[One World Trade Center]], the tallest building in the [[Western Hemisphere]], is the lead building for the new complex.\n\nThe buildings are among many created by the [[World Trade Centers Association]]. The [[World Trade Center (1970\u20132001)|original World Trade Center]] featured the landmark Twin Towers, which opened in 1973, and were the [[History of the tallest buildings in the world#Tallest buildings (from 1901)|tallest buildings]] in the world at the time of their completion.

The new World Trade Center complex also includes a museum and memorial, and a transportation hub building that is similar in size to [[Grand Central Terminal]]. 7 World Trade Center opened on May 23, 2006, making it the first of five skyscrapers to have been completed in the World Trade Center complex. 4 World Trade Center, the first building completed as part of the site's master plan, opened on November 12, 2013. The National September 11 Memorial opened on September 11, 2011, while the Museum opened on May 21, 2014. One World Trade Center was opened on November 3, 2014. The World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened to the public on March 4, 2016, and 3 World Trade Center opened on June 11, 2018. 2 World Trade Center's full construction was placed on hold in 2009, with a new design announced in 2015.\n\n=={{anchor|Original towers}}Original complex and 9/11==\n{{Main|World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|September 11 attacks}}\n[[File:World Trade Center, New York City - aerial view (March 2001).jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original World Trade Center in March 2001]]\n\nThe original World Trade Center featured the landmark Twin Towers, which opened on April 4, 1973,<ref name=\"nydn19730405\">{{cite web | title=World Trade Center is dedicated in 1973 | website=NY Daily News | date=April 5, 1973 |last=Moritz |first=Owen | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/world-trade-center-dedicated-1973-article-1.2170930 | access-date=January 23, 2018}}</ref> and were the [[History of the tallest buildings in the world#Tallest buildings (from 1901)|tallest buildings]] in the world at their completion.

Bialystok and the region around it was kind of a buffer zone between the newly established Polish state and [[Soviet Russia]]. However, after Germany's defeat, over half a million German soldiers remained in Russia. On 11 November 1918, following the end of [[World War I]], Marshal [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[National Independence Day (Poland)|declared the establishment]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. At the same time, the German garrison in Bialystok, officers formed a soldiers' council\n(Soldatenrat). In 1917, the Central National Committee existed in the city, Bialystok District, at the head of which they stood priest Stanis\u0142aw Nawrocki, pastor from [[Zab\u0142ud\u00f3w]] and pharmacist Feliks Filipowicz. On the night of 11 November 1918, the Central National Committee concluded a peace agreement with Soldiers' Council. The Germans pledged to hand over their weapons and warehouses, while the Poles guaranteed them a safe departure to [[Eastern Prussia]]. Some of the Polish troops that found themselves in [[\u0141apy]] went to Bia\u0142ystok, where they were to support the Self-Defense Guards that had been created earlier, being a formation organized by officers from the corps of general [[J\u00f3zef Dowbor Mu\u015bnicki]], students who, under the command of Tu\u015bkiewicz, formed a force of 50 people and took over the posts at the station and in front of major buildings in the city.\n\nGerman authorities tried to isolate the population of the occupied areas such as Bia\u0142ystok from the newly established Polish state. Temporary eastern border reborn and Poland was to be insured by the Lithuanian-Belarusian Division of general Wac\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz and the Podlasie Division of general Antoni Lisowski organized in Bia\u0142a Podlaska. From December 1918, the Polish government commissioner Ignacy Mrozowski resided in Bia\u0142ystok. He accepted it created in time German occupation Temporary City Committee (consisting of 16 local citizens, including 6 Poles), headed by [[J\u00f3zef Puchalski]]. However, the situation was difficult and troublesome. The Germans took away the entire archive, leaving the municipal cash register empty. In addition, the organizational structure of the German military authorities deepened and demoralized groups of soldiers roamed the city.\n\nA General Civil Commissioner was then appointed to the Military Board of the Eastern Borderlands, which was to be the highest civil instance in the discussed territories - ruling and executive. In the field, commissioners were assigned to individual armies as inspectors of the General Civilian Commissioner poviat commissioners were to administer the poviat. Maciej Jamontt became the district commissioner for the areas of Bia\u0142ystok, his competences extended to poviats: Bia\u0142ystok, Bielsk, Sok\u00f3\u0142ka, Grodno and Wo\u0142kowysk.

J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski chose to avoid the option of German Army passing through the center of the country and be withdrawn by road through Bia\u0142ystok. Therefore, Bia\u0142ystok had to be left in German hands. On 5 February 1919, another Polish-German agreement was signed, so that where the German army withdrew, Polish troops could enter, because of the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and they were afraid of the occupation of other cities by the [[Red Army]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bialystoksubiektywnie.com/blog/2018/11/09/niepodleglosc-bialystok-1919/|title=NIEPODLEG\u0141O\u015a\u0106 BIA\u0141YSTOK ODZYSKA\u0141 P\u00d3\u0179NIEJ NI\u017b RESZTA KRAJU.

The population was adapted for individual self-defense, training was provided, and trenches and shelters were planned. Specialized services were created: alarm, communications, fire, rescue-sanitary and technical. In addition to scouts, representatives of: the Air and Gas Defense League (LOPP), the Polish Red Cross, the Western Union, Military Adoption, the Union of Reservists and Riflemen, and other organizations were involved in these activities. \"Echo Bia\u0142ostockie\" instructed what to do in the event of an air alarm. \u00a0\u00a0At the end of July, a large-scale operation of digging anti-aircraft ditches in the city began. Most of them were to be located downtown, in the area of two railway stations and barracks. Local citizens participated in rebounds for the purchase of armaments for the army. For example, employees of the Plywood State Factory from Dojlid, employing over 400 people, bought a heavy machine gun for the [[Polish Armed Forces (Second Polish Republic)|Polish Armed Forces]]. Also, money was collected for the National Defense Fund ({{lang-pl|Fundusz Obrony Narodowej}}) and Maritime Defense Fund ({{lang-pl|Fundusz Obrony Morskiej}}).

The local press reported on the successes of the [[Polish Armed Forces (Second Polish Republic)|Polish Forces]] and the raids of [[Polish Air Force]] on [[Berlin]]. Only the information about the entry into [[East Prussia]] of cavalry squadrons supported by horse artillery proved to be true. On the first defensive line there was relatively calm, there were only fights around [[Myszyniec]] and [[Grajewo]]. According to the [[Plan West|Polish defense plans]], Bia\u0142ystok was not intended for defense, and the military units located in the city took positions far from their garrison.

At the next meeting of the Municipal National Council, on 12 October 1944, it was decided that only employees would receive food stamps. Their family members were to remain without food allowances. Also, heavy taxation on all spheres of life: By resolution of the City Council, public games, entertainment events, and signboards were taxed and posters. A hotel tax was introduced, the land tax was increased by half, additional taxes were introduced for the production and sale of alcohol products.

Megaphones were used for propaganda and information purposes.\n\nAfter the securing of the city, during the [[Belostock Offensive]] of [[Operation Bagration]], by the [[Red Army|Soviet army]] on 27 July 1944, it was administered by the [[Byelorussian SSR]] as the capital of the restored [[Belastok Voblast]]. With the [[Border Agreement between Poland and the USSR of 16 August 1945]], Bia\u0142ystok, with the surrounding area, was passed on to the [[People's Republic of Poland]].\n\n===Polish People's Republic===\nBia\u0142ystok was, from 1945 until 1975, the capital city of the [[Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship (1945\u20131975)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]]. After the 1975 administrative reorganization of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the city was the capital of the smaller [[Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship (1975\u20131998)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]] which lasted until 1998.\n\nAfter the incorporation to the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the formation of Bia\u0142ystok downtown (both restoration and redevelopment) took place under the influence of the architectural school of Tadeusz To\u0142wi\u0144ski, whose student Ignacy Felicjan T\u0142oczek together with Stefan Zieli\u0144ski were the authors of the general city plan of Bialystok which was approved in 1948. The works were preceded by a conference organized by the Ministry of Reconstruction and the Voivodeship of Bia\u0142ystok. The work lasted between May and December 1948. Another important general plan was drawn  on behalf of the Spatial Regional Planning Directorate ({{lang-pl|Regionalna Dyrekcja Planowania Przestrzennego}}) by architects [[Stanis\u0142aw Bukowski]], [[Leszek D\u0105browski]], [[Ignacy T\u0142oczek]] and [[Stefan Zieli\u0144ski]]. \n\nThe plans assumed that by 1979 the city will have around 200,000 residents. The development direction was directed towards Supra\u015bl definitely against previous trends in the development of the eastern part of the city. Establishment of a river port, sewage collector and main communication route, which was to be the basis for using the potential of the river valley. In the Jurowiec area, a river port with a nuisance industry center was planned based on the railway line leading there to [[E\u0142k]]. This center was to constitute the northwestern edge of the urban area. The Bia\u0142a river valley was adopted as the basis for the directional development of the city (starting from Dojlid and ending at its mouth). The southern and western barriers to the city's development were to be forest areas, the airport in Krywlany and the swampy areas of Dojlidy. It was anticipated that in the west the city should not go beyond S\u0142oboda (today's Nowe Miasto) and Starosielce-Ba\u017cantarnia to the north-east.\n[[File:Politechnika Bia\u0142ostocka - wydzia\u0142 informatyki.jpg|thumb|[[Bialystok University of Technology|Bia\u0142ystok University of Technology]]]]\nThe districts were divided into functional zones: Administrative and cultural center located on the baroque axis of Branicki Palace and the two streets perpendicular to it: Warszawska and Piwna (Sk\u0142odowska-Curei). A shopping and offices center located between Lipowa and Sienkiewicza streets. Industrial center in Antoniuk and Fabryczna Station and [[Nowem]] and residential districts located in Antoniuk, Bojary on the right side of the Biala river and Piaski on the left bank of the Biala River. Recreation areas in the form of a forest in Pieczurki and Bia\u0142ostoczek, green areas along the Bia\u0142a River.\n\nThe city center was according to the plan the main communication axis (current Pi\u0142sudskiego Avenue and Branickiego Street) and an administrative center \u2013 stretching from the historical center with the Ko\u015bciuszki Square and ending with a complex of administrative buildings located at the intersection of the palace axis with Piwna Street (nowadays Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Street).\n\nAn important component of the reconstruction of the city center envisaged the moving of the core of the new city center away from the traditional town square to the 1989 Square. The House of the Party was constructed at the square with the Marie Curie Avenue which would act as \"representative\" avenue, stretching to the south from the square and will contain important public buildings. Kalinowskiego and Liniarskiego streets were created as well to connect the square to Lipowa Street. An important element in the planning of the city center after the war was the creation of \"Parade Avenue\", a representative thoroughfare. The shape was defined by Stanislaw Bukowski in 1950. As part of this plan, Marii-Curie-Skladowska Street (then called Alej Pochodow \"Parade Avenue\"). The street was designed to be constitute a new, representative axis of a socialist city. Along the street a number of important representative public buildings were built, such as the building number 1 (District Court), number 3 (House of the Unions {{lang-pl|Dom Zwi\u0105zkowca}}), number 23 (The Actor's House), {{lang-pl|Dom Aktora}}) \n\nOriginally in place of the Central Department Store it was planned to construct the seat for the Presidium of the Voivodeship National Council.<ref> B. Fialkowska, Politics and Artists (1948\u20131959), Warsaw 1985, p. 101-103.</ref> Also, different plans called for a set of administrative buildings with the Voivodeship and the City Council at the head, as well as the central post office and cinema (called also Centrum II), at the intersection of Skladowska-Curie, Waszyngtona and Legionow streets. However, this part of the plan was never materialized.<ref>Aleja Pochod\u00f3w \u2013 reprezentacyjna arteria nowego, socjalistycznego miasta Bia\u0142ystok. \u201eArchitecturae et Artibus\", Vol. 4, nr 3 (2012), pp. 41\u201342</ref> \n\nOn 20 October 1956, people of Bia\u0142ystok gathered at the radios and listened to the speech of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] delivered at the 8th Plenum of the Central Committee of the PZPR. A declaration of loyalty was published in Gazeta Bia\u0142ostocka from 23 October which emphasized the population of the Bia\u0142ystok region together with the entire Polish nation strongly supports the new leadership of the party in the implementation of the program outlined on the VIII Plenum. The next day around 15,000 people gathered in the courtyard of the [[Branicki Palace[[ (Medical University). First, the speeches of local PUWP leaders were heard, and then through the radio of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka's speech Speaking representatives of the workplace strongly criticized the provincial state and party authorities. The first secretary of the communist party in the city, [[Jan Jab\u0142o\u0144ski]] even submitted a public resignation, which was later rejected by the Executive Committee of the PZPR. After the rally, some of the participants went home, but several thousand people mainly students and young workers walked through Lipowa Street towards the [[Church of St. Rocha]]. The demonstrators carried national flags as well as the Hungarian flag as a sign of support for the Hungarian uprising. When they reached the church of St. Rocha Father Adam Abramowicz asked for a peaceful departure.<ref name=\"poranny1\">{{Cite news|url=https://poranny.pl/test-wiedzy-o-historii-bialegostoku-lata-50-i-60-xx-wieku/ar/9289892|title=Test Wiedzy o Historii Bia\u0142egostoku.

[[Antoni Laskowski]], a local party activist who was not imposed by the Central Committee for the first time, was entrusted with the function of the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, though this not for long, as after 3 weeks he was ousted by Gomulka. His place was taken by [[Arkadiusz \u0141aszewicz]].\n\nThroughout the 50s and 60s the fast growth of the city and its reconstruction from the damages of the war continued. The construction of the viaduct at D\u0105browskiego Street began, and the next year the W-Z route called Aleja 1 Maja (in 1990 it was renamed as J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudskiego Avenue). In 1959 the Housing Cooperative 'Rodzina Kolejowa' was completed. Also, The number of inhabitants of Bia\u0142ystok increased, which in the late 1950s became demographically one of the most dynamically developing Polish cities. In 1956, this number exceeded 100,000 people. The main reason for such rapid demographic development was the migration from smaller towns and villages of the region.<ref name=\"poranny1\"/>\n\nFrom the end of the 50s Bialystok saw massive construction of housing estates. Rodzina Kolejowa was inaugurated in 1959 and the 60s saw the construction of the Tysi\u0105clecie housing estate. Between 1960 and 1965 mass housing estate was built in [[Osiedle Antoniuk, Bia\u0142ystok|Antoniuk District]].

It was made of representatives of seventeen factories; each stood for the most important factory of every voivodeship of the pre-1975 Poland. The workers from the Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship were represented by the Cotton Works Fasty in Bia\u0142ystok.\n\nApart from the National Strike Committee, several Interfactory Founding Committees (MKZ) were created in major cities. For security reasons, these offices were moved to large factories for the time of the strike, no matter how long it was planned to be.

Bialystok and the region around it was kind of a buffer zone between the newly established Polish state and [[Soviet Russia]]. However, after Germany's defeat, over half a million German soldiers remained in Russia. On 11 November 1918, following the end of [[World War I]], Marshal [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], [[National Independence Day (Poland)|declared the establishment]] of the [[Second Polish Republic]]. At the same time, the German garrison in Bialystok, officers formed a soldiers' council\n(Soldatenrat). In 1917, the Central National Committee existed in the city, Bialystok District, at the head of which they stood priest Stanis\u0142aw Nawrocki, pastor from [[Zab\u0142ud\u00f3w]] and pharmacist Feliks Filipowicz. On the night of 11 November 1918, the Central National Committee concluded a peace agreement with Soldiers' Council. The Germans pledged to hand over their weapons and warehouses, while the Poles guaranteed them a safe departure to [[Eastern Prussia]]. Some of the Polish troops that found themselves in [[\u0141apy]] went to Bia\u0142ystok, where they were to support the Self-Defense Guards that had been created earlier, being a formation organized by officers from the corps of general [[J\u00f3zef Dowbor Mu\u015bnicki]], students who, under the command of Tu\u015bkiewicz, formed a force of 50 people and took over the posts at the station and in front of major buildings in the city.\n\nGerman authorities tried to isolate the population of the occupied areas such as Bia\u0142ystok from the newly established Polish state. Temporary eastern border reborn and Poland was to be insured by the Lithuanian-Belarusian Division of general Wac\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz and the Podlasie Division of general Antoni Lisowski organized in Bia\u0142a Podlaska. From December 1918, the Polish government commissioner Ignacy Mrozowski resided in Bia\u0142ystok. He accepted it created in time German occupation Temporary City Committee (consisting of 16 local citizens, including 6 Poles), headed by [[J\u00f3zef Puchalski]]. However, the situation was difficult and troublesome. The Germans took away the entire archive, leaving the municipal cash register empty. In addition, the organizational structure of the German military authorities deepened and demoralized groups of soldiers roamed the city.\n\nA General Civil Commissioner was then appointed to the Military Board of the Eastern Borderlands, which was to be the highest civil instance in the discussed territories - ruling and executive. In the field, commissioners were assigned to individual armies as inspectors of the General Civilian Commissioner poviat commissioners were to administer the poviat. Maciej Jamontt became the district commissioner for the areas of Bia\u0142ystok, his competences extended to poviats: Bia\u0142ystok, Bielsk, Sok\u00f3\u0142ka, Grodno and Wo\u0142kowysk.

J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski chose to avoid the option of German Army passing through the center of the country and be withdrawn by road through Bia\u0142ystok. Therefore, Bia\u0142ystok had to be left in German hands. On 5 February 1919, another Polish-German agreement was signed, so that where the German army withdrew, Polish troops could enter, because of the [[October Revolution|Russian Revolution]] and they were afraid of the occupation of other cities by the [[Red Army]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://bialystoksubiektywnie.com/blog/2018/11/09/niepodleglosc-bialystok-1919/|title=NIEPODLEG\u0141O\u015a\u0106 BIA\u0141YSTOK ODZYSKA\u0141 P\u00d3\u0179NIEJ NI\u017b RESZTA KRAJU.

The population was adapted for individual self-defense, training was provided, and trenches and shelters were planned. Specialized services were created: alarm, communications, fire, rescue-sanitary and technical. In addition to scouts, representatives of: the Air and Gas Defense League (LOPP), the Polish Red Cross, the Western Union, Military Adoption, the Union of Reservists and Riflemen, and other organizations were involved in these activities. \"Echo Bia\u0142ostockie\" instructed what to do in the event of an air alarm. \u00a0\u00a0At the end of July, a large-scale operation of digging anti-aircraft ditches in the city began. Most of them were to be located downtown, in the area of two railway stations and barracks. Local citizens participated in rebounds for the purchase of armaments for the army. For example, employees of the Plywood State Factory from Dojlid, employing over 400 people, bought a heavy machine gun for the [[Polish Armed Forces (Second Polish Republic)|Polish Armed Forces]]. Also, money was collected for the National Defense Fund ({{lang-pl|Fundusz Obrony Narodowej}}) and Maritime Defense Fund ({{lang-pl|Fundusz Obrony Morskiej}}).

The local press reported on the successes of the [[Polish Armed Forces (Second Polish Republic)|Polish Forces]] and the raids of [[Polish Air Force]] on [[Berlin]]. Only the information about the entry into [[East Prussia]] of cavalry squadrons supported by horse artillery proved to be true. On the first defensive line there was relatively calm, there were only fights around [[Myszyniec]] and [[Grajewo]]. According to the [[Plan West|Polish defense plans]], Bia\u0142ystok was not intended for defense, and the military units located in the city took positions far from their garrison.

At the next meeting of the Municipal National Council, on 12 October 1944, it was decided that only employees would receive food stamps. Their family members were to remain without food allowances. Also, heavy taxation on all spheres of life: By resolution of the City Council, public games, entertainment events, and signboards were taxed and posters. A hotel tax was introduced, the land tax was increased by half, additional taxes were introduced for the production and sale of alcohol products.

Megaphones were used for propaganda and information purposes.\n\nAfter the securing of the city, during the [[Belostock Offensive]] of [[Operation Bagration]], by the [[Red Army|Soviet army]] on 27 July 1944, it was administered by the [[Byelorussian SSR]] as the capital of the restored [[Belastok Voblast]]. With the [[Border Agreement between Poland and the USSR of 16 August 1945]], Bia\u0142ystok, with the surrounding area, was passed on to the [[People's Republic of Poland]].\n\n===Polish People's Republic===\nBia\u0142ystok was, from 1945 until 1975, the capital city of the [[Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship (1945\u20131975)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]]. After the 1975 administrative reorganization of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the city was the capital of the smaller [[Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship (1975\u20131998)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]] which lasted until 1998.\n\nAfter the incorporation to the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the formation of Bia\u0142ystok downtown (both restoration and redevelopment) took place under the influence of the architectural school of Tadeusz To\u0142wi\u0144ski, whose student Ignacy Felicjan T\u0142oczek together with Stefan Zieli\u0144ski were the authors of the general city plan of Bialystok which was approved in 1948. The works were preceded by a conference organized by the Ministry of Reconstruction and the Voivodeship of Bia\u0142ystok. The work lasted between May and December 1948. Another important general plan was drawn  on behalf of the Spatial Regional Planning Directorate ({{lang-pl|Regionalna Dyrekcja Planowania Przestrzennego}}) by architects [[Stanis\u0142aw Bukowski]], [[Leszek D\u0105browski]], [[Ignacy T\u0142oczek]] and [[Stefan Zieli\u0144ski]]. \n\nThe plans assumed that by 1979 the city will have around 200,000 residents. The development direction was directed towards Supra\u015bl definitely against previous trends in the development of the eastern part of the city. Establishment of a river port, sewage collector and main communication route, which was to be the basis for using the potential of the river valley. In the Jurowiec area, a river port with a nuisance industry center was planned based on the railway line leading there to [[E\u0142k]]. This center was to constitute the northwestern edge of the urban area. The Bia\u0142a river valley was adopted as the basis for the directional development of the city (starting from Dojlid and ending at its mouth). The southern and western barriers to the city's development were to be forest areas, the airport in Krywlany and the swampy areas of Dojlidy. It was anticipated that in the west the city should not go beyond S\u0142oboda (today's Nowe Miasto) and Starosielce-Ba\u017cantarnia to the north-east.\n[[File:Politechnika Bia\u0142ostocka - wydzia\u0142 informatyki.jpg|thumb|[[Bialystok University of Technology|Bia\u0142ystok University of Technology]]]]\nThe districts were divided into functional zones: Administrative and cultural center located on the baroque axis of Branicki Palace and the two streets perpendicular to it: Warszawska and Piwna (Sk\u0142odowska-Curei). A shopping and offices center located between Lipowa and Sienkiewicza streets. Industrial center in Antoniuk and Fabryczna Station and [[Nowem]] and residential districts located in Antoniuk, Bojary on the right side of the Biala river and Piaski on the left bank of the Biala River. Recreation areas in the form of a forest in Pieczurki and Bia\u0142ostoczek, green areas along the Bia\u0142a River.\n\nThe city center was according to the plan the main communication axis (current Pi\u0142sudskiego Avenue and Branickiego Street) and an administrative center \u2013 stretching from the historical center with the Ko\u015bciuszki Square and ending with a complex of administrative buildings located at the intersection of the palace axis with Piwna Street (nowadays Sk\u0142odowska-Curie Street).\n\nAn important component of the reconstruction of the city center envisaged the moving of the core of the new city center away from the traditional town square to the 1989 Square. The House of the Party was constructed at the square with the Marie Curie Avenue which would act as \"representative\" avenue, stretching to the south from the square and will contain important public buildings. Kalinowskiego and Liniarskiego streets were created as well to connect the square to Lipowa Street. An important element in the planning of the city center after the war was the creation of \"Parade Avenue\", a representative thoroughfare. The shape was defined by Stanislaw Bukowski in 1950. As part of this plan, Marii-Curie-Skladowska Street (then called Alej Pochodow \"Parade Avenue\"). The street was designed to be constitute a new, representative axis of a socialist city. Along the street a number of important representative public buildings were built, such as the building number 1 (District Court), number 3 (House of the Unions {{lang-pl|Dom Zwi\u0105zkowca}}), number 23 (The Actor's House), {{lang-pl|Dom Aktora}}) \n\nOriginally in place of the Central Department Store it was planned to construct the seat for the Presidium of the Voivodeship National Council.<ref> B. Fialkowska, Politics and Artists (1948\u20131959), Warsaw 1985, p. 101-103.</ref> Also, different plans called for a set of administrative buildings with the Voivodeship and the City Council at the head, as well as the central post office and cinema (called also Centrum II), at the intersection of Skladowska-Curie, Waszyngtona and Legionow streets. However, this part of the plan was never materialized.<ref>Aleja Pochod\u00f3w \u2013 reprezentacyjna arteria nowego, socjalistycznego miasta Bia\u0142ystok. \u201eArchitecturae et Artibus\", Vol. 4, nr 3 (2012), pp. 41\u201342</ref> \n\nOn 20 October 1956, people of Bia\u0142ystok gathered at the radios and listened to the speech of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] delivered at the 8th Plenum of the Central Committee of the PZPR. A declaration of loyalty was published in Gazeta Bia\u0142ostocka from 23 October which emphasized the population of the Bia\u0142ystok region together with the entire Polish nation strongly supports the new leadership of the party in the implementation of the program outlined on the VIII Plenum. The next day around 15,000 people gathered in the courtyard of the [[Branicki Palace[[ (Medical University). First, the speeches of local PUWP leaders were heard, and then through the radio of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka's speech Speaking representatives of the workplace strongly criticized the provincial state and party authorities. The first secretary of the communist party in the city, [[Jan Jab\u0142o\u0144ski]] even submitted a public resignation, which was later rejected by the Executive Committee of the PZPR. After the rally, some of the participants went home, but several thousand people mainly students and young workers walked through Lipowa Street towards the [[Church of St. Rocha]]. The demonstrators carried national flags as well as the Hungarian flag as a sign of support for the Hungarian uprising. When they reached the church of St. Rocha Father Adam Abramowicz asked for a peaceful departure.<ref name=\"poranny1\">{{Cite news|url=https://poranny.pl/test-wiedzy-o-historii-bialegostoku-lata-50-i-60-xx-wieku/ar/9289892|title=Test Wiedzy o Historii Bia\u0142egostoku.

[[Antoni Laskowski]], a local party activist who was not imposed by the Central Committee for the first time, was entrusted with the function of the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, though this not for long, as after 3 weeks he was ousted by Gomulka. His place was taken by [[Arkadiusz \u0141aszewicz]].\n\nThroughout the 50s and 60s the fast growth of the city and its reconstruction from the damages of the war continued. The construction of the viaduct at D\u0105browskiego Street began, and the next year the W-Z route called Aleja 1 Maja (in 1990 it was renamed as J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudskiego Avenue). In 1959 the Housing Cooperative 'Rodzina Kolejowa' was completed. Also, The number of inhabitants of Bia\u0142ystok increased, which in the late 1950s became demographically one of the most dynamically developing Polish cities. In 1956, this number exceeded 100,000 people. The main reason for such rapid demographic development was the migration from smaller towns and villages of the region.<ref name=\"poranny1\"/>\n\nFrom the end of the 50s Bialystok saw massive construction of housing estates. Rodzina Kolejowa was inagurated in 1959 and the 60s saw the construction of the Tysi\u0105clecie housing estate. Between 1960 and 1965 mass housing estate was built in [[Osiedle Antoniuk, Bia\u0142ystok|Antoniuk District]]. Late 60s and early 70s saw the construction of Przyja\u017a\u0144, and [[Bia\u0142ostoczek (Bia\u0142ystok)|Bia\u0142ostoczek]] housing estates as well as Dziesi\u0119ciny I and II.

It was made of representatives of seventeen factories; each stood for the most important factory of every voivodeship of the pre-1975 Poland. The workers from the Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship were represented by the Cotton Works Fasty in Bia\u0142ystok.\n\nApart from the National Strike Committee, several Interfactory Founding Committees (MKZ) were created in major cities. For security reasons, these offices were moved to large factories for the time of the strike, no matter how long it was planned to be. The MZK \nBia\u0142ystok Committee was placed in the Factory of Instruments and Handles in Bia\u0142ystok.\n\nIn the days following the initial [[Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland|hunger demonstration]] on 25 July 1981 in [[Kutno]], additional demonstrations were organized in numerous cities across whole country including Bia\u0142ystok. Most of participants were women and their children,<ref>[http://www.encyklopedia-solidarnosci.pl/wiki/index.php?title=TL-1981/07 Encyclopedia of Solidarity, July 1981]</ref> with men walking on the sides and trying to protect the demonstrators.

In October 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] to run for [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Senate]] after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], but was defeated by [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.\n\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"[[Church Committee]]\").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\n\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name=\"wamu\">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|accessdate=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcripturl=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session.

Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\".<ref name=\"as204_senate\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|authorlink=Clinton P.

His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\"<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/famous.speeches/mondale.84.shtml Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984], AllPolitics</ref> While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.\n\n[[File:Mondale Ferraro.svg|thumb|left|One of the logos of the Mondale campaign]]\nMondale ran a [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\nMondale received 37,577,352 votes\u201440.6% of the popular vote. He won 40\u201349% in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n===Private citizen and ambassador===\nMondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate \"Leaders Lecture Series\" that ran from 1998 to 2002.<ref>\n[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Mondale.htm Address by Vice President Walter Mondale, September 4, 2002, in the United States Senate]<br>[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/f_two_sections_with_teasers/leader_lecture_series.htm Leader's Lecture Series Speakers]\n</ref>\n\n===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===\n{{Main|United States Senate elections, 2002|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}\n[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984). Upon conceding defeat, Mondale said, \"At the end of what will be my last campaign, I want to say to Minnesota, you always treated me well, you always listened to me.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,69286,00.html|title=Mondale Concedes to Coleman|work=Fox News}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Mondale became co-chairman of the [[Constitution Project]]'s bipartisan Right to Counsel Committee.<ref>[http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&categoryId=6] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814000144/http://www.constitutionproject.org/righttocounsel/article.cfm?messageID=73&categoryId=6|date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> He endorsed Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] for president in [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|2008]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127223358/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=4039|date=November 27, 2008}}</ref> On June 3, 2008, following the final primary contests, Mondale endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had clinched the nomination the previous evening, and won the presidency.\n\nFollowing the [[2004 United States presidential election|presidential election of 2004]] and the midterm elections of 2006, Mondale is seen talking with [[Al Franken]] about the possibility of the latter running against Coleman for Senate in 2008 in the documentary ''[[Al Franken: God Spoke]]''.<ref>Al Franken: God Spoke at the Internet Movie Database</ref> In the film, Mondale encourages Franken to run, but cautions him, saying that Coleman's allies and the Republican Party would look for anything they could use against him.

A [[United States Senator|United States senator]] from [[Minnesota]] (1964\u20131976), he was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Walter Mondale presidential campaign, 1984|nominee]] in the [[United States presidential election of 1984]], but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] [[Landslide victory|landslide]]. Reagan won 49 states while Mondale carried his home state of [[Minnesota]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In October 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] to run for [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Senate]] after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], but was defeated by [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.\n\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"[[Church Committee]]\").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Up Close with Walter Mondale|url=https://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106134345/http://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2015|website=UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA FOUNDATION|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], to Claribel Hope (n\u00e9e Cowan), a part-time music teacher, and Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |title=American President: Walter Mondale |publisher=Millercenter.org |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704011945/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |archivedate=July 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389066/Walter-Mondale |title=Walter Mondale|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Walter_Mondale.htm |title=Walter F.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\n\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name=\"wamu\">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|accessdate=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcripturl=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session.

Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\".<ref name=\"as204_senate\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|authorlink=Clinton P.

Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President.\" He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents followed this model.<ref>Paul Kengor, ''Wreath Layer or Policy Player: The Vice President's Role in Foreign Policy'' (2000) p. 85</ref>\n\n===1980 election===\n{{Further|U.S. presidential election, 1976 |U.S. presidential election, 1980}}\n[[File:Mondale and Carter.JPG|thumb|Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter, in front of Presidential helicopter [[Marine One]] in January 1979]]\nCarter and Mondale were renominated at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]], but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. That year, Mondale opened the [[XIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]].\n\nCarter and Mondale are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed [[Herbert Hoover]] as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed [[Richard Nixon]] as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). With [[George H. W. Bush]]'s death on November 30, 2018, Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living U.S vice president]] and Carter the [[List of presidents of the United States by age#Oldest living U.S. presidents|oldest living U.S. president]].\n\n==Post-vice presidency (1981\u2013present)==\n\n===1984 presidential campaign===\n\n{{Main|1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1984 United States presidential election}}\nAfter losing the 1980 election, Mondale returned briefly to the practice of law at [[Winston and Strawn]], a large Chicago-based law firm, but he intended to return to politics before long.\n\nMondale ran for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1984|Democratic Party presidential nomination]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]], and was soon the front-runner. His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\"<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/famous.speeches/mondale.84.shtml Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984], AllPolitics</ref> While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.\n\n[[File:Mondale Ferraro.svg|thumb|left|One of the logos of the Mondale campaign]]\nMondale ran a [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\nMondale received 37,577,352 votes\u201440.6% of the popular vote. He won 40\u201349% in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n===Private citizen and ambassador===\nMondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate \"Leaders Lecture Series\" that ran from 1998 to 2002.<ref>\n[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Mondale.htm Address by Vice President Walter Mondale, September 4, 2002, in the United States Senate]<br>[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/f_two_sections_with_teasers/leader_lecture_series.htm Leader's Lecture Series Speakers]\n</ref>\n\n===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===\n{{Main|United States Senate elections, 2002|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}\n[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984).
