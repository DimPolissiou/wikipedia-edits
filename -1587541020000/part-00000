Significant [[Jewish people|Jewish population]] migrated from [[Spain and Portugal]] ([[Sephardic Jews]]), after the Spanish Inquisition, to this area and settled among the [[Arab-Berbers]]. They were later met by a second wave of migration from the [[Iberian peninsula]] in the period immediately preceding and following the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]], when the Jews were expelled from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], and soon afterwards, from [[Portugal]] as well. This second immigration wave deeply modified [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Moroccan Jewry]], who largely embraced the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Sephardic|Sephardic liturgy]], making the Moroccan Jews switch to a mostly Sephardic identity.\n\nAt its peak in the 1940s, Morocco's Jewish population exceeded 250,000, but due to the [[migration of Moroccan Jews to Israel]] and other nations, including [[Operation Yachin]] from 1961 to 1964, this number has been reduced to approximately 5,000. The vast majority of Moroccan Jews now [[Moroccan Jews in Israel|live in Israel]], where they constitute the second-largest Jewish community, approximately half a million.

In accordance with the norms of the Islamic legal system, Jewish Moroccans had separate legal courts pertaining to \"personal law\" under which communities (Muslim ''[[sharia]]'', Christian [[Canon law]] and Jewish ''[[halakha]]'' law abiding) were allowed to rule themselves under their own system. \n\nParticularly after the [[Alhambra Decree]], many [[Sephardi Jews]] migrated from [[al-Andalus]] to North Africa as refugees fleeing the inquisition in [[Spanish Inquisition|Spain]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition|Portugal]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taieb-Carlen|first=Sarah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9txi3xuuENcC&pg=PA56&dq=alhambra+decree+morocco#v=onepage|title=The Jews of North Africa: From Dido to De Gaulle|date=2010-02-23|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5044-1|language=en}}</ref> They are referred to as the ''[[Megorashim]]'',<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gerber|first=Jane S.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgS1qqkVL0kC&pg=PA46&dq=megorashim#v=onepage|title=Jewish Society in Fez 1450-1700: Studies in Communal and Economic Life|date=1980|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-05820-0|language=en}}</ref> while the Jews already in Morocco are referred to as the ''[[Toshavim]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gerber|first=Jane S.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgS1qqkVL0kC&pg=PA43&dq=toshavim#v=onepage|title=Jewish Society in Fez 1450-1700: Studies in Communal and Economic Life|date=1980|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-05820-0|language=en}}</ref> Many Iberian Jews settled in Fes and Marrakesh.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taieb-Carlen|first=Sarah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9txi3xuuENcC&pg=PA56&dq=alhambra+decree+morocco#v=onepage|title=The Jews of North Africa: From Dido to De Gaulle|date=2010-02-23|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5044-1|language=en}}</ref> In the following centuries, [[Converso|''Conversos'']] who had been banished to Iberian colonial possessions in the Americas and the Atlantic reclaimed their Judaism and also resettled in Morocco.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taieb-Carlen|first=Sarah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9txi3xuuENcC&pg=PA56&dq=alhambra+decree+morocco#v=onepage|title=The Jews of North Africa: From Dido to De Gaulle|date=2010-02-23|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5044-1|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid 19th century, Moroccan Jews started migrating from the interior of the country to coastal cities such as [[Essaouira]], [[Mazagan]], [[Asfi]], and later [[Casablanca]] for economic opportunity, participating in trade with Europeans and the development of those cities.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gottreich, Emily R.|title=Jewish space in the Morroccan city : a history of the mellah of Marrakech, 1550-1930|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=54|oclc=77066581}}</ref> The [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] opened its first school in [[T\u00e9touan|Tetuan]] in 1862.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rodrigue|first=Aron|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3NatkG7sGCkC&pg=PA125&dq=alliance+1862+morocco+school#v=onepage&q=1862&f=false|title=Jews and Muslims: Images of Sephardi and Eastern Jewries in Modern Times|date=2003|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-98314-1|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948, and due to domestic strife in the 1950s, the next several decades saw waves of Jewish emigration to Israel, France and Canada. Moroccan Jews emigrated for a variety of reasons. Some have emigrated to Israel for religious reasons, some faced persecution, and others left for better economic prospects than they faced in [[French protectorate in Morocco|post-colonial Morocco]]. With every Arab-Israeli war, tensions between Arabs and Jews would rise, sparking more Jewish emigration. By the time of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in 1973, the majority of Morocco's Jewish population had emigrated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4350488,00.html|title=Morocco film searches out Jews who left|author=|date=|website=YnetNews.com|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs a protectorate of France, parts of Morocco were heavily influenced by French culture, while the same is true of the portions of the country that belonged to Spain. Traditionally, the Jews were classified as being French-Moroccan or Spanish-Moroccan depending on where in Morocco they lived, and remnants of these classifications can be felt today. These differences are reflected in language, foods, last names and even liturgy.\n\nMost Jews in Morocco lived in desolate areas during the late 1930s. This was in part due to increased taxation by the French protectorate. In 1936, [[L\u00e9on Blum]], a Jewish man, was appointed as prime minister of France. This gave some Moroccan Jews hope that they may be able to become French citizens at some point, as [[Algerian Jews]] gained French citizenship with the [[Cr\u00e9mieux Decree]]. Algerian Jews were granted right of passage to France, and this only furthered the desire of Moroccan Jews to [[Assimilation (French colonialism)|embrace French culture]] to the extent of the Algerian Jews.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kenbib|first=Mohammed|date=2014-08-08|title=Moroccan Jews and the Vichy regime, 1940\u201342|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|language=en|volume=19|issue=4|pages=540\u2013553|doi=10.1080/13629387.2014.950523|issn=1362-9387}}</ref>\n\nEarly photographs of Moroccan Jewish families, taken in the early 20th century by German explorer and photographer [[Hermann Burchardt]], are now held at the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref>[http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625690&bt=europeanaapi Jewish couple in Morocco on the roof of their house]; [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625691&bt=europeanaapi Jewish family during the Feast of Tabernacles on the roof of their house]; [http://www.moroccan-judaism.org/fiche?id=22014&bt=europeanaapi Moroccan Jews in 1905], by Hermann Burchardt; [http://www.moroccan-judaism.org/fiche?id=28768&bt=europeanaapi Jewish family, 1905]; [http://www.moroccan-judaism.org/fiche?id=22012&bt=europeanaapi The Saba Synagogue, 1905]; [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625430&bt=europeanaapi Jewish family in their home]; [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625431&bt=europeanaapi The Ibn (Aben) Danan Synagogue], in the Mellah of F\u00e8s (click to enlarge); [http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&module=collection&objectId=625432&bt=europeanaapi Jewish family in Morocco], early 20th century (click on photo to enlarge); [http://www.moroccan-judaism.org/fiche?id=22187&bt=europeanaapi Family portrait], Morocco.</ref>\n\nA small community of around 2,000\u20132,500 Jews live in Morocco today.

In the recent past, however, an emergence of French-Moroccan musical liturgy and customs has been noticed even in this dominant Moroccan city. For example, the traditional Moroccan Bakashot, classical music sung by Sephardic Jews in the winter months across countries in the Middle East on Friday night, has come to life in recent productions by Magen David Congregation and Abir Ya'akob Congregation. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n* Venezuela: Concentrated mainly in [[Caracas]].\n* Gibraltar: The Jewish community in Gibraltar originates from Tangiers and Tetouan.\n* United States: In 1972 the Moroccan Jewish Organization (MJO)<ref>Moroccan Jewish Organization (MJO) {{cite web|url=http://mjony.org/id1.html|title=The History of the MJO|author=|date=|access-date=13 Sep 2017}}</ref> was founded.

Jews in Morocco were considered <nowiki>''</nowiki>''[[dhimmi]]s''<nowiki>'''</nowiki> under Muslim law, meaning that they were seen as an inferior religious group, that were distinguished from the Muslim majority, and were prevented from participating in certain activities.<ref name=\":0\">Deshen, Shlomo. \"Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco.\" Middle Eastern Studies 20, no. 4 (1984): 212-23. doi:10.1080/00263208408700607</ref> However, ''[[dhimmi]]s'' such as Jews were tolerated, following the [[Pact of Umar]] in the 7th century, unlike the policy of intolerance that the Christians practiced with the Jews at that time in Europe. Sultans put Jews in the ''mellahs,'' as what most see as an attempt to ostracize the Jews, and keep them from being exposed to insurgents.<ref>Deshen, Shlomo. \"Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies''20, no. 4 (1984): 214 . doi:10.1080/00263208408700607.</ref> The Jewish quarters in Moroccan cities were called ''Mellahs.'' The Sultans also wanted the Jews to be protected for political reasons. An attack on minorities was seen as an attack on the Sultan's power. The Sultan put the Jews in the ''Mellah'' for their safety, as well as to protect the Sultan rulings from being tested by insurgents.<ref name=\":0\" /> The word ''mellah'' is similar to the Hebrew word for salt, {{lang|he-Latn|melach}} (\u05de\u05dc\u05d7). The term ''mellah'' refers to the salty, marshy area where the Jews of Northern Morocco were originally transferred and gathered.<ref name=\"Lapidus, Ira M 2008\">Lapidus, Ira M. \"Emily Gottreich.The Mellah of Marrakesh: Jewish and Muslim Space in Moroccos Red City.:The Mellah of Marrakesh: Jewish and Muslim Space in Moroccos Red City.(Indiana Series in Middle East Studies.).\" ''The American Historical Review''113, no. 3 (2008): 946-47. doi:10.1086/ahr.113.3.946.</ref> The ''mellah'' was not a ghetto and was not structured in a way similar to Jewish quarters in Europe.<ref name=\"Lapidus, Ira M 2008\"/> By the 1900s, most Moroccan cities had a ''mellah''.<ref name=\"Lapidus, Ira M 2008\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nMoroccan Jewry has developed as a hybrid of the many cultures that have shaped Morocco itself, namely Jewish, Arab, Berber, French and Spanish.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:F\u00eate juive \u00e0 T\u00e9touan, Alfred Dehodencq, 1865.jpg|thumb|Jewish Festival in Tetuan, [[Alfred Dehodencq]], 1865, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Paris Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\nEven before the arrival of [[Sephardi Jews]] to Morocco, Moroccan Jews performed and developed the traditions of the [[Andalusian classical music]] and introduced it into their [[Liturgical music]]. In his book \"Jews of Andalusia and the Maghreb\" on the musical traditions in Jewish societies of North Africa, [[Haim Zafrani]] writes: \"''In Spain and Morocco, Jews were ardent maintainers of Andalusian music and the zealous guardians of its old traditions ....''\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Juifs d'Andalousie et du Maghreb|series=R\u00e9f\u00e9rences Maisonneuve et Larose|author=Ha\u00efm Zafrani |publisher=Maisonneuve & Larose|year=2002|page=228|isbn=978-2-7068-1629-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cdsEySgTqxAC&pg=PA228}}</ref>\n\n===Henna===\nTraditional Henna parties usually take place within the week before a special occasion, such as a wedding, [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], or baby showers. During pre-wedding Henna parties, the Matriarch of the family (often the grandmother) smudges [[henna]] in the palm of the bride and groom to symbolically bestow the new couple with good health, fertility, wisdom, and security. The henna is believed in Moroccan tradition to protect the couple from demons. The grandmother covers the henna, a dough-like paste produced by mixing crushed henna plant leaves with water, in order to lock in body heat and generate a richer color. Normally, the henna will dye skin orange for up to 2 weeks. In Moroccan folklore, the bride is exempt of her household duties until the henna completely fades. After the bride and groom are blessed with the henna, the guests also spread henna on their palms to bring good luck.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Clothing===\nAlthough most Moroccan Jews tend to dress in styles of their adopted countries, traditional Moroccan clothing is sometimes worn during celebrations ([[Mimouna]], weddings, Bar Mitzvas, etc.) or even during more intimate gatherings, such as Shabbat dinner. Men usually wear a white jellaba ([[jellabiya]]) cloak while women wear more ornate [[kaftans]].\n\n===Mimouna===\n[[Mimouna]] is celebrated by many Moroccan Jews on the night following the last day of Passover. It has spread to be an almost national holiday in Israel where it is particularly prevalent in cities where there is a large concentration of Moroccan Jews like Ashdod, Ashkelon and Natanya.\n\n==Religious observance==\n{{Main|Minhag Morocco}}\nMany Rabanim have passed through and sojourned in Morocco leaving behind great influence. In 2008, a project to preserve Moroccan Torah and the words of its \u1e24akhamim was initiated. DarkeAbotenou.com was created by a few members of the Toronto Sephardic Community; devoting their time and effort to increasing global awareness of the customs and laws that Jews of Morocco live with every day. Daily emails are sent in both English and French containing the customs, laws, and traditional liturgy of both the French and Spanish parts of Morocco. This daily publication is currently broadcast in both English and French.<ref>[http://www.darkeabotenou.com/blog/about/ Dark\u00e9 Abotenou \u00bb About]. Darkeabotenou.com (2008-11-21). Retrieved on 4 July 2011.</ref>\n\n===Liturgy===\nThe observer of a typical Moroccan Jewish prayer service will note the presence of Oriental motifs in the melodies. However, unlike the tunes of Eastern rites (Syrian, Iraqi, etc.),  which were influenced by Middle Eastern sounds, Moroccan Jewish religious tunes have a uniquely Andalusian feel. Furthermore, just as Eastern liturgical melodies are organized into Maqams, Moroccan liturgy can be classified by Noubas. The Moroccan prayer rite itself is also unique among Sephardic customs. The Moroccan [[nusach]] has many unique components but has also incorporated numerous Ashkenazic customs due to the country's proximity and exposure to Europe. Some customs of the Moroccan nusach include:\n* Two blessing for [[Hallel]]: One blessing (ligmor et ha'Hallel) is said when the full Hallel is recited, while the other blessing (likro et ha'Hallel) is said when the abridged Hallel is recited. Other Sephardim omit the latter.\n* Yiru Enenu: The blessing commencing with the words ''Yiru Enenu'' (translation: Our eyes shall see) is recited after Hashkivenu in the Arvit service after the Sabbath. Many Ashkenazim say this passage on every weekday night after Hashkivenu. This custom is discussed in [[Tosafot]] of Tractate Berakhot 4a.\n* Le'David: Before the Arvit service after the Sabbath, three psalms are recited in a unique tune said to be the same tune that King David's soldiers recited them in. The psalms are Chapters 144, 67 and 44 (in that order). Some congregations begin this service with Chapter 16 in a tune that leads up to the other three psalms.\n* [[Pesukei Dezimra]]: The opening verse of [[Psalm 30]] (\"Mizmor Shir \u1e24anukat Habayit LeDavid\") is added to the remainder of the Psalm during Sha\u1e25arit of Hanuka. Other Sepharadim begin with \"Aromimkha\" even on \u1e24anuka.\n* Shir HaShirim: This is usually read between [[Mincha]] and [[Kabbalat Shabbat]] on the Sabbath eve.

Traditionally, the Jews were classified as being French-Moroccan or Spanish-Moroccan depending on where in Morocco they lived, and remnants of these classifications can be felt today. These differences are reflected in language, foods, last names and even liturgy.\n\nMost Jews in Morocco lived in desolate areas during the late 1930s. This was in part due to increased taxation by the French protectorate. In 1936, [[L\u00e9on Blum]], a Jewish man, was appointed as prime minister of France. This gave some Moroccan Jews hope that they may be able to become French citizens at some point, as [[Algerian Jews]] gained French citizenship with the [[Cr\u00e9mieux Decree]].

Jews in Morocco were considered <nowiki>''</nowiki>''[[dhimmi]]s''<nowiki>'''</nowiki> under Muslim law, meaning that they were seen as an inferior religious group, that were distinguished from the Muslim majority, and were prevented from participating in certain activities.<ref name=\":0\">Deshen, Shlomo. \"Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco.\" Middle Eastern Studies 20, no. 4 (1984): 212-23. doi:10.1080/00263208408700607</ref> However, ''[[dhimmi]]s'' such as Jews were tolerated, following the [[Pact of Umar]] in the 7th century, unlike the policy of intolerance that the Christians practiced with the Jews at that time in Europe. Sultans put Jews in the ''mellahs,'' as what most see as an attempt to ostracize the Jews, and keep them from being exposed to insurgents.<ref>Deshen, Shlomo. \"Urban Jews in Sherifian Morocco.\" ''Middle Eastern Studies''20, no. 4 (1984): 214 . doi:10.1080/00263208408700607.</ref> The Jewish quarters in Moroccan cities were called ''Mellahs.'' The Sultans also wanted the Jews to be protected for political reasons. An attack on minorities was seen as an attack on the Sultan's power. The Sultan put the Jews in the ''Mellah'' for their safety, as well as to protect the Sultan rulings from being tested by insurgents.<ref name=\":0\" /> The word ''mellah'' is similar to the Hebrew word for salt, {{lang|he-Latn|melach}} (\u05de\u05dc\u05d7). The term ''mellah'' refers to the salty, marshy area where the Jews of Northern Morocco were originally transferred and gathered.<ref name=\"Lapidus, Ira M 2008\">Lapidus, Ira M. \"Emily Gottreich.The Mellah of Marrakesh: Jewish and Muslim Space in Moroccos Red City.:The Mellah of Marrakesh: Jewish and Muslim Space in Moroccos Red City.(Indiana Series in Middle East Studies.).\" ''The American Historical Review''113, no. 3 (2008): 946-47. doi:10.1086/ahr.113.3.946.</ref> The ''mellah'' was not a ghetto and was not structured in a way similar to Jewish quarters in Europe.<ref name=\"Lapidus, Ira M 2008\"/> By the 1900s, most Moroccan cities had a ''mellah''.<ref name=\"Lapidus, Ira M 2008\"/>\n\n==Culture==\nMoroccan Jewry has developed as a hybrid of the many cultures that have shaped Morocco itself, namely Jewish, Arab, Berber, French and Spanish.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:F\u00eate juive \u00e0 T\u00e9touan, Alfred Dehodencq, 1865.jpg|thumb|Jewish Festival in Tetuan, [[Alfred Dehodencq]], 1865, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art et d'Histoire du Juda\u00efsme|Paris Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]\nEven before the arrival of [[Sephardi Jews]] to Morocco, Moroccan Jews performed and developed the traditions of the [[Andalusian classical music]] and introduced it into their [[Liturgical music]]. In his book \"Jews of Andalusia and the Maghreb\" on the musical traditions in Jewish societies of North Africa, [[Haim Zafrani]] writes: \"''In Spain and Morocco, Jews were ardent maintainers of Andalusian music and the zealous guardians of its old traditions ....''\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Juifs d'Andalousie et du Maghreb|series=R\u00e9f\u00e9rences Maisonneuve et Larose|author=Ha\u00efm Zafrani |publisher=Maisonneuve & Larose|year=2002|page=228|isbn=978-2-7068-1629-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cdsEySgTqxAC&pg=PA228}}</ref>\n\n===Henna===\nTraditional Henna parties usually take place within the week before a special occasion, such as a wedding, [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah]], or baby showers. During pre-wedding Henna parties, the Matriarch of the family (often the grandmother) smudges [[henna]] in the palm of the bride and groom to symbolically bestow the new couple with good health, fertility, wisdom, and security. The henna is believed in Moroccan tradition to protect the couple from demons. The grandmother covers the henna, a dough-like paste produced by mixing crushed henna plant leaves with water, in order to lock in body heat and generate a richer color. Normally, the henna will dye skin orange for up to 2 weeks. In Moroccan folklore, the bride is exempt of her household duties until the henna completely fades. After the bride and groom are blessed with the henna, the guests also spread henna on their palms to bring good luck.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Clothing===\nAlthough most Moroccan Jews tend to dress in styles of their adopted countries, traditional Moroccan clothing is sometimes worn during celebrations ([[Mimouna]], weddings, Bar Mitzvas, etc.) or even during more intimate gatherings, such as Shabbat dinner. Men usually wear a white jellaba ([[jellabiya]]) cloak while women wear more ornate [[kaftans]].\n\n===Mimouna===\n[[Mimouna]] is celebrated by many Moroccan Jews on the night following the last day of Passover. It has spread to be an almost national holiday in Israel where it is particularly prevalent in cities where there is a large concentration of Moroccan Jews like Ashdod, Ashkelon and Natanya.\n\n==Religious observance==\n{{Main|Minhag Morocco}}\nMany Rabanim have passed through and sojourned in Morocco leaving behind great influence. In 2008, a project to preserve Moroccan Torah and the words of its \u1e24akhamim was initiated. DarkeAbotenou.com was created by a few members of the Toronto Sephardic Community; devoting their time and effort to increasing global awareness of the customs and laws that Jews of Morocco live with every day. Daily emails are sent in both English and French containing the customs, laws, and traditional liturgy of both the French and Spanish parts of Morocco. This daily publication is currently broadcast in both English and French.<ref>[http://www.darkeabotenou.com/blog/about/ Dark\u00e9 Abotenou \u00bb About]. Darkeabotenou.com (2008-11-21). Retrieved on 4 July 2011.</ref>\n\n===Liturgy===\nThe observer of a typical Moroccan Jewish prayer service will note the presence of Oriental motifs in the melodies. However, unlike the tunes of Eastern rites (Syrian, Iraqi, etc.),  which were influenced by Middle Eastern sounds, Moroccan Jewish religious tunes have a uniquely Andalusian feel. Furthermore, just as Eastern liturgical melodies are organized into Maqams, Moroccan liturgy can be classified by Noubas. The Moroccan prayer rite itself is also unique among Sephardic customs. The Moroccan [[nusach]] has many unique components but has also incorporated numerous Ashkenazic customs due to the country's proximity and exposure to Europe. Some customs of the Moroccan nusach include:\n* Two blessing for [[Hallel]]: One blessing (ligmor et ha'Hallel) is said when the full Hallel is recited, while the other blessing (likro et ha'Hallel) is said when the abridged Hallel is recited. Other Sephardim omit the latter.\n* Yiru Enenu: The blessing commencing with the words ''Yiru Enenu'' (translation: Our eyes shall see) is recited after Hashkivenu in the Arvit service after the Sabbath. Many Ashkenazim say this passage on every weekday night after Hashkivenu. This custom is discussed in [[Tosafot]] of Tractate Berakhot 4a.\n* Le'David: Before the Arvit service after the Sabbath, three psalms are recited in a unique tune said to be the same tune that King David's soldiers recited them in. The psalms are Chapters 144, 67 and 44 (in that order). Some congregations begin this service with Chapter 16 in a tune that leads up to the other three psalms.\n* [[Pesukei Dezimra]]: The opening verse of [[Psalm 30]] (\"Mizmor Shir \u1e24anukat Habayit LeDavid\") is added to the remainder of the Psalm during Sha\u1e25arit of Hanuka. Other Sepharadim begin with \"Aromimkha\" even on \u1e24anuka.\n* Shir HaShirim: This is usually read between [[Mincha]] and [[Kabbalat Shabbat]] on the Sabbath eve. Other Sephardic groups tend to read it before Min\u1e25a. Moroccan Jews chant Shir HaShirim with a unique [[cantillation]]. A common practice is for a different congregant to sing each chapter.\n* Before the repetition of the [[Amidah]] in Sha\u1e25arit and Musaf of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, the hymn \"Hashem sham'ati shim'akha yareti\" (Translation:  Hashem, I have heard your speech and was awed) is sung. The origin of this verse is [[Habakkuk]] 3:2.\n* The Moroccan tune for [[Torah reading|Torah Reading]] is unique to the Moroccan tradition, unlike all other [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] who merely utilize different variations of the Yerushalmi tune.\n* Some of the Moroccan Piyutim / Jewish Prayer Melodies and Songs - are said to come from the songs of the Leviim / Levites - that were sung on the steps leading to the Beit HaMikdash / Holy Temple in Jerusalem.\n\n===Religious customs===\n* [[Psalm 29]] and [[Lekha Dodi]] are recited sitting down in the Kabbalat Shabbat service.\n* Packets of salt are distributed to congregants on the second night of Passover, marking the first counting of the 'Omer. The significance of salt includes the commemoration of the sacrifices in the Temple and other Kabbalistic reasons.<ref>[http://www.kehilacentre.com/uploads/store/salt_article.pdf \"Salt of Omer\" in the Kehila Centre Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704131203/http://www.kehilacentre.com/uploads/store/salt_article.pdf |date=2008-07-04 }}. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-07-04.</ref>\n* [[Pirke Avot]] is read during the [[Musaf]] service of Shabbat between Passover and [[Shavuot]]. As well, the custom is for pre-Bar Mi\u1e63va boys to read each chapter, and this is usually performed with a special tune.\n* After reciting the hamotzie blessing over bread, there is a custom to dip the bread into salt while reciting \"{{lang|he-Latn|Adonai melekh, Adonai malakh, Adonai yimlokh le'olam va'ed}}\" (Translation: God reigns; God has reigned; God will reign for ever and ever). This \"verse\" is actually a compilation of three verses taken from Psalms and Exodus. The validity of this custom has been disputed among Moroccan [[Poskim]] since it may constitute an interruption of a blessing.\n* Before the Magid section of the [[Passover Seder]], the [[Seder plate]] is raised and passed over the heads of those present while reciting \"{{lang|he-Latn|Bibhilu ya\u1e63anu mi\u2013mi\u1e63rayim, hala\u1e25ma 'anya ben\u00e9 \u1e25orin}}\" (Translation: In haste we went out of Egypt [with our] bread of affliction, [now we are] free people). It can be heard here.<ref>{{YouTube|DwjIcjE93ds|Pesah \u05e4\u05e1\u05d7 \u2013 Bibhilou \u05d1\u05d1\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u2013 Jo 'Amar \u05d2'\u05d5 \u05e2\u05de\u05e8 z\"l}}.
