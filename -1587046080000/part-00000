The prominent event in his life was [[Austria-Hungary]]'s entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its [[Austria-Hungary|real union]] with Austria. Tisza supported the [[dual monarchy]] of [[Austria-Hungary]] and was representative of the then ''liberal-conservative consent''.\n[[File:Istvan Tisza. Oxford, United Kingdom.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in Oxford, England]]\n[[File:Tisza Istv\u00e1n 1904.jpg|thumb|right|The 33-year-old Tisza as a member of the parliament in 1894]]\n[[File:Tisza with his family.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza and his family.

He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nIn the diplomacy, Tisza's role model was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. On April 19, 1904, nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically:  the organizers of the strike were arrested, and participant railway workers were recruited into the Hungarian Honv\u00e9d army. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai. (Magyar Statisztikai K\u00f6zlem\u00e9nyek, Budapest, 1912. pp 30\u201333)</ref>) of the population of kingdom of Hungary considered themselves as Hungarians. Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the House of Parliament, staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and organised a rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage.\n\nTisza nd his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. The answer was a demonstration organized by socialists on Thursday, May 23, 1912. Workers marched toward the Parliament, who were arrested by the police, against the appointment of Tisza and demanding universal suffrage. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

The prominent event in his life was [[Austria-Hungary]]'s entry into the First World War when he was prime minister for the second time. He was later assassinated during the [[Aster Revolution]] on 31 October 1918 - the same day that Hungary terminated its [[Austria-Hungary|real union]] with Austria.

He himself supported the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]]. A social reactionary to the end, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle the break-up of the large landed estates as well as even the most modest reform proposals that would have granted the [[universal suffrage|suffrage]] to soldiers fighting at the front<ref>Robert A. Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire, 1526\u20131918'', University of California Press, 1974, p. 494-495.</ref> (before 1918 only 10% of the Hungarian population could vote and hold office). However, in economic affairs, he tended to be a modernizer who encouraged and supported industrialization and, in that respect, he was an opponent of [[anti-Semitism]], which he feared could jeopardize Hungary's economic development.  Among the Hungarian political leaders, Tisza was the most zealous adherent of Dualism and the partnership with Austria.<ref>Stephen Tisza article of the 1922 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nIn the diplomacy, Tisza's role model was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. As an economist, he followed the concepts of the [[English historical school of economics]], as a lawyer and political scientist, Tisza favored the societal and political development of England,  which he considered as the \"ideal way of development\".<ref>Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa, Political scientist, [[ELTE]] University:{{cite web |url= http://tiszaistvan.hu/index.php/english |title= The standpoint of the Tisza Istv\u00e1n Friends Society concerning the historical figure of Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza |publisher= tiszaistvan.hu |date=March 2016 |accessdate= 2018-08-29 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and education==\nIstv\u00e1n Tisza was the son of [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Tisza]] de Borosjen\u0151, prime minister of Hungary between 1875\u20131890 from the [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party]]. The Tiszas were originally a [[Calvinist]] untitled lower nobility (regarded as equivalent to the British [[gentry]]). His mother, Ilona Degenfeld-Schomburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gr\u00e4fin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).<ref>[http://www.degenfeldkastely.com/degenfeld-ilona Degenfeld Kastely biographical data]</ref>\n\nThe young Stephen raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. Stephen has studied at home until the age of twelve, then he entered the Calvinist Gymnasium (a college-preparatory school) of [[Debrecen]]. Tisza took legal studies in Budapest, international law in [[Heidelberg University Faculty of Law|Heidelberg University]], economics in [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], where he received PHD, and political science in [[Oxford University]], where he received a doctorate in [[political science]].\n\n==Political career==\n\n===Tisza as member of the parliament===\nHe then took care of the family land at [[Bihar County]] and [[Geszt]] for five years.  He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in [[V\u00edzakna]] (Now: [[Ocna Sibiului]], Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district, and he represented the district until 1892. He won his second seat in 1892 as representative of [[\u00dajb\u00e1nya]] district (Now: [[Nov\u00e1 Ba\u0148a]], Slovakia). In 1896 he won the seat of [[Ungra|Ugra]] district (Now: [[Ungra]], Romania) and he became also a member of the economic committee of Hungarian parliament, where he plunged himself into the macroeconomic discussions.\n\nIn the 1890s he served a number of [[sinecure]]s which provided extraordinary income, a common situation among prestigious European politicians of the time. He was the president of the [[Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank]] (Magyar Ipar- \u00e9s Kereskedelmi Bank) and was a member of the boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. Despite the financial crisis of the 1890s, under his control many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the realm, some of them became unavoidable enterprises in their own sectors. His instructions and rule transformed the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank into the largest Bank of Hungary within a decade.\n\nHis uncle, the childless [[Lajos Tisza]] received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title on his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch on 16 February 1897.<ref name=\"kir\u00e1lyik\u00f6nyvekgr\u00f3fi\">{{Cite web|url=https://archives.hungaricana.hu/en/libriregii/hu_mnl_ol_a057_70_0020/?list=eyJxdWVyeSI6ICJ0aXN6YSJ9|title=Ferenc J\u00f3zsef; B\u00e9cs; 1897.02.16; gr\u00f3fi c\u00edm \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa; el\u0151n\u00e9v \u00e1truh\u00e1z\u00e1sa}}</ref>\n\n===Prime minister for first time, 1903\u20131905===\n\n====Target of Leftist and socialist circles====\nIn this period he managed to get the remains of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] repatriated from Turkey and interred in the cathedral of Kassa, today [[Ko\u0161ice]]. The Parliament approved the increase of conscriptees. As the minister of Internal Affairs he aggressively silenced the railway workers strike in 1904. The organisers were arrested and the strikers were recruited into the army. The police crushed a Socialist gathering for peasants in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.\n\n====Target of anti-Semite circles====\nTisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families, especially successful industrialists and bankers, and set them and their success as an example for the people. Many families of young middle class were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction to advise him. He even offered many positions in his cabinet to Jews. His first appointment was [[Samu Hazai]] as Minister of War. Two years later he picked [[J\u00e1nos Teleszky]] as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza's seven years in office.  The Liberal Party passed legislation for [[Jewish emancipation]] in 1867, and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to the  parliament (both the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidate.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lorman |first1=Thomas |title=The Making of the Slovak People\u2019s Party: Religion, Nationalism and the Culture War in Early 20th-Century Europe |date=2019 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-350-10938-4 |language=en|p=48}}</ref> Similarly to the policy of his father, Istv\u00e1n Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms.  His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.\n\n====Target of radical nationalists====\nDuring the era, only 54.5% (1910 census<ref>1910. \u00e9vi n\u00e9psz\u00e1ml\u00e1l\u00e1s adatai.

Tisza's party (The [[Liberal Party (Hungary)|Liberal Party of Hungary]]) urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However his main political opponents (The nationalist [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Party of Independence and '48]] and Catholic People's Party) could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.<ref>See: Zolt\u00e1n Maruzsa</ref>\n\n===\"Election by handkerchief\" and the victory of nationalist opposition===\nHe passed a modification to the rules of the House of Parliament on 18 November 1904 to crush the [[obstructing government administration|obstruction]] of the opposition. In earlier era, the members of the parliament had unrestricted time to give speech or talk in the parliament.\n\nFrom the first his ministry was exposed to the most unscrupulous opposition, exacerbated by the new and stringent rules of procedure which Tisza felt it his duty to introduce if any business were to be done. The motion for their introduction was made by the deputy G\u00e1bor Daniel, supported by the premier, and after scenes of unheard-of obstruction and violence (16\u201318 November) the speaker, in the midst of an ear-splitting tumult, declared that the new regulations had been adopted by the house, and produced a royal message suspending the session. But the Andr\u00e1ssy group, immediately afterwards, separated from the Liberal Party, and the rest of the year the Opposition made the legislation impossible. By January 1905 the situation had become ex lex or anarchical. Tisza stoutly stood by his rules, on the ground that this was a case in which the form must be sacrificed to the substance of parliamentary government.<ref>\"Stephen Tisza\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 11th ed. 1911., VOLUME: XXVI, page:1017</ref>\n\n[[Dezs\u0151 Perczel]], the President of the House, called for immediate voting on the modification. It is not clear what exactly happened, but some sources say that the Speaker of the House of Parliament waved a handkerchief, signalling for the governing party to vote \"yes\"; this act later became known as the \"election by handkerchief\", which became a large scandal and, as a consequence, [[K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Sz\u00e9ll]] and [[Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy]] left the Liberal Party and the opposition unified into the \"Federal Opposition\".\nThe political powers polarised and in new elections the 30 years of governing by the Liberal Party was ended, with the side effect that the party was dissolved.\n\nAfter the defeat of his Liberal Party by the nationalist coalition in the 1905 elections, Tisza only took part in the operations of the House of Parliament, staying away from political struggles. However, his political opponent the governing [[National Independence Kossuth Party|Independence and '48 Party]] was unable to withhold positions to protect the interests of Hungary so it resigned on 25 April 1909.\n\n===National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910===\n[[File:Tisza Istvan and his wife.jpg|thumb|Tisza and his wife in 1904.]]\n\nOn 19 February 1910, Tisza established the [[National Party of Work]] (Nemzeti Munkap\u00e1rt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. He did not desire to form a government, primarily due to his conflict with [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] who sought to centralise the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] with [[universal suffrage]]. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this would lead to the weakening of the Magyar supremacy over ethnic minorities in Hungary.  In addition, he claimed \"[[demagogue]]s (i.e. Communists and agrarian socialist movements) would manipulate peasants with the majority of the votes to put in power such groups whose aims are against democracy, supported by the urban intellectuals\".<ref>A magyar jobboldali hagyom\u00e1ny (Hungarian Right-Wing Heritage), 1900\u20131948. Edited by Ign\u00e1c Romcsics, Osiris, 2009. pp. 65.</ref> Tisza was supported by [[Franz Josef]], but he feared a repeat of the faults of his first prime ministry and thus called for [[K\u00e1roly Khuen-H\u00e9derv\u00e1ry]] to form the new government.\n[[File:Ferenc Jozsef es Tisza Istvan.jpg|thumb|right|Istv\u00e1n Tisza (right) with Emperor-King Francis Joseph]]\n[[File:Tisza I. electoral speech 1910.jpg|thumb|Tisza gives an electoral speech in [[Sopron]] in April 1910]]\n\n====Act of Protection====\n[[File:Tisza1914.PNG|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza in 1914]]\n\nAs Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. The Hungarian side was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e. use of the Magyar language in the army). The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and organised a rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage.\n\nTisza nd his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. The answer was a demonstration organized by socialists on Thursday, May 23, 1912. Workers marched toward the Parliament, who were arrested by the police, against the appointment of Tisza and demanding universal suffrage. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested.\n\nTisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a [[cleric]]al approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).\n\nHe was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the [[police force]] to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal  of some members of the opposition party.\n\nAs a result, [[Gyula Kov\u00e1cs]], an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kov\u00e1cs shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.\n\n===Prime minister for second time, 1913\u20131917 ===\n\nTisza became prime minister again on 7 June 1913.\n\n====Freedom of the press====\nInspired by the Western European model, Tisza's cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of [[defamation]], libel and \"scare-mongering\", thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.\n\n====Croatia====\nCount Istv\u00e1n Tisza tried to solve the Hungarian-Croatian issue, which had long lasted at that time, to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pej\u00e1csevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Iv\u00e1n Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.\n\n==Foreign policy and the Great War==\n\n[[File:Istv\u00e1n Tisza and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf.jpg|thumb|Tisza and H\u00f6tzendorf left Vienna after 3 days long fierce debate.]]\n\nA few days before the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]], which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]]. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army's strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] would attack [[Transylvania]].<ref>K\u00f6peczy-Makkai-M\u00f3csy-Sz\u00e1sz: History of Transylvania</ref> The loss of the alliance with the [[German Empire]] would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a [[Great Power]], so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.\n\nTisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.\n\nDuring the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]], and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.<ref>https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/crisis-in-austria-hungary</ref><ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=0RuDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA75&dq=istvan+tisza+austria+forced+to+resign#v=onepage&q=istvan%20tisza%20austria%20forced%20to%20resign&f=false | title=The Age of Catastrophe: A History of the West 1914\u20131945| isbn=9780300213096| last1=Winkler| first1=Heinrich August| date=28 September 2015}}</ref> However, he retained great political influence, and was able to delay the enactment of universal [[suffrage]].\n\nDuring this period of international insecurity, he wanted to solidify the government.

As a ''homo regius'' (\"king's man\"), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but without success.\n\n===His judgement from abroad during and after the war===\nIt is clear that after the outbreak of World War I, all opposing sides pointed to the other side as the party guilty of initiating the greater war.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The British newspaper \"New Europe\" printed a comment that Hungary was the only responsible party for the war, ''\"where Hungary\u2032s responsibility is greater than Austria\u2032s\"'' and that Tisza was the militaristic politician who dragged all sides into war. As a consequence the \"[[Little Entente]]\" took this view and pushed to punish Hungary at the end of the war. Later, the propaganda of these nations augmented and even invented Tisza's guilt, claiming that he took pains to point out in a report of 8 July that \"there should at any rate be no question of the annihilation or annexation of Serbia, and that if Serbia gave way, Austria-Hungary must be content.\" According to recent findings these accusations are without merit.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe accusations are rooted in the common belief that Tisza carried out a policy of forced [[Magyarization]] towards the ethnic minorities in Hungary. His minority policy was (directly or indirectly) often confused with the policy of his radical nationalist political opponents in the 1906 -1910 period (like the [[Party of Independence and '48]]).\n\n===His view on the war===\n[[File:Graf Stefan Tisza (BildID 15720072).jpg|thumb|Istv\u00e1n Tisza served on the Italian front between 1917-1918, where he had opportunity to experience the circumstances and dangers of trench warfare on a daily basis]]\n\nTisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.<ref>William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456</ref>\n\nIn March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown \"Weltkrieg\" (means World War) phrase in his letter.\n\"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"<ref>David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211, Princeton University Press, (1997) {{ISBN|9780691015958}}</ref>\n\nOn the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.<ref>Fischer, Fritz: Germany\u2019s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, {{ISBN|978-0-393-09798-6}}  (PAGE: 52)</ref> He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm |first=Michael |last=Duffy |title=Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno |publisher=firstworldwar.com}}</ref> He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He felt the threat of [[Romania]] and [[Bulgaria]] after the [[Balkan wars]] and was afraid of [[Romania]]n attack from the east. He was also not sure about the stand of the [[Germans]]. Germany's stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. \n \nDuring a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, Conrad asked, \"If Germany's reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?\" The emperor replied, \"Then yes\", \"But what if they reply differently?\", \"Then the Monarchy will be alone\".\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on [[Sofia]]. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official examination into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an [[ultimatum]] to the Serbian government and immediately started the [[mobilisation]] of troops.\n\nAfter sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum was obsolete within 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: \"it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity\"<ref>Tschirschky's report to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 14 July 1914</ref> He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.\n\nTisza did not resign from the Prime Ministry, as he thought remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary, as he had connections in Vienna. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] at the outbreak of war.\n\nHis initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, \"the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia&nbsp;... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.\"\n\n=== The struggle of a WW1 political leader in the trenches ===\n\nThe 57 years old Tisza joined to the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.\n\nTisza at the front: \"Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He has made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and -of course within the limits of the service regulations- with the rank and file. To better get to know each other with his fellow officers, every day he invited some young officers to his table, this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as \"tough to the upwards and humane to the downwards\" kind of a commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.\nTisza's paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alisp\u00e1ns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: \"I\u2019ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn\u2019t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.\" <ref>Peter Strausz: (Hungarian) \"Istv\u00e1n Tisza and the Second Hussar Regiment\" [http://mek.oszk.hu/03200/03296/03296.doc]</ref>\n\n==Assassination attempts==\n[[File:Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building.jpg|thumb|Monument to Tisza Istvan outside the Budapest Parliament building]]\n\nFor many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.\n\nThe first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kov\u00e1cs, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kov\u00e1cs was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was \"temporary insanity\".\n\nThe second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.\n\nThe third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when [[J\u00e1nos L\u00e9kai]], a member of the society [[Galilei-circle]] and an anti-military group led by [[Ott\u00f3 Korvin]], tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the [[Hungarian Parliament]], but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Sikl\u00f3s.

In 1893, UTS rescinded the right of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to veto faculty appointments, thus becoming fully independent.

During the late 19th century it became one of the leading centers of [[liberal Christianity]] in the United States. In 1891, [[Charles Augustus Briggs|Charles A. Briggs]], who was being installed as the chair of biblical studies, delivered an inaugural address in which he questioned the verbal inspiration of Scripture.<ref name=\"hart\">{{Cite book |title=Seeking a Better Country: 300 Years of American Presbyterianism |last=Hart |first=D.

After visiting [[Toynbee Hall]] in London and inspired by the example of Hull House in Chicago, the alumni decided to create a settlement house in the area of Manhattan enclosed on the north and south by East 96th and 110th Streets and on the east and west by the [[East River]] and [[Central Park]].\n\nThe neighborhood, known as [[East Harlem]], was filled with new tenements but devoid of any civic services. The ethos of the settlement house movement called for its workers to \"settle\" in such neighborhoods in order to learn first-hand the problems of the residents. \u201cIt seemed to us that, as early settlers, we had a chance to grow up with the community and affect its development,\u201d wrote William Adams Brown, Theology Professor, Union Theological Society (1892\u20131930) and President, Union Settlement Association (1915\u20131919).<ref>A Teacher and His Times, William Adams Brown, Scribner, 1940.</ref>\n\nUnion Settlement still exists, providing community-based services and programs to support the immigrant and low-income residents of East Harlem. One of East Harlem's largest social service agencies, Union Settlement reaches more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations throughout East Harlem through a range of programs, including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers' market, community development, and neighborhood cultural events.\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[Paul Tillich]] made UTS the center of both liberal and [[neo-orthodox]] Protestantism in the post-War period. Prominent public intellectual [[Cornel West]] commenced a promising academic career at UTS in 1977. As liberalism lost ground to conservatism after the 1960s (while neo-orthodoxy dissipated) and thus declined in prestige, UTS ran into financial difficulties and shrank significantly because of a reduced student base.\n\nEventually, the school agreed to lease some of its buildings to Columbia University and to transfer ownership of and responsibility for the Burke Library to Columbia. These agreements helped stabilize the school's finances, which had been hobbled by increasing library costs and the need for substantial campus repairs.\n\nOn July 1, 2008, feminist theologian [[Serene Jones]] became Union's first female president in its 172-year history, succeeding [[Joseph C. Hough, Jr.]]<ref>[https://archive.is/20120805182824/http://www.utsnyc.edu/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=1081&srcid=332 Union Theological Seminary \u2013 Serene Jones, President of the Faculty<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 2014, Jones announced that the Seminary would be joining the movement to divest from the fossil fuels industry in protest at the damage the industry is causing to the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weareclimatechange.com/pages/news_articles/union_ny_seminary/union_ny_seminary.html|title=WeAreClimateChange|accessdate=December 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233458/http://www.weareclimatechange.com/pages/news_articles/union_ny_seminary/union_ny_seminary.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Seminary's $108 million endowment will no longer include any fossil fuel investments.\n\nAlthough administratively independent from Columbia, Union is represented by one voting faculty member, and one non-voting student observer member, of the Columbia University [[University senate|Senate]].<ref>[http://senate.columbia.edu/orientation_materials/senate_guide_2018-2019_20190206.pdf A Guide to the University Senate],  University Senate Office, Columbia University (February 2019).</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Union Theological Seminary NYC 001 002 combined.jpg|thumb|Brown Memorial Tower]]\n[[File:UnionTheological.jpg|thumb|Union Theological Seminary entrance on Broadway]]\n\nUnion's campus is located in the [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], bordered by [[Claremont Avenue]], [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], and West 120th and 122nd Streets. The brick and limestone [[Gothic Revival|English Gothic revival architecture]], by architects [[Allen & Collens]], completed in 1910, includes the tower, which adapts features of the crossing tower of [[Durham Cathedral]]. Adjacent to [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], [[Barnard College]], the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], and the [[Manhattan School of Music]], Union has cross-registration and library access agreements with all of these schools.\n\nThe building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 23, 1980, and parts were made a [[New York City designated landmark]] in 1965.<ref name=\"NYCL-0595\"/> Some sections of the campus are now on long-term lease to Columbia University.\n\n===Library===\nThe Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary, one of the largest theological libraries in North America, contains holdings of over 700,000 items. The Burke's holdings include extensive special collections, including Greek census records from 20 CE, a rare 12th Century manuscript of the Life of St. Boniface, and one of the first African-American hymnals, published in Philadelphia in 1818.\n\nThe Burke Library also maintains a number of world-renowned archival collections, including the Archives of Women in Theological Scholarship and the Missionary Research Library Archives.\n\nIn 2004 Union's Burke Library became fully integrated into the [[Columbia University Libraries]] system, which holds over 10 million volumes. The library is named in honor of Walter Burke, a generous benefactor to the library who served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Seminary from 1976 to 1982.\n\n==Faculty==\nIn 1930, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] was a Postgraduate Teaching Fellow at the seminary. He later returned in 1939 to be a member of the faculty and to escape Nazi harassment in Germany. Writing of his experience there in his book ''Barcelona, Berlin, New York'', Bonhoeffer was dismayed by the liberalism of the seminary and its students, [http://www.faith-theology.com/2009/10/dietrich-bonhoeffer-in-new-york.html noting that], \"The students are completely clueless with respect to what dogmatics is really about. They are not familiar with even the most basic questions. They become intoxicated with liberal and humanistic phrases, are amused at the fundamentalists, and yet basically are not even up to their level....\" Referring to Union Seminary, Bonhoeffer noted: \"A seminary in which numerous students openly laugh during a public lecture because they find it amusing when a passage on sin and forgiveness ...is cited has obviously, despite its many advantages, forgotten what Christian theology in its very essence stands for\" (pp.&nbsp;309\u201310). He soon regretted his decision and decided that he had to return to Germany to resist the Nazis. He took the last ship from New York to Germany in late August 1939. Due to his secret involvement with the [[20 July plot]] on Hitler's life, he was executed at the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] on April 8, 1945, only 15 days before the United States Army liberated the camp.\n\nBoth [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[Paul Tillich]] taught at the seminary during the post-[[World War II]] period.\n\nDr. [[Serene Jones]], the seminary's first female president, was inaugurated in November 2008. Dr. [[Joseph Hough]], UTS' immediate past president, is a Christian Democratic Socialist. [[Henry Sloane Coffin]] was a past president. Civil Rights Activist [[Cornel West]] joined the faculty in July 2012. Dr. [[James Hal Cone]] is one of the founders of [[liberation theology]] and is active in the development of [[African-American theology]].\n\nUnion has also been home to [[Womanist theologian]]s such as [[Delores S. Williams]]. Dr. [[Gary Dorrien]] is a social ethicist. Dr. [[James A. Forbes]], the former senior pastor of the adjacent [[Riverside Church]], is an adjunct professor at the seminary and had been a full-time, chaired professor before accepting the Riverside post.\n\n===Notable current faculty===\n* [[Mary C.

In 1893, UTS rescinded the right of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church to veto faculty appointments, thus becoming fully independent.

During the late 19th century it became one of the leading centers of [[liberal Christianity]] in the United States. In 1891, [[Charles Augustus Briggs|Charles A. Briggs]], who was being installed as the chair of biblical studies, delivered an inaugural address in which he questioned the verbal inspiration of Scripture.<ref name=\"hart\">{{Cite book |title=Seeking a Better Country: 300 Years of American Presbyterianism |last=Hart |first=D.

After visiting [[Toynbee Hall]] in London and inspired by the example of Hull House in Chicago, the alumni decided to create a settlement house in the area of Manhattan enclosed on the north and south by East 96th and 110th Streets and on the east and west by the [[East River]] and [[Central Park]].\n\nThe neighborhood, known as [[East Harlem]], was filled with new tenements but devoid of any civic services. The ethos of the settlement house movement called for its workers to \"settle\" in such neighborhoods in order to learn first-hand the problems of the residents. \u201cIt seemed to us that, as early settlers, we had a chance to grow up with the community and affect its development,\u201d wrote William Adams Brown, Theology Professor, Union Theological Society (1892\u20131930) and President, Union Settlement Association (1915\u20131919).<ref>A Teacher and His Times, William Adams Brown, Scribner, 1940.</ref>\n\nUnion Settlement still exists, providing community-based services and programs to support the immigrant and low-income residents of East Harlem. One of East Harlem's largest social service agencies, Union Settlement reaches more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations throughout East Harlem through a range of programs, including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers' market, community development, and neighborhood cultural events.\n\n===20th century to present===\n[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[Paul Tillich]] made UTS the center of both liberal and [[neo-orthodox]] Protestantism in the post-War period. Prominent public intellectual [[Cornel West]] commenced a promising academic career at UTS in 1977. As liberalism lost ground to conservatism after the 1960s (while neo-orthodoxy dissipated) and thus declined in prestige, UTS ran into financial difficulties and shrank significantly because of a reduced student base.\n\nEventually, the school agreed to lease some of its buildings to Columbia University and to transfer ownership of and responsibility for the Burke Library to Columbia. These agreements helped stabilize the school's finances, which had been hobbled by increasing library costs and the need for substantial campus repairs.\n\nOn July 1, 2008, feminist theologian [[Serene Jones]] became Union's first female president in its 172-year history, succeeding [[Joseph C. Hough, Jr.]]<ref>[https://archive.is/20120805182824/http://www.utsnyc.edu/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=1081&srcid=332 Union Theological Seminary \u2013 Serene Jones, President of the Faculty<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 2014, Jones announced that the Seminary would be joining the movement to divest from the fossil fuels industry in protest at the damage the industry is causing to the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weareclimatechange.com/pages/news_articles/union_ny_seminary/union_ny_seminary.html|title=WeAreClimateChange|accessdate=December 18, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233458/http://www.weareclimatechange.com/pages/news_articles/union_ny_seminary/union_ny_seminary.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Seminary's $108 million endowment will no longer include any fossil fuel investments.\n\nAlthough administratively independent from Columbia, Union is represented by one voting faculty member, and one non-voting student observer member, of the Columbia University [[University senate|Senate]].<ref>[http://senate.columbia.edu/orientation_materials/senate_guide_2018-2019_20190206.pdf A Guide to the University Senate],  University Senate Office, Columbia University (February 2019).</ref>\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:Union Theological Seminary NYC 001 002 combined.jpg|thumb|Brown Memorial Tower]]\n[[File:UnionTheological.jpg|thumb|Union Theological Seminary entrance on Broadway]]\n\nUnion's campus is located in the [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], bordered by [[Claremont Avenue]], [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], and West 120th and 122nd Streets. The brick and limestone [[Gothic Revival|English Gothic revival architecture]], by architects [[Allen & Collens]], completed in 1910, includes the tower, which adapts features of the crossing tower of [[Durham Cathedral]]. Adjacent to [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teachers College]], [[Barnard College]], the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], and the [[Manhattan School of Music]], Union has cross-registration and library access agreements with all of these schools.\n\nThe building was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on April 23, 1980, and parts were made a [[New York City designated landmark]] in 1965.<ref name=\"NYCL-0595\"/> Some sections of the campus are now on long-term lease to Columbia University.\n\n===Library===\nThe Burke Library at Union Theological Seminary, one of the largest theological libraries in North America, contains holdings of over 700,000 items. The Burke's holdings include extensive special collections, including Greek census records from 20 CE, a rare 12th Century manuscript of the Life of St. Boniface, and one of the first African-American hymnals, published in Philadelphia in 1818.\n\nThe Burke Library also maintains a number of world-renowned archival collections, including the Archives of Women in Theological Scholarship and the Missionary Research Library Archives.\n\nIn 2004 Union's Burke Library became fully integrated into the [[Columbia University Libraries]] system, which holds over 10 million volumes. The library is named in honor of Walter Burke, a generous benefactor to the library who served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Seminary from 1976 to 1982.\n\n==Faculty==\nIn 1930, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] was a Postgraduate Teaching Fellow at the seminary. He later returned in 1939 to be a member of the faculty and to escape Nazi harassment in Germany. Writing of his experience there in his book ''Barcelona, Berlin, New York'', Bonhoeffer was dismayed by the liberalism of the seminary and its students, [http://www.faith-theology.com/2009/10/dietrich-bonhoeffer-in-new-york.html noting that], \"The students are completely clueless with respect to what dogmatics is really about. They are not familiar with even the most basic questions. They become intoxicated with liberal and humanistic phrases, are amused at the fundamentalists, and yet basically are not even up to their level....\" Referring to Union Seminary, Bonhoeffer noted: \"A seminary in which numerous students openly laugh during a public lecture because they find it amusing when a passage on sin and forgiveness ...is cited has obviously, despite its many advantages, forgotten what Christian theology in its very essence stands for\" (pp.&nbsp;309\u201310). He soon regretted his decision and decided that he had to return to Germany to resist the Nazis. He took the last ship from New York to Germany in late August 1939. Due to his secret involvement with the [[20 July plot]] on Hitler's life, he was executed at the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] on April 8, 1945, only 15 days before the United States Army liberated the camp.\n\nBoth [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[Paul Tillich]] taught at the seminary during the post-[[World War II]] period.\n\nDr. [[Serene Jones]], the seminary's first female president, was inaugurated in November 2008. Dr. [[Joseph Hough]], UTS' immediate past president, is a Christian Democratic Socialist. [[Henry Sloane Coffin]] was a past president. Civil Rights Activist [[Cornel West]] joined the faculty in July 2012. Dr. [[James Hal Cone]] is one of the founders of [[liberation theology]] and is active in the development of [[African-American theology]].\n\nUnion has also been home to [[Womanist theologian]]s such as [[Delores S. Williams]]. Dr. [[Gary Dorrien]] is a social ethicist. Dr. [[James A.

This led to a stay of several years at Western State Hospital in her home state of [[California]], at the request of her mother and other family members. In her autobiography, ''Will There Really Be a Morning?'', Farmer later recounted what she called the \"unbearable terror\" of being in the hospital, claiming that she \"was raped by orderlies, gnawed on by rats and poisoned by tainted food.

According to journalist Gillian G. Garr, Cobain grew to identify \"even more with Farmer's story\" after his own success with Nirvana, \"especially with Farmer's unconventional nature, her outspoken dislike of commercialism, her hounding by the media, and her sad, unjust fate.\"<ref name=\"Gaar2006\" /> In 1993, Cobain made several attempts to contact Arnold, who did not respond. Cobain eventually contacted the ''Post-Intelligencer''' Arts and Entertainment editor, and was surprised when Arnold did not know who he was. Arnold states that Cobain then \"called and left this rambling message,\" which included Cobain's theory that he was related to the judge who had signed the first order to commit Farmer. \"I thought to myself, 'I've really got to talk to this guy,'\" Arnold recalls, \"but I was going through some other stuff then and I just didn't. Then he killed himself and I felt really bad.\"<ref name=\"Gaar2006\" /> Arnold, who did not hear the song during Cobain's lifetime, had written \"Return the call of K.C. - the Nirvana guy!\" at the top of his to-do list for April 8, 1994, the day that Cobain's body was found.<ref name=\"Gaar2009\">{{cite book|last1=Gaar|first1=Gillian G|title=The Rough Guide to Nirvana |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i9mvU7iug9AC&pg=PT149&lpg=PT149&dq=Gaar+The+Rough+Guide+to+Nirvana+Frances+Farmer&source=bl&ots=Kelk3WbCCi&sig=ACfU3U0S_6nxrVfLJCwRXqRZ7Pd0bXZZ8w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU28zg5djoAhUEh1wKHS9vB0oQ6AEwAXoECAwQKQ#v=onepage&q=Gaar%20The%20Rough%20Guide%20to%20Nirvana%20Frances%20Farmer&f=false|date=2009|page=none |publisher=[[Rough Guides UK]] |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref>\n\nArnold instead wrote an article for the ''Post-Intelligencer'', published on April 14, 1994, titled \"Cobain Found a Kindred Spirit in Frances Farmer's Troubled Life,\" in which he stated that \"Cobain's behaviour might be interpreted as the actions of a man determined to embody the spirit of Frances Farmer.\"<ref name=\"Gaar2009\">{{cite book|last1=Gaar|first1=Gillian G|title=The Rough Guide to Nirvana |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=i9mvU7iug9AC&pg=PT149&lpg=PT149&dq=Gaar+The+Rough+Guide+to+Nirvana+Frances+Farmer&source=bl&ots=Kelk3WbCCi&sig=ACfU3U0S_6nxrVfLJCwRXqRZ7Pd0bXZZ8w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiU28zg5djoAhUEh1wKHS9vB0oQ6AEwAXoECAwQKQ#v=onepage&q=Gaar%20The%20Rough%20Guide%20to%20Nirvana%20Frances%20Farmer&f=false|date=2009|page=none |publisher=[[Rough Guides UK]] |accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> John D.

This led to a stay of several years at Western State Hospital in her home state of [[California]], at the request of her mother and other family members.

In 2001 the remaining birds in the surroundings were culled, thus ending the occurrence of the species in the 'wild' in the area. However, in the early 2000s vagrants from most probably France were recorded in northern Catalonia, and sporadic observations throughout the year have been recorded since then along the Mediterranean and Cantabrian coasts.

A second colony appeared in 2004 at another nearby heronry at Casalbeltrame. These birds would mostly feed in the rice fields in the area, but would also migrate elsewhere during the summer, with the population at the roosts increasing in the winter. In 2008, the number of breeding ibis was estimated at 80\u2013100 pairs, and at least 300 birds.

Furthermore, in 2000 a group of sacred ibises escaped from a zoo near [[Munster]], some of which apparently crossed the border into [[Overijssel]], as the colours of their [[Bird ringing|rings]] closely matched. The free-flying Avifauna flock numbered 12 in 2001, 30 in 2003, and an estimated maximum of 41 birds escaped the zoo eventually. There had been sightings throughout the country for many years, but in 2002 successful breeding was first reported in a nature reserve some 40&nbsp;km from Avifauna. \nBy 2007 the feral population in the Netherlands had increased to 15 pairs breeding at three locations, including in a tree just outside the zoo. Pairs would regularly move from the zoo to the nature reserve in the summer and vice versa. The next year, in 2008, the tree outside the zoo was cut down, and free-flying birds were recaptured, clipped and caged. 2008/2009 was also a cold winter and many birds died. By 2009 37 birds had been recaptured and by 2010 there were no more birds breeding in the wild. The birds in Weert were halved in number after the 2008\u20132009 winter and had disappeared somewhere between 2011 and 2015.

Thoth, whose head is that of an ibis, is the Ancient Egyptian god of wisdom and reason, and thus of truth, knowledge, learning and study, and writing and mathematics. The sacred ibis was considered the living incarnation of Thoth on earth.\n\nProperly mummified birds enjoyed a path to the afterlife. Pilgrims from all over Egypt brought thousands of ibis offerings to four or more main temples, which at their peak mummified and buried thousands of birds a year in gigantic and ancient catacombs (one complex was in operation for 700 years). Eventually an estimated eight million birds were mummified and entombed by the Ancient Egyptians.\n\nTo sustain sufficient numbers for the large and sometimes growing demand for sacrifices by the people, dozens of ibis breeding farms (called ''ibiotropheia'' by Herodotus) were established, initially throughout the regions of Egypt, but later centralised around the main temples, each producing around a thousand birds for mummies annually. Wild birds were caught and added to the captive flocks. The mummified birds were often young and were usually killed by breaking their neck. The head and bill were often placed between the tail feathers, and a piece of food was often placed in the bill. The particulars of the mummification ritual often differed. The mummies could be stored in ceramic jars, wooden chests or stone sarcophagi. Not all mummies contain whole birds; some (cheaper ones) contain only a leg, an eggshell, or even dried grass from the nest. Birds were given different burials according to their status; as pets, offerings or holy individuals. Special sacred birds were afforded special mummification, transported from their cities to the temples long after normal offerings were sourced from temple farm flocks, and honoured with more luxurious burial. Different regions in Egypt observed slightly different practises regarding the ritual beliefs.<ref name=Wasef/>\n\nIbis mummification started by at least 1,100 BC and petered out by approximately 30 BC. Although the numbers of burials peaked at different times depending on the region and temple, the rituals were most popular from the Late Period to the Ptolemaic Period.<ref name=Wasef/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wasef|first=S.|last2=Wood|first2=R.|last3=Merghani|first3=S.

Picrius mentions how the venomous basilisk is hatched from the eggs of ibis, nurtured from the poisons of all the serpents the birds devour.

In 2008, the number of breeding ibis was estimated at 80\u2013100 pairs, and at least 300 birds. That same year, six individuals, consisting of three pairs, were observed roosting at a heronry in [[Casaleggio Novara|Casaleggio]]. By 2009 they were said to be one of the most characteristic animals of the rice-growing area of Novara and [[Vercellese]]. In 2010 the species was reported attempting to breed in the [[Po (river)|Po]] Delta, northeast Italy. By 2014 reports of individuals and small flocks were recorded in various areas from the Po Valley down to [[Tuscany]]. Outside the Piedmont Region, cases of possible nesting are reported in [[Emilia-Romagna]], [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]].

Furthermore, in 2000 a group of sacred ibises escaped from a zoo near [[Munster]], some of which apparently crossed the border into [[Overijssel]], as the colours of their [[Bird ringing|rings]] closely matched. The free-flying Avifauna flock numbered 12 in 2001, 30 in 2003, and an estimated maximum of 41 birds escaped the zoo eventually. There had been sightings throughout the country for many years, but in 2002 successful breeding was first reported in a nature reserve some 40&nbsp;km from Avifauna. \nBy 2007 the feral population in the Netherlands had increased to 15 pairs breeding at three locations, including in a tree just outside the zoo. Pairs would regularly move from the zoo to the nature reserve in the summer and vice versa. The next year, in 2008, the tree outside the zoo was cut down, and free-flying birds were recaptured, clipped and caged. 2008/2009 was also a cold winter and many birds died. By 2009 37 birds had been recaptured and by 2010 there were no more birds breeding in the wild. The birds in Weert were halved in number after the 2008\u20132009 winter and had disappeared somewhere between 2011 and 2015. As of 2016 a few birds survive, some still attempting to breed in Overijssel, and handful sightings of less than three reported.

Thoth, whose head is that of an ibis, is the Ancient Egyptian god of wisdom and reason, and thus of truth, knowledge, learning and study, and writing and mathematics. The sacred ibis was considered the living incarnation of Thoth on earth.\n\nProperly mummified birds enjoyed a path to the afterlife. Pilgrims from all over Egypt brought thousands of ibis offerings to four or more main temples, which at their peak mummified and buried thousands of birds a year in gigantic and ancient catacombs (one complex was in operation for 700 years). Eventually an estimated eight million birds were mummified and entombed by the Ancient Egyptians.\n\nTo sustain sufficient numbers for the large and sometimes growing demand for sacrifices by the people, dozens of ibis breeding farms (called ''ibiotropheia'' by Herodotus) were established, initially throughout the regions of Egypt, but later centralised around the main temples, each producing around a thousand birds for mummies annually. Wild birds were caught and added to the captive flocks. The mummified birds were often young and were usually killed by breaking their neck. The head and bill were often placed between the tail feathers, and a piece of food was often placed in the bill. The particulars of the mummification ritual often differed. The mummies could be stored in ceramic jars, wooden chests or stone sarcophagi. Not all mummies contain whole birds; some (cheaper ones) contain only a leg, an eggshell, or even dried grass from the nest. Birds were given different burials according to their status; as pets, offerings or holy individuals. Special sacred birds were afforded special mummification, transported from their cities to the temples long after normal offerings were sourced from temple farm flocks, and honoured with more luxurious burial.

Herodotus wrote:\n\n{{quote|There is a region moreover in Arabia, situated nearly over against the city of Buto, to which place I came to inquire about the winged serpents: and when I came thither I saw bones of serpents and spines in quantity so great that it is impossible to make report of the number, and there were heaps of spines, some heaps large and others less large and others smaller still than these, and these heaps were many in number.\nThe region in which the spines are scattered upon the ground is of the nature of an entrance from a narrow mountain pass to a great plain, which plain adjoins the plain of Egypt; and the story goes that at the beginning of spring winged serpents from Arabia fly towards Egypt, and the birds called ibises meet them at the entrance of this country and do not suffer the serpents to go by but kill them. On account of this deed it is (say the Arabians) that the ibis has come to be greatly honored by the Egyptians, and the Egyptians also agree that it is for this reason that they honor these birds.}}\n\n[[Josephus]] tells us that when Moses lead the Hebrews to make war upon the \u00c6thiopians, he brought a great number of the birds in cages of papyrus to oppose any serpents.<ref name=Buffon/>\n\nDue to perhaps a mistranslation of the Greek of Herodotus, before the early 18th century Europeans were convinced that these ibises had human feet.<ref name=Buffon/>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] tells us that it was said that the flies that brought pestilence died immediately upon propitiatory sacrifices of this bird.<ref name=Pliny>{{cite book |last=Pliny |title=Natural History |volume=Book X |chapter=Chapter 41 |chapterurl=http://www.masseiana.org/pliny.htm#BOOK%20X|title-link=Natural History (Pliny) }}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Claudius Aelianus]] in ''De Natura Animalium'', and [[Gaius Julius Solinus]], both quoting much earlier but now lost authors, the sacred ibis procreates with its bill, and thus the bird is always a virgin. [[Aristotle]], writing some 500 years earlier, also mentions this theory, but repudiates it. Picrius mentions how the venomous basilisk is hatched from the eggs of ibis, nurtured from the poisons of all the serpents the birds devour. These authors and many others also mention how crocodiles and snakes are rendered motionless after being touched by the feather of an ibis. Claudius Aelianus also says the ibis is consecrated to the moon.<ref name=Buffon/>\n\nPliny and [[Galen]] ascribe the invention of the [[clyster]] (enema) to the ibis, as according to them it gave such treatments to hippopotami. [[Plutarch]] assures us it uses only salt water for this purpose. 1600 years later this was still accepted science, as [[Claude Perrault]], in his anatomical descriptions of the bird, claimed to have found a hole in the bill which the bird used for that purpose.<ref name=Buffon/>\n\nIn the century before the time of Christ and for at least a century after, the worship of [[Isis#Spread|Isis]] had become quite popular in Rome, especially among women, and the ibis had become one of her associated symbols.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heyob |first=Sharon Kelly |date=1975 |title=The Cult of Isis Among Women in the Graeco-Roman World |editor-last=Vermaseren |editor-first=Maarten Jozef |series=\u00c9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires aux religions orientales dans l'Empire Romain - Tomus 51 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |pages=15\u201316 |doi=10.1163/9789004296374 |isbn=978-9004043688}}</ref> A number of [[fresco]]es and mosaics in the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] villas of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] of 50BC-79AD show these birds.<ref name=Quaderni/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artoffresco.com/02-Portfolio/02.1-Birds/ibis.html |title=Ibis, Pompeii 50BC - 79AD, The Art of the Fresco |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |access-date=17 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/28772513@N07/8610154333 |title=Landscape with Ibis.

He co-edited the ''Presbyterian Review'' with [[Charles Augustus Briggs|Dr Charles A Briggs]] 1880-1888. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=937}} At Princeton, Patton found like-minded theologians - proponents of the so-called [[Princeton theologians|Princeton theology]] - a conservative theological position that, within the Presbyterian church, was a competitor to the liberal \"Chicago school\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==President of Princeton University, 1888\u20131902==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nIn 1888, he was elected president of the College of New Jersey (which in 1896 became [[Princeton University]]), replacing out-going president [[James McCosh]].  His appointment was criticized by some alumni, who noted that Patton was not an American citizen, while some feared he would harangue students with [[John Knox]]-style sermons.  He won over a large number of the alumni with a speech given in New York in 1888, in which he remarked \"I am not prepared to say that it is better to have gone and loafed than never to have gone at all, but I do believe in the ''genius loci''; and I sympathize with Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] when he says, 'that there is around every seminary of learning, an atmosphere of floating knowledge where every one can imbibe something peculiar to his own original conceptions.'\"  The phrase \"Better to have gone and loafed than never to have gone at all\" was often quoted by proponents of the so-called \"Gentleman's C.\"  Patton was a popular president, and his class in [[Ethics]] was one of the most popular on campus.\n\nDuring Patton's time as university president, Princeton more than doubled in size, growing from 600 students in 1888 to 1,300 students in 1902.  Patton appointed many prominent Princeton professors, including: [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Bliss Perry]], [[John Grier Hibben]], [[Henry van Dyke]], [[Paul Van Dyke]], and [[Howard C. Warren]].  Patton announced the name change from \"the College of New Jersey\" to \"Princeton University\" in the midst of the ceremonies celebrating the College's [[Sesquicentennial]] in 1896.  Although Princeton founded a [[graduate school]] while Patton was president (in 1900), Patton played little role in the foundation of the graduate school.\n\nIn 1891, Dr [[Charles Augustus Briggs|Charles A. Briggs]], Patton's former co-editor at the ''Presbyterian Review'' was appointed the first-ever Professor of [[Biblical Theology]] by [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]].  In his inaugural lecture, Briggs praised [[higher criticism]], a component of liberal Christianity, and argued that the Scriptures as a whole are riddled with errors and that the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] taught at Princeton Theological Seminary \"is a ghost of modern evangelicalism to frighten children.\"  Patton was outraged by this lecture and moved that the [[Presbyterian polity#The general assembly|General Assembly]], which had the authority to veto all appointments of professors of theology at Presbyterian [[seminaries]], should exercise this power and remove Briggs from the Union faculty.  On Patton's urging, the General Assembly voted to remove Briggs from his position.  The faculty of Union Theological Seminary voted to withdraw from the denomination rather than remove Briggs from his chair in order to defend the institution's [[academic freedom]].\n\nAlthough Patton was popular as an academic, a theologian, and a public speaker, he was not a gifted [[Academic administration|administrator]].  In the 1890s, clerical control over Princeton waned, and more and more businessmen and lawyers were elected as [[Trustees of Princeton University]].  Dissatisfied with Patton's management of the university, in 1902, the Trustees voted to replace Patton as president, naming [[Woodrow Wilson]] as his successor.\n\n==President of Princeton Theological Seminary, 1902\u20131913==\n\nPatton thus became president of [[Princeton Theological Seminary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptsem.edu/about/history |title=History of Princeton Theological Seminary |publisher=Princeton Theological Seminary |accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> In that capacity, he opposed [[Henry van Dyke]]'s proposal to revise the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Later years, 1913\u20131932==\n\nPatton retired in 1913, with a pension of $3,000 a year.

He co-edited the ''Presbyterian Review'' with [[Charles Augustus Briggs|Dr Charles A Briggs]] 1880-1888. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=937}} At Princeton, Patton found like-minded theologians - proponents of the so-called [[Princeton theologians|Princeton theology]] - a conservative theological position that, within the Presbyterian church, was a competitor to the liberal \"Chicago school\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==President of Princeton University, 1888\u20131902==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nIn 1888, he was elected president of the College of New Jersey (which in 1896 became [[Princeton University]]), replacing out-going president [[James McCosh]].  His appointment was criticized by some alumni, who noted that Patton was not an American citizen, while some feared he would harangue students with [[John Knox]]-style sermons.  He won over a large number of the alumni with a speech given in New York in 1888, in which he remarked \"I am not prepared to say that it is better to have gone and loafed than never to have gone at all, but I do believe in the ''genius loci''; and I sympathize with Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] when he says, 'that there is around every seminary of learning, an atmosphere of floating knowledge where every one can imbibe something peculiar to his own original conceptions.'\"  The phrase \"Better to have gone and loafed than never to have gone at all\" was often quoted by proponents of the so-called \"Gentleman's C.\"  Patton was a popular president, and his class in [[Ethics]] was one of the most popular on campus.\n\nDuring Patton's time as university president, Princeton more than doubled in size, growing from 600 students in 1888 to 1,300 students in 1902.  Patton appointed many prominent Princeton professors, including: [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[Bliss Perry]], [[John Grier Hibben]], [[Henry van Dyke]], [[Paul Van Dyke]], and [[Howard C. Warren]].  Patton announced the name change from \"the College of New Jersey\" to \"Princeton University\" in the midst of the ceremonies celebrating the College's [[Sesquicentennial]] in 1896.  Although Princeton founded a [[graduate school]] while Patton was president (in 1900), Patton played little role in the foundation of the graduate school.\n\nIn 1891, Dr [[Charles Augustus Briggs|Charles A. Briggs]], Patton's former co-editor at the ''Presbyterian Review'' was appointed the first-ever Professor of [[Biblical Theology]] by [[Union Theological Seminary (New York City)|Union Theological Seminary]].  In his inaugural lecture, Briggs praised [[higher criticism]], a component of liberal Christianity, and argued that the Scriptures as a whole are riddled with errors and that the doctrine of [[biblical inerrancy]] taught at Princeton Theological Seminary \"is a ghost of modern evangelicalism to frighten children.\"  Patton was outraged by this lecture and moved that the [[Presbyterian polity#The general assembly|General Assembly]], which had the authority to veto all appointments of professors of theology at Presbyterian [[seminaries]], should exercise this power and remove Briggs from the Union faculty.  On Patton's urging, the General Assembly voted to remove Briggs from his position.  The faculty of Union Theological Seminary voted to withdraw from the denomination rather than remove Briggs from his chair in order to defend the institution's [[academic freedom]].\n\nAlthough Patton was popular as an academic, a theologian, and a public speaker, he was not a gifted [[Academic administration|administrator]].  In the 1890s, clerical control over Princeton waned, and more and more businessmen and lawyers were elected as [[Trustees of Princeton University]].  Dissatisfied with Patton's management of the university, in 1902, the Trustees voted to replace Patton as president, naming [[Woodrow Wilson]] as his successor.\n\n==President of Princeton Theological Seminary, 1902\u20131913==\n\nPatton thus became president of [[Princeton Theological Seminary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptsem.edu/about/history |title=History of Princeton Theological Seminary |publisher=Princeton Theological Seminary |accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> In that capacity, he opposed [[Henry van Dyke]]'s proposal to revise the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Later years, 1913\u20131932==\n\nPatton retired in 1913, with a pension of $3,000 a year. He returned to his native [[Bermuda]].  He continued to speak out on controversies within the Presbyterian church, and during the [[Fundamentalist\u2013Modernist Controversy]], he supported the Fundamentalist side.  He published a book entitled ''Fundamental Christianity'', in which he wrote \"We cannot change Christianity.  We may reject it if we please, but its meaning is plain\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nHe died in Bermuda on November 25, 1932.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Patton, Francis Landey |volume=20 |pages=937\u2013938}}\n\n==External links==\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905|Patton, Francis Landey|Francis Landey Patton}}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Patton,+Francis+Landey | name=Francis Landey Patton}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Francis Landey Patton}}\n*[http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/patton_francis.html Princeton biography]\n*[https://archive.org/details/addressesatindu00pattgoog Addresses commemorating Patton's appointment at McCormick Theological Seminary, 1873]\n*[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa;idno=AGU9808 ''The world's edition of the great Presbyterian conflict: Patton vs. Swing.: Both sides of the question'', 1874]\n*[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=moa;idno=AJK3103 ''Presbyterian Principles'' by Francis L.
