The game gets a little serious as Prem, in a bid to catch a ball, falls down, only to get injured in his head. He quickly gets back on his toes as the injury is not serious. Soon after the match, the friends are in for a shock. Due to the injury, Prem develops [[retrograde amnesia]] and [[short-term memory loss]], wherein he remembers the chain of events which leads to the injury but forgets the last one year of his life and fails to remember everything after the injury. He remembers his life until college and recognizes his friends but is clueless about his upcoming wedding and about Dhana herself, as it is during the last one year that he met her, fell in love with her, and decided to marry her.

He remembers his life until college and recognizes his friends but is clueless about his upcoming wedding and about Dhana herself, as it is during the last one year that he met her, fell in love with her, and decided to marry her. Fearing trouble, his friends take him to a doctor, who says that he could recover anytime. Hence, his friends plan to keep him in their company, enact a drama until he ties the wedding knot, with the hope that he would get back his memory soon, while covering his disorder from everyone else. In the end, everything works out well, and Prem gets his memory back.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as C.

Residence in Malta is not required.\n\n* Widows and widowers of a Maltese citizen (where the spouse died within the first 5 years of marriage) may apply for Maltese citizenship by marriage 5 years after the date of the marriage to their deceased spouse.\n* Persons separated from a Maltese spouse may still apply for Maltese citizenship by marriage provided they lived together for 5 years after the celebration of the marriage.\n* Prior to 10 February 2000, the 5-year period of marriage did not apply, while before 1 August 1989 only the foreign wife of a Maltese man was eligible for citizenship by marriage\n\n==Maltese citizenship by adoption==\n\nPrior to 1 January 1977 a person adopted by Maltese citizens normally acquired Maltese citizenship automatically.  The facility to acquire Maltese citizenship by adoption was removed on that date.\n\nFrom 1 August 1989, a child adopted by Maltese citizens acquires Maltese citizenship automatically provided the child is under the age of 10 at the date of the adoption.\n\n==Loss of Maltese citizenship==\n\n===1964 to 1989===\n\nAt independence in 1964, Malta adopted strict rules to prevent [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] in adulthood.\n\n* an adult citizen of Malta acquiring a foreign citizenship automatically lost Maltese citizenship\n* a Maltese citizen who had acquired another citizenship at birth or during childhood was obliged to renounce that other citizenship before age 19.   Otherwise, Maltese citizenship was lost.\n\n===Reforms of 1989===\n\nFrom 1 August 1989 Maltese law was amended to allow certain emigrants from Malta to retain Maltese citizenship.  It was necessary to have been born in Malta and meet certain residential criteria in order to benefit from this provision.\n\nThose covered by this limited exception were deemed ''never'' to have lost Maltese citizenship.  In other words, the change in the law was retrospective to 21 September 1964.\n\nThe reform did not assist Maltese citizens by descent who had been born in other countries (such as Australia or Canada) who were still obliged to renounce their other citizenship by age 19 or face automatic loss of Maltese citizenship.\n\nFor example, between 1964 and 2000 (when the law changed), approximately 2000 Australian born young persons (aged 18) renounced their [[Australian nationality law|Australian citizenship]] in order to retain Maltese citizenship.  They were generally unable to recover their Australian citizenship later on, or migrate back to Australia.\n\n===Reforms of 2000===\n\nFrom 10 February 2000, it was no longer possible to involuntarily lose Maltese citizenship based on possession or acquisition of a foreign citizenship.\n\nA former Maltese citizen by birth or descent who had resided outside Malta for 6 years was automatically conferred with Maltese citizenship retrospective to the date on which they lost it.  In other words, they are deemed ''never'' to have lost Maltese citizenship.\n\nOther former Maltese citizens who do not meet the requirements for automatic re-acquisition of Maltese citizenship are entitled to obtain Maltese citizenship by registration.  This includes former Maltese citizens who acquired that status by naturalisation or registration, and those who resided outside Malta for less than 6 years.\n\n==Dual citizenship==\n\nWith effect from 10 February 2000, there are no restrictions under Maltese law on its citizens holding other citizenships. Dual citizens are entitled to hold a Maltese passport.\n\n==Citizenship of the European Union==\nBecause Malta forms part of the [[European Union]], Maltese citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Malta (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/malta/index_en.htm | title=Malta | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref> When in a non-EU country where there is no Maltese embassy, Maltese citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.<ref>Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].</ref><ref>[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state).

The traditional domesticated setting that women were accustomed to was used as a patriarchal reasoning for women's restriction of women's votes. However, Chileans religious convictions as devout Catholics initiated their desire to vote against the adamant anticlerical liberal party.

In the late 1940s women's issues were embraced by First Lady [[Rosa Markmann|Rosa Markmann de Gonz\u00e1lez Videla]] in acknowledgement of Mothers centers, women gaining access to resources to fulfill their role as housewives, encouraged women as consumers to fight against high living costs, and to raise their interest in partaking in other avenues of public life within the country, such as work and political participation.<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Motherhood|author=Mooney, J.P.|date=2009|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=9780822973614|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HnEKKaWjcyAC&pg=PA75|page=75|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>  The First Lady's efforts to advocate the evolution of women reform led to the modern techniques of the women reform.

Voting had just become mandatory for all Chileans and was the first time in history registration for female voters increased from thirty-five percent to seventy-five percent. The Christian democratic change of government opened women's access to birth control. However, the government's emphasis on the modernization of women institutions and underlying issues of gender hierarchy, women in poverty were neglected. Restrictions within the women's institutions, mother centers, restricted mothers under 18. To further structurally cripple Chilean women, first lady [[Maria Ruiz Tagle de Frei]] supervised \"proper functioning\" of feminist organizations.<ref name=\"google2\"/>  The Central Organization for Mothers [[(CEMA)]] was created as a formal structure to advise the underprivileged Chilean mothers.<ref name=\"google2\"/> [[Carmen Gloria Aguayo]] revolutionized the mother's centers during the period of conflict between change and tradition during the Christian democrat campaign.<ref name=\"google2\"/> Ms. Aguayo also headed the party's women's departments amongst forty-eight men and reflected the political direction of the initiatives: policies to protect the family- defending women's rights to work, to maternity leave, to equitable pay and occupation, a new opportunities for training and learning in the promised department for female labor studies.
