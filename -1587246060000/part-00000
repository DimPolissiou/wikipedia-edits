Synthetic fibres in use for rope-making include [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]], [[polyester]]s (e.g. [[polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], [[Liquid Crystal Polymer|LCP]], [[Vectran]]), [[polyethylene]] (e.g. [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|Dyneema and Spectra]]), [[Aramid]]s (e.g. [[Twaron]], [[Technora]] and [[Kevlar]]) and [[Acrylate polymer|acrylics]] (e.g. [[Dralon]]). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. [[Wire rope]] is made of steel or other metal alloys.  Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as [[silk]], [[wool]], and hair, but such ropes are not generally available. [[Rayon]] is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope.\n\nThe twist of the strands in a twisted or braided rope serves not only to keep a rope together, but enables the rope to more evenly distribute tension among the individual strands. Without any twist in the rope, the shortest strand(s) would always be supporting a much higher proportion of the total load.\n\n== Size measurement ==\nThe long history of rope means that many systems have been used to state the size of a rope. In systems that use the \"inch\" (British Imperial and United States Customary Measure), large ropes over {{convert|1|in|mm|1}} diameter such as are used on ships are measured by their circumference in inches; smaller ropes have a nominal diameter based on the circumference divided by three (rounded-down value for pi). In metric systems of measurement, nominal diameter is given in millimetres. The current preferred international standard for rope sizes is to give the mass per unit length, in kilograms per metre. However, even sources otherwise using metric units may still give a \"rope number\" for large ropes, which is the circumference in inches.<ref>H A McKenna, J. W. S.

[[Winch]]es and [[capstan (nautical)|capstans]] are machines designed to pull ropes.\n\n=== Rock climbing ropes ===\n[[File:Kernmantle climbing rope dynamic Sterling 10.7mm internal yarns and plies.jpg|thumb|[[Dynamic rope|Dynamic]] [[Kernmantle]] rock climbing rope with its braided sheath cut to expose the twisted core yarns and core yarn plies.]]\n[[File:Kernmantle climbing rope dynamic Sterling 10.7mm cut end.jpg|thumb|Section through Kernmantle rope]]\n\nThe modern sport of [[rock climbing]] uses so-called [[Dynamic rope|\"dynamic\" rope]], which stretches under load in an elastic manner to absorb the energy required to [[Fall arrest|arrest a person in free fall]] without generating forces high enough to injure them. Such ropes normally use a [[Kernmantle rope|kernmantle]] construction, as described [[#kernmantle|below]]. [[Static rope|\"Static\" ropes]], used for example in caving, rappelling, and rescue applications, are designed for minimal stretch; they are not designed to arrest free falls.  The [[UIAA]], in concert with the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], sets climbing-rope standards and oversees testing. Any rope bearing a GUIANA or CE certification tag is suitable for climbing. Despite the hundreds of thousands of falls climbers suffer every year, there are few recorded instances of a climbing rope breaking in a fall; the cases that do are often attributable to previous damage to, or contamination of, the rope. Climbing ropes, however, do cut easily when under load. Keeping them away from sharp rock edges is imperative.\n\nRock climbing ropes come with either a designation for single, double or twin use. A single rope is the most common and it is intended to be used by itself, as a single strand. Single ropes range in thickness from roughly 9&nbsp;mm to 11&nbsp;mm. Smaller ropes are lighter, but wear out faster.  Double ropes are thinner ropes, usually 9&nbsp;mm and under, and are intended for use as a pair. These ropes offer a greater margin or security against cutting, since it is unlikely that both ropes will be cut, but they complicate [[belaying]] and leading. Double ropes are usually reserved for ice and mixed climbing, where there is need for two ropes to [[rappel]] or [[Abseiling|abseil]]. They are also popular among traditional climbers, and particularly in the UK, due to the ability to clip each rope into alternating pieces of protection; allowing the ropes to stay straighter and hence reduce rope drag.\nTwin ropes are not to be confused with doubles. When using twin ropes, both ropes are clipped into the same piece of protection, treating the two as a single strand. This would be favourable in a situation where there was a high chance of a rope being cut. However new lighter-weight ropes with greater safety have virtually replaced this type of rope.\n\nThe [[butterfly coil]] is a method of carrying a rope used by climbers where the rope remains attached to the climber and ready to be uncoiled at short notice. Another method of carrying a rope is the [[mountaineer's coil|alpine coil]].\n\n=== Aerial rope ===\nRope is also an [[Corde lisse|aerial acrobatics]] circus skill, where a performer makes artistic figures on a vertical suspended rope. Tricks performed on the rope are, for example, drops, rolls and hangs. They must also be strong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fedec.eu/resources.1637.html |title=Fedec {{!}} Resources |accessdate=2014-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131140047/http://www.fedec.eu/resources.1637.html |archivedate=January 31, 2014 }}</ref> ''See also [[Corde lisse]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ancient Egypt rope manufacture.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Ancient Egypt]]ians were the first to document tools for ropemaking]]\n\nThe use of ropes for hunting, pulling, fastening, attaching, carrying, lifting, and climbing dates back to [[prehistoric]] times.

Starting from approximately 2800&nbsp;BC, rope made of [[hemp]] fibres was in use in China. Rope and the craft of rope making spread throughout Asia, India, and Europe over the next several thousand years.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages until the 18th century, in Europe ropes were constructed in [[ropewalk]]s, very long buildings where strands the full length of the rope were spread out and then ''laid up'' or twisted together to form the rope. The cable length was thus set by the length of the available rope walk. This is related to the unit of length termed ''[[cable length]]''. This allowed for long ropes of up to 300 yards long or longer to be made. These long ropes were necessary in shipping as short ropes would require [[Rope splicing|splicing]] to make them long enough to use for [[sheet (sailing)|sheets]] and [[halyards]]. The strongest form of splicing is the short [[Rope splicing|splice]], which doubles the cross-sectional area of the rope at the area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys. Any splices narrow enough to maintain smooth running would be less able to support the required weight.{{Citation needed|reason=need citation for relative strength of short and long splices|date=October 2012}}\n\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew sketches of a concept for a ropemaking machine, but it was never built. Remarkable feats of construction were accomplished using rope but without advanced technology: In 1586, [[Domenico Fontana]] erected the 327 ton [[obelisk]] on Rome's [[Saint Peter's Square]] with a concerted effort of 900 men, 75 horses, and countless pulleys and meters of rope. By the late 18th century several working machines had been built and patented.\n\nSome rope is still made from [[natural fibre]]s, such as [[coir]] and [[sisal]], despite the dominance of [[synthetic fibre]]s such as [[nylon]] and [[polypropylene]], which have become increasingly popular since the 1950s.\n\n<gallery heights=\"180px\" widths=\"200px\" class=center>\nMendel I 016 r.jpg|A ropemaker at work, {{circa|1425}}\nGerman Ropemaker, around 1460-1480.png|A [[Germany|German]] ropemaker, {{circa|1470}}\nTurku Medieval Markets, twisting rope.jpg|Public demonstration of historical ropemaking technique\nMaryRose-rope fragment.JPG|A piece of preserved rope found on board the 16th century [[carrack]] ''[[Mary Rose]]''\nRepslagarbanan 1-Karlskrona.JPG|A ropewalk in [[Karlskrona]], Sweden\n</gallery>\n\n== Styles of rope construction ==\n\n=== Laid or twisted rope ===\n[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.png|upright|thumb|left|Illustration of the S and Z naming convention]]\n\nLaid rope, also called twisted rope, is historically the prevalent form of rope, at least in modern [[Western culture|Western]] history. Common twisted rope generally consists of three strands and is normally right-laid, or given a final right-handed twist.  The [[ISO 2]] standard uses the [[Letter case|uppercase letters]] '''S''' and '''Z''' to indicate the two possible directions of twist, as suggested by the direction of slant of the central portions of these two letters.  The [[Chirality (physics)|handedness]] of the twist is the direction of the twists as they progress away from an observer. Thus Z-twist rope is said to be [[Right-hand rule#Direction associated with a rotation|right-handed]], and S-twist to be left-handed.\n\nTwisted ropes are built up in three steps. First, [[fibre]]s are gathered and [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] into [[yarn]]s. A number of these yarns are then formed into strands by twisting. The strands are then twisted together to lay the rope. The twist of the yarn is opposite to that of the strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope.  It is this counter-twist, introduced with each successive operation, which holds the final rope together as a stable, unified object.<ref name=\"ancientartoflayingrope\">{{cite journal |title=The ancient art of laying rope |author=J.

Without this feature, deep water sailing (before the advent of steel chains and other lines) was largely impossible, as any appreciable length of rope for anchoring or ship to ship transfers, would become too waterlogged&nbsp;\u2013 and therefore too heavy&nbsp;\u2013 to lift, even with the aid of a capstan or windlass.\n\nOne property of laid rope is partial untwisting when used.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp_2CANYU5wC&pg=PA17&dq=rope+partially+untwists+when+used.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5poGU6_fWAhUpqVQKHQNTDc4Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=rope%20partially%20untwists%20when%20used.&f=false |title=HORSEMANS GT TACK & EQUIPMENT: F |last=McFarland |first=Cynthia |date=2013-08-06 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7627-9598-7}}</ref> This can cause spinning of suspended loads, or [[Deformation (mechanics)|stretching]], [[wikt:kink|kinking]], or [[wikt:hockle|hockling]] of the rope itself.  An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fibre fragments, which is not easily detected visually.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nTwisted ropes have a preferred direction for coiling. Normal right-laid rope should be coiled clockwise, to prevent kinking. Coiling this way imparts a twist to the rope.  Rope of this type must be [[Whipped rope|bound]] at its ends by some means to prevent untwisting.\n\n=== Braided rope ===\n[[File:Braiding machine arbetes museum.jpg|thumb|250px|A rope [[braiding machine]] at the Arbetets Museum (Museum of Work) in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden]]\nWhile rope may be made from three or more strands,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kyosev |first=Y |title=Braiding technology for textiles |publisher=Elsevier/ Woodhead Pub |location=Cambridge, UK Waltham, MA, USA |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-85709-135-2}}</ref> modern braided rope consists of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for [[Abseiling|rappelling]] or to suspend an [[arborist]]. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used as a part of a personal or group safety system.\n\n[[Braid]]ed ropes are generally made from [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[polypropylene]] or high performance fibers such as [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|high modulus polyethylene]] (HMPE) and aramid. Nylon is chosen for its strength and elastic stretch properties. However, nylon absorbs water and is 10\u201315% weaker when wet. Polyester is about 90% as strong as nylon but stretches less under load and is not affected by water. It has somewhat better UV resistance, and is more abrasion resistant. Polypropylene is preferred for low cost and light weight (it floats on water) but it has limited resistance to [[ultraviolet]] light, is susceptible to friction and has a poor heat resistance.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nBraided ropes (and objects like garden [[hose (tubing)|hoses]], [[optical fibre|fibre optic]] or [[coaxial cable|coaxial]] cables, etc.) that have no ''lay'' (or inherent twist) uncoil better if each alternate loop is twisted in the opposite direction, such as in figure-eight coils, where the twist reverses regularly and essentially cancels out.\n\n'''Single braid''' consists of an even number of strands, eight or twelve being typical, braided into a circular pattern with half of the strands going clockwise and the other half going anticlockwise. The strands can interlock with either [[twill]] or [[plain weave]]. The central void may be large or small; in the former case the term '''hollow braid''' is sometimes preferred.\n\n'''Double braid''', also called '''braid on braid''', consists of an inner braid filling the central void in an outer braid, that may be of the same or different material. Often the inner braid fibre is chosen for strength while the outer braid fibre is chosen for abrasion resistance.\n\nIn '''solid braid''', the strands all travel the same direction, clockwise or anticlockwise, and alternate between forming the outside of the rope and the interior of the rope. This construction is popular for general purpose utility rope but rare in specialized high performance line.\n\n{{Anchor|kernmantle}}\n'''[[Kernmantle]]''' rope has a core (kern) of long twisted fibres in the center, with a braided outer sheath or mantle of [[weaving|woven]] fibres. The kern provides most of the strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how easy it is to hold, to tie knots in, and so on). In [[dynamic rope|dynamic climbing line]], core fibres are usually twisted, and chopped into shorter lengths, which makes the rope more elastic. Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibres and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch.\n\n=== Other types ===\n'''Plaited rope''' is made by braiding twisted strands, and is also called ''square braid''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92rWxakaFAoC&pg=PT753&dq=Plaited+rope+is+made+by+braiding+twisted+strands,+and+is+also+called+square+braid.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP0Ymo3v3XAhVT0GMKHbPeAo4Q6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=Plaited%20rope%20is%20made%20by%20braiding%20twisted%20strands,%20and%20is%20also%20called%20square%20braid.&f=false |title=Boating |date=June 1965}}</ref> It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material, very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibres as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. '''Brait rope''' is a combination of braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to laid three-strand ropes. Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by [[arborist]]s. It is also a popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps. This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.\n\n'''Endless winding rope''' is made by winding single strands of high-performance yarns around two end terminations until the desired break strength or stiffness has been reached. This type of rope (often specified as cable to make the difference between a braided or twined construction) has the advantage of having no construction stretch as is the case with above constructions. Endless winding is pioneered by SmartRigging and FibreMax.\n\n== Gallery of \u00b5CT/micro-CT images and animations ==\n\n=== 2D images / sections ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D top view.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D top view zoom.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D lateral view.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D lateral view 2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2D flight-throughs/sections ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 2D Top 2050x2050.ogv\nMicro-CT 2D top view flight-through of a braided polymer climbing rope Zoom.ogg\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 2D Right 2560x550 750f 25fps.ogv\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 2D Rotation 2560x550 750f 25fps.ogv\n</gallery>\n\n=== 3D renderings ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 02.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 03.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 05.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 07.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 08.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 10.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== 3D flight-throughs/sections ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 3D.ogv\n</gallery>\n\n== Safe and proper rope handling ==\n[[File:Cordages-mutin.jpg|thumb|Cordage aboard the French training ship ''[[French ship Mutin|Mutin]]'']]\nRope made from [[hemp]], cotton or nylon is generally stored in a cool dry place for proper storage.

Once rope is purposely sized, cut, spliced, or simply assigned a function, the result is often referred to as a \"line\", especially in nautical usage. The most common sail control lines, which controls the clew of a sail, are referred to as sheets (e.g. [[jib sheet]]). A [[halyard]], for example, is a line used to raise and lower a [[sail]], and is typically made of a length of rope with a [[shackle]] attached at one end. Other examples include [[clothesline]], [[chalk line]], [[anchor]] line (\"rode\"), stern line, [[fishing line]], marline and so on.

Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. [[Wire rope]] is made of steel or other metal alloys.  Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as [[silk]], [[wool]], and hair, but such ropes are not generally available. [[Rayon]] is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope.\n\nThe twist of the strands in a twisted or braided rope serves not only to keep a rope together, but enables the rope to more evenly distribute tension among the individual strands. Without any twist in the rope, the shortest strand(s) would always be supporting a much higher proportion of the total load.\n\n== Size measurement ==\nThe long history of rope means that many systems have been used to state the size of a rope. In systems that use the \"inch\" (British Imperial and United States Customary Measure), large ropes over {{convert|1|in|mm|1}} diameter such as are used on ships are measured by their circumference in inches; smaller ropes have a nominal diameter based on the circumference divided by three (rounded-down value for pi). In metric systems of measurement, nominal diameter is given in millimetres. The current preferred international standard for rope sizes is to give the mass per unit length, in kilograms per metre. However, even sources otherwise using metric units may still give a \"rope number\" for large ropes, which is the circumference in inches.<ref>H A McKenna, J. W. S.

[[Static rope|\"Static\" ropes]], used for example in caving, rappelling, and rescue applications, are designed for minimal stretch; they are not designed to arrest free falls.  The [[UIAA]], in concert with the [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]], sets climbing-rope standards and oversees testing. Any rope bearing a GUIANA or CE certification tag is suitable for climbing. Despite the hundreds of thousands of falls climbers suffer every year, there are few recorded instances of a climbing rope breaking in a fall; the cases that do are often attributable to previous damage to, or contamination of, the rope. Climbing ropes, however, do cut easily when under load. Keeping them away from sharp rock edges is imperative.\n\nRock climbing ropes come with either a designation for single, double or twin use. A single rope is the most common and it is intended to be used by itself, as a single strand. Single ropes range in thickness from roughly 9&nbsp;mm to 11&nbsp;mm. Smaller ropes are lighter, but wear out faster.  Double ropes are thinner ropes, usually 9&nbsp;mm and under, and are intended for use as a pair. These ropes offer a greater margin or security against cutting, since it is unlikely that both ropes will be cut, but they complicate [[belaying]] and leading. Double ropes are usually reserved for ice and mixed climbing, where there is need for two ropes to [[rappel]] or [[Abseiling|abseil]]. They are also popular among traditional climbers, and particularly in the UK, due to the ability to clip each rope into alternating pieces of protection; allowing the ropes to stay straighter and hence reduce rope drag.\nTwin ropes are not to be confused with doubles. When using twin ropes, both ropes are clipped into the same piece of protection, treating the two as a single strand. This would be favourable in a situation where there was a high chance of a rope being cut. However new lighter-weight ropes with greater safety have virtually replaced this type of rope.\n\nThe [[butterfly coil]] is a method of carrying a rope used by climbers where the rope remains attached to the climber and ready to be uncoiled at short notice. Another method of carrying a rope is the [[mountaineer's coil|alpine coil]].\n\n=== Aerial rope ===\nRope is also an [[Corde lisse|aerial acrobatics]] circus skill, where a performer makes artistic figures on a vertical suspended rope. Tricks performed on the rope are, for example, drops, rolls and hangs. They must also be strong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fedec.eu/resources.1637.html |title=Fedec {{!}} Resources |accessdate=2014-01-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131140047/http://www.fedec.eu/resources.1637.html |archivedate=January 31, 2014 }}</ref> ''See also [[Corde lisse]]''.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ancient Egypt rope manufacture.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Ancient Egypt]]ians were the first to document tools for ropemaking]]\n\nThe use of ropes for hunting, pulling, fastening, attaching, carrying, lifting, and climbing dates back to [[prehistoric]] times. It is likely that the earliest \"ropes\" were naturally occurring lengths of plant fibre, such as vines, followed soon by the first attempts at twisting and braiding these strands together to form the first proper ropes in the modern sense of the word.  Impressions of cordage found on [[Pit fired pottery|fired clay]] provide evidence of string and rope-making technology in Europe dating back 28,000 years.<ref name=\"stheory\">{{Citation |last=Small |first=Meredith F. |title=String theory: the tradition of spinning raw fibers dates back 28,000 years.

Turner and P. van de Griend (ed.), ''The History and Science of Knots'' (Singapore: World Scientific, 1996), 14.</ref>\n\nThe [[ancient Egypt]]ians were probably the first civilization to develop special tools to make rope. Egyptian rope dates back to 4000 to 3500&nbsp;BC and was generally made of water reed fibres.<ref>(See http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Rope.html, word-for-word not sure which \"plagiarized\" which)</ref> Other rope in antiquity was made from the fibres of [[date palm]]s, [[flax]], [[grass]], [[papyrus]], [[leather]], or animal hair. The use of such ropes pulled by thousands of workers allowed the [[Egyptians]] to move the heavy stones required to build their monuments. Starting from approximately 2800&nbsp;BC, rope made of [[hemp]] fibres was in use in China. Rope and the craft of rope making spread throughout Asia, India, and Europe over the next several thousand years.\n\nFrom the Middle Ages until the 18th century, in Europe ropes were constructed in [[ropewalk]]s, very long buildings where strands the full length of the rope were spread out and then ''laid up'' or twisted together to form the rope. The cable length was thus set by the length of the available rope walk. This is related to the unit of length termed ''[[cable length]]''. This allowed for long ropes of up to 300 yards long or longer to be made. These long ropes were necessary in shipping as short ropes would require [[Rope splicing|splicing]] to make them long enough to use for [[sheet (sailing)|sheets]] and [[halyards]]. The strongest form of splicing is the short [[Rope splicing|splice]], which doubles the cross-sectional area of the rope at the area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys. Any splices narrow enough to maintain smooth running would be less able to support the required weight.{{Citation needed|reason=need citation for relative strength of short and long splices|date=October 2012}}\n\n[[Leonardo da Vinci]] drew sketches of a concept for a ropemaking machine, but it was never built. Nevertheless, remarkable feats of construction were accomplished without advanced technology: In 1586, [[Domenico Fontana]] erected the 327 ton [[obelisk]] on Rome's [[Saint Peter's Square]] with a concerted effort of 900 men, 75 horses, and countless pulleys and meters of rope. By the late 18th century several working machines had been built and patented.\n\nSome rope is still made from [[natural fibre]]s, such as [[coir]] and [[sisal]], despite the dominance of [[synthetic fibre]]s such as [[nylon]] and [[polypropylene]], which have become increasingly popular since the 1950s.\n\n<gallery heights=\"180px\" widths=\"200px\" class=center>\nMendel I 016 r.jpg|A ropemaker at work, {{circa|1425}}\nGerman Ropemaker, around 1460-1480.png|A [[Germany|German]] ropemaker, {{circa|1470}}\nTurku Medieval Markets, twisting rope.jpg|Public demonstration of historical ropemaking technique\nMaryRose-rope fragment.JPG|A piece of preserved rope found on board the 16th century [[carrack]] ''[[Mary Rose]]''\nRepslagarbanan 1-Karlskrona.JPG|A ropewalk in [[Karlskrona]], Sweden\n</gallery>\n\n== Styles of rope construction ==\n\n=== Laid or twisted rope ===\n[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.png|upright|thumb|left|Illustration of the S and Z naming convention]]\n\nLaid rope, also called twisted rope, is historically the prevalent form of rope, at least in modern [[Western culture|Western]] history. Common twisted rope generally consists of three strands and is normally right-laid, or given a final right-handed twist.  The [[ISO 2]] standard uses the [[Letter case|uppercase letters]] '''S''' and '''Z''' to indicate the two possible directions of twist, as suggested by the direction of slant of the central portions of these two letters.  The [[Chirality (physics)|handedness]] of the twist is the direction of the twists as they progress away from an observer. Thus Z-twist rope is said to be [[Right-hand rule#Direction associated with a rotation|right-handed]], and S-twist to be left-handed.\n\nTwisted ropes are built up in three steps. First, [[fibre]]s are gathered and [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] into [[yarn]]s. A number of these yarns are then formed into strands by twisting. The strands are then twisted together to lay the rope. The twist of the yarn is opposite to that of the strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope.  It is this counter-twist, introduced with each successive operation, which holds the final rope together as a stable, unified object.<ref name=\"ancientartoflayingrope\">{{cite journal |title=The ancient art of laying rope |author=J.

Without this feature, deep water sailing (before the advent of steel chains and other lines) was largely impossible, as any appreciable length of rope for anchoring or ship to ship transfers, would become too waterlogged&nbsp;\u2013 and therefore too heavy&nbsp;\u2013 to lift, even with the aid of a capstan or windlass.\n\nOne property of laid rope is partial untwisting when used.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hp_2CANYU5wC&pg=PA17&dq=rope+partially+untwists+when+used.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5poGU6_fWAhUpqVQKHQNTDc4Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&q=rope%20partially%20untwists%20when%20used.&f=false |title=HORSEMANS GT TACK & EQUIPMENT: F |last=McFarland |first=Cynthia |date=2013-08-06 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7627-9598-7}}</ref> This can cause spinning of suspended loads, or [[Deformation (mechanics)|stretching]], [[wikt:kink|kinking]], or [[wikt:hockle|hockling]] of the rope itself.  An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fibre fragments, which is not easily detected visually.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}\n\nTwisted ropes have a preferred direction for coiling. Normal right-laid rope should be coiled clockwise, to prevent kinking. Coiling this way imparts a twist to the rope.  Rope of this type must be [[Whipped rope|bound]] at its ends by some means to prevent untwisting.\n\n=== Braided rope ===\n[[File:Braiding machine arbetes museum.jpg|thumb|250px|A rope [[braiding machine]] at the Arbetets Museum (Museum of Work) in Norrk\u00f6ping, Sweden]]\nWhile rope may be made from three or more strands,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kyosev |first=Y |title=Braiding technology for textiles |publisher=Elsevier/ Woodhead Pub |location=Cambridge, UK Waltham, MA, USA |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-85709-135-2}}</ref> modern braided rope consists of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for [[Abseiling|rappelling]] or to suspend an [[arborist]]. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used as a part of a personal or group safety system.\n\n[[Braid]]ed ropes are generally made from [[nylon]], [[polyester]], [[polypropylene]] or high performance fibers such as [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|high modulus polyethylene]] (HMPE) and aramid. Nylon is chosen for its strength and elastic stretch properties. However, nylon absorbs water and is 10\u201315% weaker when wet. Polyester is about 90% as strong as nylon but stretches less under load and is not affected by water. It has somewhat better UV resistance, and is more abrasion resistant. Polypropylene is preferred for low cost and light weight (it floats on water) but it has limited resistance to [[ultraviolet]] light, is susceptible to friction and has a poor heat resistance.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\nBraided ropes (and objects like garden [[hose (tubing)|hoses]], [[optical fibre|fibre optic]] or [[coaxial cable|coaxial]] cables, etc.) that have no ''lay'' (or inherent twist) uncoil better if each alternate loop is twisted in the opposite direction, such as in figure-eight coils, where the twist reverses regularly and essentially cancels out.\n\n'''Single braid''' consists of an even number of strands, eight or twelve being typical, braided into a circular pattern with half of the strands going clockwise and the other half going anticlockwise. The strands can interlock with either [[twill]] or [[plain weave]]. The central void may be large or small; in the former case the term '''hollow braid''' is sometimes preferred.\n\n'''Double braid''', also called '''braid on braid''', consists of an inner braid filling the central void in an outer braid, that may be of the same or different material. Often the inner braid fibre is chosen for strength while the outer braid fibre is chosen for abrasion resistance.\n\nIn '''solid braid''', the strands all travel the same direction, clockwise or anticlockwise, and alternate between forming the outside of the rope and the interior of the rope. This construction is popular for general purpose utility rope but rare in specialized high performance line.\n\n{{Anchor|kernmantle}}\n'''[[Kernmantle]]''' rope has a core (kern) of long twisted fibres in the center, with a braided outer sheath or mantle of [[weaving|woven]] fibres. The kern provides most of the strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how easy it is to hold, to tie knots in, and so on). In [[dynamic rope|dynamic climbing line]], core fibres are usually twisted, and chopped into shorter lengths, which makes the rope more elastic. Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibres and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch.\n\n=== Other types ===\n'''Plaited rope''' is made by braiding twisted strands, and is also called ''square braid''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92rWxakaFAoC&pg=PT753&dq=Plaited+rope+is+made+by+braiding+twisted+strands,+and+is+also+called+square+braid.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiP0Ymo3v3XAhVT0GMKHbPeAo4Q6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=Plaited%20rope%20is%20made%20by%20braiding%20twisted%20strands,%20and%20is%20also%20called%20square%20braid.&f=false |title=Boating |date=June 1965}}</ref> It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material, very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibres as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. '''Brait rope''' is a combination of braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to laid three-strand ropes. Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by [[arborist]]s. It is also a popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps. This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage.\n\n'''Endless winding rope''' is made by winding single strands of high-performance yarns around two end terminations until the desired break strength or stiffness has been reached. This type of rope (often specified as cable to make the difference between a braided or twined construction) has the advantage of having no construction stretch as is the case with above constructions. Endless winding is pioneered by SmartRigging and FibreMax.\n\n== Gallery of \u00b5CT/micro-CT images and animations ==\n\n=== 2D images / sections ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D top view.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D top view zoom.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D lateral view.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 2D lateral view 2.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== 2D flight-throughs/sections ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 2D Top 2050x2050.ogv\nMicro-CT 2D top view flight-through of a braided polymer climbing rope Zoom.ogg\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 2D Right 2560x550 750f 25fps.ogv\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 2D Rotation 2560x550 750f 25fps.ogv\n</gallery>\n\n=== 3D renderings ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 02.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 03.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 05.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 07.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 08.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 10.jpg\nMicro-CT braided polymer rope 3D 11.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n=== 3D flight-throughs/sections ===\n\n<gallery>\nMicro-CT Rope HighRes 3D.ogv\n</gallery>\n\n== Safe and proper rope handling ==\n[[File:Cordages-mutin.jpg|thumb|Cordage aboard the French training ship ''[[French ship Mutin|Mutin]]'']]\nRope made from [[hemp]], cotton or nylon is generally stored in a cool dry place for proper storage.

Once rope is purposely sized, cut, spliced, or simply assigned a function, the result is often referred to as a \"line\", especially in nautical usage. The most common sail control lines, which controls the clew of a sail, are referred to as sheets (e.g. [[jib sheet]]). A [[halyard]], for example, is a line used to raise and lower a [[sail]], and is typically made of a length of rope with a [[shackle]] attached at one end. Other examples include [[clothesline]], [[chalk line]], [[anchor]] line (\"rode\"), stern line, [[fishing line]], marline and so on.

Constantine had no interest in politics, statecraft or the military. His brief reign is said to have been \"an unmitigated disaster\", sparking \"a collapse of the military power of the Empire\". Constantine had no sons, so shortly before his death he married his daughter [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zo\u00eb]] to his chosen successor, [[Romanos Argyros]].\n\n==Family==\n{{stack|[[Image:GoldHistamenonZoeAndTheodora1042.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Gold ''[[histamenon]]'' of Constantine's daughters Zo\u00eb and Theodora]]\n}}\nConstantine's father, [[Romanos II]], was the sixth Byzantine emperor of the [[Macedonian dynasty]]. After the death of his first wife, Bertha (who took the name Eudocia), daughter of [[Hugh of Arles]], he fell in love with and married an innkeeper's daughter from the Peloponnese, [[Theophano (10th century)|Theophano]]. Contemporaries called Theophano the most beautiful woman in Christendom as well as ambitious, an inveterate schemer and utterly amoral. She bore Romanos four children, including Constantine, born in 960, and his elder brother [[Basil II|Basil]], born in 958.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=174}} His sister [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Anna]]'s hand was considered such a prize that [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] converted to Christianity in order to marry her.{{sfn|SkylitzesWortley|2010|p=319 (footnote)}} Aged eight, Constantine was engaged to a daughter of Emperor [[Boris II of Bulgaria]] but in the end he married a Byzantine aristocrat, [[Helena, daughter of Alypius]].

Passing over a bevy of suitors among Constantinople's courtiers, she made an alliance with [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]. Nikephoros, a physically repulsive ascetic twice her age, was the greatest military hero of the Empire. In return for her hand, the childless Nikephoros gave his sacred pledge to protect her children and their interests. Nikephoros entered Constantinople three months after Romanos' death, breaking the resistance of [[Joseph Bringas]], a eunuch palace official who had been Romanos' chief counsellor, in street fighting.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=284}} Nikephoros was crowned emperor in the presence of his nominal co-emperors, Constantine and Basil.

Tzimiskes proposed to marry Theophano but the Empress had by then been too damaged by gossip and rumours, many of them accurate. [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Polyeuctus of Constantinople|Polyeuktos]] refused to perform the coronation unless Tzimiskes removed the \"scarlet empress\" from the court. Tzimiskes calculated that his legitimacy would be better enhanced by church approval than betrothal to the unpopular empress and acceded to the Patriarch's demands. Theophano was sent into exile and Tzimiskes was crowned, again with Constantine and Basil as co-emperors.{{sfn|Ash|1995|p=248}}{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=240}} He married [[Theodora, daughter of Constantine VII|Theodora]], Constantine's aunt.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=261}}\n\n===Adulthood===\nFollowing the death of Tzimiskes in January 976, Basil and Constantine took power.

He was the younger son of Emperor [[Romanos II]] and Empress [[Theophano (10th century)|Theophano]]. He was nominal co-emperor for 63 years, successively with his father; stepfather, [[Nikephoros II Phokas]]; uncle, [[John I Tzimiskes]]; and brother, [[Basil II]].\n\nBasil II died childless on 15 December 1025 and thus left the rule of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in Constantine's hands. Constantine had no interest in politics, statecraft or the military. His brief reign is said to have been \"an unmitigated disaster\", sparking \"a collapse of the military power of the Empire\". Constantine had no sons, so shortly before his death he married his daughter [[Zoe Porphyrogenita|Zo\u00eb]] to his chosen successor, [[Romanos Argyros]].\n\n==Family==\n{{stack|[[Image:GoldHistamenonZoeAndTheodora1042.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Gold ''[[histamenon]]'' of Constantine's daughters Zo\u00eb and Theodora]]\n}}\nConstantine's father, [[Romanos II]], was the sixth Byzantine emperor of the [[Macedonian dynasty]]. After the death of his first wife, Bertha (who took the name Eudocia), daughter of [[Hugh of Arles]], he fell in love with and married an innkeeper's daughter from the Peloponnese, [[Theophano (10th century)|Theophano]]. Contemporaries called Theophano the most beautiful woman in Christendom as well as ambitious, an inveterate schemer and utterly amoral. She bore Romanos four children, including Constantine, born in 960, and his elder brother [[Basil II|Basil]], born in 958.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=174}} His sister [[Anna Porphyrogenita|Anna]]'s hand was considered such a prize that [[Vladimir I of Kiev]] converted to Christianity in order to marry her.{{sfn|SkylitzesWortley|2010|p=319 (footnote)}} Aged eight, Constantine was engaged to a daughter of Emperor [[Boris II of Bulgaria]] but in the end he married a Byzantine aristocrat, [[Helena, daughter of Alypius]]. By Helena he had three daughters: Eudokia, who became a nun; [[Zo\u00eb Porphyrogenita|Zo\u00eb]], who was empress for 22 years; and [[Theodora (11th century)|Theodora]], who reigned for 18 months and was the last of the Macedonian line.{{sfn|Garland|1999|pp=165\u201366}}\n\n==Life==\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical\n|image1=Constantine VII and Romanos II solidus.jpg\n|caption1=Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|solidus]]'' of [[Romanos II]]'s father [[Constantine VII]] (left) and Romanos II (right)\n|image2=Histamenon nomisma-Nicephorus II and Basil II-sb1776.jpg\n|caption2=''[[Histamenon]]'' of [[Nikephoros II]] (left) and [[Basil II]] (right)\n|image3=Histamenon nomisma-John I-sb1776.jpg\n|caption3=''Histamenon'' of [[John Tzimiskes]] crowned by the Virgin Mary\n|image4=Histamenon of Basil II and Constantino VIII, 977\u2013989(?).jpg\n|caption4=''Histamenon'' of Basil II (left) and Constantine VIII (right)<br>All coins show a [[Halo (religious iconography)|haloed]] Christ on obverse\n}}\n\n===Childhood===\nRomanos died in 963, amidst rumours that Theophano had poisoned him; Constantine was three years old.

Passing over a bevy of suitors among Constantinople's courtiers, she made an alliance with [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]. Nikephoros, a physically repulsive ascetic twice her age, was the greatest military hero of the Empire. In return for her hand, the childless Nikephoros gave his sacred pledge to protect her children and their interests. Nikephoros entered Constantinople three months after Romanos' death, breaking the resistance of [[Joseph Bringas]], a eunuch palace official who had been Romanos' chief counsellor, in street fighting.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=284}} Nikephoros was crowned emperor in the presence of his nominal co-emperors, Constantine and Basil. A month later he married their mother.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=174\u201375, 183\u2013190}}\n\nSix years later, Nikephoros was murdered at Theophano's instigation and her lover and co-conspirator [[John Tzimiskes]] was acclaimed emperor. Tzimiskes proposed to marry Theophano but the Empress had by then been too damaged by gossip and rumours, many of them accurate. [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Patriarch Polyeuctus of Constantinople|Polyeuktos]] refused to perform the coronation unless Tzimiskes removed the \"scarlet empress\" from the court. Tzimiskes calculated that his legitimacy would be better enhanced by church approval than betrothal to the unpopular empress and acceded to the Patriarch's demands. Theophano was sent into exile and Tzimiskes was crowned, again with Constantine and Basil as co-emperors.{{sfn|Ash|1995|p=248}}{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=240}} He married [[Theodora, daughter of Constantine VII|Theodora]], Constantine's aunt.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=261}}\n\n===Adulthood===\nFollowing the death of Tzimiskes in January 976, Basil and Constantine took power. Although the sixteen year old Constantine was nominally co-emperor it was clear that Basil was senior emperor as ''Basileus'' Basil II.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=264}} Constantine as a young man was tall and graceful, he was a superb horseman and trained his own horses. He competed in athletic and wrestling competitions, which he brought back into fashion. He had an excellent speaking voice and a good grasp of rhetoric. He was a gourmet and a gourmand.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=267, 269}} He had no interest in politics, statecraft or the military and never developed any.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=231}} Constantine led troops alongside his brother in 989; the campaign ended without any combat and Constantine was not appointed to military command again.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=242\u201343}}\n\n===Emperor===\n[[File:Histamenon nomisma-Constantine VIII-sb1776.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Histamenon]]'' of Constantine VIII. On the reverse is an image of [[Christ]].]]\n\nBasil II had an illustrious reign, earning the sobriquet \"Bulgar-slayer\" (Bulgaroktonus). He died childless on 15 December 1025 and Constantine, a sixty-five-year-old widower, became sole emperor as Constantine VIII. He had been a co-emperor for sixty-three years but had always been content to enjoy the privileges of imperial status, without concerning himself with state affairs.<ref>{{ODB|last=Brand|first=Charles M.|last2=Cutler|first2=Anthony|title=Constantine VIII|pages=503\u2013504}}</ref> He spent his life in the search of pleasure and entertainment, or amusing himself with riding and hunting. He was \"of frivolous disposition, he desired nothing more than to pass his life wallowing in extravagant pleasures.\"{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=265}} Constantine as emperor carried on as he always had \u2013 hunting, feasting, and enjoying life \u2013 and avoided state business as much as possible.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=265}}\n\nBy the time he became emperor he had chronic gout and could hardly walk. He met challenges with impulsive cruelty, persecuting the nobility and ordering an orgy of torture; [[political mutilation in Byzantine culture|blinding]] was a favoured punishment for crimes real or imagined. He filled the senior court and state positions with nonentities. Within months the land laws of Basil&nbsp;II were dropped, under pressure from the [[Anatolia]]n aristocracy. \"Devoid of any semblance of moral fibre\"{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=268}} he would grant any concession.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=268}} Favouritism failed to win him friends and he persecuted the nobility when he felt threatened by conspiracy. The start of the decline of the Byzantine Empire has been linked to Constantine's accession to the throne.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=283}} His reign has been described as \"an unmitigated disaster\", \"a break up of the system\" and causing \"a collapse of the military power of the Empire\".{{sfn|Norwich|1991|pp=283, 268}}{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1957|p=264}}\n\n[[File:Miliaresion-Romanus III-sb1822.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Miliaresion]]'' of Romanos III. On the reverse is the [[Virgin Mary]] holding the infant [[Christ]].]]\nHe ruled for less than three years before his death on 11 November 1028. On his deathbed, and without a male heir, Constantine recalled the senior aristocrat [[Constantine Dalassenos (duke of Antioch)|Constantine Dalessenos, Duke of Antioch]], to the capital in order to marry his daughter Zo\u00eb. The Dalassenus were one of the few powerful patrician families who had been unswervingly loyal to the Macedonian dynasty.{{sfn|Norwich|1991|p=269}} Constantine Dalassenos set out from his estates in the [[Armeniac Theme]], but before reaching [[Constantinople]] the situation changed: the emperor's advisors preferred a weak ruler whom they could control, and, typically, Constantine was persuaded. He choose [[Romanos III Argyros|Romanos Argyros]] instead, forcing him to divorce his wife and marry Zo\u00eb. The wedding took place only three days before Constantine died on 11 November 1028.

{"title_page": "Mobile banking", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Banking |expanded=terms}}\n'''Mobile banking''' is a service provided by a [[bank]] or other [[financial institution]] that allows its customers to conduct [[financial transaction]]s remotely using a [[mobile device]] such as a [[smartphone]] or [[tablet computer|tablet]]. Unlike the related [[internet banking]] it uses software, usually called an [[Mobile app|app]], provided by the financial institution for the purpose.  Mobile banking is usually available on a 24-hour basis.  Some financial institutions have restrictions on which accounts may be accessed through mobile banking, as well as a limit on the amount that can be transacted. Mobile banking is dependent on the availability of an internet or data connection to the mobile device.\n \nTransactions through mobile banking depend on the features of the mobile banking app provided and typically includes obtaining account balances and lists of latest transactions, [[electronic bill payment]]s, remote check deposits, [[Peer-to-peer banking|P2P payments]], and [[giro|funds transfer]]s between a customer's or another's [[deposit account|account]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pB_6qEL5ppkC&pg=PA22|title=Mobile Banking|last=BBVA|publisher=Centro de Innovaci\u00f3n BBVA|page=22|language=en}}</ref> Some apps also enable copies of statements to be downloaded and sometimes printed at the customer's premises. Using a mobile banking app increases ease of use, speed, flexibility and also improves security because it integrates with the user built-in mobile device security mechanisms.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n \nFrom the bank's point of view, mobile banking reduces the cost of handling transactions by reducing the need for customers to visit a [[Branch (banking)|bank branch]] for non-cash withdrawal and deposit transactions. Mobile banking does not handle transactions involving cash, and a customer needs to visit an [[automated teller machine|ATM]] or bank branch for cash withdrawals or deposits.  Many apps now have a [[remote deposit]] option; using the device's [[Camera phone|camera]] to digitally transmit cheques to their financial institution.\n \nMobile banking differs from [[mobile payment]]s, which involves the use of a mobile device to pay for goods or services either at the [[point of sale]] or remotely,<ref>[http://www.kpmg.com/GE/en/Insightmagazine/Documents/Monetizing_mobile_report_ENG.pdf/ KPMG \"Monetizing Mobile\" July 2011]</ref> analogously to the use of a debit or credit card to effect an [[EFTPOS]] payment.\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest mobile banking services used [[SMS]], a service known as [[SMS banking]]. With the introduction of [[smart phones]] with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] support enabling the use of the [[mobile web]] in 1999, the first European banks started to offer mobile banking on this platform to their customers.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.itavisen.no/237581/verdens-forste-wap-bank-fra-norge |title = The World's first WAP Bank is Norwegian |publisher = itavisen.no |date = 24 September 1999 |accessdate = 18 October 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110504023854/http://www.itavisen.no/237581/verdens-forste-wap-bank-fra-norge |archivedate = 4 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nMobile banking before 2010 was most often performed via SMS or the [[mobile web]].  [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] initial success with [[iPhone]] and the rapid growth of phones based on [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)]] have led to increasing use of special [[mobile app]]s, downloaded to the mobile device.  With that said, advancements in web technologies such as [[HTML5]], [[CSS3]] and [[JavaScript]] have seen more banks launching mobile web based services to complement native applications. These applications are consisted of a [[web application]] module in [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] such as [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|J2EE]] and functions of another module [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|J2ME]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving: SocProS 2014, Volume 2|last=Das|first=Kedar|last2=Deep|first2=Kusum|last3=Pant|first3=Millie|last4=Bansal|first4=Jagdish|last5=Nagar|first5=Atulya|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9788132222194|location=Heidelberg|pages=377}}</ref>\n\nA recent study (May 2012) by Mapa Research suggests that over a third of banks<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.maparesearch.com/news/article/how-the-banks-handle-mobile-detection |title = A third of banks have mobile detection |publisher = Mapa Research |date = 16 May 2012 |accessdate = 16 May 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130128181645/http://www.maparesearch.com/news/article/how-the-banks-handle-mobile-detection |archivedate = 28 January 2013}}</ref> have mobile device detection upon visiting the banks' main website. A number of things can happen on mobile detection such as redirecting to an app store, redirection to a mobile banking specific website or providing a menu of mobile banking options for the user to choose from.\n\n== A mobile banking conceptual ==\nIn one academic model,<ref>Tiwari and Buse, 2007, p. 73-74</ref> mobile banking is defined as:\n<blockquote>\nMobile Banking refers to provision and availment of banking- and financial services with the help of mobile telecommunication devices.The scope of offered services may include facilities to conduct bank and stock market transactions, to administer accounts and to access customised information.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to this model mobile banking can be said to consist of three inter-related concepts:\n\n* Mobile accounting\n* Mobile financial information services\n\nMost services in the categories designated ''[[accounting]]'' and ''[[brokerage]]'' are transaction-based. The non-transaction-based services of an informational nature are however essential for conducting transactions \u2013 for instance, balance inquiries might be needed before committing a money remittance. The accounting and brokerage services are therefore offered invariably in combination with information services. Information services, on the other hand, may be offered as an independent module.'''\n\nMobile banking may also be used to help in business situations as well as for financial situation\n\n== Mobile banking services ==\nTypical mobile banking services may include:\n\n===Account information===\n# Mini-statements and checking of account history\n# Alerts on account activity or passing of set thresholds\n# Monitoring of [[term deposits]]\n# Access to loan statements\n# Access to [[Card statement|card statements]]\n# [[Mutual fund]]s / equity statements\n#[[Insurance policy]] management\n\n===Transaction===\n# [[Giro|Funds transfers]] between the customer's linked accounts\n# Paying third parties, including [[Electronic bill payment|bill payments]] and third party [[Electronic fund transfer|fund transfers]](see, e.g., [[Fast And Secure Transfers|FAST]]) \n# [[Remote deposit|Check Remote Deposit]]\n\n===Investments===\n#[[Portfolio manager|Portfolio management]] services\n# Real-time stock\n\n===Support===\n# Status of requests for credit, including mortgage approval, and insurance coverage\n# Check (cheque) book and card requests\n# Exchange of data messages and email, including complaint submission and tracking\n# ATM Location\n\n===Content services===\n# General information such as finance related news\n# [[Loyalty program|Loyalty-related]] offers\n# [[Location-based service]]s\n\nA report by the US Federal Reserve (March 2012) found that 21 percent of mobile phone owners had used mobile banking in the past 12 months.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/mobile-device-report-201203.pdf Federal Reserve Board, \"Consumers and Mobile Financial Services,\" March 2012]</ref> Based on a survey conducted by Forrester, mobile banking will be attractive mainly to the younger, more \"tech-savvy\" customer segment. A third of mobile phone users say that they may consider performing some kind of financial transaction through their mobile phone. But most of the users are interested in performing basic transactions such as querying for account balance and making bill.\n\n==Challenges for a mobile banking solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}}==\n\nKey challenges in developing a sophisticated mobile banking application are :\n\n===Handset accessibility===\n\nThere are a large number of different mobile phone devices and it is a big challenge for banks to offer a mobile banking solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} on any type of device. Some of these devices support [[Java ME]] and others support [[SIM Application Toolkit]], a WAP browser, or only [[SMS]].\n\nInitial interoperability issues however have been localized, with countries like India using portals like \"R-World\" to enable the limitations of low end java based phones, while focus on areas such as South Africa have defaulted to the [[USSD]] as a basis of communication achievable with any phone.\n\nThe desire for interoperability is largely dependent on the banks themselves, where installed applications(Java based or native) provide better security, are easier to use and allow development of more complex capabilities similar to those of internet banking while SMS can provide the basics but becomes difficult to operate with more complex transactions.\n\nThere is a myth that there is a challenge of interoperability between mobile banking applications due to perceived lack of common technology standards for mobile banking. In practice it is too early in the service lifecycle for interoperability to be addressed within an individual country, as very few countries have more than one mobile banking service provider. In practice, banking interfaces are well defined and money movements between banks follow the IS0-8583 standard. As mobile banking matures, money movements between service providers will naturally adopt the same standards as in the banking world.\n\nIn January 2009, [[Mobile Marketing Association]] (MMA) Banking Sub-Committee, chaired by CellTrust and VeriSign Inc., published the Mobile Banking Overview for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Mobile Channel Platforms such as Short Message Services ([[SMS]]), Mobile Web, Mobile Client Applications, SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127044330/http://mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Security===\n\nAs with most internet-connected devices, as well as mobile-telephony devices, [[cybercrime]] rates are escalating year-on-year. The types of cybercrimes which may affect mobile-banking might range from unauthorized use while the owner is using the mobile banking, to remote-hacking, or even jamming or interference via the internet or telephone network data streams. This is demonstrated by the [[malware]] called ''SMSZombie.A'', which infected Chinese Android devices. It was embedded in wallpaper apps and installed itself so it can exploit the weaknesses of China Mobile SMS Payment system, stealing banks credit card numbers and information linked to financial transactions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Automated Enterprise Systems for Maximizing Business Performance|last=Papajorgji|first=Petraq|last2=Pinet|first2=Francois|last3=Guimaraes|first3=Alaine|last4=Papathanasiou|first4=Jason|publisher=IGI Global|year=2015|isbn=9781466688414|location=Hershey, PA|pages=7}}</ref> One of the most advanced malwares discovered recently was the [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] called ''Bankbot''. It went past Google's protections in its Android app marketplace and targeted [[Wells Fargo]], [[Chase Bank|Chase]], and [[Citibank]] customers on Android devices worldwide before its removal by Google in September 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/bankbot-android-malware-sneaks-into-the-google-play-store-for-the-third-time/|title=BankBot Android malware sneaks into the Google Play Store \u2013 for the third time {{!}} ZDNet|last=Palmer|first=Danny|work=ZDNet|access-date=3 October 2018|language=en}}</ref> This malicious app was activated when users opened a banking app, overlaying it so it can steal banking credentials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://digitalguardian.com/blog/mobile-banking-trojan-bankbot-identified-removed-google-play|title=Mobile Banking Trojan BankBot Identified, Removed From Google Play|last=Brook|first=Chris|date=21 November 2017|work=Digital Guardian|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> \n{{see also|Mobile security}}In the banking world, currency rates may change by the millisecond.\nSecurity of financial transactions, being executed from some remote location and transmission of financial information over the air, are the most complicated challenges that need to be addressed jointly by mobile application developers, wireless network service providers and the banks' IT departments.\n\nThe following aspects need to be addressed to offer a secure infrastructure for financial transaction over wireless network:\n\n# Physical part of the hand-held device. If the bank is offering smart-card based security, the physical security of the device is more important.\n# Security of any thick-client application running on the device. In case the device is stolen, the hacker should require at least an ID/Password to access the application.\n# [[Authentication]] of the device with service provider before initiating a transaction. This would ensure that unauthorized devices are not connected to perform financial transactions.\n# User ID / Password [[authentication]] of bank's customer.\n# [[Encryption]] of the data being transmitted over the air.\n# [[Encryption]] of the data that will be stored in device for later / off-line analysis by the customer.\n\n[[One-time password]] (OTPs) are the latest tool used by financial and banking service providers in the fight against [[cyber fraud]].<ref name=\"otp\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104955/http://www.mobilepaymentsworld.com/mobile-payments/issue-pdfs/MPW_Q1_07_screen.pdf], Mobile payments</ref> Instead of relying on traditional memorized passwords, OTPs are requested by consumers each time they want to perform transactions using the online or mobile banking interface. When the request is received the password is sent to the consumer's phone via SMS. The password is expired once it has been used or once its scheduled life-cycle has expired.\n\nBecause of the concerns made explicit above, it is extremely important that [[SMS gateway]] providers can provide a decent quality of service for banks and financial institutions in regards to [[SMS]] services. Therefore, the provision of [[service level agreements]] (SLAs) is a requirement for this industry; it is necessary to give the bank customer delivery guarantees of all messages, as well as measurements on the speed of delivery, throughput, etc. SLAs give the service parameters in which a messaging solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} is guaranteed to perform.\n\n===Scalability and reliability===\nAnother challenge for the [[chief information officer|CIO]]s and [[chief technical officer|CTO]]s of the banks is to scale-up the mobile banking infrastructure to handle exponential growth of the customer base. With mobile banking, the customer may be sitting in any part of the world (true anytime, anywhere banking) and hence banks need to ensure that the systems are up and running in a true 24&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7 fashion. As customers will find mobile banking more and more useful, their expectations from the solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} will increase. Banks unable to meet the performance and reliability expectations may lose customer confidence. There are systems such as [[Mobile Transaction Platform]] which allow quick and secure mobile enabling of various banking services. Recently in India there has been a phenomenal growth in the use of Mobile Banking applications, with leading banks adopting Mobile Transaction Platform and the [[Reserve Bank of India|Central Bank]] publishing guidelines for mobile banking operations.\n\n===Application distribution===\nDue to the nature of the connectivity between bank and its customers, it would be impractical to expect customers to regularly visit banks or connect to a web site for regular upgrade of their mobile banking application. It will be expected that the mobile application itself check the upgrades and updates and download necessary patches (so called \"Over The Air\" updates). However, there could be many issues to implement this approach such as upgrade / synchronization of other dependent components.\n\nStudies have shown that a huge concerning factor of having mobile banking more widely used, is a banking customer's unwillingness to adapt. Many consumers, whether they are misinformed or not, do not want to begin using mobile banking for several reasons. These can include the learning curve associated with new technology, having fears about possible security compromises, just simply not wanting to start using technology, etc.\n\n===Personalization===\n\nIt would be expected from the mobile application to support personalization such as :\n# Preferred Language\n# Date / Time format\n# Amount format\n# Default transactions\n# Standard Beneficiary list\n# Alerts\n\n== Mobile banking in the world ==\n{{See also|List of countries by mobile banking usage}}\nThis is a list of countries by mobile banking usage as measured by the percentage of people who had non-SMS mobile banking transactions in the previous three months.

This aspect of [[mobile commerce]] is also popular in countries where most of their population is [[unbanked]]. In most of these places, banks can only be found in big cities, and customers have to travel hundreds of miles to the nearest bank.\n\nIn Iran, banks such as [[Parsian Bank|Parsian]], [[Tejarat Bank|Tejarat]], [[Bank Pasargad|Pasargad Bank]], [[Mellat Bank|Mellat]], Saderat, [[Sepah Bank|Sepah]], Edbi, and Bankmelli offer the service. Banco Industrial provides the service in Guatemala.  Citizens of Mexico can access mobile banking with Omnilife, [[Bancomer]] and MPower Venture.\n[[Kenya]]'s [[Safaricom]] (part of the [[Vodafone Group]]) has the [[M-Pesa]] Service, which is mainly used to transfer limited amounts of money, but increasingly used to pay utility bills as well. In 2009, [[Zain Group|Zain]] launched their own mobile money transfer business, known as ZAP, in Kenya and other African countries. Several other players in Kenya such as Tangerine, [[MobiKash]] and [[Funtrench Limited]] also have network-independent mobile money transfer. In [[Somalia]], the many telecom companies provide mobile banking, the most prominent being [[Hormuud Telecom]] and its [[Hormuud Telecom#ZAAD service|ZAAD]] service.\n\n[[Telenor Pakistan]] has also launched a mobile banking solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}}, in coordination with Taameer Bank, under the label Easy Paisa, which was begun in Q4 2009.  [[Eko India Financial Services]], the business correspondent of [[State Bank of India]] (SBI) and [[ICICI Bank]], provides bank accounts, deposit, withdrawal and remittance services, [[micro-insurance]], and [[micro-finance]] facilities to its customers (nearly 80% of whom are migrants or the unbanked section of the population) through mobile banking.<ref name=\"ny\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/opinion/03friedman.html?_r=3&hp|title=Do Believe the Hype|last=Friedman|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Friedman|date=2 November 2010|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn a year of 2010, mobile banking users soared over 100 percent in [[Kenya]], China, [[Brazil]] and United States with 200 percent, 150 percent, 110 percent and 100 percent respectively.<ref>[http://www.cellular-news.com/story/49148.php Mobile Banking Surges As Emerging Markets Embrace Mobile Finance]</ref>\n\n[[Dutch Bangla Bank]] launched the very first mobile banking service in [[Bangladesh]] on 31 March 2011.

Under the service, any mobile handset with subscription to any of the six existing mobile operators of Bangladesh would be able to utilize the service. Under the mobile banking services, bank-nominated [[Banking agent]] performs banking activities on its behalf, like opening mobile banking accounts, providing cash services (receipts and payments) and dealing with small credits. Cash withdrawal from a mobile account can also be done from an ATM validating each transaction by 'mobile phone & PIN' instead of 'card & PIN'. Other services that are being delivered through mobile banking system are person-to-person (e.g. fund transfer), person-to-business (e.g. merchant payment, utility bill payment), business-to-person (e.g. salary/commission disbursement), government-to-person (disbursement of government allowance) transactions.\n\nIn May 2012, [[Laxmi Bank Limited]] launched the very first mobile banking in [[Nepal]] with its product [[Mobile Khata]]. Mobile Khata currently runs on a third-party platform called [[Hello Paisa]] that is interoperable with all the telecoms in Nepal viz.

Unlike the related [[internet banking]] it uses software, usually called an [[Mobile app|app]], provided by the financial institution for the purpose.  Mobile banking is usually available on a 24-hour basis.  Some financial institutions have restrictions on which accounts may be accessed through mobile banking, as well as a limit on the amount that can be transacted. Mobile banking is dependent on the availability of an internet or data connection to the mobile device.\n \nTransactions through mobile banking depend on the features of the mobile banking app provided and typically includes obtaining account balances and lists of latest transactions, [[electronic bill payment]]s, remote check deposits, [[Peer-to-peer banking|P2P payments]], and [[giro|funds transfer]]s between a customer's or another's [[deposit account|account]]s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pB_6qEL5ppkC&pg=PA22|title=Mobile Banking|last=BBVA|publisher=Centro de Innovaci\u00f3n BBVA|page=22|language=en}}</ref> Some apps also enable copies of statements to be downloaded and sometimes printed at the customer's premises. Using a mobile banking app increases ease of use, speed, flexibility and also improves security because it integrates with the user built-in mobile device security mechanisms.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n \nFrom the bank's point of view, mobile banking reduces the cost of handling transactions by reducing the need for customers to visit a [[Branch (banking)|bank branch]] for non-cash withdrawal and deposit transactions. Mobile banking does not handle transactions involving cash, and a customer needs to visit an [[automated teller machine|ATM]] or bank branch for cash withdrawals or deposits.  Many apps now have a [[remote deposit]] option; using the device's [[Camera phone|camera]] to digitally transmit cheques to their financial institution.\n \nMobile banking differs from [[mobile payment]]s, which involves the use of a mobile device to pay for goods or services either at the [[point of sale]] or remotely,<ref>[http://www.kpmg.com/GE/en/Insightmagazine/Documents/Monetizing_mobile_report_ENG.pdf/ KPMG \"Monetizing Mobile\" July 2011]</ref> analogously to the use of a debit or credit card to effect an [[EFTPOS]] payment.\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest mobile banking services used [[SMS]], a service known as [[SMS banking]]. With the introduction of [[smart phones]] with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] support enabling the use of the [[mobile web]] in 1999, the first European banks started to offer mobile banking on this platform to their customers.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.itavisen.no/237581/verdens-forste-wap-bank-fra-norge |title = The World's first WAP Bank is Norwegian |publisher = itavisen.no |date = 24 September 1999 |accessdate = 18 October 2010 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110504023854/http://www.itavisen.no/237581/verdens-forste-wap-bank-fra-norge |archivedate = 4 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nMobile banking before 2010 was most often performed via SMS or the [[mobile web]].  [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] initial success with [[iPhone]] and the rapid growth of phones based on [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)]] have led to increasing use of special [[mobile app]]s, downloaded to the mobile device.  With that said, advancements in web technologies such as [[HTML5]], [[CSS3]] and [[JavaScript]] have seen more banks launching mobile web based services to complement native applications. These applications are consisted of a [[web application]] module in [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]] such as [[Java Platform, Enterprise Edition|J2EE]] and functions of another module [[Java Platform, Micro Edition|J2ME]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of Fourth International Conference on Soft Computing for Problem Solving: SocProS 2014, Volume 2|last=Das|first=Kedar|last2=Deep|first2=Kusum|last3=Pant|first3=Millie|last4=Bansal|first4=Jagdish|last5=Nagar|first5=Atulya|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9788132222194|location=Heidelberg|pages=377}}</ref>\n\nA recent study (May 2012) by Mapa Research suggests that over a third of banks<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.maparesearch.com/news/article/how-the-banks-handle-mobile-detection |title = A third of banks have mobile detection |publisher = Mapa Research |date = 16 May 2012 |accessdate = 16 May 2012 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130128181645/http://www.maparesearch.com/news/article/how-the-banks-handle-mobile-detection |archivedate = 28 January 2013}}</ref> have mobile device detection upon visiting the banks' main website. A number of things can happen on mobile detection such as redirecting to an app store, redirection to a mobile banking specific website or providing a menu of mobile banking options for the user to choose from.\n\n== A mobile banking conceptual ==\nIn one academic model,<ref>Tiwari and Buse, 2007, p. 73-74</ref> mobile banking is defined as:\n<blockquote>\nMobile Banking refers to provision and availment of banking- and financial services with the help of mobile telecommunication devices.The scope of offered services may include facilities to conduct bank and stock market transactions, to administer accounts and to access customised information.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to this model mobile banking can be said to consist of three inter-related concepts:\n\n* Mobile accounting\n* Mobile financial information services\n\nMost services in the categories designated ''[[accounting]]'' and ''[[brokerage]]'' are transaction-based. The non-transaction-based services of an informational nature are however essential for conducting transactions \u2013 for instance, balance inquiries might be needed before committing a money remittance. The accounting and brokerage services are therefore offered invariably in combination with information services. Information services, on the other hand, may be offered as an independent module.'''\n\nMobile banking may also be used to help in business situations as well as for financial situation\n\n== Mobile banking services ==\nTypical mobile banking services may include:\n\n===Account information===\n# Mini-statements and checking of account history\n# Alerts on account activity or passing of set thresholds\n# Monitoring of [[term deposits]]\n# Access to loan statements\n# Access to [[Card statement|card statements]]\n# [[Mutual fund]]s / equity statements\n#[[Insurance policy]] management\n\n===Transaction===\n# [[Giro|Funds transfers]] between the customer's linked accounts\n# Paying third parties, including [[Electronic bill payment|bill payments]] and third party [[Electronic fund transfer|fund transfers]](see, e.g., [[Fast And Secure Transfers|FAST]]) \n# [[Remote deposit|Check Remote Deposit]]\n\n===Investments===\n#[[Portfolio manager|Portfolio management]] services\n# Real-time stock\n\n===Support===\n# Status of requests for credit, including mortgage approval, and insurance coverage\n# Check (cheque) book and card requests\n# Exchange of data messages and email, including complaint submission and tracking\n# ATM Location\n\n===Content services===\n# General information such as finance related news\n# [[Loyalty program|Loyalty-related]] offers\n# [[Location-based service]]s\n\nA report by the US Federal Reserve (March 2012) found that 21 percent of mobile phone owners had used mobile banking in the past 12 months.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/mobile-device-report-201203.pdf Federal Reserve Board, \"Consumers and Mobile Financial Services,\" March 2012]</ref> Based on a survey conducted by Forrester, mobile banking will be attractive mainly to the younger, more \"tech-savvy\" customer segment. A third of mobile phone users say that they may consider performing some kind of financial transaction through their mobile phone. But most of the users are interested in performing basic transactions such as querying for account balance and making bill.\n\n==Challenges for a mobile banking solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}}==\n\nKey challenges in developing a sophisticated mobile banking application are :\n\n===Handset accessibility===\n\nThere are a large number of different mobile phone devices and it is a big challenge for banks to offer a mobile banking solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} on any type of device. Some of these devices support [[Java ME]] and others support [[SIM Application Toolkit]], a WAP browser, or only [[SMS]].\n\nInitial interoperability issues however have been localized, with countries like India using portals like \"R-World\" to enable the limitations of low end java based phones, while focus on areas such as South Africa have defaulted to the [[USSD]] as a basis of communication achievable with any phone.\n\nThe desire for interoperability is largely dependent on the banks themselves, where installed applications(Java based or native) provide better security, are easier to use and allow development of more complex capabilities similar to those of internet banking while SMS can provide the basics but becomes difficult to operate with more complex transactions.\n\nThere is a myth that there is a challenge of interoperability between mobile banking applications due to perceived lack of common technology standards for mobile banking. In practice it is too early in the service lifecycle for interoperability to be addressed within an individual country, as very few countries have more than one mobile banking service provider. In practice, banking interfaces are well defined and money movements between banks follow the IS0-8583 standard. As mobile banking matures, money movements between service providers will naturally adopt the same standards as in the banking world.\n\nIn January 2009, [[Mobile Marketing Association]] (MMA) Banking Sub-Committee, chaired by CellTrust and VeriSign Inc., published the Mobile Banking Overview for financial institutions in which it discussed the advantages and disadvantages of Mobile Channel Platforms such as Short Message Services ([[SMS]]), Mobile Web, Mobile Client Applications, SMS with Mobile Web and Secure SMS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=9 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127044330/http://mmaglobal.com/mbankingoverview.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010  }}</ref>\n\n===Security===\n\nAs with most internet-connected devices, as well as mobile-telephony devices, [[cybercrime]] rates are escalating year-on-year. The types of cybercrimes which may affect mobile-banking might range from unauthorized use while the owner is using the mobile banking, to remote-hacking, or even jamming or interference via the internet or telephone network data streams. This is demonstrated by the [[malware]] called ''SMSZombie.A'', which infected Chinese Android devices. It was embedded in wallpaper apps and installed itself so it can exploit the weaknesses of China Mobile SMS Payment system, stealing banks credit card numbers and information linked to financial transactions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Automated Enterprise Systems for Maximizing Business Performance|last=Papajorgji|first=Petraq|last2=Pinet|first2=Francois|last3=Guimaraes|first3=Alaine|last4=Papathanasiou|first4=Jason|publisher=IGI Global|year=2015|isbn=9781466688414|location=Hershey, PA|pages=7}}</ref> One of the most advanced malwares discovered recently was the [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan]] called ''Bankbot''. It went past Google's protections in its Android app marketplace and targeted [[Wells Fargo]], [[Chase Bank|Chase]], and [[Citibank]] customers on Android devices worldwide before its removal by Google in September 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/bankbot-android-malware-sneaks-into-the-google-play-store-for-the-third-time/|title=BankBot Android malware sneaks into the Google Play Store \u2013 for the third time {{!}} ZDNet|last=Palmer|first=Danny|work=ZDNet|access-date=3 October 2018|language=en}}</ref> This malicious app was activated when users opened a banking app, overlaying it so it can steal banking credentials.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://digitalguardian.com/blog/mobile-banking-trojan-bankbot-identified-removed-google-play|title=Mobile Banking Trojan BankBot Identified, Removed From Google Play|last=Brook|first=Chris|date=21 November 2017|work=Digital Guardian|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref> \n{{see also|Mobile security}}In the banking world, currency rates may change by the millisecond.\nSecurity of financial transactions, being executed from some remote location and transmission of financial information over the air, are the most complicated challenges that need to be addressed jointly by mobile application developers, wireless network service providers and the banks' IT departments.\n\nThe following aspects need to be addressed to offer a secure infrastructure for financial transaction over wireless network :\n\n# Physical part of the hand-held device. If the bank is offering smart-card based security, the physical security of the device is more important.\n# Security of any thick-client application running on the device. In case the device is stolen, the hacker should require at least an ID/Password to access the application.\n# [[Authentication]] of the device with service provider before initiating a transaction. This would ensure that unauthorized devices are not connected to perform financial transactions.\n# User ID / Password [[authentication]] of bank's customer.\n# [[Encryption]] of the data being transmitted over the air.\n# [[Encryption]] of the data that will be stored in device for later / off-line analysis by the customer.\n\n[[One-time password]] (OTPs) are the latest tool used by financial and banking service providers in the fight against [[cyber fraud]].<ref name=\"otp\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714104955/http://www.mobilepaymentsworld.com/mobile-payments/issue-pdfs/MPW_Q1_07_screen.pdf], Mobile payments</ref> Instead of relying on traditional memorized passwords, OTPs are requested by consumers each time they want to perform transactions using the online or mobile banking interface. When the request is received the password is sent to the consumer's phone via SMS. The password is expired once it has been used or once its scheduled life-cycle has expired.\n\nBecause of the concerns made explicit above, it is extremely important that [[SMS gateway]] providers can provide a decent quality of service for banks and financial institutions in regards to [[SMS]] services. Therefore, the provision of [[service level agreements]] (SLAs) is a requirement for this industry; it is necessary to give the bank customer delivery guarantees of all messages, as well as measurements on the speed of delivery, throughput, etc. SLAs give the service parameters in which a messaging solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} is guaranteed to perform.\n\n===Scalability and reliability===\nAnother challenge for the [[chief information officer|CIO]]s and [[chief technical officer|CTO]]s of the banks is to scale-up the mobile banking infrastructure to handle exponential growth of the customer base. With mobile banking, the customer may be sitting in any part of the world (true anytime, anywhere banking) and hence banks need to ensure that the systems are up and running in a true 24&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;7 fashion. As customers will find mobile banking more and more useful, their expectations from the solution{{solution-inline|date=August 2019}} will increase. Banks unable to meet the performance and reliability expectations may lose customer confidence. There are systems such as [[Mobile Transaction Platform]] which allow quick and secure mobile enabling of various banking services. Recently in India there has been a phenomenal growth in the use of Mobile Banking applications, with leading banks adopting Mobile Transaction Platform and the [[Reserve Bank of India|Central Bank]] publishing guidelines for mobile banking operations.\n\n===Application distribution===\nDue to the nature of the connectivity between bank and its customers, it would be impractical to expect customers to regularly visit banks or connect to a web site for regular upgrade of their mobile banking application. It will be expected that the mobile application itself check the upgrades and updates and download necessary patches (so called \"Over The Air\" updates). However, there could be many issues to implement this approach such as upgrade / synchronization of other dependent components.\n\nStudies have shown that a huge concerning factor of having mobile banking more widely used, is a banking customer's unwillingness to adapt. Many consumers, whether they are misinformed or not, do not want to begin using mobile banking for several reasons. These can include the learning curve associated with new technology, having fears about possible security compromises, just simply not wanting to start using technology, etc.\n\n===Personalization===\n\nIt would be expected from the mobile application to support personalization such as :\n# Preferred Language\n# Date / Time format\n# Amount format\n# Default transactions\n# Standard Beneficiary list\n# Alerts\n\n== Mobile banking in the world ==\n{{See also|List of countries by mobile banking usage}}\nThis is a list of countries by mobile banking usage as measured by the percentage of people who had non-SMS mobile banking transactions in the previous three months.

This aspect of [[mobile commerce]] is also popular in countries where most of their population is [[unbanked]]. In most of these places, banks can only be found in big cities, and customers have to travel hundreds of miles to the nearest bank.\n\nIn Iran, banks such as [[Parsian Bank|Parsian]], [[Tejarat Bank|Tejarat]], [[Bank Pasargad|Pasargad Bank]], [[Mellat Bank|Mellat]], Saderat, [[Sepah Bank|Sepah]], Edbi, and Bankmelli offer the service. Banco Industrial provides the service in Guatemala.  Citizens of Mexico can access mobile banking with Omnilife, [[Bancomer]] and MPower Venture.\n[[Kenya]]'s [[Safaricom]] (part of the [[Vodafone Group]]) has the [[M-Pesa]] Service, which is mainly used to transfer limited amounts of money, but increasingly used to pay utility bills as well. In 2009, [[Zain Group|Zain]] launched their own mobile money transfer business, known as ZAP, in Kenya and other African countries.
