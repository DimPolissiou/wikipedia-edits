The condition may also make [[sexual intercourse]] painful and/or difficult, though it is unclear whether some men report satisfactory or unsatisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It can affect men of any race and age. The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie's exhibit concurrent [[connective tissue disorders]] in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie's disease develop [[fibrosis]] in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including [[Dupuytren's contracture]] of the hand. An increased incidence in genetically related males suggests a genetic component.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Carrieri MP, Serraino D, Palmiotto F, Nucci G, Sasso F |title=A case-control study on risk factors for Peyronie's disease |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=511\u20135 |date=June 1998  |pmid=9636000 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(98)00015-8}}</ref>\n===Psychosocial===\nPeyronie's disease can also have psychological effects.

The condition may also make [[sexual intercourse]] painful and/or difficult, though it is unclear whether some men report satisfactory or unsatisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It can affect men of any race and age. The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie's exhibit concurrent [[connective tissue disorders]] in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie's disease develop [[fibrosis]] in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including [[Dupuytren's contracture]] of the hand.

When doing so, the result is called the ''[[classical limit]]''.\n[[File:Black body.svg|thumb|250px|Classical physics ([[Rayleigh\u2013Jeans law]], black line) failed to explain [[black-body radiation]] \u2013 the so-called [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]. The quantum description ([[Planck's law]], colored lines) is said to be ''modern physics''.]]\n{{Cquote|The term \"modern physics\", taken literally, means of course, the ''sum total'' of knowledge under the head of present-day physics. In this sense, the physics of 1890 is still modern; very few statements made in a good physics text of 1890 would need to be deleted today as untrue...<br /><br />On the other hand... there have been enormous advances in physics, and some of these advances have brought into question, or have directly contradicted, certain theories that had seemed to be strongly supported by the experimental evidence.<br /><br />For example, few, if any physicists in 1890 questioned the [[Light#Wave theory|wave theory of light]]. Its triumphs over the old [[Corpuscular theory of light|corpuscular theory]] seemed to be final and complete, particularly after the brilliant [[Heinrich Hertz#Electromagnetic research|experiments of Hertz]], in 1887, which demonstrated, beyond doubt, the fundamental soundness of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light]]. And yet... these very experiments of Hertz brought to light a new phenomenon\u2014the [[photoelectric effect]]\u2014which played an important part in establishing the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]]. The latter theory... is diametrically opposed to the wave theory of light; indeed, the reconciliation of these two theories... was one of the great problems of the first quarter of the twentieth century.\n|4= [[Floyd K.
