A special unit within 848 Squadron, M Flight, was tasked with supporting the [[Special Boat Service]] (SBS) in their operations. 848 NAS disbanded in 2013 but then reformed on 1 May 2015 to continue operating the Sea Kings, maintaining operational capability within the CHF while 845 NAS converted to the Merlin, until the Sea King reached its planned out of service date on 31 March 2016.<ref name=\"forces.tv\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/news/848-nas-awarded-the-bambara-flight-safety-shield|title=848 NAS awarded the Bambara flight safety shield|website=www.fleetairarmoa.org}}</ref> 848 NAS disbanded 24 March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/news-and-latest-activity/news/2016/march/24/160324-decommissioning-of-sea-king-848-naval-air-squadron|title=It really is goodbye to the 'old girl' \u2013 Royal Navy|website=www.royalnavy.mod.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\nAircrew, recruited from the Fleet Air Arm and Royal Marines, join the force having completed training in helicopter operations under [[No. 1 Flying Training School RAF|No. 1 Flying Training School]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/local-hubs/north-shropshire/shawbury/2020/02/29/raf-chief-opens-state-of-the-art-helicopter-training-facilities-in-shawbury/|title=https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/local-hubs/north-shropshire/shawbury/2020/02/29/raf-chief-opens-state-of-the-art-helicopter-training-facilities-in-shawbury/|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> at [[RAF Shawbury]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/uk-mod-begins-training-helicopter-acquisition-403559/ |title=UK MoD begins training helicopter acquisition|date= 10 September 2014|publisher=Flight Global|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/fleet-air-arm/support-and-training/commando-helicopter-force-headquarters Royal Navy \u2013 Commando Helicopter Force]\n*[http://www.fleetairarmoa.org/gallery-commando-helicopter-force Fleet Air Arm Association \u2013 Commando Helicopter Force]\n\n[[Category:Royal Marine formations and units]]\n[[Category:Naval aviation units and formations of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1997]]\n", "name_user": "Kahtar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Repair CS1 error(s), replaced: website=www. \u2192 website= (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Helicopter_Force"}

Using Raleigh as their brand name, it is one of the oldest bicycle companies in the world. After being acquired by [[Sir Frank Bowden, 1st Baronet|Frank Bowden]] in December 1888, it became The Raleigh Cycle Company, which was registered as a limited liability company in January 1889.  By 1913, it was the largest bicycle manufacturing company in the world. From 1921 to 1935, Raleigh also produced motorcycles and three-wheel cars, leading to the formation of [[Reliant Motors]].  Raleigh bicycle is now a division of the Dutch corporation [[Accell]].\n\nIn 2006, the [[Raleigh Chopper]] was named in the list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the [[BBC]] and the [[Design Museum]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe history of Raleigh bicycles started in 1885, when Richard Morriss Woodhead from [[Sherwood Forest]], and Paul Eugene Louis Angois, a French citizen, set up a small bicycle workshop in Raleigh Street, [[Nottingham]], England. In the spring of that year, they started advertising in the local press. The ''Nottinghamshire Guardian'' of 15 May 1885 printed what was possibly the first Woodhead and Angois classified advertisement.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The classic Raleigh Cycle Company emblem.jpg|thumb|right|The classic Raleigh Cycle Company emblem.]] -->\n[[File:Raleigh 1940s advert.jpg|thumb|right|Raleigh advert from 1940.]]\nNearly two years later, the 11 April 1887 issue of ''[[Nottingham Post|The Nottingham Evening Post]]'' contained a display advertisement for the Raleigh \u2018Safety\u2019 model under the new banner \u2018Woodhead, Angois, and Ellis. Russell Street Cycle Works.\u2019 William Ellis had recently joined the partnership and provided much-needed financial investment. Like Woodhead and Angois, Ellis's background was in the lace industry. He was a lace gasser, a service provider involved in the bleaching and treating of lace, with premises in nearby Clare Street and Glasshouse Street. Thanks to Ellis, the bicycle works had now expanded round the corner from Raleigh Street into former lace works on the adjoining road, Russell Street. By 1888, the company was making about three cycles a week and employed around half a dozen men.<ref name=\"Bowden F 1903, p.8\">Bowden F, \u2018To the Public\u2019, ''The Book of the Raleigh'', Raleigh, Nottingham, 1903, p.8</ref> It was one of 15 bicycle manufacturers based in Nottingham at that time.<ref>Harrison A E, \u2018The Competitiveness of the British Cycle Industry, 1890\u20131914\u2019, ''The Economic History Review'', News Series, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Aug 1969), p.289</ref>\n\n[[Sir Frank Bowden, 1st Baronet|Frank Bowden]], a recent convert to cycling who on medical advice had toured extensively on a tricycle, first saw a Raleigh bicycle in a shop window in [[Queen Victoria Street, London]], about the time that William Ellis's investment in the cycle workshop was beginning to take effect.<ref>\u2018Rutulan\u2019, ''Souvenir of the Raleigh Works'', Raleigh, 1922, p.4</ref> Bowden described how this led to him visiting the Raleigh works:\n\n{{quote|In the early part of 1887, while looking for a good specimen of the then new safety bicycle, I came across a Raleigh in London. Its patent changeable gear and other special features struck me as superior to all the others I had seen, and I purchased one upon which I toured extensively through France, Italy and England during 1887 and 1888. In the autumn of the latter year, happening to pass through Nottingham, and with the idea of, if possible, getting a still more up-to-date machine, I called upon Messrs. Woodhead and Angois, the originators and makers of the Raleigh \u2026<ref name=\"Bowden F 1903, p.8\"/>}}\n\nIt is clear from Frank Bowden's own account that, although he bought a Raleigh \u2018Safety\u2019 in 1887, he did not visit the Raleigh workshop until autumn 1888. That visit led to Bowden replacing Ellis as the partnership's principal investor, though Bowden did not become the outright owner of the firm. He concluded that the company had a profitable future if it promoted its innovative features, increased its output, cut its overhead costs and tailored its products to the individual tastes and preferences of its customers. He bought out William Ellis's share in the firm and was allotted 5,000 \u00a31 shares, while Woodhead and Angois between them held another 5,000 shares.<ref>Lloyd-Jones R & Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, pp.47\u201349</ref>\n\nIn Frank Bowden's own lifetime, Raleigh publicity material stated that the firm was founded in 1888,<ref name=THadland>Hadland T, ''Raleigh: Past and Presence of an Iconic Bicycle Brand'', Cycle Publishing, San Francisco, 2011, fig.8.3</ref> which was when Bowden, as he himself confirmed, first bought into the enterprise. Thus, Raleigh's 30th anniversary was celebrated in 1918.<ref>Hadland T, ''Raleigh: Past and Presence of an Iconic Bicycle Brand'', Cycle Publishing, San Francisco, 2011, p.52</ref> The 1888 foundation date is confirmed by Bowden's great-grandson, Gregory Houston Bowden, who states that Frank Bowden \"began to negotiate with Woodhead and Angois and in December 1888 founded 'The Raleigh Cycle Company'.\"<ref>Bowden GH, ''The Story of the Raleigh Cycle'', Allen, London, 1975, p.16</ref> The December 1888 foundation date is also confirmed by Nottinghamshire Archives.<ref>Dorrington M et al, ''Turning Back the Pages of Raleigh Cycles of Nottingham'', Nottinghamshire County Council, 2007, p.2</ref> In recent years, the Raleigh company has cited 1887 as a foundation date but, whilst this pre-dates Bowden's involvement, the Raleigh brand name was created by Woodhead and Angois and the enterprise can, as demonstrated above, be traced back to 1885.\n[[Image:Raleigh head badge.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Raleigh USA [[head badge]].]]\nThe company established by Bowden in December 1888 was still privately owned with unlimited public liability. In January 1889, it became the first of a series of limited liability companies with Raleigh in its name. It had a nominal capital of \u00a320,000, half of which was provided by Frank Bowden. Paul Angois was appointed director responsible for product design, Richard Woodhead was made director responsible for factory management, and Frank Bowden became chairman and managing director. Some shares were made available to small investors and local businessmen, but take-up was minimal, and Bowden ended up buying most of the public shares. He subsequently supplied virtually all the capital needed to expand the firm.<ref>Lloyd-Jones R & Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, pp.49\u201350</ref>\n\nWhen Frank Bowden got involved with the enterprise, the works comprised three small workshops and a greenhouse. As Woodhead, Angois and Ellis, the firm had expanded round the corner from Raleigh Street into Russell Street, where also stood Clarke's five-storey former lace factory. To enable further expansion of the business, Bowden financed the renting of this property and installation of new machinery.<ref>Lloyd-Jones R & Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, p.50</ref>\n\nUnder Bowden's guidance, Raleigh expanded rapidly. By 1891, the company occupied not only Clarke's factory but also Woodroffe's Factory and Russell Street Mills.<ref>Raleigh catalogue, 1892, p.1</ref> In November 1892, Raleigh signed a tenancy agreement for rooms in Butler's factory on the other side of Russell Street.<ref>Nottinghamshire Archives DD/RN/1/1/1</ref> Shortly after this, the company also occupied Forest Road Mill.<ref>Raleigh catalogue, 1893, p.3</ref> (Forest Road junctions with Russell Street at the opposite end from Raleigh Street.)\n\nBowden created a business which, by 1913, was the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, occupying seven and a half acres in purpose-built premises completed in 1897 at Faraday Road, [[Lenton, Nottingham]].<ref>[http://www.nottinghampost.com/Building-business-heritage/story-25845916-detail/story.html#ixzz47jEOZdQx \"\u00a35.2 million University of Nottingham deal will build on business heritage\"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

Manufacture was transferred to Raleigh's Nottingham works.<ref>Roger Lloyd-Jones, Myrddin John Lewis, Mark Eason, ''Raleigh and the British Bicycle Industry: An Economic and Business History, 1870-1960'', Ashgate Publishing, 2000. {{ISBN|1859284574}}</ref> Raleigh-made Humbers differed from Raleighs only in chainwheels, fork crowns and some brakework.<ref name=THadland/>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the Raleigh factory in Nottingham was used for the production of [[fuze]]s. Bicycle production was reduced to approximately 5% of its peacetime capacity.<ref name=\"NottGov\" />\n\nIn 1939, Raleigh opened a bicycle factory at 6 Hanover Quay, Dublin, Ireland and commenced bicycle production there. The Raleigh (Ireland) business expanded and moved to 8\u201311 Hanover Quay, Dublin in 1943. The plant produced complete bicycles and [[Sturmey-Archer]] hubs, and remained in production until 1976, when the factory burned down. Models produced there latterly were the Chopper and Triumph 20. The head badges changed in the late 1960s, possibly after the passing of the Trade Descriptions Act in the UK. Dublin-made machines no longer had \"Nottingham England\" on the Heron or Triumph head badge, the panel being left blank instead.\n[[File:Irish Raleigh Heron Badge.jpg|thumb|150px|Irish Raleigh Heron Badge]]\n\n===Motor vehicles===\nIn 1899, Raleigh started to build motorcycles and in 1903, introduced the Raleighette, a belt-driven three-wheel motorcycle with the driver in the back and a wicker seat for the passenger between the two front wheels. Financial losses meant production lasted only until 1908.\n\nIn 1930, the company acquired the rights to the Ivy Karryall, a motorcycle fitted with a cabin for cargo and a hood for the driver. Raleigh's version was called the Light Delivery Van and had a chain drive. A two-passenger version was followed by Raleigh's first three-wheel car, the Safety Seven. It was a four-seat convertible with shaft drive and a maximum speed of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. A saloon version was planned, but Raleigh shut its motor department to concentrate on bicycles again. Chief designer T. L. Williams took the equipment and remaining parts and moved to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], where his company produced three-wheelers for 65 years. The leftover parts from Raleigh carried an \"R\", so Williams chose a matching name: [[Reliant]].\n[[Image:Raleigh Sports 1970.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Raleigh Sports in the USA.]]\n\nRaleigh also made [[mopeds]] in the late 1950s and 1960s as the bicycle market declined. The most popular of which was the RM6 Runabout. This model featured unsprung front forks and a cycle type calliper front brake which made it a very affordable mode of transport. Because of its success, production continued until February 1971; 17 months after Raleigh had stopped manufacturing all other mopeds.\n\n===Post-war U.S. export market===\nAfter [[World War II]], Raleigh became known for its lightweight ''sports [[roadster (bicycle)|roadster]]'' bicycles, often using [[Sturmey-Archer]] three and five-speed transmissions. These cycles were considerably lighter and quicker than either the old heavy English utility roadster or the American \"[[Bicycle tire#Balloon|balloon-tire]]\" [[cruiser bicycle|cruiser]] bikes. In 1946, Raleigh and other English bicycle manufacturers accounted for 95% of the bicycles imported into the United States.<ref>Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles: Marketing Lessons from the Leading Post-World War II U.S. Bicycle Brand'', Babson College, MA (2007), pp. 5\u20136 [http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2013%202007/170-179_petty.pdf Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514091409/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2013%202007/170-179_petty.pdf |date=14 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\nRaleigh's ''sports roadster'', or ''British racer'' bicycles were exported around the world, including the United States. The company continued to increase imports to the United States until 1955, when a rate increase in foreign bicycle tariffs caused a shift in imports in favour of bicycles from [[West Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. However, this proved only a temporary setback, and by 1964, Raleigh was again a major selling brand in the US bicycle market.<ref>Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles'', pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\n===Raleigh RSW===\nIn 1965, Raleigh introduced the RSW 16, its long-awaited competitor to the hugely successful [[Moulton Bicycle]]. The new Raleigh shared several important features with the Moulton, including small wheels, an open frame and built-in luggage carrying capacity.\n\n[[File:Raleigh rsw mk 2 bicycle drive side bootiebike 2 com.JPG|thumb|Late 1960s Raleigh RSW. The RSW was Raleigh's competitor to the fully suspended [[Moulton Bicycle]].]]\n\nHowever, the RSW lacked the Moulton's suspension, which compensated for the bumpy ride that comes with small wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bootiebike.com/commentary/small_wheel_obsession.htm|title=Small wheel obsession|first=Brian|last=Conolly|website=bootiebike.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160102123855/http://bootiebike.com/commentary/small_wheel_obsession.htm|archivedate=2 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Instead, Raleigh fitted the RSW with [[Bicycle tire#Balloon|balloon tyres]], which effectively smoothed the ride but at the cost of increased rolling resistance. Nevertheless, the RSW was pleasant to ride, and Raleigh's extensive retail network ensured its success.\n\nThe success of the RSW took sales away from the Moulton and put the maker into financial difficulties. Raleigh then bought out Moulton and produced both bikes until 1974. Raleigh also produced a sister model to the RSW, the [[Raleigh Twenty|'Twenty']], which was more successful and remained in production well into the 1980s.\n\n===Expansion and mergers===\nWhile bicycle production had steadily risen through the mid-1950s, the British market began to decline with the increasing affordability and popularity of the motor car. For much of the postwar era, British bicycle manufacturers had largely competed with each other in both the home and export markets, but 1956 saw the formation of the British Cycle Corporation by the [[Tube Investments|Tube Investments Group]] which already owned Phillips, Hercules, Armstrong, and [[Norman Cycles|Norman]]. In 1957, Raleigh bought the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] Cycles Ltd., BSA's bicycle division, which gave them exclusive use of the former brand names New Hudson and Sunbeam. Raleigh also already owned the Robin Hood brand, and Three Spires with Triumph (cycles) also at their disposal.\n\nBSA had itself acquired [[Triumph Cycle]] Co. Ltd. only five years previously. Ti added the Sun bicycle company to their stable in 1958, and with two \"super groups\" now controlling a large portion of the market, it was perhaps inevitable that in 1960, Tube Investments acquired Raleigh and merged the British Cycle Corporation with Raleigh to form TI\u2013Raleigh, which now had 75% of the UK market. TI\u2013Raleigh then acquired [[Carlton Cycles]] in [[Worksop]], England that same year, at the time one of the largest semi-custom lightweight makers in the UK. Ti Raleigh gave total control of its cycle division to Raleigh and soon set about marketing many of the acquired names as budget ranges, though with Raleigh frames. The old British Cycle Corporation factory at Handsworth continued to produce non Raleigh branded product well into the 1970s, with Raleigh branded models built in the main plant at Nottingham. However, the Sun branded bicycles were made in the Carlton factory at Worksop, England.\n\nAs a vertically integrated manufacturer in the mid-1960s, TI\u2013Raleigh owned [[Brooks England|Brooks]] (one of the oldest saddle makers in the world), [[Sturmey-Archer]] (pioneer of 3-speed hubs), and [[Reynolds Technology|Reynolds]] (maker of [[Reynolds 531|531 tubing]]). Carlton, which had been unable to make inroads in the USA market after a failed rebranding deal with [[Huffy]], found success in the late 1960s by recasting itself as \"Raleigh-Carlton\", a Raleigh-logo'd bike with some Carlton badging, and using the US dealer network to import and distribute bikes.\n\n===The Raleigh Chopper===\n{{Main|Raleigh Chopper}}\n\nThe Raleigh Chopper was designed by Nottingham native [[Alan Oakley (designer)|Alan Oakley]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18136787 |title=Raleigh Chopper designer Alan Oakley dies from cancer |publisher=BBC |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520201921/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18136787 |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> though this has been disputed by Cambridge designer [[Tom Karen]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/i-designed-the-chopper-argues-cambridge-inventor/03035 | title = I designed the Chopper, argues Cambridge inventor | publisher = BikeBiz | date = 21 Jan 2004 | accessdate = 5 Jul 2015 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923185253/http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/i-designed-the-chopper-argues-cambridge-inventor/03035 | archivedate = 23 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The Chopper was patented in the UK in 1967 and patented in the US in 1968.

It went on sale in the UK in 1970 and sold well, and was a key factor in reviving the company's fortunes. The ''Chopper'' featured a 3-speed Sturmey-Archer gear hub, shifted using a [[Top tube|top-tube]] mounted gear lever reminiscent of the early [[Harley-Davidson]] [[suicide shifter]] \u2014 one of its \"cool\" features. Other differences were the unusual frame, long padded seat with backrest, sprung suspension at the back, high-rise handlebars, and differently sized front (16\") and rear (20\") wheels. Tyres were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring red highlights on the sidewall. The price was from approximately \u00a332 for a standard ''Chopper'' to \u00a355 for the deluxe. Two smaller versions, the ''Chipper'' and ''Tomahawk'', also sold well.\n\nThe Mk 2 ''Chopper'' was an improved version from 1972. It had the option of five-speed [[derailleur]] gears in the United States, but all UK bikes had the 3 speed hub, with the exception of a model introduced in 1973 and only available in a bizarre shade of pink. This model was discontinued in 1976. The Mk 2 had a shorter seat and the frame modified to move the rear of the seat forward, this helped prevent the bike [[wheelie|tipping up]]. The shorter seat also made it harder to ride '2 up' (2 people on the bike at a time). The ''Chopper'' remained in production until 1982, when the rising popularity of the [[BMX]] bicycle caused sales to drop off.\n\nRaleigh revisited the chopper design in recent times, with great success although the new version has had some changes to conform to modern safety laws. Gone is the top tube shifter and long integrated seat, but the look and feel of the bike remain.\n\n===1979-present reorganisations===\nIn 1979, production of Raleigh 531 butted-tube bicycles reached 10,000 units a year. In 1980, the former Carlton factory at Worksop closed and production was moved to a Lightweights facility at Nottingham. However, all bicycles made there afterward still carried the W for Worksop frame number designation. In 1982, rights to the ''Raleigh USA'' name were purchased by the [[Huffy Corporation]]. Under the terms of the agreement, ''Raleigh of England'' licensed Huffy to design and distribute Raleigh bicycles in the US,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mombat.org/Raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh Museum |publisher=Mombat.org |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221112455/http://mombat.org/Raleigh.htm |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and Huffy was given instant access to a nationwide network of bike shops. The renamed ''Raleigh Cycle Company of America'' sold bikes in the US while the rest of the world, including Canada, received ''Raleigh of England'' bikes. At that time, production of some U.S. Raleigh models were shifted to Japan, with [[Bridgestone]] manufacturing most of these bikes. By 1984, all Raleighs for the American market, except the top-of-the range Team Professional (made in Ilkeston) and Prestige road bikes (made in Nottingham), were produced in the Far East.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Meanwhile, in the home market, Raleigh had broken into the new UK BMX market with their Burner range, which was very successful.\n\nIn 1987, the leading German bicycle manufacturer [[Derby Cycle]] bought Raleigh from Ti and Raleigh USA from Huffy. In 1988, Derby opened a factory in [[Kent, Washington]] manufacturing two Raleigh lines, the bimetallic ''Technium'' road bike line, which used heat-treated aluminum main frame tubes, thermally bonded and heat-cured to internal steel lugs using a Boeing-developed proprietary epoxy &mdash; along with [[41xx steel|chromoly steel]] head tube and rear stays.  Kent also manufactured the off-road chromoly steel ''Altimetric'' line (Tangent CX, Traverse CX, Tactic CX and Talon CX 1991-1992). The factory closed in 1994. All ''Raleigh Cycle Company of America'' parts and frames from 1995 on were then [[mass production|mass-produced]] in China and [[Taiwan]] and assembled in other plants.\n\nThe high-end framesets offered for sale in Raleigh catalogues together with the frames built for Team riders were produced in Ilkeston by the Special Bicycle Developments Unit (SBDU) from 1974 to 1989 under the guidance of Gerald V O'Donovan; this production was moved to a new \"Raleigh Special Products\" division in Nottingham on closure of the Kent factory.\n\n''Raleigh Canada'' had a factory in [[Waterloo, Quebec]] from 1972 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granbyexpress.com/Actualites/Economie/2013-12-03/article-3528778/Raleigh-quitte-definitivement-Waterloo/1|title=Raleigh quitte d\u00e9finitivement Waterloo|publisher=Granby Express|date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106213815/http://www.granbyexpress.com/Actualites/Economie/2013-12-03/article-3528778/Raleigh-quitte-definitivement-Waterloo/1|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Derby Cycle acquired [[Diamondback Bicycles]] in 1999.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh in the Last Quarter of the 20th Century |publisher=Hadland.me.uk |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418052858/http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |archivedate=18 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the same year, Raleigh ceased volume production of frames in the UK and its frame-making equipment were sold by auction.<ref name=\"hadland.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |accessdate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418052858/http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh in the last quarter of the 20th century|archivedate=18 April 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Derby Cycle controlled Raleigh USA, Raleigh UK, Raleigh Canada, and Raleigh Ireland.

Using Raleigh as their brand name, it is one of the oldest bicycle companies in the world. After being acquired by [[Sir Frank Bowden, 1st Baronet|Frank Bowden]] in December 1888, it became The Raleigh Cycle Company, which was registered as a limited liability company in January 1889.  By 1913, it was the largest bicycle manufacturing company in the world. From 1921 to 1935, Raleigh also produced motorcycles and three-wheel cars, leading to the formation of [[Reliant Motors]].  Raleigh bicycle is now a division of the Dutch corporation [[Accell]].\n\nIn 2006, the [[Raleigh Chopper]] was named in the list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the [[BBC]] and the [[Design Museum]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nThe history of Raleigh bicycles started in 1885, when Richard Morriss Woodhead from [[Sherwood Forest]], and Paul Eugene Louis Angois, a French citizen, set up a small bicycle workshop in Raleigh Street, [[Nottingham]], England. In the spring of that year, they started advertising in the local press. The ''Nottinghamshire Guardian'' of 15 May 1885 printed what was possibly the first Woodhead and Angois classified advertisement.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The classic Raleigh Cycle Company emblem.jpg|thumb|right|The classic Raleigh Cycle Company emblem.]] -->\n[[File:Raleigh 1940s advert.jpg|thumb|right|Raleigh advert from 1940.]]\nNearly two years later, the 11 April 1887 issue of ''[[Nottingham Post|The Nottingham Evening Post]]'' contained a display advertisement for the Raleigh \u2018Safety\u2019 model under the new banner \u2018Woodhead, Angois, and Ellis. Russell Street Cycle Works.\u2019 William Ellis had recently joined the partnership and provided much-needed financial investment. Like Woodhead and Angois, Ellis's background was in the lace industry. He was a lace gasser, a service provider involved in the bleaching and treating of lace, with premises in nearby Clare Street and Glasshouse Street. Thanks to Ellis, the bicycle works had now expanded round the corner from Raleigh Street into former lace works on the adjoining road, Russell Street. By 1888, the company was making about three cycles a week and employed around half a dozen men.<ref name=\"Bowden F 1903, p.8\">Bowden F, \u2018To the Public\u2019, ''The Book of the Raleigh'', Raleigh, Nottingham, 1903, p.8</ref> It was one of 15 bicycle manufacturers based in Nottingham at that time.<ref>Harrison A E, \u2018The Competitiveness of the British Cycle Industry, 1890\u20131914\u2019, ''The Economic History Review'', News Series, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Aug 1969), p.289</ref>\n\n[[Sir Frank Bowden, 1st Baronet|Frank Bowden]], a recent convert to cycling who on medical advice had toured extensively on a tricycle, first saw a Raleigh bicycle in a shop window in [[Queen Victoria Street, London]], about the time that William Ellis's investment in the cycle workshop was beginning to take effect.<ref>\u2018Rutulan\u2019, ''Souvenir of the Raleigh Works'', Raleigh, 1922, p.4</ref> Bowden described how this led to him visiting the Raleigh works:\n\n{{quote|In the early part of 1887, while looking for a good specimen of the then new safety bicycle, I came across a Raleigh in London. Its patent changeable gear and other special features struck me as superior to all the others I had seen, and I purchased one upon which I toured extensively through France, Italy and England during 1887 and 1888. In the autumn of the latter year, happening to pass through Nottingham, and with the idea of, if possible, getting a still more up-to-date machine, I called upon Messrs. Woodhead and Angois, the originators and makers of the Raleigh \u2026<ref name=\"Bowden F 1903, p.8\"/>}}\n\nIt is clear from Frank Bowden's own account that, although he bought a Raleigh \u2018Safety\u2019 in 1887, he did not visit the Raleigh workshop until autumn 1888. That visit led to Bowden replacing Ellis as the partnership's principal investor, though Bowden did not become the outright owner of the firm. He concluded that the company had a profitable future if it promoted its innovative features, increased its output, cut its overhead costs and tailored its products to the individual tastes and preferences of its customers. He bought out William Ellis's share in the firm and was allotted 5,000 \u00a31 shares, while Woodhead and Angois between them held another 5,000 shares.<ref>Lloyd-Jones R & Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, pp.47\u201349</ref>\n\nIn Frank Bowden's own lifetime, Raleigh publicity material stated that the firm was founded in 1888,<ref name=THadland>Hadland T, ''Raleigh: Past and Presence of an Iconic Bicycle Brand'', Cycle Publishing, San Francisco, 2011, fig.8.3</ref> which was when Bowden, as he himself confirmed, first bought into the enterprise.

In January 1889, it became the first of a series of limited liability companies with Raleigh in its name. It had a nominal capital of \u00a320,000, half of which was provided by Frank Bowden. Paul Angois was appointed director responsible for product design, Richard Woodhead was made director responsible for factory management, and Frank Bowden became chairman and managing director. Some shares were made available to small investors and local businessmen, but take-up was minimal, and Bowden ended up buying most of the public shares. He subsequently supplied virtually all the capital needed to expand the firm.<ref>Lloyd-Jones R & Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, pp.49\u201350</ref>\n\nWhen Frank Bowden got involved with the enterprise, the works comprised three small workshops and a greenhouse. As Woodhead, Angois and Ellis, the firm had expanded round the corner from Raleigh Street into Russell Street, where also stood Clarke's five-storey former lace factory. To enable further expansion of the business, Bowden financed the renting of this property and installation of new machinery.<ref>Lloyd-Jones R & Lewis MJ with Eason M, ''Raleigh and The British Bicycle Industry'', Ashgate, Aldershot, 2000, p.50</ref>\n\nUnder Bowden's guidance, Raleigh expanded rapidly. By 1891, the company occupied not only Clarke's factory but also Woodroffe's Factory and Russell Street Mills.<ref>Raleigh catalogue, 1892, p.1</ref> In November 1892, Raleigh signed a tenancy agreement for rooms in Butler's factory on the other side of Russell Street.<ref>Nottinghamshire Archives DD/RN/1/1/1</ref> Shortly after this, the company also occupied Forest Road Mill.<ref>Raleigh catalogue, 1893, p.3</ref> (Forest Road junctions with Russell Street at the opposite end from Raleigh Street.)\n\nBowden created a business which, by 1913, was the biggest bicycle manufacturing company in the world, occupying seven and a half acres in purpose-built premises completed in 1897 at Faraday Road, [[Lenton, Nottingham]].<ref>[http://www.nottinghampost.com/Building-business-heritage/story-25845916-detail/story.html#ixzz47jEOZdQx \"\u00a35.2 million University of Nottingham deal will build on business heritage\"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The Raleigh (Ireland) business expanded and moved to 8\u201311 Hanover Quay, Dublin in 1943. The plant produced complete bicycles and [[Sturmey-Archer]] hubs, and remained in production until 1976, when the factory burned down. Models produced there latterly were the Chopper and Triumph 20. The head badges changed in the late 1960s, possibly after the passing of the Trade Descriptions Act in the UK. Dublin-made machines no longer had \"Nottingham England\" on the Heron or Triumph head badge, the panel being left blank instead.\n[[File:Irish Raleigh Heron Badge.jpg|thumb|150px|Irish Raleigh Heron Badge]]\n\n===Motor vehicles===\nIn 1899, Raleigh started to build motorcycles and in 1903, introduced the Raleighette, a belt-driven three-wheel motorcycle with the driver in the back and a wicker seat for the passenger between the two front wheels. Financial losses meant production lasted only until 1908.\n\nIn 1930, the company acquired the rights to the Ivy Karryall, a motorcycle fitted with a cabin for cargo and a hood for the driver. Raleigh's version was called the Light Delivery Van and had a chain drive. A two-passenger version was followed by Raleigh's first three-wheel car, the Safety Seven. It was a four-seat convertible with shaft drive and a maximum speed of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. A saloon version was planned, but Raleigh shut its motor department to concentrate on bicycles again. Chief designer T. L. Williams took the equipment and remaining parts and moved to [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]], where his company produced three-wheelers for 65 years. The leftover parts from Raleigh carried an \"R\", so Williams chose a matching name: [[Reliant]].\n[[Image:Raleigh Sports 1970.jpg|thumb|left|1970 Raleigh Sports in the USA.]]\n\nRaleigh also made [[mopeds]] in the late 1950s and 1960s as the bicycle market declined. The most popular of which was the RM6 Runabout. This model featured unsprung front forks and a cycle type calliper front brake which made it a very affordable mode of transport. Because of its success, production continued until February 1971; 17 months after Raleigh had stopped manufacturing all other mopeds.\n\n===Post-war U.S. export market===\nAfter [[World War II]], Raleigh became known for its lightweight ''sports [[roadster (bicycle)|roadster]]'' bicycles, often using [[Sturmey-Archer]] three and five-speed transmissions. These cycles were considerably lighter and quicker than either the old heavy English utility roadster or the American \"[[Bicycle tire#Balloon|balloon-tire]]\" [[cruiser bicycle|cruiser]] bikes. In 1946, Raleigh and other English bicycle manufacturers accounted for 95% of the bicycles imported into the United States.<ref>Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles: Marketing Lessons from the Leading Post-World War II U.S. Bicycle Brand'', Babson College, MA (2007), pp. 5\u20136 [http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2013%202007/170-179_petty.pdf Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514091409/http://faculty.quinnipiac.edu/charm/CHARM%20proceedings/CHARM%20article%20archive%20pdf%20format/Volume%2013%202007/170-179_petty.pdf |date=14 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\nRaleigh's ''sports roadster'', or ''British racer'' bicycles were exported around the world, including the United States. The company continued to increase imports to the United States until 1955, when a rate increase in foreign bicycle tariffs caused a shift in imports in favour of bicycles from [[West Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. However, this proved only a temporary setback, and by 1964, Raleigh was again a major selling brand in the US bicycle market.<ref>Petty, Ross D., ''Pedaling Schwinn Bicycles'', pp. 5\u20136</ref>\n\n===Raleigh RSW===\nIn 1965, Raleigh introduced the RSW 16, its long-awaited competitor to the hugely successful [[Moulton Bicycle]]. The new Raleigh shared several important features with the Moulton, including small wheels, an open frame and built-in luggage carrying capacity.\n\n[[File:Raleigh rsw mk 2 bicycle drive side bootiebike 2 com.JPG|thumb|Late 1960s Raleigh RSW. The RSW was Raleigh's competitor to the fully suspended [[Moulton Bicycle]].]]\n\nHowever, the RSW lacked the Moulton's suspension, which compensated for the bumpy ride that comes with small wheels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bootiebike.com/commentary/small_wheel_obsession.htm|title=Small wheel obsession|first=Brian|last=Conolly|website=bootiebike.com|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160102123855/http://bootiebike.com/commentary/small_wheel_obsession.htm|archivedate=2 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Instead, Raleigh fitted the RSW with [[Bicycle tire#Balloon|balloon tyres]], which effectively smoothed the ride but at the cost of increased rolling resistance. Nevertheless, the RSW was pleasant to ride, and Raleigh's extensive retail network ensured its success.\n\nThe success of the RSW took sales away from the Moulton and put the maker into financial difficulties. Raleigh then bought out Moulton and produced both bikes until 1974. Raleigh also produced a sister model to the RSW, the [[Raleigh Twenty|'Twenty']], which was more successful and remained in production well into the 1980s.\n\n===Expansion and mergers===\nWhile bicycle production had steadily risen through the mid-1950s, the British market began to decline with the increasing affordability and popularity of the motor car. For much of the postwar era, British bicycle manufacturers had largely competed with each other in both the home and export markets, but 1956 saw the formation of the British Cycle Corporation by the [[Tube Investments|Tube Investments Group]] which already owned Phillips, Hercules, Armstrong, and [[Norman Cycles|Norman]]. In 1957, Raleigh bought the [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] Cycles Ltd., BSA's bicycle division, which gave them exclusive use of the former brand names New Hudson and Sunbeam. Raleigh also already owned the Robin Hood brand, and Three Spires with Triumph (cycles) also at their disposal.\n\nBSA had itself acquired [[Triumph Cycle]] Co. Ltd. only five years previously. Ti added the Sun bicycle company to their stable in 1958, and with two \"super groups\" now controlling a large portion of the market, it was perhaps inevitable that in 1960, Tube Investments acquired Raleigh and merged the British Cycle Corporation with Raleigh to form TI\u2013Raleigh, which now had 75% of the UK market. TI\u2013Raleigh then acquired [[Carlton Cycles]] in [[Worksop]], England that same year, at the time one of the largest semi-custom lightweight makers in the UK. Ti Raleigh gave total control of its cycle division to Raleigh and soon set about marketing many of the acquired names as budget ranges, though with Raleigh frames. The old British Cycle Corporation factory at Handsworth continued to produce non Raleigh branded product well into the 1970s, with Raleigh branded models built in the main plant at Nottingham. However, the Sun branded bicycles were made in the Carlton factory at Worksop, England.\n\nAs a vertically integrated manufacturer in the mid-1960s, TI\u2013Raleigh owned [[Brooks England|Brooks]] (one of the oldest saddle makers in the world), [[Sturmey-Archer]] (pioneer of 3-speed hubs), and [[Reynolds Technology|Reynolds]] (maker of [[Reynolds 531|531 tubing]]). Carlton, which had been unable to make inroads in the USA market after a failed rebranding deal with [[Huffy]], found success in the late 1960s by recasting itself as \"Raleigh-Carlton\", a Raleigh-logo'd bike with some Carlton badging, and using the US dealer network to import and distribute bikes.\n\n===The Raleigh Chopper===\n{{Main|Raleigh Chopper}}\n\nThe Raleigh Chopper was designed by Nottingham native [[Alan Oakley (designer)|Alan Oakley]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18136787 |title=Raleigh Chopper designer Alan Oakley dies from cancer |publisher=BBC |date=20 May 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520201921/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-18136787 |archivedate=20 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> though this has been disputed by Cambridge designer [[Tom Karen]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/i-designed-the-chopper-argues-cambridge-inventor/03035 | title = I designed the Chopper, argues Cambridge inventor | publisher = BikeBiz | date = 21 Jan 2004 | accessdate = 5 Jul 2015 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923185253/http://www.bikebiz.com/news/read/i-designed-the-chopper-argues-cambridge-inventor/03035 | archivedate = 23 September 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The Chopper was patented in the UK in 1967 and patented in the US in 1968.

It went on sale in the UK in 1970 and sold well, and was a key factor in reviving the company's fortunes. The ''Chopper'' featured a 3-speed Sturmey-Archer gear hub, shifted using a [[Top tube|top-tube]] mounted gear lever reminiscent of the early [[Harley-Davidson]] [[suicide shifter]] \u2014 one of its \"cool\" features. Other differences were the unusual frame, long padded seat with backrest, sprung suspension at the back, high-rise handlebars, and differently sized front (16\") and rear (20\") wheels. Tyres were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring red highlights on the sidewall. The price was from approximately \u00a332 for a standard ''Chopper'' to \u00a355 for the deluxe. Two smaller versions, the ''Chipper'' and ''Tomahawk'', also sold well.\n\nThe Mk 2 ''Chopper'' was an improved version from 1972. It had the option of five-speed [[derailleur]] gears in the United States, but all UK bikes had the 3 speed hub, with the exception of a model introduced in 1973 and only available in a bizarre shade of pink. This model was discontinued in 1976. The Mk 2 had a shorter seat and the frame modified to move the rear of the seat forward, this helped prevent the bike [[wheelie|tipping up]]. The shorter seat also made it harder to ride '2 up' (2 people on the bike at a time). The ''Chopper'' remained in production until 1982, when the rising popularity of the [[BMX]] bicycle caused sales to drop off.\n\nRaleigh revisited the chopper design in recent times, with great success although the new version has had some changes to conform to modern safety laws. Gone is the top tube shifter and long integrated seat, but the look and feel of the bike remain.\n\n===1979-present reorganisations===\nIn 1979, production of Raleigh 531 butted-tube bicycles reached 10,000 units a year. In 1980, the former Carlton factory at Worksop closed and production was moved to a Lightweights facility at Nottingham. However, all bicycles made there afterward still carried the W for Worksop frame number designation. In 1982, rights to the ''Raleigh USA'' name were purchased by the [[Huffy Corporation]]. Under the terms of the agreement, ''Raleigh of England'' licensed Huffy to design and distribute Raleigh bicycles in the US,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mombat.org/Raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh Museum |publisher=Mombat.org |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221112455/http://mombat.org/Raleigh.htm |archivedate=21 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and Huffy was given instant access to a nationwide network of bike shops. The renamed ''Raleigh Cycle Company of America'' sold bikes in the US while the rest of the world, including Canada, received ''Raleigh of England'' bikes. At that time, production of some U.S. Raleigh models were shifted to Japan, with [[Bridgestone]] manufacturing most of these bikes. By 1984, all Raleighs for the American market, except the top-of-the range Team Professional (made in Ilkeston) and Prestige road bikes (made in Nottingham), were produced in the Far East.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Meanwhile, in the home market, Raleigh had broken into the new UK BMX market with their Burner range, which was very successful.\n\nIn 1987, the leading German bicycle manufacturer [[Derby Cycle]] bought Raleigh from Ti and Raleigh USA from Huffy. In 1988, Derby opened a factory in [[Kent, Washington]] manufacturing two Raleigh lines, the bimetallic ''Technium'' road bike line, which used heat-treated aluminum main frame tubes, thermally bonded and heat-cured to internal steel lugs using a Boeing-developed proprietary epoxy &mdash; along with [[41xx steel|chromoly steel]] head tube and rear stays.  Kent also manufactured the off-road chromoly steel ''Altimetric'' line (Tangent CX, Traverse CX, Tactic CX and Talon CX 1991-1992). The factory closed in 1994. All ''Raleigh Cycle Company of America'' parts and frames from 1995 on were then [[mass production|mass-produced]] in China and [[Taiwan]] and assembled in other plants.\n\nThe high-end framesets offered for sale in Raleigh catalogues together with the frames built for Team riders were produced in Ilkeston by the Special Bicycle Developments Unit (SBDU) from 1974 to 1989 under the guidance of Gerald V O'Donovan; this production was moved to a new \"Raleigh Special Products\" division in Nottingham on closure of the Kent factory.\n\n''Raleigh Canada'' had a factory in [[Waterloo, Quebec]] from 1972 to 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granbyexpress.com/Actualites/Economie/2013-12-03/article-3528778/Raleigh-quitte-definitivement-Waterloo/1|title=Raleigh quitte d\u00e9finitivement Waterloo|publisher=Granby Express|date=3 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106213815/http://www.granbyexpress.com/Actualites/Economie/2013-12-03/article-3528778/Raleigh-quitte-definitivement-Waterloo/1|archivedate=6 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Derby Cycle acquired [[Diamondback Bicycles]] in 1999.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh in the Last Quarter of the 20th Century |publisher=Hadland.me.uk |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418052858/http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |archivedate=18 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the same year, Raleigh ceased volume production of frames in the UK and its frame-making equipment were sold by auction.<ref name=\"hadland.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |accessdate=22 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060418052858/http://www.hadland.me.uk/raleigh.htm |title=Raleigh in the last quarter of the 20th century|archivedate=18 April 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Derby Cycle controlled Raleigh USA, Raleigh UK, Raleigh Canada, and Raleigh Ireland.

Lenark promised to build a new factory in [[Calverton, Nottinghamshire|Calverton]] but failed to pay the first instalment and the company entered liquidation. It was reported that the reason for selling the business, after extracting the cash for the factory site, was to have Lenark declare it insolvent so that neither Derby nor Lenark would have to pay the redundancy costs. Sturmey-Archer's assets were acquired by [[SunRace]] of Taiwan who relocated the factory to Taiwan and sales to the Netherlands. Sister company Brooks was sold to [[Selle Royal]] of Italy.\n\nIn 2001, following continuing financial problems at Derby Cycle, there was a management buy-out of all the remaining Raleigh companies led by Alan Finden-Crofts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canberrabicyclemuseum.com.au/non-australian%20manuf%20articles.htm |title=Non-Australian manuf articles |publisher=Canberrabicyclemuseum.com.au |accessdate=20 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229090110/http://canberrabicyclemuseum.com.au/non-australian%20manuf%20articles.htm |archivedate=29 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nBy 2003, assembly of bicycles had ended in the UK with 280 assembly and factory staff made redundant, and bicycles were to come \"from Vietnam and other centres of 'low-cost, high-quality' production.\"<ref name=\"hadland.me.uk\"/> with final assembly takes place in [[Cloppenburg]], Germany.\n\nIn 2012, Derby was acquired by Pon, a Dutch company, as part of their new bicycle group, which also owns [[Gazelle (bicycle)|Gazelle]] and [[Cerv\u00e9lo]].

In the closed caucuses, candidates must meet a 15% viability threshold within an individual precinct in order to be considered viable and 15% at the congressional district or statewide level, with supporters of non-viable candidates at precinct caucuses then allowed to support one of the remaining viable candidates. Of the 36 pledged delegates to the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]], 23 are allocated on the basis of the results of the precinct caucuses, with between 5 and 6 allocated to each of [[Nevada's congressional districts|the state's four congressional districts]]. The precinct caucuses also elect delegates to county conventions based on the results of the vote in each precinct. Of the remaining 13 pledged delegates, another 5 will be allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates) in addition to 8 at-large pledged delegates, and delegates to the national convention will be distributed proportionally based on the number of county delegates.<ref name=\"GP\"/>\n\nThe county conventions will subsequently be held on April 18, 2020, to choose delegates for the state Democratic convention. On May 30, 2020, the state Democratic convention will meet to vote on the unpledged delegates to send to the Democratic National Convention. The 36 pledged delegates Nevada sends to the national convention will be joined by 12 unpledged PLEO delegates (five members of the [[Democratic National Committee]], five members of Congress, of which two are Senators and three are U.S. Representatives, one governor, and one distinguished party leader). These delegate totals do not account for pledged delegate bonuses or penalties from timing or clustering.<ref name=\"GP\"/>\n\nOn March 20, 2019, the [[Nevada Democratic Party]] released its 2020 delegate selection plan, introducing four days for early voting from February 15 to 18, 2020, and, like the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]], \"virtual caucuses\" on February 16 and 17 to allow those unable to physically attend to vote in addition to releasing raw vote totals. In both cases, caucusgoers' ranked presidential preferences will be sent to their precinct and counted on the day of the physical caucus. After county conventions following the [[2016 Nevada Democratic caucuses and convention|previous caucuses]] left open the risk of a candidate winning a majority of delegates at the state conventions despite trailing among district delegates, all unpledged delegates will now be allocated on the basis of the results of the precinct caucuses on February 22.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Messerly|first1=Megan|title=After bitter 2016 cycle, Nevada Democrats overhaul caucus process to build a bigger tent|url=https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-bitter-2016-cycle-nevada-democrats-overhaul-caucus-process-to-build-a-bigger-tent|publisher=The Nevada Independent|date=March 19, 2019|accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late August 2019, the Democratic National Committee ordered both the Iowa and Nevada Democratic state parties to scrap their plans for \"virtual caucuses\" because of security concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/30/iowa-dnc-caucus-1479172|title=DNC throws Iowa, Nevada caucuses into confusion|last1=Korecki|first1=Natasha|date=August 31, 2019|publisher=Politico}}</ref>\n\n==Candidates==\nIn order to get on the \"caucus preference card\" (ballot), candidates had to file with the State committee and pay a $2,500 fee by New Year's Day 2020.

In the closed caucuses, candidates must meet a 15% viability threshold within an individual precinct in order to be considered viable and 15% at the congressional district or statewide level, with supporters of non-viable candidates at precinct caucuses then allowed to support one of the remaining viable candidates. Of the 36 pledged delegates to the [[2020 Democratic National Convention]], 23 are allocated on the basis of the results of the precinct caucuses, with between 5 and 6 allocated to each of [[Nevada's congressional districts|the state's four congressional districts]]. The precinct caucuses also elect delegates to county conventions based on the results of the vote in each precinct. Of the remaining 13 pledged delegates, another 5 will be allocated to party leaders and elected officials (PLEO delegates) in addition to 8 at-large pledged delegates, and delegates to the national convention will be distributed proportionally based on the number of county delegates.<ref name=\"GP\"/>\n\nThe county conventions will subsequently be held on April 18, 2020, to choose delegates for the state Democratic convention. On May 30, 2020, the state Democratic convention will meet to vote on the unpledged delegates to send to the Democratic National Convention. The 36 pledged delegates Nevada sends to the national convention will be joined by 12 unpledged PLEO delegates (five members of the [[Democratic National Committee]], five members of Congress, of which two are Senators and three are U.S. Representatives, one governor, and one distinguished party leader). These delegate totals do not account for pledged delegate bonuses or penalties from timing or clustering.<ref name=\"GP\"/>\n\nOn March 20, 2019, the [[Nevada Democratic Party]] released its 2020 delegate selection plan, introducing four days for early voting from February 15 to 18, 2020, and, like the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]], \"virtual caucuses\" on February 16 and 17 to allow those unable to physically attend to vote in addition to releasing raw vote totals. In both cases, caucusgoers' ranked presidential preferences will be sent to their precinct and counted on the day of the physical caucus. After county conventions following the [[2016 Nevada Democratic caucuses and convention|previous caucuses]] left open the risk of a candidate winning a majority of delegates at the state conventions despite trailing among district delegates, all unpledged delegates will now be allocated on the basis of the results of the precinct caucuses on February 22.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Messerly|first1=Megan|title=After bitter 2016 cycle, Nevada Democrats overhaul caucus process to build a bigger tent|url=https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/after-bitter-2016-cycle-nevada-democrats-overhaul-caucus-process-to-build-a-bigger-tent|publisher=The Nevada Independent|date=March 19, 2019|accessdate=April 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn late August 2019, the Democratic National Committee ordered both the Iowa and Nevada Democratic state parties to scrap their plans for \"virtual caucuses\" because of security concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/30/iowa-dnc-caucus-1479172|title=DNC throws Iowa, Nevada caucuses into confusion|last1=Korecki|first1=Natasha|date=August 31, 2019|publisher=Politico}}</ref>\n\n==Candidates==\nIn order to get on the \"caucus preference card\" (ballot), candidates had to file with the State committee and pay a $2,500 fee by New Year's Day 2020.
