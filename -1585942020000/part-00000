{"title_page": "History of money", "text_new": "{{short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\n{{Numismatics}}\nThe '''history of money''' concerns the development of social systems that provide at least one of the [[money#Functions|functions of money]]. Such systems can be understood as means of trading wealth indirectly; not directly as with [[barter]]. [[Money]] is a mechanism that facilitates this process.\n\nMoney may take a physical form as in coins and notes, or may exist as a written or electronic account. It may have [[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] ([[commodity money]]), be legally exchangeable for something with intrinsic value ([[representative money]]), or only have nominal value ([[fiat money]]).<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-money/</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe invention of money took place before the beginning of written history.<ref name=\"Schmandt-Besserat\">[https://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/ Denise Schmandt-Besserat], [https://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/tokens/tokens/ Tokens: their Significance for the Origin of Counting and Writing]</ref><ref>Keynes, J.M.

These included livestock and grain \u2013 things directly useful in themselves \u2013 but also merely attractive items such as [[cowry|cowrie shells]] or [[bead]]s<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=gRdSDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT139&dq=money+physical+form+coin+note+electronic+account&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiat7uS-NzgAhWRL6YKHRYoDWcQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&q=money%20physical%20form%20coin%20note%20electronic%20account&f=false|title=Cambridge IGCSE and O Level Economics 2nd edition|last=Hoang|first=Paul|last2=Ducie|first2=Margaret|date=2018-04-09|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=9781510420205|language=en}}</ref> were exchanged for more useful [[commodities]]. However, such exchanges would be better described as [[barter system|barter]], and the common bartering of a particular commodity (especially when the commodity items are not fungible) does not technically make that commodity \"[[money]]\" or a \"[[commodity money]]\" like the [[shekel]] \u2013 which was both a coin representing a specific weight of [[barley]], and the weight of that sack of barley.<ref name=\"Kramer, pp. 52\">Kramer, ''History Begins at Sumer'', pp. 52\u201355.</ref>\n\nDue to the complexities of ancient history (ancient civilizations developing at different paces and not keeping accurate records or having their records destroyed), and because the ancient origins of economic systems precede written history, it is impossible to trace the true origin of the invention of money and the transition from \"[[barter system]]s\" to the \"[[monetary system]]s\".

The [[Roman Republican currency|Romans' use of bronze]], while not among the more ancient examples is well documented, and it illustrates this transition clearly. First, the \"[[aes rude]]\" (rough bronze) was used. This was a heavy weight of unmeasured bronze used in what was probably a barter system\u2014the barter-ability of the bronze was related exclusively to its usefulness in blacksmithing and it was bartered with the intent of being turned into tools. The next historical step was bronze in bars that had a 5-pound pre-measured weight (presumably to make barter easier and more fair), called \"[[aes signatum]]\" (signed bronze), which is where debate arises between if this is still the [[barter system]] or now a [[monetary system]]. Finally, there is a clear break from the use of bronze in barter into its undebatable use as money because of lighter measures of bronze not intended to be used as anything other than coinage for transactions. The [[aes grave]] (heavy bronze) (or [[As (coin)|''As'']]) is the start of the use of coins in Rome, but not the oldest known example of metal coinage.\n\n==Theories of money==\n{{main|Monetary economics}}\nThe earliest ideas included [[Aristotle]]'s \"[[Metallism|metallist]]\" and [[Plato]]'s \"[[Chartalism|chartalist]]\" concepts, which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] integrated into his own theory of money as forms of classification.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Marx\u2019s Theory of Money: Modern Appraisals|last=Moseley|first=F|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=9781403936417|location=New York|pages=65}}</ref> Specifically, the Austrian economist attempted to develop a catallactic theory of money out of Claim Theory.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Theory of Money and Credit|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781620871614|location=New York|pages=472}}</ref> Schumpeter's theory had several themes but the most important of these involve the notions that money can be analyzed from the viewpoint of [[social accounting]] and that it is also firmly connected to the [[Theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] and price.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Joseph A.

His research indicates that [[Gift economy|gift economies]] were common, at least at the beginnings of the [[History of agriculture|first agrarian]] societies, when humans used elaborate credit systems. Graeber proposes that money as a unit of account was invented the moment when the unquantifiable obligation \"I owe you one\" transformed into the quantifiable notion of \"I owe you one unit of something\". In this view, money emerged first as credit and only later acquired the functions of a medium of exchange and a store of value.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"nakedcapitalism.com\"/> Graeber's criticism partly relies on and follows that made by Michell A. Innes in his 1913 pamphlet \"What is money?\". Innes refutes the barter theory of money, by examining historic evidence and showing that early coins never were of consistent value nor of more or less consistent metal content. Therefore, he concludes that sales is not exchange of goods for some universal commodity, but an exchange for credit. He argues that \"credit and credit alone is money\".<ref>Innes, Michell A. 1913. \"What is Money ?\".

A greater problem was the simultaneous co-existence of gold, silver and copper coins in Europe. The exchange rates between the metals varied with supply and demand. For instance the gold guinea coin began to rise against the silver crown in England in the 1670s and 1680s. Consequently, silver was exported from England in exchange for gold imports. The effect was worsened with Asian traders not sharing the European appreciation of gold altogether \u2014 gold left Asia and silver left Europe in quantities European observers like [[Isaac Newton]], Master of the Royal Mint observed with unease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1701-25-mint-reports/report-1717-09-25.html |title=Sir Isaac Newton's state of the gold and silver coin (25 September 1717). |publisher=[[Pierre Marteau]]}}</ref>\n\nStability came when national banks guaranteed to change silver money into gold at a fixed rate; it did, however, not come easily.

A flourishing Italian wholesale trade in cloth, woolen clothing, wine, tin and other commodities was heavily dependent on credit for its rapid expansion. Goods were supplied to a buyer against a bill of exchange, which constituted the buyer's promise to make payment at some specified future date. Provided that the buyer was reputable or the bill was endorsed by a credible guarantor, the seller could then present the bill to a merchant banker and redeem it in money at a discounted value before it actually became due. The main purpose of these bills nevertheless was, that traveling with cash was particularly dangerous at the time. A deposit could be made with a banker in one town, in turn a bill of exchange was handed out, that could be redeemed in another town.\n\nThese bills could also be used as a form of payment by the seller to make additional purchases from his own suppliers. Thus, the bills \u2013 an early form of credit \u2013 became both a medium of exchange and a medium for storage of value.

Tallies originally came into use at a time when paper was rare and costly, but their use persisted until the early 19th century, even after paper money had become prevalent. The notches denoted various amounts of taxes payable to the Crown. Initially tallies were simply a form of receipt to the taxpayer at the time of rendering his dues. As the revenue department became more efficient, they began issuing tallies to denote a promise of the tax assessee to make future tax payments at specified times during the year. Each tally consisted of a matching pair \u2013 one stick was given to the assessee at the time of assessment representing the amount of taxes to be paid later, and the other held by the Treasury representing the amount of taxes to be collected at a future date.\n\nThe Treasury discovered that these tallies could also be used to create money. When the Crown had exhausted its current resources, it could use the tally receipts representing future tax payments due to the Crown as a form of payment to its own creditors, who in turn could either collect the tax revenue directly from those assessed or use the same tally to pay their own taxes to the government. The tallies could also be sold to other parties in exchange for gold or silver coin at a discount reflecting the length of time remaining until the tax was due for payment. Thus, the tallies became an accepted medium of exchange for some types of transactions and an accepted store of value. Like the girobanks before it, the Treasury soon realized that it could also issue tallies that were not backed by any specific assessment of taxes. By doing so, the Treasury created new money that was backed by public trust and confidence in the monarchy rather than by specific revenue receipts.<ref>Davies, Glyn, [http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/llyfr.html \u2018\u2019A History of Money\u2019\u2019], University of Wales(England), 1994, pp. 146\u2013151 {{ISBN|0-7083-1717-0}}</ref>\n\n==1450\u20132008==\n\n===Goldsmith bankers===\n{{main |Goldsmith banker}}\n[[Goldsmith]]s in England had been craftsmen, bullion merchants, money changers, and money lenders since the 16th century. But they were not the first to act as [[financial intermediary|financial intermediaries]]; in the early 17th century, the [[scrivener]]s were the first to keep deposits for the express purpose of relending them.<ref>Richards</ref> Merchants and traders had amassed huge hoards of gold and entrusted their wealth to the [[Royal Mint]] for storage. In 1640 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] seized the private gold stored in the mint as a forced loan (which was to be paid back over time). Thereafter merchants preferred to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee (i.e., in trust). These receipts could not be assigned (only the original depositor could collect the stored goods). Gradually the goldsmiths took over the function of the scriveners of relending on behalf of a depositor and also developed modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited which by custom and/or law was a loan to the goldsmith,<ref>Thus by the 19th century \"[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded\". Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and \"Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.\" [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Chancellor Cottenham]], ''[[Foley v Hill]]'' (1848) 2 HLC 28.</ref> i.e., the depositor expressly allowed the goldsmith to use the money for any purpose including advances to his customers. The goldsmith charged no fee, or even paid interest on these deposits. Since the [[promissory note]]s were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of [[fractional reserve banking]]. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument, which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay.<ref>Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people.</ref> Hence goldsmiths could advance loans in the form of gold money, or in the form of promissory notes, or in the form of checking accounts.<ref>Richards, p. 40</ref> Gold deposits were relatively stable, often remaining with the goldsmith for years on end, so there was little risk of default so long as public trust in the goldsmith's integrity and financial soundness was maintained. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of British banking and prominent creators of new money based on credit.\n\n===Demand deposits===\n[[Demand deposit]]s are funds that are deposited in bank accounts and are available for withdrawal at the discretion of the depositor. The withdrawal of funds from the account does not require contacting or making any type of prior arrangements with the bank or [[credit union]]. As long as the account balance is sufficient to cover the amount of the withdrawal, and the withdrawal takes place in accordance with procedures set in place by the financial institution, the funds may be withdrawn on demand.\n\n===Banknotes===\n[[File:Money 100 USD (4792018878).jpg|160px|thumbnail|right|[[US dollar|100 USD]] banknote]]\nThe first European banknotes were issued by [[Stockholms Banco]], a predecessor of Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]], in 1661.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geisst|first=Charles R.|title=Encyclopedia of American business history|year=2005|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-4350-7|page=39}}</ref> These replaced the copper-plates being used instead as a means of payment,<ref>Karl Gunnar Persson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYJtS1MdKlsC&pg=PA137&dq=Swedish+banknote+history&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z1_LT5qeEdSp8QOZ17DWDw&ved=0CGwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Swedish%20banknote%20history&f=false ''An Economic History of Europe: Knowledge, Institutions and Growth, 600 to the Present''] Cambridge University Press, 28 January 2010, {{ISBN|052154940X}} \u2013 Retrieved 2012-06-03</ref> although in 1664 the bank ran out of coins to redeem notes and ceased operating in the same year.\n\nInspired by the success of the London goldsmiths, some of whom became the forerunners of great English banks, banks began issuing paper notes quite properly termed \"[[banknote]]s\", which circulated in the same way that government-issued currency circulates today. In England this practice continued up to 1694. Scottish banks continued issuing notes until 1850, and still do issue banknotes backed by [[Bank of England]] notes. In the United States, this practice continued through the 19th century; at one time there were more than 5,000 different types of banknotes issued by various commercial banks in America. Only the notes issued by the largest, most creditworthy banks were widely accepted. The scrip of smaller, lesser-known institutions circulated locally. Farther from home it was only accepted at a discounted rate, if at all. The proliferation of types of money went hand in hand with a multiplication in the number of financial institutions.\n\nThese banknotes were a form of representative money which could be converted into gold or silver by application at the bank. Since banks issued notes far in excess of the gold and silver they kept on deposit, sudden loss of public confidence in a bank could precipitate mass redemption of banknotes and result in bankruptcy.\n\nThe use of banknotes issued by private commercial banks as [[legal tender]] has gradually been replaced by the issuance of bank notes authorized and controlled by national governments. The [[Bank of England]] was granted sole rights to issue banknotes in England after 1694. In the United States, the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] was granted similar rights after its establishment in 1913. Until recently, these government-authorized currencies were forms of representative money, since they were partially backed by gold or silver and were theoretically convertible into gold or silver.\n\n==1990\u2013present==\nThe development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990, in the United States, all money transferred between its central bank and commercial banks was in electronic form.  By the 2000s most money existed as [[digital currency]] in banks databases.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730143424/https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm |archive-date=30 July 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic (dependent on country).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150724-the-truth-about-the-death-of-cash | title=The truth about the death of cash  | date=24 July 2015 | first=Rose | last=Eveleth | publisher=BBC | accessdate=4 December 2018 }}</ref> The benefit of digital currency is that it allows for easier, faster, and more flexible payments.<ref>https://www.motilaloswal.com/article.aspx/1131/Understanding-Digital-Money-and-Its-Importance</ref>  \n \n===Cryptocurrencies===\n{{main|Cryptocurrency}}\nIn 2008, [[Bitcoin]] was proposed by an unknown author/s under the pseudonym of [[Satoshi Nakamoto]].

The different measures of the money supply have been classified by various [[central bank]]s, using the prefix \"M\". The supply classifications often depend on how narrowly a supply is specified, for example the \"M\"s may range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (broadest). The classifications depend on the particular policy formulation used:\n\n* '''{{visible anchor|M0}}''': In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, M0 includes bank reserves, so M0 is referred to as the monetary base, or narrow money.<ref>[http://moneyterms.co.uk/m0/ M0 (monetary base)].

It may have [[Intrinsic value (numismatics)|intrinsic value]] ([[commodity money]]), be legally exchangeable for something with intrinsic value ([[representative money]]), or only have nominal value ([[fiat money]]).<ref>https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-money/</ref>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Overview==\nThe invention of money took place before the beginning of written history.<ref name=\"Schmandt-Besserat\">[https://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/ Denise Schmandt-Besserat], [https://sites.utexas.edu/dsb/tokens/tokens/ Tokens: their Significance for the Origin of Counting and Writing]</ref><ref>Keynes, J.M.

Volume I, p. 13</ref> Consequently, any story of how money first developed is largely based on conjecture and logical inference.\n\nThe significant evidence establishes many things were bartered in ancient markets that could be described as a [[medium of exchange]].

The [[Roman Republican currency|Romans' use of bronze]], while not among the more ancient examples is well documented, and it illustrates this transition clearly. First, the \"[[aes rude]]\" (rough bronze) was used. This was a heavy weight of unmeasured bronze used in what was probably a barter system\u2014the barter-ability of the bronze was related exclusively to its usefulness in blacksmithing and it was bartered with the intent of being turned into tools. The next historical step was bronze in bars that had a 5-pound pre-measured weight (presumably to make barter easier and more fair), called \"[[aes signatum]]\" (signed bronze), which is where debate arises between if this is still the [[barter system]] or now a [[monetary system]]. Finally, there is a clear break from the use of bronze in barter into its undebatable use as money because of lighter measures of bronze not intended to be used as anything other than coinage for transactions. The [[aes grave]] (heavy bronze) (or [[As (coin)|''As'']]) is the start of the use of coins in Rome, but not the oldest known example of metal coinage.\n\n==Theories of money==\n{{main|Monetary economics}}\nThe earliest ideas included [[Aristotle]]'s \"[[Metallism|metallist]]\" and [[Plato]]'s \"[[Chartalism|chartalist]]\" concepts, which [[Joseph Schumpeter]] integrated into his own theory of money as forms of classification.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Marx\u2019s Theory of Money: Modern Appraisals|last=Moseley|first=F|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2004|isbn=9781403936417|location=New York|pages=65}}</ref> Specifically, the Austrian economist attempted to develop a catallactic theory of money out of Claim Theory.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Theory of Money and Credit|last=von Mises|first=Ludwig|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781620871614|location=New York|pages=472}}</ref> Schumpeter's theory had several themes but the most important of these involve the notions that money can be analyzed from the viewpoint of [[social accounting]] and that it is also firmly connected to the [[Theory of value (economics)|theory of value]] and price.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Joseph A.

His research indicates that [[Gift economy|gift economies]] were common, at least at the beginnings of the [[History of agriculture|first agrarian]] societies, when humans used elaborate credit systems. Graeber proposes that money as a unit of account was invented the moment when the unquantifiable obligation \"I owe you one\" transformed into the quantifiable notion of \"I owe you one unit of something\". In this view, money emerged first as credit and only later acquired the functions of a medium of exchange and a store of value.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"nakedcapitalism.com\"/> Graeber's criticism partly relies on and follows that made by Michell A. Innes in his 1913 pamphlet \"What is money?\". Innes refutes the barter theory of money, by examining historic evidence and showing that early coins never were of consistent value nor of more or less consistent metal content. Therefore, he concludes that sales is not exchange of goods for some universal commodity, but an exchange for credit. He argues that \"credit and credit alone is money\".<ref>Innes, Michell A. 1913. \"What is Money ?\".

A greater problem was the simultaneous co-existence of gold, silver and copper coins in Europe. The exchange rates between the metals varied with supply and demand. For instance the gold guinea coin began to rise against the silver crown in England in the 1670s and 1680s. Consequently, silver was exported from England in exchange for gold imports. The effect was worsened with Asian traders not sharing the European appreciation of gold altogether \u2014 gold left Asia and silver left Europe in quantities European observers like [[Isaac Newton]], Master of the Royal Mint observed with unease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pierre-marteau.com/editions/1701-25-mint-reports/report-1717-09-25.html |title=Sir Isaac Newton's state of the gold and silver coin (25 September 1717). |publisher=[[Pierre Marteau]]}}</ref>\n\nStability came when national banks guaranteed to change silver money into gold at a fixed rate; it did, however, not come easily.

A flourishing Italian wholesale trade in cloth, woolen clothing, wine, tin and other commodities was heavily dependent on credit for its rapid expansion. Goods were supplied to a buyer against a bill of exchange, which constituted the buyer's promise to make payment at some specified future date. Provided that the buyer was reputable or the bill was endorsed by a credible guarantor, the seller could then present the bill to a merchant banker and redeem it in money at a discounted value before it actually became due. The main purpose of these bills nevertheless was, that traveling with cash was particularly dangerous at the time. A deposit could be made with a banker in one town, in turn a bill of exchange was handed out, that could be redeemed in another town.\n\nThese bills could also be used as a form of payment by the seller to make additional purchases from his own suppliers. Thus, the bills \u2013 an early form of credit \u2013 became both a medium of exchange and a medium for storage of value.

Tallies originally came into use at a time when paper was rare and costly, but their use persisted until the early 19th century, even after paper money had become prevalent. The notches denoted various amounts of taxes payable to the Crown. Initially tallies were simply a form of receipt to the taxpayer at the time of rendering his dues. As the revenue department became more efficient, they began issuing tallies to denote a promise of the tax assessee to make future tax payments at specified times during the year. Each tally consisted of a matching pair \u2013 one stick was given to the assessee at the time of assessment representing the amount of taxes to be paid later, and the other held by the Treasury representing the amount of taxes to be collected at a future date.\n\nThe Treasury discovered that these tallies could also be used to create money. When the Crown had exhausted its current resources, it could use the tally receipts representing future tax payments due to the Crown as a form of payment to its own creditors, who in turn could either collect the tax revenue directly from those assessed or use the same tally to pay their own taxes to the government. The tallies could also be sold to other parties in exchange for gold or silver coin at a discount reflecting the length of time remaining until the tax was due for payment. Thus, the tallies became an accepted medium of exchange for some types of transactions and an accepted store of value. Like the girobanks before it, the Treasury soon realized that it could also issue tallies that were not backed by any specific assessment of taxes. By doing so, the Treasury created new money that was backed by public trust and confidence in the monarchy rather than by specific revenue receipts.<ref>Davies, Glyn, [http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/RDavies/arian/llyfr.html \u2018\u2019A History of Money\u2019\u2019], University of Wales(England), 1994, pp. 146\u2013151 {{ISBN|0-7083-1717-0}}</ref>\n\n==1450\u20132008==\n\n===Goldsmith bankers===\n{{main |Goldsmith banker}}\n[[Goldsmith]]s in England had been craftsmen, bullion merchants, money changers, and money lenders since the 16th century. But they were not the first to act as [[financial intermediary|financial intermediaries]]; in the early 17th century, the [[scrivener]]s were the first to keep deposits for the express purpose of relending them.<ref>Richards</ref> Merchants and traders had amassed huge hoards of gold and entrusted their wealth to the [[Royal Mint]] for storage. In 1640 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] seized the private gold stored in the mint as a forced loan (which was to be paid back over time). Thereafter merchants preferred to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee (i.e., in trust). These receipts could not be assigned (only the original depositor could collect the stored goods). Gradually the goldsmiths took over the function of the scriveners of relending on behalf of a depositor and also developed modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited which by custom and/or law was a loan to the goldsmith,<ref>Thus by the 19th century \"[i]n ordinary cases of deposits of money with banking corporations, or bankers, the transaction amounts to a mere loan or mutuum, and the bank is to restore, not the same money, but an equivalent sum, whenever it is demanded\". Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Law of Bailments (1832, p. 66) and \"Money, when paid into a bank, ceases altogether to be the money of the principal (see Parker v. Marchant, 1 Phillips 360); it is then the money of the banker, who is bound to return an equivalent by paying a similar sum to that deposited with him when he is asked for it.\" [[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Lord Chancellor Cottenham]], ''[[Foley v Hill]]'' (1848) 2 HLC 28.</ref> i.e., the depositor expressly allowed the goldsmith to use the money for any purpose including advances to his customers. The goldsmith charged no fee, or even paid interest on these deposits. Since the [[promissory note]]s were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of [[fractional reserve banking]]. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument, which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay.<ref>Richards. The usual denomination was 50 or 100 pounds, so these notes were not an everyday currency for the common people.</ref> Hence goldsmiths could advance loans in the form of gold money, or in the form of promissory notes, or in the form of checking accounts.<ref>Richards, p. 40</ref> Gold deposits were relatively stable, often remaining with the goldsmith for years on end, so there was little risk of default so long as public trust in the goldsmith's integrity and financial soundness was maintained. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of British banking and prominent creators of new money based on credit.\n\n===Demand deposits===\n[[Demand deposit]]s are funds that are deposited in bank accounts and are available for withdrawal at the discretion of the depositor. The withdrawal of funds from the account does not require contacting or making any type of prior arrangements with the bank or [[credit union]]. As long as the account balance is sufficient to cover the amount of the withdrawal, and the withdrawal takes place in accordance with procedures set in place by the financial institution, the funds may be withdrawn on demand.\n\n===Banknotes===\n[[File:Money 100 USD (4792018878).jpg|160px|thumbnail|right|[[US dollar|100 USD]] banknote]]\nThe first European banknotes were issued by [[Stockholms Banco]], a predecessor of Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]], in 1661.<ref>{{cite book|last=Geisst|first=Charles R.|title=Encyclopedia of American business history|year=2005|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8160-4350-7|page=39}}</ref> These replaced the copper-plates being used instead as a means of payment,<ref>Karl Gunnar Persson, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYJtS1MdKlsC&pg=PA137&dq=Swedish+banknote+history&hl=en&sa=X&ei=z1_LT5qeEdSp8QOZ17DWDw&ved=0CGwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=Swedish%20banknote%20history&f=false ''An Economic History of Europe: Knowledge, Institutions and Growth, 600 to the Present''] Cambridge University Press, 28 January 2010, {{ISBN|052154940X}} \u2013 Retrieved 2012-06-03</ref> although in 1664 the bank ran out of coins to redeem notes and ceased operating in the same year.\n\nInspired by the success of the London goldsmiths, some of whom became the forerunners of great English banks, banks began issuing paper notes quite properly termed \"[[banknote]]s\", which circulated in the same way that government-issued currency circulates today. In England this practice continued up to 1694. Scottish banks continued issuing notes until 1850, and still do issue banknotes backed by [[Bank of England]] notes. In the United States, this practice continued through the 19th century; at one time there were more than 5,000 different types of banknotes issued by various commercial banks in America. Only the notes issued by the largest, most creditworthy banks were widely accepted. The scrip of smaller, lesser-known institutions circulated locally. Farther from home it was only accepted at a discounted rate, if at all. The proliferation of types of money went hand in hand with a multiplication in the number of financial institutions.\n\nThese banknotes were a form of representative money which could be converted into gold or silver by application at the bank. Since banks issued notes far in excess of the gold and silver they kept on deposit, sudden loss of public confidence in a bank could precipitate mass redemption of banknotes and result in bankruptcy.\n\nThe use of banknotes issued by private commercial banks as [[legal tender]] has gradually been replaced by the issuance of bank notes authorized and controlled by national governments. The [[Bank of England]] was granted sole rights to issue banknotes in England after 1694. In the United States, the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] was granted similar rights after its establishment in 1913. Until recently, these government-authorized currencies were forms of representative money, since they were partially backed by gold or silver and were theoretically convertible into gold or silver.\n\n==1990\u2013present==\nThe development of computer technology in the second part of the twentieth century allowed money to be represented digitally. By 1990, in the United States, all money transferred between its central bank and commercial banks was in electronic form.  By the 2000s most money existed as [[digital currency]] in banks databases.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=22 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730143424/https://money.howstuffworks.com/currency6.htm |archive-date=30 July 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2012, by number of transaction, 20 to 58 percent of transactions were electronic (dependent on country).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150724-the-truth-about-the-death-of-cash | title=The truth about the death of cash  | date=24 July 2015 | first=Rose | last=Eveleth | publisher=BBC | accessdate=4 December 2018 }}</ref> The benefit of digital currency is that it allows for easier, faster, and more flexible payments.<ref>https://www.motilaloswal.com/article.aspx/1131/Understanding-Digital-Money-and-Its-Importance</ref>  \n \n===Cryptocurrencies===\n{{main|Cryptocurrency}}\nIn 2008, [[Bitcoin]] was proposed by an unknown author/s under the pseudonym of [[Satoshi Nakamoto]].

The different measures of the money supply have been classified by various [[central bank]]s, using the prefix \"M\". The supply classifications often depend on how narrowly a supply is specified, for example the \"M\"s may range from M0 (narrowest) to M3 (broadest). The classifications depend on the particular policy formulation used:\n\n* '''{{visible anchor|M0}}''': In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, M0 includes bank reserves, so M0 is referred to as the monetary base, or narrow money.<ref>[http://moneyterms.co.uk/m0/ M0 (monetary base)].

The contingency stations, later renamed Federal Medical Stations (FMS), are caches of equipment and supplies provided by the SNS, set up in local \"buildings of opportunity\" and staffed by local or federal medical personnel to provide triage, low acuity care, and temporary holding of displaced patients for whom local acute care systems are damaged or destroyed.\n\nSince the original deployment following Hurricane Katrina, FMSs have been deployed to support other major disaster responses including Superstorm Sandy. The FMS program is a collaboration between CDC and the [[Office of Emergency Management]] under the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. In 2014, responding to stakeholder feedback, a 50-bed FMS cache was developed and made available in addition to the original 250-bed FMS.<ref>HHS, ASPR FMS Concept of Operation, 2014</ref>\n\nThe SNS released one-quarter of its antiviral drug inventory ([[Tamiflu]] and [[Relenza]]), personal protective equipment (PPE), and respiratory protection devices, to help every US state respond to the H1N1 Influenza [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 swine influenza outbreak]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdc.gov/swineflu/index.htm|accessdate=2009-04-27|title=2009 H1N1 Flu}}</ref>\n\nThe SNS was involved in providing supplies to the repatriation efforts of State Department employees from China and Japan during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic, and shipped thousands of N95 masks to Washington, Massachusetts, and New York states in an effort to respond to COVID-19 \"hot spots\" as community spread began in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/5800200/strategic-national-stockpile-coronavirus/|title=States Need Medical Supplies to Fight Coronavirus.
