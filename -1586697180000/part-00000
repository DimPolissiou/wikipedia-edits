The material standard of life in the Western zones of Berlin began to improve quickly, and residents of the Soviet Zone soon began leaving for the West in large numbers, fleeing hunger, poverty and repression in the Soviet Zone for a better life in the West. Soon residents of other parts of the Soviet Zone began to escape to the West through Berlin, and this migration, called in Germany \"Republikflucht\", deprived the Soviet Zone not only of working forces desperately needed for post-war reconstruction, but disproportionately highly educated people, which came to be known as the \"Brain Drain\".{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn 1948, in response to moves by the Western powers to establish a separate, federal system of government in the Western zones, and to extend the Marshall Plan to Germany, the Soviets instituted the [[Berlin Blockade]], preventing people, food, materials and supplies from arriving in [[West Berlin]] by land routes through the Soviet zone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gaddis|2005|p=33}}</ref> The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and several other countries began a massive \"[[Berlin airlift|airlift]]\", supplying West Berlin with food and other supplies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=65\u201370}}</ref> The Soviets mounted a public relations campaign against the Western policy change.

The border between the Western and Eastern sectors of Berlin, however, remained open, although traffic between the Soviet and the Western sectors was somewhat restricted.

The loss was disproportionately heavy among professionals: engineers, technicians, physicians, teachers, lawyers and skilled workers. The direct cost of manpower losses to East Germany (and corresponding gain to the West) has been estimated at $7&nbsp;billion to $9&nbsp;billion, with East German party leader [[Walter Ulbricht]] later claiming that West Germany owed him $17&nbsp;billion in compensation, including reparations as well as manpower losses.<ref name=\"dowty122\" /> In addition, the drain of East Germany's young population potentially cost it over 22.5&nbsp;billion marks in lost educational investment.<ref>Volker Rolf Berghahn, ''Modern Germany: Society, Economy and Politics in the Twentieth Century'', p. 227.

Berlin soon went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult.<ref>Keeling, Drew (2014), business-of-migration.com [http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-processes/other-regions/berlin-wall-and-migration/ \"Berlin Wall and Migration,\" ''Migration as a travel business'']</ref> Many families were split, while East Berliners employed in the West were cut off from their jobs. West Berlin became an isolated [[exclave]] in a hostile land. West Berliners demonstrated against the Wall, led by their Mayor ({{lang|de|Oberb\u00fcrgermeister}}) [[Willy Brandt]], who strongly criticized the United States for failing to respond. Allied intelligence agencies had hypothesized about a wall to stop the flood of refugees, but the main candidate for its location was around the perimeter of the city. In 1961, Secretary of State Dean Rusk proclaimed, \"The Wall certainly ought not to be a permanent feature of the European landscape. I see no reason why the Soviet Union should think it is\u2014it is to their advantage in any way to leave there that monument to communist failure.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1961\"/>\n\nUnited States and UK sources had expected the Soviet sector to be sealed off from West Berlin, but were surprised by how long the East Germans took for such a move. They considered the Wall as an end to concerns about a GDR/Soviet retaking or capture of the whole of Berlin; the Wall would presumably have been an unnecessary project if such plans were afloat. Thus, they concluded that the possibility of a Soviet military conflict over Berlin had decreased.<ref>Taylor, Frederick. ''The Berlin Wall: 13 August 1961 \u2013 9 November 1989''.

Clay had been the Military Governor of the US Zone of Occupation in Germany during the period of the Berlin Blockade and had ordered the first measures in what became the [[Berlin Airlift]]. He was immensely popular with the residents of West Berlin, and his appointment was an unambiguous sign that Kennedy would not compromise on the status of West Berlin.

By stemming the exodus of people from East Germany, the East German government was able to reassert its control over the country: in spite of discontent with the Wall, economic problems caused by dual currency and the black market were largely eliminated. The economy in the GDR began to grow. However, the Wall proved a public relations disaster for the communist bloc as a whole. Western powers portrayed it as a symbol of communist tyranny, particularly after East German border guards shot and killed would-be defectors. Such fatalities were later treated as acts of murder by the reunified Germany.<ref>Goodman, Micah (1996) \"After the Wall: The Legal Ramifications of the East German Border Guard Trials in Unified Germany,\" Cornell International Law Journal: Vol. 29: Iss. 3, Article 3. p. 728</ref>\n\n==Structure and adjacent areas==\n===Layout and modifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable float-right\"\n|+ The wall overview<ref>[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/de/Start/Detail/id/593791/page/0 Berliner Mauer (Stand 31.

Both the eastern and western networks converged at {{lang|de|Friedrichstra\u00dfe}}, which became a major crossing point for those (mostly Westerners) with permission to cross.<ref name=\"history.howstuffworks.com\"/><ref name=\"mashable.com\">{{cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2014/11/06/berlin-wall-fence/|title=Before the Berlin Wall, people escaped through a wire fence|first=Chris|last=Wild|website=Mashable}}</ref>\n\n===Crossing===\n[[File:Berlin travel orders.png|thumb|Travel orders to go to Berlin as used by U.S. forces in the 1980s.]]\nWest Germans and citizens of other Western countries could generally visit East Germany, often after applying for a [[Travel visa|visa]]<ref name=willis>{{cite book|last1=Willis|first1=Jim|title=Daily Life behind the Iron Curtain|date=1946|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=9780313397639|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j-I99V70m0sC&pg=PT45&dq=visa+to+visit+west+germany+from+east#v=onepage&q=visa%20to%20visit%20west%20germany%20from%20east|accessdate=5 November 2014|ref=willis}}</ref> at an East German embassy several weeks in advance. Visas for day trips restricted to East Berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing. However, East German authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason. In the 1980s, visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least DM 25 into East German currency at the poor exchange rate of 1:1. It was forbidden to export East German currency from the East, but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits. Tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa, which cost DM 5; West Berliners did not have to pay this fee.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nWest Berliners initially could not visit East Berlin or East Germany at all\u2014all crossing points were closed to them between 26 August 1961 and 17 December 1963. In 1963, negotiations between East and West resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the Christmas season that year ({{lang|de|Passierscheinregelung}}). Similar, very limited arrangements were made in 1964, 1965 and 1966.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nIn 1971, with the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]], agreements were reached that allowed West Berliners to apply for visas to enter East Berlin and East Germany regularly, comparable to the regulations already in force for West Germans. However, East German authorities could still refuse entry permits.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nEast Berliners and East Germans could not, at first, travel to West Berlin or West Germany at all. This regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the Wall, but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced, the most significant being:\n* Elderly pensioners could travel to the West starting in 1964<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chronik der Mauer staff |title=Chronicle of the Berlin Wall: 9 September 1964 |url=http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/en/chronicle/#anchoryear1964 |website=Chronik der Mauer |publisher=Federal Agency for Civic Education |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n* Visits of relatives for important family matters\n* People who had to travel to the West for professional reasons (for example, artists, truck drivers, musicians, writers, etc.){{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFor each of these exceptions, GDR citizens had to apply for individual approval, which was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange only a very small amount of [[East German Mark]]s into [[Deutsche Mark]]s (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (''[[Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsgeld]]'', or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nCitizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nAllied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money. Likewise, Soviet military patrols could enter and exit West Berlin. This was a requirement of the post-war [[Allied Control Council|Four Powers]] Agreements. A particular area of concern for the Western Allies involved official dealings with East German authorities when crossing the border, since Allied policy did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin, as well as the Allied presence within Greater Berlin, including entry into, exit from, and presence within East Berlin.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nThe Allies held that only the Soviet Union, and not the GDR, had authority to regulate Allied personnel in such cases. For this reason, elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when engaged in travel through the GDR and when in East Berlin. Special rules applied to travel by Western Allied military personnel assigned to the [[military liaison missions]] accredited to the commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, located in [[Potsdam]].<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nAllied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes:\n\n;Transit between West Germany and West Berlin:\n* '''Road:''' the Helmstedt\u2013Berlin autobahn (A2) (checkpoints Alpha and Bravo respectively). Soviet military personnel manned these checkpoints and processed Allied personnel for travel between the two points. Military personnel were required to be in uniform when traveling in this manner.\n* '''Rail:''' Western Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces were forbidden to use commercial train service between West Germany and West Berlin, because of GDR passport and customs controls when using them. Instead, the Allied forces operated a series of official (duty) trains that traveled between their respective duty stations in West Germany and West Berlin. When transiting the GDR, the trains would follow the route between Helmstedt and Griebnitzsee, just outside West Berlin. In addition to persons traveling on official business, authorized personnel could also use the duty trains for personal travel on a space-available basis. The trains traveled only at night, and as with transit by car, Soviet military personnel handled the processing of duty train travelers.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/> (See [[History of the Berlin S-Bahn]].)\n\n;Entry into and exit from East Berlin:\n* [[Checkpoint Charlie]] (as a pedestrian or riding in a vehicle)\n\nAs with military personnel, special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the Western Allies accredited to their respective embassies in the GDR. This was intended to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when crossing between East and West Berlin, which could jeopardize the overall Allied position governing the freedom of movement by Allied forces personnel within all Berlin.\n\nOrdinary citizens of the Western Allied powers, not formally affiliated with the Allied forces, were authorized to use all designated transit routes through East Germany to and from West Berlin. Regarding travel to East Berlin, such persons could also use the Friedrichstra\u00dfe train station to enter and exit the city, in addition to Checkpoint Charlie. In these instances, such travelers, unlike Allied personnel, had to submit to East German border controls.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\n===Defection attempts===\n{{further|List of deaths at the Berlin Wall}}\n[[File:East German Guard - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[National People's Army|NVA]] soldier [[Conrad Schumann]] [[defection|defecting]] to West Berlin during the Wall's early days in 1961.]]\nDuring the years of the Wall, around 5,000 people successfully defected to West Berlin.

East German authorities no longer permitted apartments near the Wall to be occupied, and any building near the Wall had its windows boarded and later bricked up.

But a West German policeman intervened, firing his weapon at the East German border guards.

When a metal beam was placed at checkpoints to prevent this kind of defection, up to four people (two in the front seats and possibly two in the [[Trunk (car)|boot]]) drove under the bar in a sports car that had been modified to allow the roof and windscreen to come away when it made contact with the beam.

By early November refugees were finding their way to Hungary via Czechoslovakia, or via the West German Embassy in Prague. This was tolerated by the new Krenz government, because of long-standing agreements with the communist Czechoslovak government, allowing free travel across their common border. However this movement of people grew so large it caused difficulties for both countries. To ease the difficulties, the politburo led by Krenz decided on 9 November to allow refugees to exit directly through crossing points between East Germany and West Germany, including between East and West Berlin.

The direct cost of manpower losses to East Germany (and corresponding gain to the West) has been estimated at $7&nbsp;billion to $9&nbsp;billion, with East German party leader [[Walter Ulbricht]] later claiming that West Germany owed him $17&nbsp;billion in compensation, including reparations as well as manpower losses.<ref name=\"dowty122\" /> In addition, the drain of East Germany's young population potentially cost it over 22.5&nbsp;billion marks in lost educational investment.<ref>Volker Rolf Berghahn, ''Modern Germany: Society, Economy and Politics in the Twentieth Century'', p. 227.

The interagency intelligence Berlin Watch Committee assessed that this intercept \"might be the first step in a plan to close the border.\"<ref name=\"TNSA20130925\" /><ref name=\"AidBurr20130925\" /> This warning did not reach John F. Kennedy until noon on 13 August 1961, while he was vacationing in his yacht off the [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]]. While Kennedy was angry that he had no advance warning, he was relieved that the East Germans and the Soviets had only divided Berlin without taking any action against West Berlin's access to the West. However, he denounced the Berlin Wall, whose erection worsened the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"TNSA20130925\">{{cite web|title=Berlin Crisis After Dividing Berlin, August 1961|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB441/docs/berlin%20crisis%20after.pdf|publisher=The National Security Archive at George Washington University in Washington, D.C.|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"AidBurr20130925\">{{cite web|title=\"Disreputable if Not Outright Illegal\": The National Security Agency versus Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, Art Buchwald, Frank Church, et al.|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB441/|publisher=The National Security Archive at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C.|accessdate=26 September 2013|author1=Matthew M.

Clay]], was appointed by Kennedy as his special advisor and sent to Berlin with ambassadorial rank. Clay had been the Military Governor of the US Zone of Occupation in Germany during the period of the Berlin Blockade and had ordered the first measures in what became the [[Berlin Airlift]]. He was immensely popular with the residents of West Berlin, and his appointment was an unambiguous sign that Kennedy would not compromise on the status of West Berlin. Clay and Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] arrived at [[Tempelhof International Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] on the afternoon of Saturday, 19 August 1961.<ref name=\"cnn.com\"/>\n\nThey arrived in a city defended by three Allied brigades\u2014one each from the UK ([[Berlin Infantry Brigade]]), the US ([[Berlin Brigade]]), and France ([[Forces Fran\u00e7aises \u00e0 Berlin]]). On 16 August, Kennedy had given the order for them to be reinforced. Early on 19 August, the 1st Battle Group, 18th Infantry (commanded by Colonel Glover S. Johns Jr.) was alerted.<ref>See also [[David Hackworth|Hackworth]], About Face</ref>\n\nOn Sunday morning, U.S. troops marched from West Germany through East Germany, bound for West Berlin.

By stemming the exodus of people from East Germany, the East German government was able to reassert its control over the country: in spite of discontent with the Wall, economic problems caused by dual currency and the black market were largely eliminated. The economy in the GDR began to grow. However, the Wall proved a public relations disaster for the communist bloc as a whole. Western powers portrayed it as a symbol of communist tyranny, particularly after East German border guards shot and killed would-be defectors. Such fatalities were later treated as acts of murder by the reunified Germany.<ref>Goodman, Micah (1996) \"After the Wall: The Legal Ramifications of the East German Border Guard Trials in Unified Germany,\" Cornell International Law Journal: Vol. 29: Iss. 3, Article 3. p. 728</ref>\n\n==Structure and adjacent areas==\n===Layout and modifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable float-right\"\n|+ The wall overview<ref>[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/de/Start/Detail/id/593791/page/0 Berliner Mauer (Stand 31.

These allowed visits by West Berliners, other West Germans, Western foreigners and Allied personnel into East Berlin, as well as visits by GDR citizens and citizens of other socialist countries into West Berlin, provided that they held the necessary permits. These crossings were restricted according to which nationality was allowed to use it (East Germans, West Germans, West Berliners, other countries). The best known was the vehicle and pedestrian checkpoint at the corner of [[Friedrichstra\u00dfe]] and Zimmerstra\u00dfe ([[Checkpoint Charlie]]), which was restricted to Allied personnel and foreigners.<ref name=\"harrison206\">{{Harvnb|Harrison|2003|pp=206\u2013214}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other border crossings existed between West Berlin and surrounding East Germany. These could be used for transit between West Germany and West Berlin, for visits by West Berliners into East Germany, for transit into countries neighbouring East Germany (Poland, [[Czechoslovakia]], Denmark), and for visits by East Germans into West Berlin carrying a permit. After the 1972 agreements, new crossings were opened to allow West Berlin waste to be transported into East German dumps, as well as some crossings for access to West Berlin's [[exclave]]s (see ''[[Steinst\u00fccken]]'').\n\nFour [[autobahn]]s connected West Berlin to West Germany, including [[Bundesautobahn 2|Berlin-Helmstedt autobahn]], which entered East German territory between the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn (Checkpoint Alpha), and which entered West Berlin at Dreilinden (Checkpoint Bravo for the Allied forces) in southwestern Berlin. Access to West Berlin was also possible by railway (four routes) and by boat for commercial shipping via canals and rivers.<ref name=\"cnn.com\"/><ref name=\"thoughtco.com\"/><ref name=\"history.howstuffworks.com\">{{cite web|url=https://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-events/berlin-wall.htm|title=How the Berlin Wall Worked|date=12 May 2008|website=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>\n\nNon-German Westerners could cross the border at [[Berlin Friedrichstra\u00dfe station|Friedrichstra\u00dfe station]] in East Berlin and at Checkpoint Charlie.

Visas for day trips restricted to East Berlin were issued without previous application in a simplified procedure at the border crossing. However, East German authorities could refuse entry permits without stating a reason. In the 1980s, visitors from the western part of the city who wanted to visit the eastern part had to exchange at least DM 25 into East German currency at the poor exchange rate of 1:1. It was forbidden to export East German currency from the East, but money not spent could be left at the border for possible future visits. Tourists crossing from the west had to also pay for a visa, which cost DM 5; West Berliners did not have to pay this fee.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nWest Berliners initially could not visit East Berlin or East Germany at all\u2014all crossing points were closed to them between 26 August 1961 and 17 December 1963. In 1963, negotiations between East and West resulted in a limited possibility for visits during the Christmas season that year ({{lang|de|Passierscheinregelung}}). Similar, very limited arrangements were made in 1964, 1965 and 1966.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nIn 1971, with the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]], agreements were reached that allowed West Berliners to apply for visas to enter East Berlin and East Germany regularly, comparable to the regulations already in force for West Germans. However, East German authorities could still refuse entry permits.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nEast Berliners and East Germans could not, at first, travel to West Berlin or West Germany at all. This regulation remained in force essentially until the fall of the Wall, but over the years several exceptions to these rules were introduced, the most significant being:\n* Elderly pensioners could travel to the West starting in 1964<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chronik der Mauer staff |title=Chronicle of the Berlin Wall: 9 September 1964 |url=http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/en/chronicle/#anchoryear1964 |website=Chronik der Mauer |publisher=Federal Agency for Civic Education |accessdate=3 December 2019}}</ref>\n* Visits of relatives for important family matters\n* People who had to travel to the West for professional reasons (for example, artists, truck drivers, musicians, writers, etc.){{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nFor each of these exceptions, GDR citizens had to apply for individual approval, which was never guaranteed. In addition, even if travel was approved, GDR travellers could exchange only a very small amount of [[East German Mark]]s into [[Deutsche Mark]]s (DM), thus limiting the financial resources available for them to travel to the West. This led to the West German practice of granting a small amount of DM annually (''[[Begr\u00fc\u00dfungsgeld]]'', or welcome money) to GDR citizens visiting West Germany and West Berlin to help alleviate this situation.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nCitizens of other East European countries were in general subject to the same prohibition of visiting Western countries as East Germans, though the applicable exception (if any) varied from country to country.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nAllied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces could enter and exit East Berlin without submitting to East German passport controls, purchasing a visa or being required to exchange money. Likewise, Soviet military patrols could enter and exit West Berlin. This was a requirement of the post-war [[Allied Control Council|Four Powers]] Agreements. A particular area of concern for the Western Allies involved official dealings with East German authorities when crossing the border, since Allied policy did not recognize the authority of the GDR to regulate Allied military traffic to and from West Berlin, as well as the Allied presence within Greater Berlin, including entry into, exit from, and presence within East Berlin.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nThe Allies held that only the Soviet Union, and not the GDR, had authority to regulate Allied personnel in such cases. For this reason, elaborate procedures were established to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when engaged in travel through the GDR and when in East Berlin. Special rules applied to travel by Western Allied military personnel assigned to the [[military liaison missions]] accredited to the commander of Soviet forces in East Germany, located in [[Potsdam]].<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\nAllied personnel were restricted by policy when travelling by land to the following routes:\n\n;Transit between West Germany and West Berlin:\n* '''Road:''' the Helmstedt\u2013Berlin autobahn (A2) (checkpoints Alpha and Bravo respectively). Soviet military personnel manned these checkpoints and processed Allied personnel for travel between the two points. Military personnel were required to be in uniform when traveling in this manner.\n* '''Rail:''' Western Allied military personnel and civilian officials of the Allied forces were forbidden to use commercial train service between West Germany and West Berlin, because of GDR passport and customs controls when using them. Instead, the Allied forces operated a series of official (duty) trains that traveled between their respective duty stations in West Germany and West Berlin. When transiting the GDR, the trains would follow the route between Helmstedt and Griebnitzsee, just outside West Berlin. In addition to persons traveling on official business, authorized personnel could also use the duty trains for personal travel on a space-available basis. The trains traveled only at night, and as with transit by car, Soviet military personnel handled the processing of duty train travelers.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/> (See [[History of the Berlin S-Bahn]].)\n\n;Entry into and exit from East Berlin:\n* [[Checkpoint Charlie]] (as a pedestrian or riding in a vehicle)\n\nAs with military personnel, special procedures applied to travel by diplomatic personnel of the Western Allies accredited to their respective embassies in the GDR. This was intended to prevent inadvertent recognition of East German authority when crossing between East and West Berlin, which could jeopardize the overall Allied position governing the freedom of movement by Allied forces personnel within all Berlin.\n\nOrdinary citizens of the Western Allied powers, not formally affiliated with the Allied forces, were authorized to use all designated transit routes through East Germany to and from West Berlin. Regarding travel to East Berlin, such persons could also use the Friedrichstra\u00dfe train station to enter and exit the city, in addition to Checkpoint Charlie. In these instances, such travelers, unlike Allied personnel, had to submit to East German border controls.<ref name=\"mashable.com\"/>\n\n===Defection attempts===\n{{further|List of deaths at the Berlin Wall}}\n[[File:East German Guard - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[National People's Army|NVA]] soldier [[Conrad Schumann]] [[defection|defecting]] to West Berlin during the Wall's early days in 1961.]]\nDuring the years of the Wall, around 5,000 people successfully defected to West Berlin.
