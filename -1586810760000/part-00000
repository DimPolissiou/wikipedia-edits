The book follows up with heavy topics such as colorism within the south Asian community and the islamophobia he faced before and after the [[September 11 attacks]]. For more lighthearted episodes of Tan's life he describes his first trip to NYC, how he got involved in fashion, how he secretly and hilariously switched major course and how he fell in love with his husband.

Bands like [[Peter og Ulvene]], [[Sir Henry and his Butlers]], [[The Beefeaters]] and later on [[Steppeulvene]] (the Steppenwolves), [[Alrune Rod]] and [[Savage Rose]] were among the popular bands in Denmark throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. Still, Danish rock and pop music in those days resembled more of German schlager than American or British rock.\n\nThe Danish rock scene thrived in the 1970s when groups drew on trends in the United States and Britain. Many consider their style to be Danish although this seems mainly to be due to the language of the songs and the way they fit into the national agenda. The most successful have been [[Gasolin']], [[Shu-Bi-Dua]], [[Sebastian (Danish musician)|Sebastian]], [[Anne Linnet]], [[Gnags]], [[TV-2 (band)|TV-2]], and more recently [[Magtens Korridorer]].

The financing of the music schools are divided among state, municipality and students (or parents of students). \n\n==Music in everyday life==\nMusic is an important part of the lives of most Danes. One of the carefully observed traditions is to include music at celebrations at large, including family oriented ones such as wedding parties, birthdays and anniversaries. Indeed, it is not only common to engage one or more musicians for dancing but it is usual for the guests to write songs, normally to well-known traditional tunes, in honour of those to be celebrated.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Livsstil,_sport_og_fritid/Underholdning_og_spil/Forestillinger_og_forlystelser/Fest \"Fest\"], ''Den store Danske''. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 18 March 2010.</ref>\n\nThere is also a popular tradition of choir singing.

''[[Der er et yndigt land]]'' (There is a Lovely Country) is sung loudly and enthusiastically at sporting events and is the most popular. Lyrics are by the Danish poet [[Adam Oehlenschl\u00e4ger]] and music by [[Hans Ernst Kr\u00f8yer]]. ''[[Kong Kristian stod ved h\u00f8jen mast]]'' (King Christian stood by tow'ring mast), is sung on official occasions when the royal family is represented.

[[Rake-and-scrape]] music is a unique type of instrumental music made by bending a saw and scraping with a small object, most typically a [[screwdriver]]; it is used to accompany dances derived from European forms like [[polka]] and [[waltz]].  Rake-and-scrape's popularity has been declining in recent years, but performers like [[Lassie Do and the Boys]] continue to keep the tradition alive.

The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake and scrape became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=bp94R0EiBn4C&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=nassau+guardian+concertinas+1886#v=onepage&q=nassau%20guardian%20concertinas%201886&f=false | title=Funky Nassau: Roots, Routes, and Representation in Bahamian Popular Music| isbn=9780520265684| last1=Rommen| first1=Timothy| date=19 May 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.bahamasentertainers.com/Paper/rkeNscr.html</ref>\n\n==Organology of instruments==\n\nMembranophones: The [[Goombay]] drum is main rhythmic component in rake-n-scrape. It is also referred to a goatskin drum, as the skin of a goat was stretched over a wooden barrel. It is decorated by simple or complex geometric designs in bright colors. The drum is always heated over fire to retain its tone. In 1971, when manufacturers started shipping products in metal barrels, Bahamians switched the drum to metal, slightly changing the tone of the drum.<ref>Ingraham 368</ref>\n\nIdiophones: The main component that makes Rake-N-Scrape unique is the use of the Carpenter's Saw. This instrument is scraped with a nail or butter knife. Bent against the body of the player and flexed, various timbral effects are obtained.<ref>Ingraham 369</ref> In more modern music, the saw is replaced with maracas or a guiro.<ref>Rommen 173</ref>\n\nAerophones: The accordion is the component that adds the round form which enables dancers to dance the ring dance. This is of European descent. In more modern bands, it is replaced by an electric guitar or electronic keyboard.<ref>Ingraham 369</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bahamian musicians]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n*Kaliss, Jeff. \"Junkanoo and Sloop John B.\". 2000.

Christian [[rhyming spiritual]]s and the ''[[ant'em]]s'' of [[sponge fishing|sponge fishermen]] are now mostly dead traditions, decimated by the arrival of pop music, a 1930s sponge blight and other causes.\n\n[[E. Clement Bethel]]'s master's thesis on traditional Bahamian music was adapted for the stage by his daughter, [[Nicolette Bethel]] and [[Philip A. Burrows]].  ''[[Music of The Bahamas]]'' was first performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1991, and was revived in 2002 for fresh Bahamian audiences.  A recording of that show is available for sale from [[Ringplay Productions]].\n\n==Rake and scrape== \n{{Main|Rake-and-scrape}}\n[[Rake and scrape Music|Rake and scrape]] music is played traditionally with [[Concertinas]], [[Goombay drums]], and a [[Handsaw]]. Rake and scrape is believed to have originated on the island of Cat Island but evidence suggest that it was emerging in many places simultaneously. The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake and scrape became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=bp94R0EiBn4C&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=nassau+guardian+concertinas+1886#v=onepage&q=nassau%20guardian%20concertinas%201886&f=false | title=Funky Nassau: Roots, Routes, and Representation in Bahamian Popular Music| isbn=9780520265684| last1=Rommen| first1=Timothy| date=19 May 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.bahamasentertainers.com/Paper/rkeNscr.html</ref>\n\n==Organology of instruments==\n\nMembranophones: The [[Goombay]] drum is main rhythmic component in rake-n-scrape. It is also referred to a goatskin drum, as the skin of a goat was stretched over a wooden barrel. It is decorated by simple or complex geometric designs in bright colors. The drum is always heated over fire to retain its tone. In 1971, when manufacturers started shipping products in metal barrels, Bahamians switched the drum to metal, slightly changing the tone of the drum.<ref>Ingraham 368</ref>\n\nIdiophones: The main component that makes Rake-N-Scrape unique is the use of the Carpenter's Saw. This instrument is scraped with a nail or butter knife. Bent against the body of the player and flexed, various timbral effects are obtained.<ref>Ingraham 369</ref> In more modern music, the saw is replaced with maracas or a guiro.<ref>Rommen 173</ref>\n\nAerophones: The accordion is the component that adds the round form which enables dancers to dance the ring dance. This is of European descent. In more modern bands, it is replaced by an electric guitar or electronic keyboard.<ref>Ingraham 369</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Bahamian musicians]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n*Kaliss, Jeff. \"Junkanoo and Sloop John B.\". 2000.

Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported and seen. Older examples of any given technology are found often.

The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Ma, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being the [[Australopithecus anamensis]].

This is coincident with the complete collapse of the already-fledgling [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. This event is followed by the beginning of the Iron age. We define the iron age as ending in 510 BC for the purposes of this article, even though the typical definition is region-dependent (e.g. 510 BC in Greece, 322 BC in India, 200 BC in China), thus being an 800-year period.\n\nIt's worth noting the uncertainty in dating several Indian developments between 600 BC and 300 AD, due to the tradition that existed of editing existing documents  (such as the Sushruta Samhita and Arthashastra) without specifically documenting the edit. Most such documents were canonized at the start of the Gupta empire (mid-3rd century AD).\n\n* 1300 BC: [[Iron smelting]] in either [[India]] or the [[Middle East]].<ref name=UCP>Early Antiquity By I.M.

The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 ([[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Ma, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being the [[Australopithecus anamensis]].

This is coincident with the complete collapse of the already-fledgling [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. This event is followed by the beginning of the Iron age. We define the iron age as ending in 510 BC for the purposes of this article, even though the typical definition is region-dependent (e.g. 510 BC in Greece, 322 BC in India, 200 BC in China), thus being an 800-year period.\n\nIt's worth noting the uncertainty in dating several Indian developments between 600 BC and 300 AD, due to the tradition that existed of editing existing documents  (such as the Sushruta Samhita and Arthashastra) without specifically documenting the edit. Most such documents were canonized at the start of the Gupta empire (mid-3rd century AD).\n\n* 1300 BC: [[Iron smelting]] in either [[India]] or the [[Middle East]].<ref name=UCP>Early Antiquity By I.M.
