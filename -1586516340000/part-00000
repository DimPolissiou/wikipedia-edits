Figure last adapted by user Leonid 2.]]\n\nDuring the first 3 months of pregnancy, the main form of hemoglobin in the embryo/fetus is [[embryonic hemoglobin]], which has 3 variants depending on the types of subunits it contains. The production of hemoglobin F starts from week 6, but it's only from 3 months onwards that it becomes the main type found in fetal red blood cells.<ref name=\"Barbara2017\"/>\nThe switch to produce adult forms of hemoglobin (essentially Hemoglobin A) starts at around 40 weeks of gestation, which is close to the expected time of birth.<ref name=\"David 1998\"/> At birth, hemoglobin F accounts for 50-95% of the infant's hemoglobin and at around 6 months after birth, hemoglobin A becomes the predominant type. By the time the baby is one year old, the proportions of different types of hemoglobin are expected to approximate the adult levels, with hemoglobin F reduced to very low levels.<ref name=\"Barbara2017\" /> The small proportion of red blood cells containing hemoglobin F are called F-cells.\n\nIn healthy adults, the composition of hemoglobin is hemoglobin A (~97%), hemoglobin A2 (2.2 - 3.5%) and hemoglobin F (<1%).<ref name=\"Caroline 2012\">{{Cite journal | author=Caroline T & Andrew L| title= Physiology of haemoglobin| journal=[[Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain]] | volume=12(5) |year=2012 | pages=251\u2013256 | doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mks025 }}</ref>\n\nCertain genetic abnormalities can cause the switch to adult hemoglobin synthesis to fail, resulting in a condition known as [[hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin]] (HPFH).\n\n==Binding to oxygen==\n===Why hemoglobin F has higher oxygen affinity===\nThe 4 hemes, which are the oxygen-binding parts of hemoglobin, are similar between hemoglobin F and other types of hemoglobin, including hemoglobin A. Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">  {{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}} </ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG. Due to the preference of 2,3-BPG for hemoglobin A, hemoglobin F binds to oxygen with more affinity, in average.<ref name=\"Duane 2016\"> {{cite web |url=https://biosci.mcdb.ucsb.edu/biochemistry/tw-hbn/hbf/hbf-overview.htm\n|title= Comparing the molecular structure differences between HbF and HbA that affect BPG binding|last= Sears|first= Duane|date= 2016|website= https://biosci.mcdb.ucsb.edu/|publisher= Biosci Portal |access-date= 11 March 2020}} </ref>\n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the minimum concentration of oxygen needed for 50% of the hemoglobin molecules to bind to it.<ref name=\"Vibhu2006\">  {{Cite book | authors= Awasthi V, Goins E and Phillips W| title= Blood Substitutes| year=2006 | chapter=Chapter 43 \u2013 Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin: history, preparation and evaluation | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-759760-7}} </ref> For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A. This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so. Therefore, a lower P50 means stronger binding or higher affinity for oxygen. \n\nFor reference, the P50 of fetal hemoglobin is roughly 19 mmHg (a measure of pressure), whereas adult hemoglobin is approximately 26.8 mmHg (see [[Blood gas tension]]).<ref name=\"Yacov2017\">  {{Cite book | authors= Yacov R, Derek K and Namasivayam A| title= Assisted Ventilation of the Neonate (sixth edition)| year=2017 | chapter=Chapter 10 \u2013 Blood gases: technical aspects and interpretation | publisher=Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-323-39006-4 }} </ref>\n\n\n==Oxygen exchange in the womb==\nDuring pregnancy, the mother\u2019s circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and carries away nutrient-depleted blood enriched with carbon dioxide. The maternal and fetal blood circulations are separate and the exchange of molecules occurs through the placenta, in a region called [[intervillous space]] which is located in between maternal and fetal blood vessels .<ref name=\"Wang Y & Zhao S\">   </ref>\n\nFocusing on oxygen exchange, there are 3 important aspects that allow it to pass from the maternal circulation into the fetal circulation. Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin. Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\"> {{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }} </ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin. At the same time, the decrease in carbon dioxide in fetal blood makes it more alkaline and favours the uptake of oxygen. This is called the Bohr effect or [[Haldane effect]], which also happens in the air exchange in the lungs.<ref name=\"Sarah2015\"> {{cite journal | authors=Griffiths S and Campbell J |title= Placental structure, function and drug transfer |journal= Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=84-89 |date=2015 |doi= 10.1093/bjaceaccp/mku013}} </ref> All of these 3 factors are present simultaneously and cooperate to improve the fetus\u2019 access to oxygen.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Treatment of sickle-cell disease===\n[[Image:Sicklecells.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Increasing the body's production of fetal hemoglobin is used as a strategy to treat [[sickle-cell disease]].]]\n\n{{main article|Sickle-cell disease#Hydroxyurea}}\n\nWhen fetal hemoglobin production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA).

There are 2 very similar [[gene]]s that code for the \u03b1 subunit, [[HBA1]] and [[HBA2]]. The protein that they produce is identical, but they differ in gene regulatory regions that determine when or how much of the protein is produced. This leads to HBA1 and HBA2 each contributing with 40% and 60%, respectively, of the total of \u03b1 subunits produced.

Figure last adapted by user Leonid 2.]]\n\nDuring the first 3 months of pregnancy, the main form of hemoglobin in the embryo/fetus is [[embryonic hemoglobin]], which has 3 variants depending on the types of subunits it contains. The production of hemoglobin F starts from week 6, but it's only from 3 months onwards that it becomes the main type found in fetal red blood cells.<ref name=\"Barbara2017\"/>\nThe switch to produce adult forms of hemoglobin (essentially Hemoglobin A) starts at around 40 weeks of gestation, which is close to the expected time of birth.<ref name=\"David 1998\"/> At birth, hemoglobin F accounts for 50-95% of the infant's hemoglobin and at around 6 months after birth, hemoglobin A becomes the predominant type. By the time the baby is one year old, the proportions of different types of hemoglobin are expected to approximate the adult levels, with hemoglobin F reduced to very low levels.<ref name=\"Barbara2017\" /> \n\nIn healthy adults, the composition of hemoglobin is hemoglobin A (~97%), hemoglobin A2 (2.2 - 3.5%) and hemoglobin F (<1%).<ref name=\"Caroline 2012\">{{Cite journal | author=Caroline T & Andrew L| title= Physiology of haemoglobin| journal=[[Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain]] | volume=12(5) |year=2012 | pages=251\u2013256 | doi=10.1093/bjaceaccp/mks025 }}</ref>\n\nCertain genetic abnormalities can cause the switch to adult hemoglobin synthesis to fail, resulting in a condition known as [[hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin]] (HPFH).\n\n==Binding to oxygen==\n===Why hemoglobin F has higher oxygen affinity===\nThe 4 hemes, which are the oxygen-binding parts of hemoglobin, are similar between hemoglobin F and other types of hemoglobin, including hemoglobin A. Thus, the key feature that allows hemoglobin F to bind more strongly to oxygen is by having \u03b3 subunits (instead of \u03b2, for example). In fact, some naturally existing molecules in our body can bind to hemoglobin and change its binding affinity for oxygen. One of the molecules is [[2,3-bisphosphoglycerate|2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG)]] and it enhances hemoglobin\u2019s ability to release oxygen.<ref name=\"Gerald 2018\">  {{Cite book | authors= Litwack G| title= Human Biochemistry | year=2018 | chapter=Chapter 8 \u2013 Glycolysis and Glocuneogenesis | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-383864-3}} </ref> 2,3-BPG interacts much more with hemoglobin A than hemoglobin F. This is because the adult \u03b2 subunit has more positive charges than the fetal \u03b3 subunit, which attract the negative charges from 2,3-BPG. Due to the preference of 2,3-BPG for hemoglobin A, hemoglobin F binds to oxygen with more affinity, in average.<ref name=\"Duane 2016\"> {{cite web |url=https://biosci.mcdb.ucsb.edu/biochemistry/tw-hbn/hbf/hbf-overview.htm\n|title= Comparing the molecular structure differences between HbF and HbA that affect BPG binding|last= Sears|first= Duane|date= 2016|website= https://biosci.mcdb.ucsb.edu/|publisher= Biosci Portal |access-date= 11 March 2020}} </ref>\n\n===Quantification of oxygen binding=== \nTo quantify how strongly a certain type of hemoglobin binds to oxygen (or its affinity for oxygen), a parameter called P50 is often used. In a given situation, P50 can be understood as the minimum concentration of oxygen needed for 50% of the hemoglobin molecules to bind to it.<ref name=\"Vibhu2006\">  {{Cite book | authors= Awasthi V, Goins E and Phillips W| title= Blood Substitutes| year=2006 | chapter=Chapter 43 \u2013 Liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin: history, preparation and evaluation | publisher=Academic press| isbn = 978-0-12-759760-7}} </ref> For example, Hemoglobin F has a lower P50 than hemoglobin A. This means that if we have the same amount of hemoglobin F and hemoglobin A in the blood and add oxygen to it, half of hemoglobin F will bind to oxygen before half of hemoglobin A manages to do so. Therefore, a lower P50 means stronger binding or higher affinity for oxygen. \n\nFor reference, the P50 of fetal hemoglobin is roughly 19 mmHg (a measure of pressure), whereas adult hemoglobin is approximately 26.8 mmHg (see [[Blood gas tension]]).<ref name=\"Yacov2017\">  {{Cite book | authors= Yacov R, Derek K and Namasivayam A| title= Assisted Ventilation of the Neonate (sixth edition)| year=2017 | chapter=Chapter 10 \u2013 Blood gases: technical aspects and interpretation | publisher=Elsevier| isbn = 978-0-323-39006-4 }} </ref>\n\n\n==Oxygen exchange in the womb==\nDuring pregnancy, the mother\u2019s circulatory system delivers oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and carries away nutrient-depleted blood enriched with carbon dioxide. The maternal and fetal blood circulations are separate and the exchange of molecules occurs through the placenta, in a region called [[intervillous space]] which is located in between maternal and fetal blood vessels .<ref name=\"Wang Y & Zhao S\">   </ref>\n\nFocusing on oxygen exchange, there are 3 important aspects that allow it to pass from the maternal circulation into the fetal circulation. Firstly, the presence of hemoglobin F in the fetus allows a stronger binding to oxygen than maternal hemoglobin. Secondly, the mother\u2019s bloodstream is richer in oxygen that the fetus\u2019, so oxygen naturally flows towards the fetal circulation by diffusion.<ref name=\"Metcalfe1967\"> {{cite journal | authors=Metcalfe J, Bartels H and Moll W |title= Gas exchange in the pregnant uterus.  |journal= Physiological reviews |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=782-838 |date=1967 |doi= 10.1152/physrev.1967.47.4.782 }} </ref> The final factor is related to the effects of pH on maternal and fetal hemoglobin. As the maternal blood acquires more carbon dioxide, it becomes more acidic and favours the release of oxygen by the maternal hemoglobin. At the same time, the decrease in carbon dioxide in fetal blood makes it more alkaline and favours the uptake of oxygen. This is called the Bohr effect or [[Haldane effect]], which also happens in the air exchange in the lungs.<ref name=\"Sarah2015\"> {{cite journal | authors=Griffiths S and Campbell J |title= Placental structure, function and drug transfer |journal= Continuing Education in Anaesthesia Critical Care & Pain |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=84-89 |date=2015 |doi= 10.1093/bjaceaccp/mku013}} </ref> All of these 3 factors are present simultaneously and cooperate to improve the fetus\u2019 access to oxygen.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Treatment of sickle-cell disease===\n[[Image:Sicklecells.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Increasing the body's production of fetal hemoglobin is used as a strategy to treat [[sickle-cell disease]].]]\n\n{{main article|Sickle-cell disease#Hydroxyurea}}\n\nWhen fetal hemoglobin production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA).

[[Kottayam Port]] is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2020}}\n\nKottayam is home to one of the first English schools in India, and is a leader in literacy, known as '''Akshara Nagari''' (English: land of letters).

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]]. \n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi. Rulers of Munjanad and Thekkumkur had their headquarters at Thazhathangadi in the present Kottayam town. Marthanda Varma of Travancore attacked Thekkumkur and destroyed the palace and the Thaliyil fort. The remnants of the palaces and forts are still seen here.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] of England established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first college in India.

[[Kottayam Port]] is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2020}}\n\nKottayam is home to one of the first English schools in India, and is a leader in literacy, known as '''Akshara Nagari''' (English: land of letters).

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]]. \n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi. Rulers of Munjanad and Thekkumkur had their headquarters at Thazhathangadi in the present Kottayam town. Marthanda Varma of Travancore attacked Thekkumkur and destroyed the palace and the Thaliyil fort. The remnants of the palaces and forts are still seen here.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A.

After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] of England established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first college in India.
