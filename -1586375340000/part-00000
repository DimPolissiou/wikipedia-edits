Carey, R.J. Sundberg Plenum Press {{ISBN|0-306-41198-9}}</ref> This notion does not follow from elemental [[thermochemistry]] or [[chemical kinetics]] and was introduced by Hammett intuitively.<ref>The opening line in his 1935 publication reads: ''The idea that there is some sort of relationship between the rate of a reaction and the equilibrium constant is one of the most persistently held and at the same time most emphatically denied concepts in chemical theory''</ref>\n\nThe basic equation is:\n\n<math>\\log \\frac{K}{K_0} = \\sigma\\rho </math>\n\nrelating the [[equilibrium constant]], K, for a given equilibrium reaction with substituent R and the reference K<sub>0</sub> constant when R is a hydrogen atom to the '''substituent constant''' [[sigma|\u03c3]] which depends only on the specific substituent R and the '''reaction constant''' [[rho|\u03c1]] which depends only on the type of reaction but not on the substituent used.\n\nThe equation also holds for [[reaction rate]]s k of a series of reactions with substituted benzene derivatives:\n\n<math>\\log \\frac{k}{k_0} = \\sigma\\rho. </math>\n\nIn this equation k<sub>0</sub> is the reference reaction rate of the unsubstituted reactant, and k that of a substituted reactant.\n\nA plot of log(K/K<sub>0</sub>) for a given equilibrium versus log(k/k<sub>0</sub>) for a given reaction rate with many differently substituted reactants will give a straight line.\n\n==Substituent constants==\nThe starting point for the collection of the substituent constants is a [[chemical equilibrium]] for which both the substituent constant and the reaction constant are arbitrarily set to 1: the [[ionization]] of [[benzoic acid]] or [[benzene carboxylic acid]] (R and R' both H) in water at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\n[[File:BenzoicAcidDissociation.svg|center|600px|Scheme 1. Dissociation of benzoic acids]]\n\nHaving obtained a value for K<sub>0</sub>, a series of equilibrium constants (K) are now determined based on the same process, but now with variation of the para substituent\u2014for instance, [[p-hydroxybenzoic acid]] (R=OH, R'=H) or p[[4-aminobenzoic acid|-aminobenzoic acid]] (R=NH<sub>2</sub>, R'=H). These values, combined in the Hammett equation with K<sub>0</sub> and remembering that \u03c1 = 1, give the '''para substituent constants''' compiled in table 1 for [[amine]], [[methoxy]], [[ethoxy]], [[dimethylamino]], [[methyl]], [[fluorine]], [[bromine]], [[chlorine]], [[iodine]], [[nitro compound|nitro]] and [[cyano]] substituents. Repeating the process with meta-substituents afford the '''meta substituent constants'''. This treatment does not include [[ortho-]]substituents, which would introduce [[steric effect]]s.\n\nThe \u03c3 values displayed in the Table above reveal certain substituent effects. With \u03c1 = 1, the group of substituents with increasing positive values\u2014notably [[cyano]] and [[nitro compound|nitro]]\u2014cause the equilibrium constant to increase compared to the [[hydrogen]] reference, meaning that the [[acidity]] of the carboxylic acid (depicted on the left of the equation) has increased. These substituents stabilize the negative charge on the carboxylate oxygen atom by an electron-withdrawing [[inductive effect]] (-I) and also by a negative [[mesomeric effect]] (-M).\n\nThe next set of substituents are the [[halogen]]s, for which the substituent effect is still positive but much more modest. The reason for this is that while the [[inductive effect]] is still negative, the [[mesomeric effect]] is positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, the meta effect is much larger than the para effect, due to the fact that the mesomeric effect is greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).\n\nThis effect is depicted in ''scheme 3'', where, in a para substituted arene '''1a''', one [[resonance structure]] '''1b''' is a [[quinoid]] with positive charge on the X substituent, releasing electrons and thus destabilizing the Y substituent. This destabilizing effect is not possible when X has a meta orientation.\n  \n[[Image:HammettInductiveMesomericEffects.png|center|600px|Scheme 3. Hammett Inductive Mesomeric Effects]]\n\nOther substituents, like [[methoxy]] and [[ethoxy]], can even have opposite signs for the substituent constant as a result of opposing inductive and mesomeric effect. Only alkyl and aryl substituents like [[methyl]] are electron-releasing in both respects.\n\nOf course, when the sign for the reaction constant is negative (next section), only substituents with a likewise negative substituent constant will increase equilibrium constants.\n\n=== The \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> constants ===\n{{Unreferenced section|reason=No literature is cited to support this section.|date=March 2020}}\n\nBecause the carbonyl group is unable to serve a source of electrons for -M groups (in contrast to lone pair donors like OH), for reactions involving phenol and aniline starting materials, the \u03c3<sub>p</sub> values for electron-withdrawing groups will appear too small.  For reactions where resonance effects are expected to have a major impact, a modified parameter, and a modified set of \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> constants may give a better fit.  This parameter is defined using the ionization constants of ''para'' substituted phenols, via a scaling factor to match up the values of \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> with those of \u03c3<sub>p</sub> for \"non-anomalous\" substituents, so as to maintain comparable \u03c1 values: for ArOH \u21c4 ArO<sup>\u2013</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>, we define <math>\\sigma_p^- = \\frac{1}{2.11}\\log_{10}(K_\\mathrm{X}/K_\\mathrm{H})</math>.  \n\nLikewise, the carbonyl carbon of a benzoic acid is at a nodal position and unable to serve as a sink for +M groups (in contrast to a carbocation at the benzylic position).  Thus for reactions involving carbocations at the \u03b1-position, the \u03c3<sub>p</sub> values for electron-donating groups will appear insufficiently negative.  Based on similar considerations, a set of \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> constants give better fit for reactions involving electron-donating groups at the ''para'' position and the formation of a carbocation at the benzylic site.  The \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> are based on the ''rate'' constants of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction of cumyl chlorides in 90% acetone/water: for ArCMe<sub>2</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 ArCMe<sub>2</sub>OH + HCl, we define <math>\\sigma_p^+ = -\\frac{1}{4.54}\\log_{10}(k_\\mathrm{X}/k_\\mathrm{H})</math>.  Note that the scaling factor is negative, since an electron-donating group speeds up the reaction.  For a reaction whose Hammett plot is being constructed, these alternative Hammett constants may need to be tested to see if a better linearity could be obtained.\n\n==Rho value==\nWith knowledge of substituent constants it is now possible to obtain reaction constants for a wide range of [[organic reaction]]s. The archetypal reaction is the alkaline [[hydrolysis]] of [[ethyl benzoate]] (R=R'=H) in a water/ethanol mixture at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. Measurement of the [[reaction rate]] k<sub>0</sub> combined with that of many substituted ethyl benzoates ultimately result in a reaction constant of +2.498.<ref name=\"Hammett1937\"/>{{update after|2015|6|23}}{{primary source inline|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:BenzoateEsterHydrolysis.png|center|600px|Scheme 2. Hydrolysis of benzoic acid esters]]\n\nReaction constants are known for many other reactions and equilibria. Here is a selection of those provided by Hammett himself (with their values in parenthesis):\n* the hydrolysis of substituted [[cinnamic acid]] ester in ethanol/water (+1.267)\n* the ionization of substituted [[phenols]] in water (+2.008)\n* the acid catalyzed [[esterification]] of substituted benzoic esters in [[ethanol]] (-0.085)\n* the acid catalyzed bromination of substituted [[acetophenone]]s ([[Ketone halogenation]]) in an [[acetic acid]]/water/hydrochloric acid (+0.417)\n* the hydrolysis of substituted [[benzyl chloride]]s in [[acetone]]-water at 69.8&nbsp;\u00b0C (-1.875).\n\nThe reaction constant, or sensitivity constant, ''\u03c1'', describes the susceptibility of the reaction to substituents, compared to the ionization of benzoic acid. It is equivalent to the slope of the Hammett plot. Information on the reaction and the associated mechanism can be obtained based on the value obtained for ''\u03c1''. If the value of:\n\n# ''\u03c1>1'', the reaction is more sensitive to substituents than benzoic acid and negative charge is built during the reaction (or positive charge is lost).\n# ''0<\u03c1<1'', the reaction is less sensitive to substituents than benzoic acid and negative charge is built (or positive charge is lost).\n# ''\u03c1=0'', no sensitivity to substituents, and no charge is built or lost.\n# ''\u03c1<0'', the reaction builds positive charge (or loses negative charge).\n\nThese relations can be exploited to elucidate the mechanism of a reaction. As the value of ''\u03c1'' is related to the charge during the rate determining step, mechanisms can be devised based on this information. If the mechanism for the reaction of an aromatic compound is thought to occur through one of two mechanisms, the compound can be modified with substituents with different ''\u03c3'' values and kinetic measurements taken. Once these measurements have been made, a Hammett plot can be constructed to determine the value of ''\u03c1''. If one of these mechanisms involves the formation of charge, this can be verified based on the \u03c1 value. Conversely, if the Hammett plot shows that no charge is developed, i.e. a zero slope, the mechanism involving the building of charge can be discarded.\n\nHammett plots may not always be perfectly linear. For instance, a curve may show a sudden change in slope, or ''\u03c1'' value. In such a case, it is likely that the mechanism of the reaction changes upon adding a different substituent. Other deviations from linearity may be due to a change in the position of the transition state. In such a situation, certain substituents may cause the transition state to appear earlier (or later) in the reaction mechanism.<ref>E.V. Anslyn & D.A.

Westheimer's treatment worked well except for those acids with substituents that have unshared electron pairs such as \u2013OH and \u2013OCH3, as these substituents interact strongly with the benzene ring.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01877a012 | author = Westheimer F.H. | title = The Electrostatic effect of substituents on the dissociation constants of organic acids.

A plot of log(k) against log(K<sub>A</sub>) showed a linear relationship. Such linear relationships correspond to linear free energy relationships, which strongly imply that the effect of the substituents are exerted through changes of [[chemical potential|potential energy]] and that the [[steric]] and [[entropy|entropy terms]] remain almost constant through the series. The linear relationship fit well in the Hammett Equation.

However, nonlinearity emerges in the Hammett plot when a substituent affects the rate of reaction or changes the [[rate-determining step]] or [[reaction mechanism]] of the reaction.  For the reason of the former case, new sigma constants have been introduced to accommodate the deviation from linearity otherwise seen resulting from the effect of the substituent.  \u03c3+ takes into account positive charge buildup occurring in the transition state of the reaction.  Therefore, an electron donating group (EDG) will accelerate the rate of the reaction by resonance stabilization and will give the following sigma plot with a negative rho value.<ref>Y. Yukawa & Y.

The EWG withdraws electron density by resonance and effectively stabilizes the negative charge that is generated.  The corresponding plot will show a positive rho value.\n\nIn the case of a [[nucleophilic acyl substitution]] the effect of the substituent, X, of the non-leaving group can in fact accelerate the rate of the nucleophilic addition reaction when X is an EWG. This is attributed to the resonance contribution of the EWG to withdraw electron density thereby increasing the susceptibility for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon.  A change in rate occurs when X is EDG, as is evidenced when comparing the rates between X = Me and X = OMe, and nonlinearity is observed in the Hammett plot.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo035854r | pmid = 15049643 | last1 = Um | first1 = Ik-Hwan | title = Curved Hammett plot in alkaline hydrolysis of ''O''-aryl thionobenzoates: Change in rate-determining step versus ground-state stabilization | journal = [[Journal of Organic Chemistry|J.

If the nucleophile is negatively charged (e.g. cyanide) the electron withdrawing group will increase the rate due to stabilization of the extra charge which is put on the carbon in the transition state. On the other hand, if the nucleophile is not charged (e.g. triphenylphosphine), electron withdrawing group is going to slow down the reaction by decreasing the electron density in the anti bonding orbital of leaving group in the transition state.\n\n==Hammett modifications==\nOther equations now exist that refine the original Hammett equation: the [[Swain\u2013Lupton equation]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} the [[Taft equation]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} the [[Grunwald\u2013Winstein equation]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and the [[Yukawa\u2013Tsuno equation]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} An equation that addresses stereochemistry in aliphatic systems has also been developed.{{vague|date=June 2015}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bols | first1 = Mikael | last2 = Liang | first2 = Xifu | last3 = Jensen | first3 = Henrik H. | title = Equatorial contra axial polar substituents.

Dissociation of benzoic acids]]\n\nHaving obtained a value for K<sub>0</sub>, a series of equilibrium constants (K) are now determined based on the same process, but now with variation of the para substituent\u2014for instance, [[p-hydroxybenzoic acid]] (R=OH, R'=H) or p[[4-aminobenzoic acid|-aminobenzoic acid]] (R=NH<sub>2</sub>, R'=H). These values, combined in the Hammett equation with K<sub>0</sub> and remembering that \u03c1 = 1, give the '''para substituent constants''' compiled in table 1 for [[amine]], [[methoxy]], [[ethoxy]], [[dimethylamino]], [[methyl]], [[fluorine]], [[bromine]], [[chlorine]], [[iodine]], [[nitro compound|nitro]] and [[cyano]] substituents. Repeating the process with meta-substituents afford the '''meta substituent constants'''. This treatment does not include [[ortho-]]substituents, which would introduce [[steric effect]]s.\n\nThe \u03c3 values displayed in the Table above reveal certain substituent effects. With \u03c1 = 1, the group of substituents with increasing positive values\u2014notably [[cyano]] and [[nitro compound|nitro]]\u2014cause the equilibrium constant to increase compared to the [[hydrogen]] reference, meaning that the [[acidity]] of the carboxylic acid (depicted on the left of the equation) has increased. These substituents stabilize the negative charge on the carboxylate oxygen atom by an electron-withdrawing [[inductive effect]] (-I) and also by a negative [[mesomeric effect]] (-M).\n\nThe next set of substituents are the [[halogen]]s, for which the substituent effect is still positive but much more modest. The reason for this is that while the [[inductive effect]] is still negative, the [[mesomeric effect]] is positive, causing partial cancellation. The data also show that for these substituents, the meta effect is much larger than the para effect, due to the fact that the mesomeric effect is greatly reduced in a meta substituent. With meta substituents a carbon atom bearing the negative charge is further away from the carboxylic acid group (structure 2b).\n\nThis effect is depicted in ''scheme 3'', where, in a para substituted arene '''1a''', one [[resonance structure]] '''1b''' is a [[quinoid]] with positive charge on the X substituent, releasing electrons and thus destabilizing the Y substituent. This destabilizing effect is not possible when X has a meta orientation.\n  \n[[Image:HammettInductiveMesomericEffects.png|center|600px|Scheme 3. Hammett Inductive Mesomeric Effects]]\n\nOther substituents, like [[methoxy]] and [[ethoxy]], can even have opposite signs for the substituent constant as a result of opposing inductive and mesomeric effect. Only alkyl and aryl substituents like [[methyl]] are electron-releasing in both respects.\n\nOf course, when the sign for the reaction constant is negative (next section), only substituents with a likewise negative substituent constant will increase equilibrium constants.\n\n=== The \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> and \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> constants {{Unreferenced section|reason=No literature is cited to support this section.|date=March 2020}}===\n\nBecause the carbonyl group is unable to serve a source of electrons for -M groups (in contrast to lone pair donors like OH), for reactions involving phenol and aniline starting materials, the \u03c3<sub>p</sub> values for electron-withdrawing groups will appear too small.  For reactions where resonance effects are expected to have a major impact, a modified parameter, and a modified set of \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> constants may give a better fit.  This parameter is defined using the ionization constants of ''para'' substituted phenols, via a scaling factor to match up the values of \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>\u2013</sup> with those of \u03c3<sub>p</sub> for \"non-anomalous\" substituents, so as to maintain comparable \u03c1 values: for ArOH \u21c4 ArO<sup>\u2013</sup> + H<sup>+</sup>, we define <math>\\sigma_p^- = \\frac{1}{2.11}\\log_{10}(K_\\mathrm{X}/K_\\mathrm{H})</math>.  \n\nLikewise, the carbonyl carbon of a benzoic acid is at a nodal position and unable to serve as a sink for +M groups (in contrast to a carbocation at the benzylic position).  Thus for reactions involving carbocations at the \u03b1-position, the \u03c3<sub>p</sub> values for electron-donating groups will appear insufficiently negative.  Based on similar considerations, a set of \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> constants give better fit for reactions involving electron-donating groups at the ''para'' position and the formation of a carbocation at the benzylic site.  The \u03c3<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> are based on the ''rate'' constants of the S<sub>N</sub>1 reaction of cumyl chlorides in 90% acetone/water: for ArCMe<sub>2</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 ArCMe<sub>2</sub>OH + HCl, we define <math>\\sigma_p^+ = -\\frac{1}{4.54}\\log_{10}(k_\\mathrm{X}/k_\\mathrm{H})</math>.  Note that the scaling factor is negative, since an electron-donating group speeds up the reaction.  For a reaction whose Hammett plot is being constructed, these alternative Hammett constants may need to be tested to see if a better linearity could be obtained.\n\n==Rho value==\nWith knowledge of substituent constants it is now possible to obtain reaction constants for a wide range of [[organic reaction]]s. The archetypal reaction is the alkaline [[hydrolysis]] of [[ethyl benzoate]] (R=R'=H) in a water/ethanol mixture at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. Measurement of the [[reaction rate]] k<sub>0</sub> combined with that of many substituted ethyl benzoates ultimately result in a reaction constant of +2.498.<ref name=\"Hammett1937\"/>{{update after|2015|6|23}}{{primary source inline|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Image:BenzoateEsterHydrolysis.png|center|600px|Scheme 2. Hydrolysis of benzoic acid esters]]\n\nReaction constants are known for many other reactions and equilibria. Here is a selection of those provided by Hammett himself (with their values in parenthesis):\n* the hydrolysis of substituted [[cinnamic acid]] ester in ethanol/water (+1.267)\n* the ionization of substituted [[phenols]] in water (+2.008)\n* the acid catalyzed [[esterification]] of substituted benzoic esters in [[ethanol]] (-0.085)\n* the acid catalyzed bromination of substituted [[acetophenone]]s ([[Ketone halogenation]]) in an [[acetic acid]]/water/hydrochloric acid (+0.417)\n* the hydrolysis of substituted [[benzyl chloride]]s in [[acetone]]-water at 69.8&nbsp;\u00b0C (-1.875).\n\nThe reaction constant, or sensitivity constant, ''\u03c1'', describes the susceptibility of the reaction to substituents, compared to the ionization of benzoic acid. It is equivalent to the slope of the Hammett plot. Information on the reaction and the associated mechanism can be obtained based on the value obtained for ''\u03c1''. If the value of:\n\n# ''\u03c1>1'', the reaction is more sensitive to substituents than benzoic acid and negative charge is built during the reaction (or positive charge is lost).\n# ''0<\u03c1<1'', the reaction is less sensitive to substituents than benzoic acid and negative charge is built (or positive charge is lost).\n# ''\u03c1=0'', no sensitivity to substituents, and no charge is built or lost.\n# ''\u03c1<0'', the reaction builds positive charge (or loses negative charge).\n\nThese relations can be exploited to elucidate the mechanism of a reaction. As the value of ''\u03c1'' is related to the charge during the rate determining step, mechanisms can be devised based on this information. If the mechanism for the reaction of an aromatic compound is thought to occur through one of two mechanisms, the compound can be modified with substituents with different ''\u03c3'' values and kinetic measurements taken. Once these measurements have been made, a Hammett plot can be constructed to determine the value of ''\u03c1''. If one of these mechanisms involves the formation of charge, this can be verified based on the \u03c1 value. Conversely, if the Hammett plot shows that no charge is developed, i.e. a zero slope, the mechanism involving the building of charge can be discarded.\n\nHammett plots may not always be perfectly linear. For instance, a curve may show a sudden change in slope, or ''\u03c1'' value. In such a case, it is likely that the mechanism of the reaction changes upon adding a different substituent. Other deviations from linearity may be due to a change in the position of the transition state. In such a situation, certain substituents may cause the transition state to appear earlier (or later) in the reaction mechanism.<ref>E.V. Anslyn & D.A.

Westheimer demonstrated that the electrical effects of \u03c0-substituted dipolar groups on the acidities of [[benzoic acid|benzoic]] and [[phenylacetic acid]]s can be quantitatively correlated, by assuming only direct electrostatic action of the substituent on the ionizable proton of the [[carboxyl group]]. Westheimer's treatment worked well except for those acids with substituents that have unshared electron pairs such as \u2013OH and \u2013OCH3, as these substituents interact strongly with the benzene ring.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01877a012 | author = Westheimer F.H. | title = The Electrostatic effect of substituents on the dissociation constants of organic acids.

A plot of log(k) against log(K<sub>A</sub>) showed a linear relationship. Such linear relationships correspond to linear free energy relationships, which strongly imply that the effect of the substituents are exerted through changes of [[chemical potential|potential energy]] and that the [[steric]] and [[entropy|entropy terms]] remain almost constant through the series. The linear relationship fit well in the Hammett Equation.

However, nonlinearity emerges in the Hammett plot when a substituent affects the rate of reaction or changes the [[rate-determining step]] or [[reaction mechanism]] of the reaction.  For the reason of the former case, new sigma constants have been introduced to accommodate the deviation from linearity otherwise seen resulting from the effect of the substituent.  \u03c3+ takes into account positive charge buildup occurring in the transition state of the reaction.  Therefore, an electron donating group (EDG) will accelerate the rate of the reaction by resonance stabilization and will give the following sigma plot with a negative rho value.<ref>Y. Yukawa & Y.

The EWG withdraws electron density by resonance and effectively stabilizes the negative charge that is generated.  The corresponding plot will show a positive rho value.\n\nIn the case of a [[nucleophilic acyl substitution]] the effect of the substituent, X, of the non-leaving group can in fact accelerate the rate of the nucleophilic addition reaction when X is an EWG. This is attributed to the resonance contribution of the EWG to withdraw electron density thereby increasing the susceptibility for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon.  A change in rate occurs when X is EDG, as is evidenced when comparing the rates between X = Me and X = OMe, and nonlinearity is observed in the Hammett plot.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo035854r | pmid = 15049643 | last1 = Um | first1 = Ik-Hwan | title = Curved Hammett plot in alkaline hydrolysis of ''O''-aryl thionobenzoates: Change in rate-determining step versus ground-state stabilization | journal = [[Journal of Organic Chemistry|J.

To clearly articulate the essential and unique activities of human use ... represents, for me, the excitement of the design process.<ref name=\"Emanuel\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Critical assessment==\nKent Hurley says that Clifford Wiens was able \"to distill a building to its essence and to express the distillation in simple floor plans and eye-catching forms\", pointing out that Wiens is evidently preoccupied with \"rigid and simple geometry\" in his \"formal and static\" plans, but \"lightens his seriousness\" in the three-dimensional form itself, where he \"achieves some of the memorable effects that have enhanced his reputation.\"\"<ref name=\"Emanuel\" />\n\nWilliam P. Thompson describes Wiens' work as reflecting both [[corporate architecture|corporate]] [[modern architecture]] and the broader [[expressionist architecture|expressionist]] movement, with a distinctive approach to structure and form; an experimental [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], but with \"an expressive formal aesthetic and a respectful sensitivity to context and the surrounding landscape.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> A conscious reference to the ubiquitous prairie horizon is Wiens' most persistent structural signature, as he himself points out in an episode of ''Edifice & Us'':<blockquote>I like to create this horizon line right through the building, and I get a lot of pleasure out of doing that and you find that a lot in my buildings.

To clearly articulate the essential and unique activities of human use ... represents, for me, the excitement of the design process.<ref name=\"Emanuel\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Critical assessment==\nKent Hurley says that Clifford Wiens was able \"to distill a building to its essence and to express the distillation in simple floor plans and eye-catching forms\", pointing out that Wiens is evidently preoccupied with \"rigid and simple geometry\" in his \"formal and static\" plans, but \"lightens his seriousness\" in the three-dimensional form itself, where he \"achieves some of the memorable effects that have enhanced his reputation.\"\"<ref name=\"Emanuel\" />\n\nWilliam P. Thompson describes Wiens' work as reflecting both [[corporate architecture|corporate]] [[modern architecture]] and the broader [[expressionist architecture|expressionist]] movement, with a distinctive approach to structure and form; an experimental [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]], but with \"an expressive formal aesthetic and a respectful sensitivity to context and the surrounding landscape.\"<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> A conscious reference to the ubiquitous prairie horizon is Wiens' most persistent structural signature, as he himself points out in an episode of ''Edifice & Us'':<blockquote>I like to create this horizon line right through the building, and I get a lot of pleasure out of doing that and you find that a lot in my buildings. There's a line going right through as if the building is floating... What belongs to the ground belongs to the ground and what belongs to the sky belongs to the sky and they all just meet on the horizon line.<ref name=\"Wolfson\">{{cite web |last1=Wolfson |first1=Steve (director) |title=Architect Clifford Wiens Industrial Chic |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtveUhqGdtQ&list=PLhdQmDNFVDBiBqy4nLVFRzr2wwmrOOP_C&index=11&t=0s |via=YouTube |accessdate=26 January 2020 |format=video (TV broadcast)}}</ref></blockquote>\nHurley emphasizes this \"standard technique\" in his own assessment, suggesting that Wiens wants to do two things: \"to express in built form the horizontality of his sites and also to interrupt this horizontality visually in order to make his building stand out as an 'event'\"; the \"floating roof structure\" serves as a \"flag\" which Wiens frequently enhances by sinking the base of the building into the ground as in John Nugent's Studio and the Silton Chapel.<ref name=\"Emanuel\" />\n\nBernard Flaman identifies similarities among such diverse works as the Heating and Cooling Plant, the Silton Chapel, and the Nugent Studio despite their \"radically different\" purposes and being formally and materially unique, exhibiting \"strong, simple forms\" and \"ignoring modernism's dogmatic side and the dictum of flat roofs\".<ref name=\"Flaman0\" /> All three find ways of filtering \"the strong prairie sunlight\" and  establish \"a delicate relationship with the landscape.\"<blockquote>Most striking, however, is the way each building springs from the combination of a structural and an architectural idea, beginning with a close analysis of tension and compression elements that are resolved with architectural details of startling invention.<ref name=\"Flaman0\" /></blockquote>\n\nTrevor Boddy summarizes the body of work as a bold range of buildings combining \"the pragmatism and romanticism that co-exist at the heart of prairie culture.\"<ref name=\"Boddy\" /> It is \"widely recognized\" that Wiens was one of three architects from Western Canada (the others being [[Douglas Cardinal]] and [[Etienne Gaboury]]) who were born in and worked across the region and, despite their diverse backgrounds, forged a distinctive \"[[Canadian Prairies|Prairie]]\" regional architecture that blended [[First Nations]] and colonial traditions,<ref name=\"Livesey\" /> but Boddy asserts that Wiens stands out \"even among this distinguished company for the rigour and originality of his construction details, some of them born of his training and parallel career as an industrial designer.\"<ref name=\"Boddy\" /> [[Arthur Erickson]] once declared: \"Not only is he Saskatchewan's finest architect ever, but Clifford Wiens' work is of international importance.\"<ref name=\"Lam\" /> After his death, Boddy said: \"There's almost no debate that Clifford Wiens is the finest architect ever to practice in Saskatchewan.\"<ref name=\"Atter\" /> A month later, he lamented that the architect's reputation has not spread very widely, in part because of his geographic isolation, and that while the work is included in most of the major historical surveys of Canadian architecture, Boddy believes it is underrepresented: \"He was and remains one of the most undocumented of the geniuses of Canadian architecture.\"<ref name=\"Bozikovic\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe architectural archive left by Clifford Wiens resides at the University of Regina.<ref name=\"Lam\" /> The archive, or fonds, includes 5,200 architectural drawings, 100 photographs, about 120 presentation panels, and 19 slides, as well as personal, professional, and business records from 1953 to 1990 (as of January 2020).<ref name=\"Fonds\" />\n\nThere has been a failure of upkeep for many of Wiens' private projects like the Silton Chapel, which Bernard Flaman found coming apart due to moisture rotting the wooden beams in 2015.

They were battles for economic welfare throughout the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley in Canada and the lower [[Great Lakes]] region which pitted the [[Iroquois]] against the northern [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] and the Algonquians' French allies. From medieval times, Europeans had obtained furs from Russia and Scandinavia. American pelts came on the market during the 16th century, decades before the French, English, and Dutch established permanent settlements and trading posts on the continent. [[Basques|Basque]] fishermen chasing cod off Newfoundland's [[Grand Banks]] bartered with local Indians for [[beaver]] robes to help fend off the Atlantic chill. By virtue of their location, the tribes wielded considerable influence in European\u2013Indian relations from the early seventeenth century onwards.\n\nThe Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the [[Ohio Country]] and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Oneida people|Oneida]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]] tribes inhabiting the lands in Upstate New York along the shores of [[Lake Ontario]] east to [[Lake Champlain]] and [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] on the [[Hudson river]], and the lower-estuary of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The [[Iroquois Confederation]] led by the Mohawks mobilized against the largely [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Wyandot language|Huron]] and related tribes of the Great Lakes region. The Iroquois were armed by their Dutch and English trading partners; the Algonquians and Hurons were backed by the French, their chief trading partner.\n\nThe Iroquois effectively destroyed several large tribal confederacies, including the [[Mahicans]] (Mohicans), Huron ([[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]), [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erie people|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]] (Conestoga), and northern [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]]. They became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory, realigning the American tribal geography. The Iroquois gained control of the [[New England]] frontier and [[Ohio River]] valley lands as hunting ground from about 1670 onward.\n\nBoth Algonquian and Iroquoian societies were greatly disrupted by these wars. The conflict subsided when the Iroquois lost their Dutch allies in the [[New Netherland]] colony after England took it over in 1664, with [[Fort Amsterdam]] and the town of [[New Amsterdam]] on Manhattan Island. The French had the objective of gaining the Iroquois as an ally against English encroachment, but they became trading partners with the English. Their alliance was a crucial component of the English western and northern expansion leading to the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763).\n\n==Background==\n{{further|France\u2013Americas relations}}\n[[File:Beaver wars map.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Map showing the approximate location of major tribes and settlements around 1648.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|pp=15, 26}}]]\nFrench explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] in the 1540s made the first written records of the Indians in America, although French explorers and fishermen had traded in the region near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River estuary a decade before then for valuable furs.

The Dutch trading efforts and eventual colonies in New Jersey and Delaware soon also established trade with the coastal [[Delaware nation|Delaware tribe]] (Lenape) and the more southerly [[Susquehannock]] tribe. The Dutch founded [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 and its 1624 replacement [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] (both at Albany) which removed the Iroquois' need to rely on the French and their allied tribes or to travel through southern tribal territories to reach European traders. The Dutch supplied the Mohawks and other Iroquois with guns.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\" /> In addition, the new post offered valuable tools that the Iroquois could receive in exchange for animal pelts.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\" /> They began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\" />{{sfnp|Hine|Faragher|2000|p=67}}\n\nAt this time, conflict began to grow between the Iroquois Confederacy and the tribes supported by the French. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of [[Lake Ontario]] and west of the [[Hudson River]]. Their lands were surrounded on all sides but the south by Algonquian-speaking tribes, all traditional enemies, including the [[Shawnee]] to the west in the [[Ohio Country]], the [[Neutral Nation]] and [[Wyandot people|Huron]] confederacies on the western shore of Lake Ontario and southern shore of Lake Huron to the west, and the Susquehannock to their south. These tribes were historically competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who had Five Nations in their confederacy.\n\n===Beaver Wars begin===\nIn 1628, the Mohawks defeated the [[Mahican]]s, pushing them east of the Hudson River and establishing a monopoly of trade with the Dutch at [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]], [[New Netherland]]. The Susquehannocks were also well armed by Dutch traders, and they effectively reduced the strength of the Delawares and won a protracted war with the English-dominated [[Province of Maryland]].<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\"/> By the 1630s, the Iroquois had become fully armed with European weaponry through their trade with the Dutch.\n[[File:Iroquois Warrior with musket 1730.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Firearms from Dutch traders allowed the Iroquois to wage effective campaigns against the Algonquin and the Huron.]]\nThe Iroquois relied on the trade for firearms and other highly valued European goods for their livelihood and survival. They used their growing expertise with the [[arquebus]] to good effect in their continuing wars with the Algonquins and Hurons, and other traditional enemies. The French, meanwhile, outlawed the trading of firearms to their Indian allies, though they occasionally gave arquebuses as gifts to individuals who converted to Christianity. The Iroquois attacked their traditional enemies the [[Algonquins]], Mahicans, [[Innu|Montagnais]], and [[Hurons]], and the alliance of these tribes with the French quickly brought the Iroquois into conflict directly with the colonists.\n\nThe expansion of the fur trade with Europe brought a decline in the [[American Beaver|beaver]] population in the region, and the animal had largely disappeared from the Hudson Valley by 1640. ''American Heritage Magazine'' notes that the growing scarcity of the beaver in the lands controlled by the Iroquois in the middle 17th century accelerated the wars.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\"/> The center of the fur trade shifted north to the colder regions of southern Ontario, an area controlled by the Neutral and Huron tribes who were close trading partners with the French.\n\n==Course of war==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nWith the decline of the beaver population, the Iroquois began to conquer their smaller neighbors. They attacked the [[Wenro]] in 1638 and took all of their territory, and survivors fled to the Hurons for refuge. The Wenro had served as a buffer between the Iroquois and the Neutral tribe and their Erie allies. The Neutral and Erie tribes were considerably larger and more powerful than the Iroquois, so the Iroquois turned their attention to the north{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=100}} and the Dutch encouraged them in this strategy. At that time, the Dutch were the Iroquois' primary European trading partners, with their goods passing through Dutch trading posts down the [[Hudson River]]. As the Iroquois' sources of furs declined, however, so did the income of the trading posts.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=9}}\n[[File:CharlesHuaultMontmagny.jpg|thumb|upright|New France's governor [[Charles de Montmagny]] rejected peace with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawks]] in 1641 because it would imply abandonment of their Huron allies.]]\nIn 1641, the Mohawks traveled to [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] in New France to propose peace with the French and their allied tribes, and they asked the French to set up a trading post in Iroquoia. Governor [[Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny|Montmagny]] rejected this proposal because it would imply abandonment of their Huron allies.\n\nIn the early 1640s, the war began in earnest with Iroquois attacks on frontier [[Wyandot people|Huron]] villages along the [[St. Lawrence River]] in order to disrupt the trade with the French. In 1645, the French called the tribes together to negotiate a treaty to end the conflict, and Iroquois leaders Deganaweida and Koiseaton traveled to New France to take part in the negotiations.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=101}} The French agreed to most of the Iroquois demands, granting them trading rights in New France. The next summer, a fleet of 80 canoes traveled through Iroquois territory carrying a large harvest of furs to be sold in New France. When they arrived, however, the French refused to purchase the furs and told the Iroquois to sell them to the Hurons, who would act as a middleman. The Iroquois were outraged and resumed the war.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=101}}\n\nThe French decided to become directly involved in the conflict. The Huron and the Iroquois had an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 members each.{{sfnp|Johansen|2006|p=147}} The Hurons and [[Susquehannock]]s formed an alliance to counter Iroquois aggression in 1647, and their warriors greatly outnumbered those of the Iroquois. The Hurons tried to break the Iroquois Confederacy by negotiating a separate peace with the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] and [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]] tribes, but the other tribes intercepted their messengers and put an end to the negotiations. During the summer of 1647, there were several small skirmishes between the tribes, but a more significant battle occurred in 1648 when the two Algonquin tribes passed a fur convoy through an Iroquois blockade. They succeeded and inflicted high casualties on the Iroquois.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=102}} In the early 1650s, the Iroquois began attacking the French themselves, although some of the Iroquois tribes had peaceful relations with them, notably the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and Onondaga tribes. They were under control of the Mohawks, however, who were the strongest tribe in the Confederation and had animosity towards the French presence.  After a failed peace treaty negotiated by [[Chief Canaqueese]], Iroquois moved north into New France along Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River, attacking and blockading Montreal. By 1650, they controlled the area from the Virginia Colony in the south up to the St. Lawrence. In the west, the Iroquois had driven the Algonquin-speaking Shawnee out of the Ohio Country and seized control of the Illinois Country as far west as the Mississippi River. In January 1666, the French invaded the Iroquois and took Chief Canaqueese prisoner. In September, they proceeded down the Richelieu but were unable to find an Iroquois army, so they burned their crops and homes. Many Iroquois died from starvation in the following winter. During the following years, the Iroquois strengthened their confederacy to work more closely and create an effective central leadership, and the five tribes ceased fighting among themselves by the 1660s. They also easily coordinated military and economic plans, and they increased their power as a result.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Long Sault 1660.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] (standing, center) during the [[Battle of Long Sault]], May 1660]]\nIndian raids were not constant, but they terrified the inhabitants of New France, and some of the heroes of French-Canadian folklore are individuals who stood up to such attacks. [[Dollard des Ormeaux]], for example, died in May 1660 while resisting an Iroquois raiding force at the [[Battle of Long Sault]], the confluence of the St. Lawrence and the [[Ottawa River]]s, but saved Montreal by his actions. In 1692, 14 year-old [[Madeleine de Verch\u00e8res|Marie-Madeleine Jarret]] successfully frustrated an Iroquois attack on Fort Verch\u00e8res.\n\n===Defeat of the Huron===\nIn 1648, the Dutch authorized selling guns directly to the Mohawks rather than through traders, and promptly sold 400 to the Iroquois. The Confederacy sent 1,000 newly armed warriors through the woods to Huron territory with the onset of winter, and they launched a devastating attack into the heart of Huron territory, destroying several key villages, killing many warriors, and taking thousands of people captive for later adoption into the tribe. Among those killed were Jesuit missionaries [[Jean Brebeuf]], [[Charles Garnier (missionary)|Charles Garnier]], and [[Gabriel Lallemant]], each of whom is considered a martyr of the Roman Catholic Church. The surviving Hurons fled their territory to seek assistance from the [[Council of Three Fires|Anishinaabeg Confederacy]] in the northern [[Great Lakes]] region. The [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa tribe]] temporarily halted Iroquois expansion further northwest, but the Iroquois controlled a fur-rich region and had no more tribes blocking them from the French settlements in Canada.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Br\u00e9buef-jesuits04jesuuoft.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jean Brebeuf]] was one of several Jesuits killed during the Iroquois attack into the heart of Huron territory.]]\n\nDiseases had taken their toll on the Iroquois and neighbors in the years preceding the war, however, and their populations had drastically declined. To replace lost warriors, they worked to integrate many of their captured enemies by adoption into their own tribes. They invited Jesuits into their territory to teach those who had converted to Christianity. The Jesuits also reached out to the Iroquois, many of whom converted to Roman Catholicism or intermingled its teachings with their own traditional beliefs.{{sfnp|Hine|Faragher|2000|p=68}}\n\n===Defeat of the Erie and Neutral===\nThe Iroquois attacked the [[Neutral Nation|Neutrals]] in 1650, and they completely drove the tribe from traditional territory by the end of 1651, killing or assimilating thousands.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=103}} The Neutrals had inhabited a territory ranging from the [[Niagara Peninsula]] westward to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] valley.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Archaeology Of Southern Ontario To A.D. 1650 |editor-first1=Chris J. |editor-last1=Ellis |editor-first2=Neal |editor-last2=Ferris |year=1990 |publisher=London Chapter of the [[Ontario Archaeological Society]]|isbn=0-919350-13-5 |pages=410\u2013411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IepsAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA410}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, the Iroquois attacked the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]] tribe, but with less success. The war lasted for two years, and the Iroquois destroyed the Erie confederacy by 1656, whose members refused to flee to the west. The Erie territory was located on the southeastern shore of Lake Erie and was estimated to have 12,000 members in 1650.{{sfnp|Lupold|Haddad|1988|p=11}} The Iroquois were greatly outnumbered by the tribes that they subdued, but they achieved their victories through the use of firearms purchased from the Dutch.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=103}}\n\n===French counterattack===\nThe Iroquois continued to control the countryside of New France, raiding to the edges of the walled settlements of Quebec and Montreal. In May 1660, an Iroquois force of 160 warriors attacked Montreal and captured 17 colonists. The following year, 250 warriors attacked and took ten captives.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=60}} In 1661 and 1662, the Iroquois made several raids against the [[Abenakis]] who were allied with the French. The French Crown ordered a change to the governing of Canada. They put together a small military force made up of Frenchmen, Hurons, and Algonquins to counter the Iroquois raids, but the Iroquois attacked them when they ventured into the countryside. Only 29 of the French survived and escaped; five were captured and tortured to death by the Iroquois. Despite their victory, the Iroquois also suffered a significant number of casualties, and their leaders began to consider negotiating for peace with the French.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=59}}\n\nThe tide of war began to turn in the mid-1660s with the arrival of the [[Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment]], a small contingent of regular troops from France and the first group of uniformed professional soldiers in Canada. A change in administration led the New France government to authorize direct sale of arms and other military support to their Indian allies. In 1664, the Dutch allies of the Iroquois lost control of the New Netherland colony to the English. In the immediate years after the Dutch defeat, European support waned for the Iroquois.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=60}}\n[[File:Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In 1666, [[Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy]] led a French force of 1,300 men to attack Mohawk villages in New York.]]\nIn January 1666, the French invaded the Iroquois homeland in New York.

The invasion force of about 1,300 men moved out in the fall of 1666. They found the Mohawk villages deserted, so they destroyed the villages and their crops.<ref name=\"biographi1\"/> Prouville de Tracy seized all the Mohawk lands in the name of the king of France and forced the Mohawks to accept the Roman Catholic faith and to adopt the French language, as taught by Jesuit missionaries.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|pp=104\u2013105}} The Iroquois sued for peace and France agreed.\n\n===Peace with France and Iroquois expansion===\nOnce peace was achieved with the French, the Iroquois returned to their westward conquest in their continued attempt to take control of all the land between the Algonquins and the French. Eastern tribes such as the [[Lakota people|Lakotas]] were pushed across the Mississippi onto the [[Great Plains]] in the early 18th century, where they adopted the horse culture and nomadic lifestyle for which they later became known. Other refugees flooded the Great Lakes area, resulting in a conflict with existing tribes in the region. In the Ohio Country, the [[Shawnee]] and [[Miami tribe]]s were dominant. The Iroquois quickly overran Shawnee holdings in central Ohio, forcing them to flee into Miami territory. The Miamis were a powerful tribe and brought together a confederacy of their neighboring allies, including the [[Pottawatomie]] and the [[Illini confederation]] who inhabited [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]]. The majority of the fighting was between the Anishinaabeg Confederacy and the Iroquois Confederacy.{{sfnp|Funk|1964|p=12}}\n[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map of Iroquois expansion during the war. Peace was re-established with the French in 1666, and the Iroquois returned to their westward conquest of all the land between the French and Algonquin territory.]]\nThe Iroquois improved on their warfare as they continued to attack even farther from their home. War parties often traveled by canoes at night, and they would sink their canoes and fill them with rocks to hold them on the river bottom. They would then move through the woods to a target and burst from the wood to cause the greatest panic. After the attack, they returned to their boats and left before any significant resistance could be put together.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=16}} The lack of firearms caused the Algonquin tribes the greatest disadvantage. Despite their larger numbers, they were not centralized enough to mount a united defense and were unable to withstand the Iroquois. Several tribes ultimately moved west beyond the [[Mississippi River]], leaving much of the Ohio Valley, southern Michigan, and southern Ontario depopulated. Several [[Anishinaabe]] forces numbering in the thousands remained to the north of Lakes Huron and Superior, and they were later decisive in rolling back the Iroquois advance.<ref>Schmalz, Peter S. (1991), ''The Ojibwa of Southern Ontario'', University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|0-8020-2736-9}}</ref> From west of the Mississippi, displaced groups continued to arm war parties and attempt to retake their land.\n\nBeginning in the 1670s, the French began to explore and settle the [[Ohio Country|Ohio]] and [[Illinois Country]] from the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and they established the post of [[Tassinong, Indiana|Tassinong]] to trade with the western tribes. The Iroquois destroyed it to retain control of the fur trade with the Europeans. The Iroquois also drove the [[Mannahoac]] tribe out of the northern [[Virginia Piedmont]] region in 1670, and they claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684, but they acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.\n\nDuring a raid into the Illinois Country in 1689, the Iroquois captured numerous prisoners and destroyed a sizable Miami settlement. The Miami asked for aid from others in the Anishinaabeg Confederacy, and a large force gathered to track down the Iroquois. Using their new firearms, the Confederacy laid an ambush near [[South Bend, Indiana]], and they attacked and destroyed most of the Iroquois party,{{sfnp|Thompson|1898|pp=38\u201340}} and a large part of the region was left depopulated. The Iroquois were unable to establish a permanent presence, as their tribe was unable to colonize the large area,{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=11}} and the Iroquois' brief control over the region was lost. Many of the former inhabitants of the territory began to return.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|pp=12-13}}\n\n====Defeat of the Susquehannocks====\nWith the tribes destroyed to the north and west, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the [[Susquehannock]]s. They attained the peak of their influence in 1660, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the following decades.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=58}} The Susquehannocks had become allied with the [[Maryland Colony]] in 1661, as the colonists had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped that an alliance would help block the northern tribes' advance on the colonies. In 1663, the Iroquois sent 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. The Susquehannocks repulsed them, but the unprovoked attack prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois.\n\nBy supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the Maryland colonists turned the tables on the Iroquois. The Susquehannocks took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674, the Maryland colonists changed their Indian policy, negotiated peace with the Iroquois, and terminated their alliance with the Susquehannocks. In 1675, the militias of [[Virginia]] and Maryland captured and executed the Susquehannock chiefs, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois drove the warriors from traditional territory{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=104}} and absorbed the survivors in 1677.\n\n===Resumption of war with France===\nEnglish colonization began to move into the former Dutch territory of upper New York State, and the colonists began to form close ties with the Iroquois as an alliance in the face of French colonial expansion. They began to supply the Iroquois with firearms as the Dutch had. At the same time, New France's governor [[Louis de Buade]] tried to revive the western fur trade. His efforts competed with those of the Iroquois to control the traffic and they started attacking the French again. The war lasted ten years.\n[[File:Frontenac with the Indians.jpg|thumb|upright|New France's Governor General [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]] with Indian allies; his attempts to revive the fur-trade in the frontier led to renewed hostilities with the Iroquois]]\n\nIn 1681, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] negotiated a treaty with the Miami and Illinois tribes.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=''The Road from Detroit to the Illinois'' 1774.|title=''Michigan Pioneer and History Collections''|volume=10|page=248}}</ref> France lifted the ban on the sale of firearms to the Indians, and colonists quickly armed the Algonquin tribes, evening the odds between the Iroquois and their enemies.\n\nWith the renewal of hostilities, the militia of New France was strengthened after 1683 by a small force of regular French navy troops in the [[Compagnies Franches de la Marine]], who constituted the longest serving unit of French regular troops in New France. In June 1687, [[Jacques-Ren\u00e9 de Brisay de Denonville, Marquis de Denonville|Governor Denonville]] and [[Sieur de Troyes|Pierre de Troyes]] set out with a well organized force to [[Fort Frontenac]], where they met with the 50 sachems of the Iroquois Confederacy from their [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] council.<ref>{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brisay_de_denonville_jacques_rene_de_2E.html |title=Brisay de Denonville, Jacques-Ren\u00e9 de |first=W.J. |last=Eccles |volume=2 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref> These 50 chiefs constituted the top leaders of the Iroquois, and Denonville captured them and shipped them to [[Marseilles]], France to be galley slaves. He then travelled down the shore of [[Lake Ontario]] and built [[Fort Denonville]] at the site where the [[Niagara River]] meets Lake Ontario. This site was previously used by [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] for [[Fort Conti]] from 1678 to 1679, and was later used for [[Fort Niagara]] which still exists. The Iroquois retaliated by destroying farmsteads and slaughtering entire families. They [[Lachine massacre|burned Lachine to the ground]] on August 4, 1689. [[Comte de Frontenac|Frontenac]] replaced Denonville as governor for the next nine years (1689\u20131698), and he recognized the danger created by the imprisonment of the sachems. He located the 13 surviving leaders and returned with them to New France in October 1698.\n\nDuring [[King William's War]] (1688\u20131697), the French formed raiding parties with Indian allies to attack English colonial settlements, as the English had allied themselves with the Iroquois against the French, carrying out the [[Schenectady massacre]] in the [[Province of New York]], the [[Raid on Salmon Falls]], New Hampshire, and the [[Battle of Fort Loyal]] in [[Portland, Maine]]. The French and their allies killed settlers in the raids and carried some back to Canada. Settlers in New England raised money to redeem the captives, but some were adopted into the tribes. The French government generally did not intervene when the Indians kept the captives. Throughout the 1690s, the French and their allies also continued to raid deep into Iroquois territory, [[Mohawk Valley raid|destroying Mohawk villages]] in 1692 and raiding Seneca, Oneida, and Onondaga villages. The English colonists and Iroquois banded together for operations aimed at New France, but these were largely ineffective. The most successful incursion resulted in the 1691 [[Battle of La Prairie]]. The French offensive was not halted by the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] that brought peace between France and England, but it ended English participation in the conflict.\n\n==Peace==\n{{main|Great Peace of Montreal}}\n[[File:Grande Paix Montreal.jpg|thumb|A copy of the [[Great Peace of Montreal|peace treaty]] that ended hostilities between New France and 39 [[First Nations]]]]\nThe Iroquois began to see the English as a greater threat than the French in 1698. The English had begun colonizing [[Pennsylvania]] in 1681, and the continued colonial growth there began to encroach on the southern border of the Iroquois territory.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=9}} The French policy began to change towards the Iroquois after nearly 50 years of warfare, and they decided that befriending them would be the easiest way to ensure their monopoly on the northern fur trade and stop English colonization. The English colonies heard of the treaty and immediately set about to prevent it from being agreed to. It would result in the loss of [[Albany, New York|Albany's]] fur trade with the Iroquois and, without their protection, the northern flank of the English colonies would be open to French attack. Nevertheless, the French and Indians signed the treaty.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=106}}\n\nThe French and 39 Indian chiefs signed the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. The Iroquois agreed to stop marauding and to allow refugees from the Great Lakes to return east. The Shawnee eventually regained control of the Ohio Country and the lower [[Allegheny River]].

They were battles for economic welfare throughout the [[Saint Lawrence River]] valley in Canada and the lower [[Great Lakes]] region which pitted the [[Iroquois]] against the northern [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquians]] and the Algonquians' French allies. From medieval times, Europeans had obtained furs from Russia and Scandinavia. American pelts came on the market during the 16th century, decades before the French, English, and Dutch established permanent settlements and trading posts on the continent. [[Basques|Basque]] fishermen chasing cod off Newfoundland's [[Grand Banks]] bartered with local Indians for [[beaver]] robes to help fend off the Atlantic chill. By virtue of their location, the tribes wielded considerable influence in European\u2013Indian relations from the early seventeenth century onwards.\n\nThe Iroquois sought to expand their territory into the [[Ohio Country]] and to monopolize the fur trade with European markets. They originally were a confederacy of the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]], [[Oneida people|Oneida]], [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]], [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]], and [[Seneca people|Seneca]] tribes inhabiting the lands in Upstate New York along the shores of [[Lake Ontario]] east to [[Lake Champlain]] and [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] on the [[Hudson river]], and the lower-estuary of the [[Saint Lawrence River]]. The [[Iroquois Confederation]] led by the Mohawks mobilized against the largely [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking tribes and [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking [[Wyandot language|Huron]] and related tribes of the Great Lakes region. The Iroquois were armed by their Dutch and English trading partners; the Algonquians and Hurons were backed by the French, their chief trading partner.\n\nThe Iroquois effectively destroyed several large tribal confederacies, including the [[Mahicans]] (Mohicans), Huron ([[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]), [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erie people|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]] (Conestoga), and northern [[Algonquin people|Algonquins]]. They became dominant in the region and enlarged their territory, realigning the American tribal geography. The Iroquois gained control of the [[New England]] frontier and [[Ohio River]] valley lands as hunting ground from about 1670 onward.\n\nBoth Algonquian and Iroquoian societies were greatly disrupted by these wars. The conflict subsided when the Iroquois lost their Dutch allies in the [[New Netherland]] colony after England took it over in 1664, with [[Fort Amsterdam]] and the town of [[New Amsterdam]] on Manhattan Island. The French had the objective of gaining the Iroquois as an ally against English encroachment, but they became trading partners with the English. Their alliance was a crucial component of the English western and northern expansion leading to the [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u20131763).\n\n==Background==\n{{further|France\u2013Americas relations}}\n[[File:Beaver wars map.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Map showing the approximate location of major tribes and settlements around 1648.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|pp=15, 26}}]]\nFrench explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] in the 1540s made the first written records of the Indians in America, although French explorers and fishermen had traded in the region near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence River estuary a decade before then for valuable furs.

In 1615, he joined a Huron raiding party and took part in a siege on an Iroquois town, probably among the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] south of Lake Ontario in New York. The attack ultimately failed, and Champlain was injured.{{sfnp|Trigger|1987|pp=312\u2013315|loc=\"Sealing the Alliance\"}}</ref>\n\n===Dutch competition===\n[[File:Castle Island and Fort Orange Albany, New York 1629.jpg|thumb|The Dutch established [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] in [[Albany, New York]] in 1624. The fort removed the Iroquois' reliance on French traders and on their Indian allies for European goods.]]\nIn 1610-1614, the Dutch established a series of seasonal trading posts on the Hudson and Delaware rivers, including one on [[Castle Island (New York)|Castle Island]] at the eastern edge of Mohawk territory near Albany.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\"/> This gave the Iroquois direct access to European markets via the Mohawks. The Dutch trading efforts and eventual colonies in New Jersey and Delaware soon also established trade with the coastal [[Delaware nation|Delaware tribe]] (Lenape) and the more southerly [[Susquehannock]] tribe. The Dutch founded [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] in 1614 and its 1624 replacement [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] (both at Albany) which removed the Iroquois' need to rely on the French and their allied tribes or to travel through southern tribal territories to reach European traders. The Dutch supplied the Mohawks and other Iroquois with guns.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\" /> In addition, the new post offered valuable tools that the Iroquois could receive in exchange for animal pelts.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\" /> They began large-scale hunting for furs to satisfy demand among their peoples for new products.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\" />{{sfnp|Hine|Faragher|2000|p=67}}\n\nAt this time, conflict began to grow between the Iroquois Confederacy and the tribes supported by the French. The Iroquois inhabited the region of New York south of [[Lake Ontario]] and west of the [[Hudson River]]. Their lands were surrounded on all sides but the south by Algonquian-speaking tribes, all traditional enemies, including the [[Shawnee]] to the west in the [[Ohio Country]], the [[Neutral Nation]] and [[Wyandot people|Huron]] confederacies on the western shore of Lake Ontario and southern shore of Lake Huron to the west, and the Susquehannock to their south. These tribes were historically competitive with and sometimes enemies of the Iroquois, who had Five Nations in their confederacy.\n\n===Beaver Wars begin===\nIn 1628, the Mohawks defeated the [[Mahican]]s, pushing them east of the Hudson River and establishing a monopoly of trade with the Dutch at [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]], [[New Netherland]]. The Susquehannocks were also well armed by Dutch traders, and they effectively reduced the strength of the Delawares and won a protracted war with the English-dominated [[Province of Maryland]].<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\"/> By the 1630s, the Iroquois had become fully armed with European weaponry through their trade with the Dutch.\n[[File:Iroquois Warrior with musket 1730.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Firearms from Dutch traders allowed the Iroquois to wage effective campaigns against the Algonquin and the Huron.]]\nThe Iroquois relied on the trade for firearms and other highly valued European goods for their livelihood and survival. They used their growing expertise with the [[arquebus]] to good effect in their continuing wars with the Algonquins and Hurons, and other traditional enemies. The French, meanwhile, outlawed the trading of firearms to their Indian allies, though they occasionally gave arquebuses as gifts to individuals who converted to Christianity. The Iroquois attacked their traditional enemies the [[Algonquins]], Mahicans, [[Innu|Montagnais]], and [[Hurons]], and the alliance of these tribes with the French quickly brought the Iroquois into conflict directly with the colonists.\n\nThe expansion of the fur trade with Europe brought a decline in the [[American Beaver|beaver]] population in the region, and the animal had largely disappeared from the Hudson Valley by 1640. ''American Heritage Magazine'' notes that the growing scarcity of the beaver in the lands controlled by the Iroquois in the middle 17th century accelerated the wars.<ref name=\"AmHerTage187\"/> The center of the fur trade shifted north to the colder regions of southern Ontario, an area controlled by the Neutral and Huron tribes who were close trading partners with the French.\n\n==Course of war==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2019}}\nWith the decline of the beaver population, the Iroquois began to conquer their smaller neighbors. They attacked the [[Wenro]] in 1638 and took all of their territory, and survivors fled to the Hurons for refuge. The Wenro had served as a buffer between the Iroquois and the Neutral tribe and their Erie allies. The Neutral and Erie tribes were considerably larger and more powerful than the Iroquois, so the Iroquois turned their attention to the north{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=100}} and the Dutch encouraged them in this strategy. At that time, the Dutch were the Iroquois' primary European trading partners, with their goods passing through Dutch trading posts down the [[Hudson River]]. As the Iroquois' sources of furs declined, however, so did the income of the trading posts.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=9}}\n[[File:CharlesHuaultMontmagny.jpg|thumb|upright|New France's governor [[Charles de Montmagny]] rejected peace with the [[Mohawk people|Mohawks]] in 1641 because it would imply abandonment of their Huron allies.]]\nIn 1641, the Mohawks traveled to [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] in New France to propose peace with the French and their allied tribes, and they asked the French to set up a trading post in Iroquoia. Governor [[Charles Jacques Huault de Montmagny|Montmagny]] rejected this proposal because it would imply abandonment of their Huron allies.\n\nIn the early 1640s, the war began in earnest with Iroquois attacks on frontier [[Wyandot people|Huron]] villages along the [[St. Lawrence River]] in order to disrupt the trade with the French. In 1645, the French called the tribes together to negotiate a treaty to end the conflict, and Iroquois leaders Deganaweida and Koiseaton traveled to New France to take part in the negotiations.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=101}} The French agreed to most of the Iroquois demands, granting them trading rights in New France. The next summer, a fleet of 80 canoes traveled through Iroquois territory carrying a large harvest of furs to be sold in New France. When they arrived, however, the French refused to purchase the furs and told the Iroquois to sell them to the Hurons, who would act as a middleman. The Iroquois were outraged and resumed the war.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=101}}\n\nThe French decided to become directly involved in the conflict. The Huron and the Iroquois had an estimated 25,000 to 30,000 members each.{{sfnp|Johansen|2006|p=147}} The Hurons and [[Susquehannock]]s formed an alliance to counter Iroquois aggression in 1647, and their warriors greatly outnumbered those of the Iroquois. The Hurons tried to break the Iroquois Confederacy by negotiating a separate peace with the [[Onondaga (tribe)|Onondaga]] and [[Cayuga people|Cayuga]] tribes, but the other tribes intercepted their messengers and put an end to the negotiations. During the summer of 1647, there were several small skirmishes between the tribes, but a more significant battle occurred in 1648 when the two Algonquin tribes passed a fur convoy through an Iroquois blockade. They succeeded and inflicted high casualties on the Iroquois.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=102}} In the early 1650s, the Iroquois began attacking the French themselves, although some of the Iroquois tribes had peaceful relations with them, notably the [[Oneida people|Oneida]] and Onondaga tribes. They were under control of the Mohawks, however, who were the strongest tribe in the Confederation and had animosity towards the French presence.  After a failed peace treaty negotiated by [[Chief Canaqueese]], Iroquois moved north into New France along Lake Champlain and the Richelieu River, attacking and blockading Montreal. By 1650, they controlled the area from the Virginia Colony in the south up to the St. Lawrence. In the west, the Iroquois had driven the Algonquin-speaking Shawnee out of the Ohio Country and seized control of the Illinois Country as far west as the Mississippi River. In January 1666, the French invaded the Iroquois and took Chief Canaqueese prisoner. In September, they proceeded down the Richelieu but were unable to find an Iroquois army, so they burned their crops and homes. Many Iroquois died from starvation in the following winter. During the following years, the Iroquois strengthened their confederacy to work more closely and create an effective central leadership, and the five tribes ceased fighting among themselves by the 1660s. They also easily coordinated military and economic plans, and they increased their power as a result.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=8}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Long Sault 1660.jpg|thumb|upright|Depiction of [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] (standing, center) during the [[Battle of Long Sault]], May 1660]]\nIndian raids were not constant, but they terrified the inhabitants of New France, and some of the heroes of French-Canadian folklore are individuals who stood up to such attacks. [[Dollard des Ormeaux]], for example, died in May 1660 while resisting an Iroquois raiding force at the [[Battle of Long Sault]], the confluence of the St. Lawrence and the [[Ottawa River]]s, but saved Montreal by his actions. In 1692, 14 year-old [[Madeleine de Verch\u00e8res|Marie-Madeleine Jarret]] successfully frustrated an Iroquois attack on Fort Verch\u00e8res.\n\n===Defeat of the Huron===\nIn 1648, the Dutch authorized selling guns directly to the Mohawks rather than through traders, and promptly sold 400 to the Iroquois. The Confederacy sent 1,000 newly armed warriors through the woods to Huron territory with the onset of winter, and they launched a devastating attack into the heart of Huron territory, destroying several key villages, killing many warriors, and taking thousands of people captive for later adoption into the tribe. Among those killed were Jesuit missionaries [[Jean Brebeuf]], [[Charles Garnier (missionary)|Charles Garnier]], and [[Gabriel Lallemant]], each of whom is considered a martyr of the Roman Catholic Church. The surviving Hurons fled their territory to seek assistance from the [[Council of Three Fires|Anishinaabeg Confederacy]] in the northern [[Great Lakes]] region. The [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa tribe]] temporarily halted Iroquois expansion further northwest, but the Iroquois controlled a fur-rich region and had no more tribes blocking them from the French settlements in Canada.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=103}}\n\n[[File:Br\u00e9buef-jesuits04jesuuoft.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jean Brebeuf]] was one of several Jesuits killed during the Iroquois attack into the heart of Huron territory.]]\n\nDiseases had taken their toll on the Iroquois and neighbors in the years preceding the war, however, and their populations had drastically declined. To replace lost warriors, they worked to integrate many of their captured enemies by adoption into their own tribes. They invited Jesuits into their territory to teach those who had converted to Christianity. The Jesuits also reached out to the Iroquois, many of whom converted to Roman Catholicism or intermingled its teachings with their own traditional beliefs.{{sfnp|Hine|Faragher|2000|p=68}}\n\n===Defeat of the Erie and Neutral===\nThe Iroquois attacked the [[Neutral Nation|Neutrals]] in 1650, and they completely drove the tribe from traditional territory by the end of 1651, killing or assimilating thousands.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=103}} The Neutrals had inhabited a territory ranging from the [[Niagara Peninsula]] westward to the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] valley.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Archaeology Of Southern Ontario To A.D. 1650 |editor-first1=Chris J. |editor-last1=Ellis |editor-first2=Neal |editor-last2=Ferris |year=1990 |publisher=London Chapter of the [[Ontario Archaeological Society]]|isbn=0-919350-13-5 |pages=410\u2013411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IepsAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA410}}</ref>\n\nIn 1654, the Iroquois attacked the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]] tribe, but with less success. The war lasted for two years, and the Iroquois destroyed the Erie confederacy by 1656, whose members refused to flee to the west. The Erie territory was located on the southeastern shore of Lake Erie and was estimated to have 12,000 members in 1650.{{sfnp|Lupold|Haddad|1988|p=11}} The Iroquois were greatly outnumbered by the tribes that they subdued, but they achieved their victories through the use of firearms purchased from the Dutch.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=103}}\n\n===French counterattack===\nThe Iroquois continued to control the countryside of New France, raiding to the edges of the walled settlements of Quebec and Montreal. In May 1660, an Iroquois force of 160 warriors attacked Montreal and captured 17 colonists. The following year, 250 warriors attacked and took ten captives.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=60}} In 1661 and 1662, the Iroquois made several raids against the [[Abenakis]] who were allied with the French. The French Crown ordered a change to the governing of Canada. They put together a small military force made up of Frenchmen, Hurons, and Algonquins to counter the Iroquois raids, but the Iroquois attacked them when they ventured into the countryside. Only 29 of the French survived and escaped; five were captured and tortured to death by the Iroquois. Despite their victory, the Iroquois also suffered a significant number of casualties, and their leaders began to consider negotiating for peace with the French.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=59}}\n\nThe tide of war began to turn in the mid-1660s with the arrival of the [[Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment]], a small contingent of regular troops from France and the first group of uniformed professional soldiers in Canada. A change in administration led the New France government to authorize direct sale of arms and other military support to their Indian allies. In 1664, the Dutch allies of the Iroquois lost control of the New Netherland colony to the English. In the immediate years after the Dutch defeat, European support waned for the Iroquois.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=60}}\n[[File:Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In 1666, [[Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy]] led a French force of 1,300 men to attack Mohawk villages in New York.]]\nIn January 1666, the French invaded the Iroquois homeland in New York. The first invasion force of 400 to 500 men<ref name=\"biographi1\">{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/prouville_de_tracy_alexandre_de_1E.html |title=Prouville de Tracy, Alexandre de |first=L\u00e9opold |last=Lamontagne |volume=1 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref> was led by [[Daniel de R\u00e9my de Courcelle]]. His men were greatly outnumbered by the Iroquois and were forced to withdraw before any significant action could take place, but they took [[Chief Canaqueese]] prisoner.\n\nThe second invasion force was led by [[Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy|Alexandre de Prouville]], the \"Marquis de Tracy\" and viceroy of New France, from his base in Quebec City. The invasion force of about 1,300 men moved out in the fall of 1666. They found the Mohawk villages deserted, so they destroyed the villages and their crops.<ref name=\"biographi1\"/> Prouville de Tracy seized all the Mohawk lands in the name of the king of France and forced the Mohawks to accept the Roman Catholic faith and to adopt the French language, as taught by Jesuit missionaries.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|pp=104\u2013105}} The Iroquois sued for peace and France agreed.\n\n===Peace with France and Iroquois expansion===\nOnce peace was achieved with the French, the Iroquois returned to their westward conquest in their continued attempt to take control of all the land between the Algonquins and the French. Eastern tribes such as the [[Lakota people|Lakotas]] were pushed across the Mississippi onto the [[Great Plains]] in the early 18th century, where they adopted the horse culture and nomadic lifestyle for which they later became known. Other refugees flooded the Great Lakes area, resulting in a conflict with existing tribes in the region. In the Ohio Country, the [[Shawnee]] and [[Miami tribe]]s were dominant. The Iroquois quickly overran Shawnee holdings in central Ohio, forcing them to flee into Miami territory. The Miamis were a powerful tribe and brought together a confederacy of their neighboring allies, including the [[Pottawatomie]] and the [[Illini confederation]] who inhabited [[Michigan]] and [[Illinois]]. The majority of the fighting was between the Anishinaabeg Confederacy and the Iroquois Confederacy.{{sfnp|Funk|1964|p=12}}\n[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A map of Iroquois expansion during the war. Peace was re-established with the French in 1666, and the Iroquois returned to their westward conquest of all the land between the French and Algonquin territory.]]\nThe Iroquois improved on their warfare as they continued to attack even farther from their home. War parties often traveled by canoes at night, and they would sink their canoes and fill them with rocks to hold them on the river bottom. They would then move through the woods to a target and burst from the wood to cause the greatest panic. After the attack, they returned to their boats and left before any significant resistance could be put together.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=16}} The lack of firearms caused the Algonquin tribes the greatest disadvantage. Despite their larger numbers, they were not centralized enough to mount a united defense and were unable to withstand the Iroquois. Several tribes ultimately moved west beyond the [[Mississippi River]], leaving much of the Ohio Valley, southern Michigan, and southern Ontario depopulated. Several [[Anishinaabe]] forces numbering in the thousands remained to the north of Lakes Huron and Superior, and they were later decisive in rolling back the Iroquois advance.<ref>Schmalz, Peter S. (1991), ''The Ojibwa of Southern Ontario'', University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|0-8020-2736-9}}</ref> From west of the Mississippi, displaced groups continued to arm war parties and attempt to retake their land.\n\nBeginning in the 1670s, the French began to explore and settle the [[Ohio Country|Ohio]] and [[Illinois Country]] from the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and they established the post of [[Tassinong, Indiana|Tassinong]] to trade with the western tribes. The Iroquois destroyed it to retain control of the fur trade with the Europeans. The Iroquois also drove the [[Mannahoac]] tribe out of the northern [[Virginia Piedmont]] region in 1670, and they claimed the land by right of conquest as a hunting ground. The English acknowledged this claim in 1674 and again in 1684, but they acquired the land from the Iroquois by a 1722 treaty.\n\nDuring a raid into the Illinois Country in 1689, the Iroquois captured numerous prisoners and destroyed a sizable Miami settlement. The Miami asked for aid from others in the Anishinaabeg Confederacy, and a large force gathered to track down the Iroquois. Using their new firearms, the Confederacy laid an ambush near [[South Bend, Indiana]], and they attacked and destroyed most of the Iroquois party,{{sfnp|Thompson|1898|pp=38\u201340}} and a large part of the region was left depopulated. The Iroquois were unable to establish a permanent presence, as their tribe was unable to colonize the large area,{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=11}} and the Iroquois' brief control over the region was lost. Many of the former inhabitants of the territory began to return.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|pp=12-13}}\n\n====Defeat of the Susquehannocks====\nWith the tribes destroyed to the north and west, the Iroquois turned their attention southward to the [[Susquehannock]]s. They attained the peak of their influence in 1660, and they were able to use that to their advantage in the following decades.{{sfnp|Barr|2006|p=58}} The Susquehannocks had become allied with the [[Maryland Colony]] in 1661, as the colonists had grown fearful of the Iroquois and hoped that an alliance would help block the northern tribes' advance on the colonies. In 1663, the Iroquois sent 800 warriors into the Susquehannock territory. The Susquehannocks repulsed them, but the unprovoked attack prompted the colony of Maryland to declare war on the Iroquois.\n\nBy supplying Susquehannock forts with artillery, the Maryland colonists turned the tables on the Iroquois. The Susquehannocks took the upper hand and began to invade Iroquois territory, where they caused significant damage. This warfare continued intermittently for 11 years. In 1674, the Maryland colonists changed their Indian policy, negotiated peace with the Iroquois, and terminated their alliance with the Susquehannocks. In 1675, the militias of [[Virginia]] and Maryland captured and executed the Susquehannock chiefs, whose growing power they feared. The Iroquois drove the warriors from traditional territory{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=104}} and absorbed the survivors in 1677.\n\n===Resumption of war with France===\nEnglish colonization began to move into the former Dutch territory of upper New York State, and the colonists began to form close ties with the Iroquois as an alliance in the face of French colonial expansion. They began to supply the Iroquois with firearms as the Dutch had. At the same time, New France's governor [[Louis de Buade]] tried to revive the western fur trade. His efforts competed with those of the Iroquois to control the traffic and they started attacking the French again. The war lasted ten years.\n[[File:Frontenac with the Indians.jpg|thumb|upright|New France's Governor General [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]] with Indian allies; his attempts to revive the fur-trade in the frontier led to renewed hostilities with the Iroquois]]\n\nIn 1681, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] negotiated a treaty with the Miami and Illinois tribes.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=''The Road from Detroit to the Illinois'' 1774.|title=''Michigan Pioneer and History Collections''|volume=10|page=248}}</ref> France lifted the ban on the sale of firearms to the Indians, and colonists quickly armed the Algonquin tribes, evening the odds between the Iroquois and their enemies.\n\nWith the renewal of hostilities, the militia of New France was strengthened after 1683 by a small force of regular French navy troops in the [[Compagnies Franches de la Marine]], who constituted the longest serving unit of French regular troops in New France. In June 1687, [[Jacques-Ren\u00e9 de Brisay de Denonville, Marquis de Denonville|Governor Denonville]] and [[Sieur de Troyes|Pierre de Troyes]] set out with a well organized force to [[Fort Frontenac]], where they met with the 50 sachems of the Iroquois Confederacy from their [[Onondaga people|Onondaga]] council.<ref>{{cite DCB |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/brisay_de_denonville_jacques_rene_de_2E.html |title=Brisay de Denonville, Jacques-Ren\u00e9 de |first=W.J. |last=Eccles |volume=2 |accessdate=2011-12-08}}</ref> These 50 chiefs constituted the top leaders of the Iroquois, and Denonville captured them and shipped them to [[Marseilles]], France to be galley slaves. He then travelled down the shore of [[Lake Ontario]] and built [[Fort Denonville]] at the site where the [[Niagara River]] meets Lake Ontario. This site was previously used by [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] for [[Fort Conti]] from 1678 to 1679, and was later used for [[Fort Niagara]] which still exists. The Iroquois retaliated by destroying farmsteads and slaughtering entire families. They [[Lachine massacre|burned Lachine to the ground]] on August 4, 1689. [[Comte de Frontenac|Frontenac]] replaced Denonville as governor for the next nine years (1689\u20131698), and he recognized the danger created by the imprisonment of the sachems. He located the 13 surviving leaders and returned with them to New France in October 1698.\n\nDuring [[King William's War]] (1688\u20131697), the French formed raiding parties with Indian allies to attack English colonial settlements, as the English had allied themselves with the Iroquois against the French, carrying out the [[Schenectady massacre]] in the [[Province of New York]], the [[Raid on Salmon Falls]], New Hampshire, and the [[Battle of Fort Loyal]] in [[Portland, Maine]]. The French and their allies killed settlers in the raids and carried some back to Canada. Settlers in New England raised money to redeem the captives, but some were adopted into the tribes. The French government generally did not intervene when the Indians kept the captives. Throughout the 1690s, the French and their allies also continued to raid deep into Iroquois territory, [[Mohawk Valley raid|destroying Mohawk villages]] in 1692 and raiding Seneca, Oneida, and Onondaga villages. The English colonists and Iroquois banded together for operations aimed at New France, but these were largely ineffective. The most successful incursion resulted in the 1691 [[Battle of La Prairie]]. The French offensive was not halted by the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] that brought peace between France and England, but it ended English participation in the conflict.\n\n==Peace==\n{{main|Great Peace of Montreal}}\n[[File:Grande Paix Montreal.jpg|thumb|A copy of the [[Great Peace of Montreal|peace treaty]] that ended hostilities between New France and 39 [[First Nations]]]]\nThe Iroquois began to see the English as a greater threat than the French in 1698. The English had begun colonizing [[Pennsylvania]] in 1681, and the continued colonial growth there began to encroach on the southern border of the Iroquois territory.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=9}} The French policy began to change towards the Iroquois after nearly 50 years of warfare, and they decided that befriending them would be the easiest way to ensure their monopoly on the northern fur trade and stop English colonization. The English colonies heard of the treaty and immediately set about to prevent it from being agreed to. It would result in the loss of [[Albany, New York|Albany's]] fur trade with the Iroquois and, without their protection, the northern flank of the English colonies would be open to French attack. Nevertheless, the French and Indians signed the treaty.{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=106}}\n\nThe French and 39 Indian chiefs signed the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. The Iroquois agreed to stop marauding and to allow refugees from the Great Lakes to return east. The Shawnee eventually regained control of the Ohio Country and the lower [[Allegheny River]]. The Miami tribe returned to take control of Indiana and northwest Ohio. The Pottawatomie went to [[Michigan]], and the Illinois tribe to [[Illinois]].{{sfnp|Wallace|2007|p=106}} The peace lasted into the 1720s.{{sfnp|Jennings|1984|p=23}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn 1768, several colonies purchased the \"Iroquois claim\" to the Ohio and Illinois Country and created the [[Indiana Land Company]] to hold the claim to all of the Northwest. It maintained a claim to the region using the Iroquois right of conquest until the company was dissolved in 1798 by the United States Supreme Court.<ref name=\"IHBNI\">{{cite web |url= http://www.in.gov/history/2686.htm|title=The naming of Indiana|publisher=Indiana Historical Bureau, State of Indiana |website=in.gov |accessdate=2008-09-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006123009/http://www.in.gov/history/2686.htm |archivedate=6 October 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History|Canada|France|North America}}\n* [[American Indian wars]]\n* [[Colonial American military history]]\n* [[Fox Wars]]\n* [[Military history of Canada]]\n* [[Military history of the Mi'kmaq people]]\n* [[Military of New France]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Barr |first=Daniel P. |title=Unconquered: The Iroquois League at War in Colonial America |year=2006 |isbn=0-275-98466-4 |publisher=Greenwood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vi1ROx0PmI4C |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Arville |title=A Sketchbook of Indiana History |publisher=Christian Book Press |year=1964 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Hine |first1=Robert V. |last2=Faragher |first2=John Mack |title=The American West: A New Interpretive History |year=2000 |isbn=0-300-07835-8 |publisher=Yale University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xuLSxbn7DSUC |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Lupold |first1=Harry Forrest |last2=Haddad |first2=Gladys |title=Ohio's Western Reserve |isbn=0-87338-372-9 |publisher=Kent State University Press |year=1988 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Jennings |first=Francis |title=The Ambiguous Iroquois Empire |year=1984 |isbn=0-393-01719-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfxdH5pslt4C |publisher=W.
