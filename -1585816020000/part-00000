In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|545}} The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|303}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|85}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295f}}<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|55f}}\n\nThe world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or [[Overshoot (population)|population overshoot]]. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken \u2014 and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.<ref name=tj01/><ref name=bc01/><ref name=rd01/><ref name=ap01/>{{rp|148\u2013155}}\n \nA steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]]. An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].\n\n== Definition and vision ==\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]] \u2014 to such an extent that even his boldest critics recognize the prominence of his work.<ref name=ngr03/>{{rp|167}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|9}}\n\nHerman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy \u2014 something desirable by itself \u2014 maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14\u201319}}\n\nDaly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nIn the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ma01/>{{rp|84}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|83}}\n\n== Historical background ==\nFor centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].\n\n=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===\n{{main|Classical economics}}\n{{see also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}\nFrom [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|3}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295}}\n\n=== Adam Smith's concept ===\n{{main|Adam Smith}}\n{{see also|Invisible hand}}\n{{further|The Wealth of Nations}}\n[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]\n[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the [[enlightened self-interest]] of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|349f, 533f}}\n\nSmith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|59\u201368}}\n\nSmith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:\n\n{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}}}\n\nAccording to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, \"... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\n=== David Ricardo's concept ===\n{{Main|David Ricardo}}\n{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}\n{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}\n[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]\nIn the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade#Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|135f}}\n\nIn Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|6\u201310}}\n\nAccording to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers \u2013 Ricardo himself died in 1823 \u2013 directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|202f}}\n\nThe Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|88f}}\n\nRicardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).\n\n=== John Stuart Mill's concept ===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\n{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}\n{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}\n[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]\nJohn Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|179}}\n\nA champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.<ref name=jsm02/> Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:\n\n{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...<ref name=jsm03/>{{rp|19}}}}\n\nMill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|16}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:\n\n{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592}}}}\n\nContrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not \"... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about \"... a very considerable improvement on our present condition.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by \u2014 instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592\u2013596}}\n\nHence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14f}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|79}}\n\n=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===\n{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}\nWhen the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:\n\n[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]\n{{anchor|Karl Marx}}\n* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of \"from each according to ability, to each according to need\" \u2014 that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Post-scarcity economy#Marxism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|57\u201365}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|218\u2013225}} <ref name=pb01/>{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that \"Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]].\"<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|52}}\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295\u2013299}} <ref name=rc01/>{{rp|55\u201357}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|156\u2013160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|121\u2013123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.<ref name=jb01/>{{rp|145\u2013148}}\n\nTaken together, it has been argued that \"... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics.\"<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has \nreintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).\n\n=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===\n{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}\n{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}\n{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}\n\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]\n[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.\n\nIn his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing \"bad attack of economic pessimism\" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' \u2014 avarice, exaction of interest, love of money \u2014 that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live \"wisely and agreeably and well.\" Mankind would finally have solved \"the economic problem,\" that is, the struggle for existence.<ref name=jmk01/><ref name=lp01/>{{rp|2, 11}}\n\nThe similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|3\u20136}}\n\nIn his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and \u2014 if population was not increasing rapidly \u2014 society would finally \"... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ...\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. \"I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work.\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|237}}\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===\nThe economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ===\n{{See also|Environmentalism#Post-war expansion}}\nAfter the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion \u2014 known today as the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]] \u2014 was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded \u2014 or later joined \u2014 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973\u201375 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].\n\nThroughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] \u2014 dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] \u2014 developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.<ref name=rc01/>{{rp|46f}} <ref name=mc01/>{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream. As the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics \u2014 namely [[general equilibrium theory]] \u2014 was uncritically adopted and maintained by even environmental economics, this subdiscipline was rendered largely unable to consider important issues of concern to environmental policy.<ref name=cs01/>{{rp|416\u2013422}}\n\nIn the years around 1970, the widening discrepancy between an ever-growing world economy on the one hand, and a mainstream economics discipline not taking into account the importance of natural resources and environmental constraints on the other hand, was finally addressed \u2014 indeed, ''challenged'' \u2014 in academia by a few unorthodox economists and researchers.<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|296\u2013298}}\n\n=== Emerging ecological concerns ===\nDuring the short period of time from 1966 to 1972, four works were published addressing the importance of natural resources and the environment to human society:\n\n* In his 1966 philosophical-minded essay on ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'', economist and systems scientist [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution \u2014 like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.<ref name=kb01/><ref name=mc01/>{{rp|104}}\n* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).<ref name=ngr01/> In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ag01/>{{rp|13}} <ref name=kb02/>{{rp|164f}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013171}}\n* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis. His work provided the biological term 'ecology' with its broader societal meaning used today.<ref name=ho01/><ref name=rc01/>{{rp|68\u201371}} <ref name=cc01/>{{rp|14f}}\n\n{{anchor|LtG}}\n* In 1972, scientist and systems analyst [[Dennis Meadows]] and his team of researchers had their study on ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' published by the [[Club of Rome]]. The Meadows team modelled aggregate trends in the [[world economy]] and made the projection \u2014 ''not'' prediction \u2014 that by the mid to latter part of the 21st century, industrial production per capita, food supply per capita and [[world population]] would all reach a peak, and then rapidly decline in a vicious [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse trajectory]].<ref name=dm02/> Due to its dire pessimism, the study was scorned and dismissed by most mainstream economists at the time of its publication.<ref name=mc01/>{{rp|244f}} <ref name=jn01/>{{rp|60f}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|50\u201362}} However, well into the 21st century, several independent researchers have confirmed that world economic trends so far do indeed match up to the original 'standard run' projections made by the Meadows team, indicating that a global collapse may still loom large in the not too distant future.<ref name=ch01/>{{rp|230}} <ref name=aj01/>{{rp|8f}} <ref name=hs01/>{{rp|152\u2013155}} <ref name=gt01/><ref name=tj02/>{{rp|8}}\nTaken together, these four works were seminal in bringing about the formation of ecological economics later on.<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|301\u2013305}}\n\n=== Formation of ecological economics as an academic subdiscipline ===\n{{Main| Ecological economics}}\nAlthough most of the theoretical and foundational work behind ecological economics was in place by the early 1970s, a long gestation period elapsed before this new academic subdiscipline in economics was properly named and institutionalized. Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Mart\u00ednez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|308\u2013310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].\n\nWhen the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.<ref name=ir02/>{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.<ref name=ba01/><ref name=cs02/><ref name=gp01/>\n\n=== Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy ===\nSince the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.<ref name=hd01/><ref name=hd02/><ref name=hd03/>{{rp|117\u2013124}} <ref name=hd05/> He has also helped founding the ''Center for the Advancement of the Steady-State Economy'' (CASSE).<ref name=casse/> He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.<ref name=cr01/>\n\nAccording to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] \u2014 or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] \u2014 top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|146\u2013148}}\n\n[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]\nThe premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nDaly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may \u2014 within some practical limits \u2014 extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock \u2014 and not the Sun \u2014 that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|21f}}\n\n[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]\nDaly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.\n\nDaly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:\n\n{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point \u2014 the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|23}}}}\n\nFollowing the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:\n\n{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|36}}}}\n\nThis view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nIn Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that \"... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants\".<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.\n\n{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}\n[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]\nConsequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:\n\n* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.\n* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.\n* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).\n\nThe purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls \"a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity\" and providing \"the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|69}}\n\nAmong the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} \n<ref name=kb02/>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}\nResponding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: \"A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy\".<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...\n\n{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end \u2014 that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|370}}}}\n\nLater, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.<ref name=mr01/>{{rp|90f}} <ref name=mf01/>{{rp|105\u2013107}} <ref name=mb03/>{{rp|270}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=av01/>{{rp|37}}\n\n== Ecological reasons for a steady state economy ==\n=== Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth ===\n{{see also|Anthropocene|List of environmental issues|Planetary boundaries|Societal collapse}}\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright|Like any other planet, earth is finite]]\nThe world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy.

By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.<ref name=gfn01/><ref name=jw01/> In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.<ref name=welanth/> The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:\n\n;Overpopulation\nWorld population is [[Human overpopulation#Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population#Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].\n\n;Pollution and global warming\nAir pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many \u2014 if not all \u2014 parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability.

The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, [[Global warming|climate change]], [[pollution]] and [[invasive species]]. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to [[governance]].\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land.

Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding \nthe role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:\n\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.<ref name=cm01/>{{rp|508f}} <ref name=rc02/>{{rp|813\u2013816}} <ref name=tt02/>{{rp|409f}}\n\n[[File:2012 09 03 Br\u00fcckenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]\n* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology \u2014 useful though it is \u2014 works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] \u2014 or disorder \u2014 of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|18\u201325}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nFrom the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|15\u201319}} <ref name=js01/>{{rp|106\u2013109}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|80f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|116\u2013118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.<ref name=hd06/>{{rp|134f}}\n\n=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===\n{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}\n\nResource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural [[resource consumption]] to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption \u2014 that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|67f}}\n\n[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]\nIn the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income\u2013consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013163}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|40f}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|64f}}\n\nIn 2009, two separate studies were published that \u2014 among other things \u2014 addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].<ref name=ew02/> British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].<ref name=tj01/> Consider each in turn:\n* Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment \u2014 based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology \u2014 will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|11\u201318}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizs\u00e4cker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizs\u00e4cker notes that \"... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption.\"<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizs\u00e4cker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|309f}}\n* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' \u2014 that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP\u2014decreased by 33 percent;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that \"resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction,\" mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] \u2014 notably China \u2014 building up their [[infrastructure]].<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that \"simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt.\"<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|188}}\n\nHerman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|61\u201364}}\n\n* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.\n* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).\n* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both \u2014 and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.\n\nFor all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|77\u201380}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|118}}\n\n=== Declining-state economy ===\n{{Distinguish|Recession}}\n{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}\n{{Further|Degrowth}}\n\nA declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.\n\nProponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].\n\n[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]] that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his \nparadigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth \u2014 that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels \u2014 is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].<ref name=ngr01/> In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|374\u2013379}} <ref name=jg02/>{{rp|150\u2013153}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013146}}\n\nAmerican political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner \u2014 who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work \u2014 have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:\n\n* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is incapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy \u2014 or what he terms an 'entropic society' \u2014 based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|205\u2013224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}\n* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that \"the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life.\"<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|103}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\nHerman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:\n\n{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}}}}\n\nDaly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\n=== Capitalism without growth ===\n{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}\nSeveral [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.<ref name=rs01/><ref name=jf01/><ref name=tt01/><ref name=rf01/>{{rp|97\u2013100}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|45\u201351}} <ref name=bb01/><ref name=pa01/> Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:\n[[File:I think he&#039;s running away from Wall Street... (3007506886).jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]\n* Economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige \u2014 or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.\n* [[Employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].\n* The [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.\n* [[Productivity improving technologies|Technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.\n* Private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.\n* Governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.\n* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.\n\u2014 In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.\n\nFully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):\n\n{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}}}\n\nDaly concludes by inviting all (most) people \u2014 both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism \u2014 to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}\n\n=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===\n{{Main| Asteroid mining}}\n{{See also| Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement | Space colonization #Reasons| Space manufacturing}}\n{{Further|Space advocacy}}\n\nEver since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).\n\n[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]\nIn the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K. O'Neill]] developed a large plan to [[Gerard K. O'Neill#Space colonization|build human settlements in outer space]] to solve the problems of overpopulation and limits to growth on earth without recourse to political repression. According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could \u2014 and indeed ''should'' \u2014 expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth \u2014 and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline \u2014 than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: \"The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies.\"<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\nBy the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation had long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.<ref name=wc01/><ref name=as02/><ref name=pm01/>\n\n[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]\nHowever, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space \u2014 and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.<ref name=hd07/>{{rp|24}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|81\u201383}} <ref name=te01/><ref name=ws01/><ref name=kz01/>\n\n=== Economic growth as a condition of military capability ===\n{{See also|Peace|military capability}}\n{{off topic|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE)]] mention on his site that the cold war was measured in GDP, and because of it was unsustainable referring to the book of Robert Collins, named: \"More: The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Czech |first1=Brian |last2=Mastini |first2=Riccardo |title=Degrowth Toward a Steady State Economy: Unifying Non-Growth Movements for Political Impact |url=https://steadystate.org/degrowth-toward-a-steady-state-economy-unifying-non-growth-movements-for-political-impact/ |website=Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy |accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>.

In effect, such an economy does not grow in the course of time.<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|545}} The term usually refers to the [[economy|national economy]] of a particular country, but it is also applicable to the economic system of a city, a region, or the [[world economy|entire world]]. Early in the [[history of economic thought]], [[classical economics|classical economist]] [[Adam Smith]] of the 18th century developed the concept of a ''stationary state'' of an economy: Smith believed that any national economy in the world would sooner or later settle in a final state of [[wikt:stationarity|stationarity]].<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]].<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|303}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|85}} As Daly's concept of a ''steady-state'' includes the ecological analysis of natural resource flows through the economy, his concept differs from the original classical concept of a ''stationary state''. One other difference is that Daly recommends immediate political action to establish the steady-state economy by imposing permanent government restrictions on all resource use, whereas economists of the classical period believed that the final stationary state of any economy would evolve by itself without any government intervention.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295f}}<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|55f}}\n\nThe world's [[Ecological footprint|mounting ecological problems]] have brought about a widening interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Critics of the steady-state economy usually object to it by arguing that [[Sustainability#Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth|resource decoupling]], [[Productivity improving technologies|technological development]], and the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|unrestrained operation of market mechanisms]] are capable of overcoming any resource scarcity, any rampant pollution, or [[Overshoot (population)|population overshoot]]. Proponents of the steady-state economy, on the other hand, maintain that these objections remain insubstantial and mistaken \u2014 and that the need for a steady-state economy is becoming more compelling every day.<ref name=tj01/><ref name=bc01/><ref name=rd01/><ref name=ap01/>{{rp|148\u2013155}}\n \nA steady-state economy is not to be confused with [[economic stagnation]]: Whereas a steady-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, economic stagnation is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a [[Economic growth|growth economy]]. An ideological contrast to the steady-state economy is formed by the concept of a [[post-scarcity economy]].\n\n== Definition and vision ==\nSince the 1970s, the concept of a steady-state economy has been associated mainly with the work of leading [[ecological economics|ecological economist]] [[Herman Daly]] \u2014 to such an extent that even his boldest critics recognize the prominence of his work.<ref name=ngr03/>{{rp|167}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|32}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|9}}\n\nHerman Daly defines his concept of a steady-state economy as an economic system made up of a constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of [[natural resource]]s through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the ''stationary state'', originally used in [[classical economics]]; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new [[Ecology|ecological feature]], presently also used in the academic discipline of [[ecological economics]]. The ''durability'' of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy \u2014 something desirable by itself \u2014 maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14\u201319}}\n\nDaly's concept of a steady-state economy is based on the vision that man's economy is an open subsystem embedded in a finite natural environment of scarce resources and fragile ecosystems. The economy is maintained by importing valuable natural resources from the input end and exporting valueless waste and pollution at the output end in a constant and irreversible flow. Any subsystem of a finite nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing and start maintaining itself in a steady-state as far as possible. This vision is opposed to [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream neoclassical economics]], where the economy is represented by an isolated and circular model with goods and services exchanging endlessly between companies and households, without exhibiting any physical contact to the natural environment.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nIn the early 2010s, reviewers sympathetic towards Daly's concept of a steady-state economy have passed the concurrent judgement that although his concept remains beyond what is politically feasible at present, there is room for mainstream thinking and collective action to approach the concept in the future.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ma01/>{{rp|84}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|83}}\n\n== Historical background ==\nFor centuries, economists and other scholars have considered matters of natural resource scarcity and limits to growth, from the early [[Classical economics|classical economists]] in the 18th and 19th centuries down to the ecological concerns that emerged in the second half of the 20th century and developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an independent academic subdiscipline in [[economics]].\n\n=== Concept of the stationary state in classical economics ===\n{{main|Classical economics}}\n{{see also|Tendency of the rate of profit to fall}}\nFrom [[Adam Smith]] and onwards, economists in the [[classical economics|classical period of economic theorising]] described the general development of society in terms of a contrast between the scarcity of arable agricultural land on the one hand, and the growth of population and capital on the other hand. The incomes from gross production were distributed as rents, profits and wages among landowners, capitalists and labourers respectively, and these three classes were incessantly engaged in the struggle for increasing their own share. The accumulation of capital (net investments) would sooner or later come to an end as the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|rate of profit fell to a minimum or to nil]]. At that point, the economy would settle in a final stationary state with a constant population size and a constant stock of capital.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|3}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295}}\n\n=== Adam Smith's concept ===\n{{main|Adam Smith}}\n{{see also|Invisible hand}}\n{{further|The Wealth of Nations}}\n[[File:Adam Smith The Muir portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Smith examined the economic states of various nations in the world]]\n[[Adam Smith]]'s [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, laid the foundation of [[classical economics]] in Britain. Smith thereby disseminated and established a concept that has since been a cornerstone in [[economics]] throughout most of the world: In a [[capitalism|liberal capitalist society]], provided with a stable institutional and legal framework, an '[[invisible hand]]' will ensure that the [[enlightened self-interest]] of all members of society will contribute to the growth and prosperity of society as a whole, thereby leading to an 'obvious and simple system of natural liberty'.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|349f, 533f}}\n\nSmith was convinced of the beneficial effect of the enlightened self-interest on the wealth of nations; but he was less certain this wealth would grow forever. Smith observed that any country in the world found itself in either a 'progressive', a 'stationary', or a 'declining' state: Although England was wealthier than its North American colonies, wages were higher in the latter place as wealth in North America was growing faster than in England; hence, North America was in the 'cheerful and hearty' progressive state. In China, on the other hand, wages were low, the condition of poor people was scantier than in any nation in Europe, and more marriages were contracted here because the 'horrid' killing of newborn babies was permitted and even widely practised; hence, China was in the 'dull' stationary state, although it did not yet seem to be declining. In nations situated in the 'melancholic' declining state, the higher ranks of society would fall down and settle for occupation amid the lower ranks, while the lowest ranks would either subsist on a miserable and insufficient wage, resort to begging or crime, or slide into starvation and early death. Bengal and some other English settlements in the East Indies possibly found themselves in this state, Smith reckoned.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|59\u201368}}\n\nSmith pointed out that as wealth was growing in any nation, the rate of profit would tend to fall and investment opportunities would diminish. In a nation that had thereby reached this 'full complement of riches', society would finally settle in a stationary state with a constant stock of people and capital. In an 18th-century anticipation of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' ([[#LtG|see below]]), Smith described the state as follows:\n\n{{cquote|In a country which had acquired that full complement of riches which the nature of its soil and climate, and its situation with respect to other countries, allowed it to acquire; which could, therefore, advance no further, and which was not going backwards, both the wages of labour and the profits of stock would probably be very low. In a country fully peopled in proportion to what either its territory could maintain or its stock employ, the competition for employment would necessarily be so great as to reduce the wages of labour to what was barely sufficient to keep up the number of labourers, and, the country being already fully peopled, that number could never be augmented. In a country fully stocked in proportion to all the business it had to transact, as great a quantity of stock would be employed in every particular branch as the nature and extent of the trade would admit. The competition, therefore, would everywhere be as great, and consequently the ordinary profit as low as possible.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}}}\n\nAccording to Smith, Holland seemed to be approaching this stationary state, although at a much higher level than in China. Smith believed the laws and institutions of China prevented this country from achieving the potential wealth its soil, climate and situation might have admitted of.<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78f}} Smith was unable to provide any contemporary examples of a nation in the world that had in fact reached the full complement of riches and thus had settled in stationarity, because, as he conjectured, \"... perhaps no country has ever yet arrived at this degree of opulence.\"<ref name=as01/>{{rp|78}}\n\n=== David Ricardo's concept ===\n{{Main|David Ricardo}}\n{{See also|Ricardian economics|Corn Laws}}\n{{Further||On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation}}\n[[File:David ricardo.jpg|thumb|upright|Ricardo was opposed to the interests of the landowning class]]\nIn the early 19th century, [[David Ricardo]] was the leading economist of the day and the champion of British [[Classical liberalism|''laissez-faire'' liberalism]]. He is known today for his [[Free trade#Economic models|free trade principle]] of [[comparative advantage]], and for his formulation of the controversial [[labor theory of value]]. Ricardo replaced Adam Smith's [[Empirical research|empirical reasoning]] with [[Deductive reasoning|abstract principles and deductive argument]]. This new methodology would later become the norm in economics as a science.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|135f}}\n\nIn Ricardo's times, Britain's trade with the European continent was somewhat disrupted during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that had raged since 1803. The [[Continental System]] brought into effect a large-scale [[embargo]] against British trade, whereby the nation's food supply came to rely heavily on domestic agriculture to the benefit of the landowning classes. When the wars ended with [[Battle of Waterloo#French disintegration|Napoleon's final defeat]] in 1815, the landowning classes dominating the British parliament had managed to tighten the existing [[Corn Laws]] in order to retain their [[Monopoly|monopoly status]] on the home market during peacetime. The controversial Corn Laws were a [[protectionist]] two-sided measure of [[subsidies]] on corn exports and [[tariff]]s on corn imports. The tightening was opposed by both the capitalist and the labouring classes, as the high price of bread effectively reduced real profits and real wages in the economy. So was the political setting when Ricardo published his treatise ''[[On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation]]'' in 1817.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|6\u201310}}\n\nAccording to Ricardo, the limits to growth were ever present due to scarcity of arable agricultural land in the country. In the wake of the wartime period, the British economy seemed to be approaching the stationary state as population was growing, plots of land with lower fertility were put into agricultural use, and the rising rents of the rural landowning class were crowding out the profits of the urban capitalists. This was the broad outline of Ricardo's controversial [[Economic rent#Land rent|land rent theory]]. Ricardo believed that the only way for Britain to avoid the stationary state was to increase her volume of [[international trade]]: The country should export more industrial products and start importing cheap agricultural products from abroad in turn. However, this course of development was impeded by the Corn Laws that seemed to be hampering both the [[industrialisation]] and the [[internationalization]] of the British economy. In the 1820s, Ricardo and his followers \u2013 Ricardo himself died in 1823 \u2013 directed much of their fire at the Corn Laws in order to have them repealed, and various other free trade campaigners borrowed indiscriminately from Ricardo's doctrines to suit their agenda.<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|202f}}\n\nThe Corn Laws were not repealed before 1846. In the meantime, the British economy kept growing, a fact that effectively undermined the credibility and thrust of Ricardian economics in Britain;<ref name=mb01/>{{rp|223}} but Ricardo had by now established himself as the first stationary state theorist in the [[history of economic thought]].<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|88f}}\n\nRicardo's preoccupation with [[class conflict]] anticipated the work of [[Karl Marx]] ([[#Karl Marx|see below]]).\n\n=== John Stuart Mill's concept ===\n{{Main|John Stuart Mill}}\n{{See also|Liberalism #Classical and modern|Utilitarianism #Classical utilitarianism}}\n{{Further|Principles of Political Economy|On Liberty|Utilitarianism}}\n[[File:JohnStuartMill.JPG|thumb|upright|Mill believed the future stationary state was both inevitable, necessary and desirable]]\nJohn Stuart Mill was the leading economist, philosopher and social reformer in mid-19th century Britain. His economics treatise on the ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'', published in 1848, attained status as the standard textbook in economics throughout the English-speaking world until the turn of the century.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|179}}\n\nA champion of [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberalism]], Mill believed that an ideal society should allow all individuals to pursue their own good without any interference from others or from government.<ref name=jsm02/> Also a [[Utilitarianism#Classical utilitarianism|utilitarian philosopher]], Mill regarded the 'Greatest Happiness Principle' as the ultimate ideal for a harmonious society:\n\n{{cquote|As the means of making the nearest approach to this ideal, utility would enjoin, first, that laws and social arrangements should place the happiness ... of every individual, as nearly as possible in harmony with the interest of the whole; and secondly, that education and opinion, which have so vast a power over human character, should so use that power as to establish in the mind of every individual an indissoluble association between his own happiness and the good of the whole; ...<ref name=jsm03/>{{rp|19}}}}\n\nMill's concept of the stationary state was strongly coloured by these ideals.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|16}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} Mill conjectured that the stationary state of society was not too far away in the future:\n\n{{cquote|It must always have been seen, more or less distinctly, by political economists, that the increase of wealth is not boundless; that at the end of what they term the progressive state lies the stationary state, that all progress in wealth is but a postponement of this, and that each step in advance is an approach to it. We have now been led to recognize that this ultimate goal is at all times near enough to be fully in view; that we are always on the verge of it, and that, if we have not reached it long ago, it is because the goal itself flies before us.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592}}}}\n\nContrary to both Smith and Ricardo before him, Mill took an optimistic view on the future stationary state. Mill could not \"... regard the stationary state of capital and wealth with the unaffected aversion so generally manifested toward it by political economists of the old school.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about \"... a very considerable improvement on our present condition.\"<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|593}} According to Mill, the stationary state was at one and the same time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was ''inevitable'', because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also ''necessary'', because mankind had to learn how to reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was ''desirable'', as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by \u2014 instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.<ref name=jsm01/>{{rp|592\u2013596}}\n\nHence, Mill was able to express all of his liberal ideals for mankind through his concept of the stationary state.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|14f}} <ref name=mb02/>{{rp|213}} It has been argued that Mill essentially made a quality-of-life argument for the stationary state.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|79}}\n\n=== Main developments in economics since Mill ===\n{{See also|Marxism|Neoclassical economics}}\nWhen the influence of John Stuart Mill and his ''Principles'' declined, the classical-liberalist period of economic theorising came to an end. By the turn of the 19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[neoclassical economics]] had emerged to dominate economics. This development led to the exclusion of any concern with natural resource scarcity in economic modelling and analysis:\n\n[[File:Marx6.jpg|thumb|upright|Marx replaced the concept of a stationary state with his vision of a communist society that would bring about abundance for everybody]]\n{{anchor|Karl Marx}}\n* Although a classical economist in his own right, [[Karl Marx]] abandoned the earlier concept of a stationary state and replaced it with his own unique vision of [[historical materialism]], according to which human societies pass through several [[Mode of production|'modes of production']], eventually leading to [[communism]]. In each mode of production, man's increasing mastery over nature and the '[[productive forces]]' of society develop to a point where the [[class conflict]] bursts into [[revolution]]s, followed by the establishment of a new mode of production. In opposition to his liberalist predecessors in the field, Marx did not regard natural resource scarcity as a factor constraining future economic growth; instead, the capitalist mode of production was to be overturned before the productive forces of society could fully develop, bringing about an abundance of goods in a new society based on the principle of \"from each according to ability, to each according to need\" \u2014 that is, communism. The assumption, based on [[Post-scarcity economy#Marxism|technological optimism]], was that communism would overcome any resource scarcity ever to be encountered.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|292}} For ideological reasons, then, orthodox Marxism has mostly been opposed to any concern with natural resource scarcity ever since Marx's own day.<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|57\u201365}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|218\u2013225}} <ref name=pb01/>{{rp|5f}} However, the march of history has been hard on this ideology: By 1991, German sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]] was able to make the rather sweeping observation that \"Orthodox Marxism has vanished from the scene, [[Left-wing politics|leftism]] has turned [[Green politics|green]], and Marxists have become [[Ecology|ecologists]].\"<ref name=rg01/>{{rp|52}}\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the other hand, the preoccupation with society's long term growth and development inherent in classical economics was abandoned altogether; instead, economic analysis came to focus on the study of the relationship between given ends and given scarce means, forming the concept of [[general equilibrium theory]] within an essentially static framework. Hence, neoclassical economics achieved greater generality, but only by asking easier questions; and any concern with natural resource scarcity was neglected.<ref name=mb02/>{{rp|295\u2013299}} <ref name=rc01/>{{rp|55\u201357}} For this reason, modern [[Ecological economics|ecological economists]] have deplored the simplified and ecologically harmful features of neoclassical economics: It has been argued that neoclassical economics has become a [[pseudoscience]] of choice between anything in general and nothing in particular, while neglecting the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] of future generations;<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|156\u2013160}} that the very [[terminology]] of neoclassical economics is so ecologically illiterate as to rarely even refer to natural resources or ecological limits;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|121\u2013123}} and that neoclassical economics has developed to become a dominant [[Neoliberalism|free market ideology]] legitimizing an ideal of society resembling a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual motion machine]] of [[economic growth]] at intolerable environmental and human costs.<ref name=jb01/>{{rp|145\u2013148}}\n\nTaken together, it has been argued that \"... if Judeo-Christian [[monotheism]] took nature out of religion, Anglo-American economists (after about 1880) took nature out of economics.\"<ref name=hd04/>{{rp|xx}} Almost one century later, Herman Daly has \nreintegrated nature into economics in his concept of a steady-state economy ([[#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|see below]]).\n\n=== John Maynard Keynes's concept of reaching saturation ===\n{{Main|John Maynard Keynes}}\n{{See also|Great Depression|Keynesian economics|Macroeconomics}}\n{{Further|The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money}}\n\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|upright|Keynes predicted that capital accumulation would soon reach saturation and bring about a quasi-stationary community]]\n[[John Maynard Keynes]] was the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of modern [[macroeconomics]], and is widely considered today to be the most influential economist of the 20th century. Keynes rejected the basic tenet of classical economics that [[Keynesian economics#Keynes and the classics|free markets would lead to full employment by themselves]]. Consequently, he recommended government intervention to stimulate [[aggregate demand]] in the economy, a macroeconomic policy now known as [[Keynesian economics]]. Keynes also believed that capital accumulation would reach saturation at some point in the future.\n\nIn his essay from 1930 on ''The Economic Possibilities of Our Grandchildren'', Keynes ventured to look one hundred years ahead into the future and predict the standard of living in the 21st century. Writing at the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], Keynes rejected the prevailing \"bad attack of economic pessimism\" of his own time and foresaw that by 2030, the grandchildren of his generation would live in a state of abundance, where saturation would have been reached. People would find themselves liberated from such economic activities as saving and capital accumulation, and be able to get rid of 'pseudo-moral principles' \u2014 avarice, exaction of interest, love of money \u2014 that had characterized [[Capitalism|capitalistic societies]] so far. Instead, people would devote themselves to the true art of life, to live \"wisely and agreeably and well.\" Mankind would finally have solved \"the economic problem,\" that is, the struggle for existence.<ref name=jmk01/><ref name=lp01/>{{rp|2, 11}}\n\nThe similarity between John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state ([[#John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|see above]]) and Keynes's predictions in this essay has been noted.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|15}} It has been argued that although Keynes was right about future growth rates, he underestimated the inequalities prevailing today, both within and across countries. He was also wrong in predicting that greater wealth would induce more leisure spent; in fact, the reverse trend seems to be true.<ref name=lp01/>{{rp|3\u20136}}\n\nIn his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]]'', Keynes looked only one generation ahead into the future and predicted that state intervention balancing aggregate demand would by then have caused capital accumulation to reach the point of saturation. The marginal efficiency of capital as well as the rate of interest would both be brought down to zero, and \u2014 if population was not increasing rapidly \u2014 society would finally \"... attain the conditions of a quasi-stationary community where change and progress would result only from changes in technique, taste, population and institutions ...\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|138f}} Keynes believed this development would bring about the disappearance of the rentier class, something he welcomed: Keynes argued that rentiers incurred no sacrifice for their earnings, and their savings did not lead to productive investments unless aggregate demand in the economy was sufficiently high. \"I see, therefore, the rentier aspect of capitalism as a transitional phase which will disappear when it has done its work.\"<ref name=jmk02/>{{rp|237}}\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and emerging ecological concerns ===\nThe economic expansion following [[World War II]] took place while [[mainstream economics]] largely neglected the importance of [[natural resource]]s and [[Natural environment|environmental constraints]] in the development. Addressing this discrepancy, ecological concerns emerged in academia around 1970. Later on, these concerns developed into the formation of [[ecological economics]] as an academic subdiscipline in economics.\n\n=== Post-war economic expansion and the neglect of mainstream economics ===\n{{See also|Environmentalism#Post-war expansion}}\nAfter the ravages of [[World War II]], the industrialised part of the world experienced almost three decades of unprecedented and prolonged economic expansion. This expansion \u2014 known today as the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]] \u2014 was brought about by international financial stability, low [[Price of oil|oil prices]] and ever increasing labour productivity in manufacturing. During the era, all the advanced countries who founded \u2014 or later joined \u2014 [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|the OECD]] enjoyed robust and sustained growth rates as well as full employment. In the 1970s, the expansion ended with the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulting in the [[1973\u201375 recession]] and the [[Bretton Woods system#Paralysis of international monetary management|collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary system]].\n\nThroughout this era, [[mainstream economics]] \u2014 dominated by both [[neoclassical economics]] and [[Keynesian economics]] \u2014 developed theories and models where natural resources and environmental constraints were neglected.<ref name=rc01/>{{rp|46f}} <ref name=mc01/>{{rp|3f}} [[Conservation (ethic)|Conservation issues]] related specifically to [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] were left to specialists in the subdiscipline of [[environmental economics]] at the margins of the mainstream.

Boulding]] argued that mankind would soon have to adapt to economic principles much different than the past 'open earth' of illimitable plains and exploitative behaviour. On the basis of the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principle]] of the [[First law of thermodynamics|conservation of matter and energy]], Boulding developed the view that the flow of natural resources through the economy is a rough measure of the [[Gross national product]] (GNP); and, consequently, that society should start regarding the GNP as a cost to be minimized rather than a benefit to be maximized. Therefore, mankind would have to find its place in a cyclical ecological system without unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution \u2014 like a [[Astronaut|spaceman]] on board a [[Spacecraft|spaceship]]. Boulding was not the first to make use of the '[[Spaceship Earth]]' metaphor, but he was the one who combined this metaphor with the analysis of natural resource flows through the economy.<ref name=kb01/><ref name=mc01/>{{rp|104}}\n* In his 1971 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] integrated the [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic concept]] of [[entropy]] with economic analysis, and argued that all natural resources are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity. What happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable natural resources) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless waste and pollution).<ref name=ngr01/> In the [[history of economic thought]], Georgescu-Roegen was also the first economist of some standing to theorise on the premise that all of earth's [[Mineral|mineral resources]] will eventually be exhausted at some point ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ag01/>{{rp|13}} <ref name=kb02/>{{rp|164f}} <ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013171}}\n* Also in 1971, pioneering ecologist and general systems analyst [[Howard T. Odum]] published his book on ''Environment, Power and Society'', where he described human society in terms of [[ecology]]. He formulated the [[maximum power principle]], according to which all organisms, ecosystems and human societies organise themselves in order to maximize their use of available energy for survival. Odum pointed out that those human societies with access to the higher quality of [[Energy development#Types of energy|energy sources]] enjoyed an advantage over other societies in the [[Natural selection|Darwinian evolutionary struggle]]. Odum later co-developed the concept of [[emergy]] (i.e., [[embodied energy]]) and made other valuable contributions to ecology and systems analysis.

Ecological economics was formally founded in 1988 as the culmination of a series of conferences and meetings through the 1980s, where key scholars interested in the ecology-economy interdependency were interacting with each other. The most important people involved in the establishment were [[Herman Daly]] and [[Robert Costanza]] from the US; AnnMari Jansson from Sweden; and [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Mart\u00ednez-Alier]] from Spain (Catalonia).<ref name=ir01/>{{rp|308\u2013310}} Since 1989, the discipline has been organised in the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] that publishes the journal of [[Ecological Economics (journal)|''Ecological Economics'']].\n\nWhen the ecological economics subdiscipline was established, Herman Daly's 'preanalytic vision' of the economy was widely shared among the members who joined in: The human economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment), and any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing. Indeed, it has been argued that the subdiscipline itself was born out of frustration with the unwillingness of the established disciplines to accept this vision.<ref name=ir02/>{{rp|266}} However, ecological economics has since been overwhelmed by the influence and domination of neoclassical economics and its everlasting [[Neoliberalism|free market orthodoxy]]. This development has been deplored by activistic ecological economists as an 'incoherent', 'shallow' and overly 'pragmatic' slide.<ref name=ba01/><ref name=cs02/><ref name=gp01/>\n\n=== Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy ===\nSince the 1970s, [[Herman Daly]] has been the world's leading proponent of a steady-state economy.<ref name=ma01/>{{rp|81f}} Throughout his career, Daly has published several books and articles on the subject.<ref name=hd01/><ref name=hd02/><ref name=hd03/>{{rp|117\u2013124}} <ref name=hd05/> He has also helped founding the ''Center for the Advancement of the Steady-State Economy'' (CASSE).<ref name=casse/> He has received several prizes and awards in recognition of his work.<ref name=cr01/>\n\nAccording to two independent comparative studies of American Daly's steady-state economics versus the later, competing school of [[degrowth]] from continental Europe, no differences of analytical substance exist between the two schools; only, Daly's [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] \u2014 or even [[Technocracy|technocratic]] \u2014 top-down management of the economy fares badly with the more radical [[grassroots]] appeal of degrowth, as championed by French political scientist [[Serge Latouche]] ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|549}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|146\u2013148}}\n\n[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Natural resources flow through the economy only to end up as waste and pollution in the environment]]\nThe premise underlying Daly's concept of a steady-state economy is that the economy is an open subsystem of a finite and non-growing ecosystem (earth's natural environment). The economy is maintained by importing low-entropy matter-energy (resources) from nature; these resources are put through the economy, being transformed and manufactured into goods along the way; eventually, the throughput of matter-energy is exported to the environment as high-entropy waste and pollution. [[Recycling]] of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources as well as an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as [[waste heat]]. Out of necessity, then, any subsystem of a fixed nongrowing system must itself at some point also become nongrowing.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xiii}}\n\nDaly argues that nature has provided basically two sources of wealth at man's disposal, namely a stock of terrestrial [[Mineral resource classification|mineral resources]] and a flow of [[solar energy]]. An 'asymmetry' between these two sources of wealth exist in that we may \u2014 within some practical limits \u2014 extract the mineral stock at a rate of our own choosing (that is, rapidly), whereas the flow of solar energy is reaching earth at a rate beyond human control. Since the [[Sun]] will continue to shine on earth at a fixed rate for billions of years to come, it is the terrestrial mineral stock \u2014 and not the Sun \u2014 that constitutes the crucial scarcity factor regarding man's economic future.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|21f}}\n\n[[File:Cottonopolis1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |Unintentionally, the Industrial Revolution has thrown modern man out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere]]\nDaly points out that today's global ecological problems are rooted in man's historical record: Until the [[Industrial Revolution]] that took place in Britain in the second half of the 18th century, man lived within the limits imposed by what Daly terms a 'solar-income budget': The [[Palaeolithic]] tribes of hunter-gatherers and the later agricultural societies of the [[Neolithic]] and onwards subsisted primarily \u2014 though not exclusively \u2014 on earth's [[biosphere]], powered by an ample supply of renewable energy, received from the Sun. The Industrial Revolution changed this situation completely, as man began extracting the terrestrial mineral stock at a rapidly increasing rate. The original solar-income budget was thereby broken and supplemented by the new, but much scarcer source of wealth. Mankind still lives in the after-effect of this revolution.\n\nDaly cautions that more than two hundred years of worldwide industrialisation is now confronting mankind with a range of problems pertaining to the future existence and survival of our species:\n\n{{cquote|The entire evolution of the biosphere has occurred around a fixed point \u2014 the constant solar-energy budget. Modern man is the only species to have broken the solar-income budget constraint, and this has thrown him out of equilibrium with the rest of the biosphere. Natural cycles have become overloaded, and new materials have been produced for which no natural cycles exist. Not only is geological capital being depleted, but the basic life-support services of nature are impaired in their functioning by too large a throughput from the human sector.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|23}}}}\n\nFollowing the work of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly argues that the laws of [[thermodynamics]] restrict all [[technology|human technologies]] and apply to all economic systems:\n\n{{cquote|[[Entropy]] is the basic physical coordinate of scarcity. Were it not for entropy, we could burn the same gallon of gasoline over and over, and our capital stock would never wear out. Technology is unable to rise above the basic laws of physics, so there is no question of ever 'inventing' a way to recycle energy.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|36}}}}\n\nThis view on the role of technology in the economy was later termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']] ([[#Role of technology|see below]]).<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nIn Daly's view, mainstream economists tend to regard natural resource scarcity as only a relative phenomenon, while human needs and wants are granted absolute status: It is believed that the [[Market (economics)#Mechanisms of markets|price mechanism]] and [[Technology|technological development]] (however defined) is capable of overcoming any scarcity ever to be faced on earth; it is also believed that all human wants could and should be treated alike as absolutes, from the most basic necessities of life to the extravagant and insatiable craving for luxuries. Daly terms this belief 'growthmania', which he finds pervasive in modern society. In opposition to the dogma of growthmania, Daly submits that \"... there ''is'' such a thing as absolute scarcity, and there ''is'' such a thing as purely relative and trivial wants\".<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|41}} Once it is recognised that scarcity is imposed by nature in an absolute form by the laws of thermodynamics and the finitude of earth; and that some human wants are only relative and not worthy of satisfying; then we are all well on the way to the paradigm of a steady-state economy, Daly concludes.\n\n{{anchor|Daly's institutions}}\n[[File:Bingham Canyon April 2005.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1 |The inevitable exhaustion of mined resources could be postponed by imposing permanent quantitative restrictions on the economy]]\nConsequently, Daly recommends that a system of permanent government restrictions on the economy is established as soon as possible, a steady-state economy. Whereas the [[Classical economics|classical economists]] believed that the final stationary state would settle by itself as the rate of profit fell and capital accumulation came to an end ([[#The stationary state in classical economics|see above]]), Daly wants to create the steady-state politically by establishing three institutions of the state as a superstructure on top of the present market economy:\n\n* The first institution is to correct inequality to some extent by putting minimum and maximum limits on incomes, maximum limits on wealth, and then redistribute accordingly.\n* The second institution is to stabilise the population by issuing transferable reproduction licenses to all fertile women at a level corresponding with the general replacement fertility in society.\n* The third institution is to stabilise the level of capital by issuing and selling depletion quotas that impose quantitative restrictions on the flow of resources through the economy. Quotas effectively minimise the throughput of resources necessary to maintain any given level of capital (as opposed to taxes, that merely alter the prevailing price structure).\n\nThe purpose of these three institutions is to stop and prevent further growth by combining what Daly calls \"a nice reconciliation of efficiency and equity\" and providing \"the ecologically necessary macrocontrol of growth with the least sacrifice in terms of microlevel freedom and variability.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|69}}\n\nAmong the generation of his teachers, Daly ranks [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] as the two economists he has learned the most from.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|xvi}} However, both Georgescu-Roegen and Boulding have assessed that a steady-state economy may serve only as a temporary societal arrangement for mankind when facing the long-term issue of global mineral resource exhaustion: Even with a constant stock of people and capital, and a minimised (yet constant) flow of resources put through the [[world economy]], earth's mineral stock will still be exhausted, although at a slower rate than is presently the situation ([[#Declining-state economy|see below]]).<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} \n<ref name=kb02/>{{rp|165\u2013167}}\n\n{{Anchor|Daly's credo}}\nResponding specifically to the [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Criticising Daly.27s steady-state economics|criticism levelled at him by Georgescu-Roegen]], Daly concedes that a steady-state economy will serve only to postpone, and not to prevent, the inevitable mineral resource exhaustion: \"A steady-state economy cannot last forever, but neither can a growing economy, nor a declining economy\".<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}} A frank and committed [[Protestantism|Protestant]], Daly further argues that...\n\n{{cquote|... the steady-state economy is based on the assumption that [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] will have an end \u2014 that it is finite temporally as well as spatially. ... Only [[God]] can raise any part of his creation out of time and into [[eternity]]. As mere stewards of creation, all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of creation to support present and future life.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|370}}}}\n\nLater, several other economists in the field have agreed that not even a steady-state economy can last forever on earth.<ref name=mr01/>{{rp|90f}} <ref name=mf01/>{{rp|105\u2013107}} <ref name=mb03/>{{rp|270}} <ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=av01/>{{rp|37}}\n\n== Ecological reasons for a steady state economy ==\n=== Present situation: Exceeding global limits to growth ===\n{{see also|Anthropocene|List of environmental issues|Planetary boundaries|Societal collapse}}\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|upright|Like any other planet, earth is finite]]\nThe world's mounting ecological problems have stimulated interest in the concept of a steady-state economy. Since the 1990s, most metrics have provided evidence that the volume of the [[world economy]] far exceeds critical global limits to [[economic growth]] already.<ref name=dm01/> According to the [[Ecological footprint#Footprint measurements|ecological footprint measure]], earth's [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] \u2014 that is, earth's long-term capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels \u2014 was exceeded by some 30 percent in 1995. By 2018, this figure had increased to some 70 percent.<ref name=gfn01/><ref name=jw01/> In effect, mankind is confronted with planetary [[Overshoot (population)|overshoot-and-collapse]] in our time. The significant impact of human activities on earth's ecosystems has motivated some geologists to propose the present [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] be named the ''[[anthropocene]]''.<ref name=welanth/> The following issues have raised much concern worldwide:\n\n;Overpopulation\nWorld population is [[Human overpopulation#Overview|expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050]], and continue growing thereafter. This unprecedented number of people is already stressing [[World population#Environmental impacts|natural environments]] and [[Habitat destruction|wildlife habitats]] everywhere, increasing pollution levels, and worsening human living conditions. Uncontrolled urbanisation forces millions to live in congested [[shanty town]]s, and large cities swell to become [[Megacity|megacities]] with [[Megacity#Crime|high crime]] [[Megacity#Slums|slum areas]]. Overpopulation may even lead to [[War#Youth bulge|social conflict and violence]], when too many people, especially young males, compete for too few employment opportunities in [[Economic stagnation|stagnating economies]].\n\n;Pollution and global warming\nAir pollution emanating from motor vehicles and industrial plants is [[Pollution#Human health|damaging public health]] and increasing mortality rates. The concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es in the atmosphere is the apparent source of [[global warming]] and climate changes. [[Regional effects of global warming|Extreme regional weather patterns]] and [[Sea level rise#Effects|rising sea levels]] caused by warming degrade living conditions in many \u2014 if not all \u2014 parts of the world. The warming already poses a [[Climate security#General|security threat]] to many nations and works as a so-called [[Effects of global warming on humans#Security|'threat multiplier']] to geo-political stability. Even worse, the [[Arctic methane emissions#Loss of permafrost|loss of Arctic permafrost]] may be triggering a [[Permafrost#Predicted rate of change in the Arctic|massive release of methane and other greenhouse gases from thawing soils]] in the region, thereby overwhelming political action to counter climate change. If critical temperature thresholds are crossed, Earth's climate may transit from an [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|'icehouse' to a 'greenhouse' state]] for the first time in 34 million years.\n\nOne of the most common solutions to the [[climate crisis]] is transitioning to renewable energy, but it also has some environmental impacts.

Global erosion rates on conventional cropland are estimated to [[Human impact on the environment#Agricultural land loss and soil erosion|exceed soil creation rates]] by more than ten times. Widespread overuse of [[groundwater]] results in [[Water scarcity#Overview of regions suffering crisis impacts|water deficits]] in many countries.

The report was finalised in Paris. The main conclusions:\n\n1. Over the last 50 years, the state of nature has deteriorated at an unprecedented and accelerating rate.\n\n2. The main drivers of this deterioration have been changes in land and sea use, exploitation of living beings, [[Global warming|climate change]], [[pollution]] and [[invasive species]]. These five drivers, in turn, are caused by societal behaviors, from [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] to [[governance]].\n\n3. Damage to ecosystems undermines 35 of 44 selected UN targets, including the UN General Assembly's  [[Sustainable Development Goals]] for poverty, hunger, health, water, cities' climate, oceans and land. It can cause problems with food, water and humanity's air supply.\n\n4.

This ultra-[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] path will then make ecological room for poorer countries to catch up and combine into a final world steady-state, maintained at some internationally agreed upon intermediate and 'optimum' level of activity for some period of time \u2014 although not forever. Kerschner admits that this goal of a world steady-state may remain unattainable in the foreseeable future, but such seemingly unattainable goals could stimulate visions about how to better approach them.<ref name=ck01/>{{rp|548}} <ref name=do02/>{{rp|229}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013146}}\n\n=== The concept of Overdevelopment by Leopold Cohr ===\n{{main|Overdevelopment}}\nIn 1977 [[Leopold Kohr]] published a book named ''The Overdeveloped Nations: The Diseconomies Of Scale'', talking primarily about [[overconsumption]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kohr|first1=Leopold|title=The Overdeveloped Nations: The Diseconomies Of Scale|date=1977|publisher=Christopher Davies Publishers|location=Swansea}}</ref> This book is the basis for the theory of [[overdevelopment]], saying that the global north, the rich countries are too much developed what increases the [[Ecological footprint]] of humanity and create many problems both in overdeveloped and underdeveloped countries.<ref>Barkin, Samuel J. \"Trade, Sustainable Development and the Environment\", ''Global Environmental Politics'' 3:4, November 2003</ref>\n\n== Conceptual and ideological disagreements ==\n{{See also| Economic growth #Environmental impact|Post-scarcity economy}}\nSeveral conceptual and ideological disagreements presently exist concerning the steady-state economy in particular and the dilemma of growth in general. The following issues are considered below: The role of technology; resource decoupling and the rebound effect; a declining-state economy; the possibility of having capitalism without growth; and the possibility of pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space.\n\nIn 2019 a research, presenting an overview of the attempts to achieve constant economic growth without environmental destruction and their results, was published. It shows that by the year 2019 the attempts were not successful. It does not give a clear answer about future attempts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hickel |first1=Jason |last2=Kallis |first2=Giorgos |title=Is Green Growth Possible? |journal=New Political Economy |date=17 April 2019 |pages=1\u201318 |doi=10.1080/13563467.2019.1598964 |url=http://ddd.uab.cat/record/205316 }}</ref>\n\nHerman Daly's approach to these issues are presented throughout the text.\n\n=== Role of technology ===\n{{See also | Productivity improving technologies | Production function | Pessimism #Entropy pessimism }}\n[[Technology]] is usually defined as the application of scientific method in the production of goods or in other social achievements. Historically, technology has mostly been developed and implemented in order to [[Productivity improving technologies|improve labour productivity]] and increase living standards. In economics, disagreement presently exists regarding \nthe role of technology when considering its dependency on natural resources:\n\n* In [[neoclassical economics]], on the one hand, the role of 'technology' is usually represented as yet another [[Factors of production#Neoclassical economics|factor of production]] contributing to [[economic growth]], like land, labour and capital contribute. However, in neoclassical [[production function]]s, where the output of produced goods are related to the inputs provided by the factors of production, no mention is made of the contribution of natural resources to the production process. Hence, 'technology' is reified as a separate, self-contained device, capable of contributing to production without receiving any natural resource inputs beforehand. This representation of 'technology' also prevails in standard [[mainstream economics]] textbooks on the subject.<ref name=cm01/>{{rp|508f}} <ref name=rc02/>{{rp|813\u2013816}} <ref name=tt02/>{{rp|409f}}\n\n[[File:2012 09 03 Br\u00fcckenfahrstand Voraus DSCI73357.JPG|thumb|Technology is usually dependent on fuel or electricity for its operation]]\n* In [[ecological economics]], on the other hand, 'technology' is represented as the way natural resources are transformed in the production process.<ref name=ap01/>{{rp|121f}} Hence, Herman Daly argues that the role of technology in the economy cannot be properly conceptualized without taking into account the flow of natural resources necessary to support the technology itself: An [[internal combustion engine]] runs on [[fuel]]s; [[Electric machine|machinery]] and electric devices run on [[electricity]]; all [[Capital (economics)|capital equipment]] is made out of material resources to begin with. In physical terms, any technology \u2014 useful though it is \u2014 works largely as a medium for transforming valuable [[natural resource]]s into material goods that eventually end up as valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]], thereby increasing the [[entropy]] \u2014 or disorder \u2014 of the [[Heat death of the universe|world as a whole]].<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|18\u201325}} This view of the role of technology in the economy has been termed [[Pessimism#Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimism']].<ref name=ra01/>{{rp|116}}\n\nFrom the ecological point of view, it has been suggested that the disagreement boils down to a matter of teaching some elementary [[physics]] to the uninitiated neoclassical economists and other [[Technology#Optimism|technological optimists]].<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|15\u201319}} <ref name=js01/>{{rp|106\u2013109}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|80f}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|116\u2013118}} From the neoclassical point of view, leading growth theorist and [[List of Nobel Memorial Prize laureates in Economics|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Robert Solow]] has defended his much criticised position by replying in 1997 that 'elementary physics' has not by itself prevented growth in the industrialized countries so far.<ref name=hd06/>{{rp|134f}}\n\n=== Resource decoupling and the rebound effect ===\n{{See also| Sustainability #Decoupling environmental degradation and economic growth| Jevons paradox| Rebound effect (conservation)}}\n\nResource decoupling occurs when economic activity becomes less intensive ecologically: A declining input of natural resources is needed to produce one unit of output on average, measured by the ratio of total natural [[resource consumption]] to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). ''Relative'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines on a ''[[ceteris paribus]]'' assumption \u2014 that is, all other things being equal. ''Absolute'' resource decoupling occurs when natural resource consumption declines, even while GDP is growing.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|67f}}\n\n[[File:PSM V11 D660 William Stanley Jevons.jpg|thumb|upright|Jevons analysed the effect of increasing energy efficiency]]\nIn the [[history of economic thought]], [[William Stanley Jevons]] was the first economist of some standing to analyse the occurrence of resource decoupling, although he did not use this term. In his 1865 book on ''[[The Coal Question]]'', Jevons argued that an increase in energy efficiency would by itself lead to ''more'', not less, consumption of energy: Due to the [[Income\u2013consumption curve|income effect]] of the lowered energy expenditures, people would be rendered better off and demand even more energy, thereby outweighing the initial gain in efficiency. This mechanism is known today as the [[Jevons paradox]] or the [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]. Jevons's analysis of this seeming paradox formed part of his general concern that Britain's industrial supremacy in the 19th century would soon be set back by the inevitable exhaustion of the country's coal mines, whereupon the geopolitical balance of power would tip in favour of countries abroad possessing more abundant mines.<ref name=jm01/>{{rp|160\u2013163}} <ref name=rs01/>{{rp|40f}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|64f}}\n\nIn 2009, two separate studies were published that \u2014 among other things \u2014 addressed the issues of resource decoupling and the rebound effect: German scientist and politician [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]] published [[Factor 5 (book)|''Factor Five: Transforming the Global Economy through 80% Improvements in Resource Productivity'']], co-authored with a team of researchers from [[The Natural Edge Project]].<ref name=ew02/> British ecological economist [[Tim Jackson (economist)|Tim Jackson]] published ''[[Prosperity Without Growth]]'', drawing extensively from an earlier report authored by him for the UK [[Sustainable Development Commission]].<ref name=tj01/> Consider each in turn:\n* Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker argues that a new economic wave of innovation and investment \u2014 based on increasing resource productivity, [[renewable energy]], [[industrial ecology]] and other green technology \u2014 will soon kick off a 'Green Kondratiev' cycle, named after the Russian economist [[Nikolai Kondratiev]].<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|11\u201318}} This new long-term cycle is expected to bring about as much as an 80 percent increase in resource productivity, or what amounts to a 'Factor Five' improvement of the gross input per output ratio in the economy, and reduce environmental impact accordingly, von Weizs\u00e4cker promises. Regarding the adverse rebound effect, von Weizs\u00e4cker notes that \"... efforts to improve efficiency have been fraught with increasing overall levels of consumption.\"<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|306}} As remedies, von Weizs\u00e4cker recommends three separate approaches: Recycling of and imposing restrictions on the use of materials; establishing capital funds from natural resource proceeds for reinvestments in order to compensate for the future bust caused by depletion; and finally, taxing resource consumption so as to balance it with the available supplies.<ref name=ew02/>{{rp|309f}}\n* Tim Jackson points out that according to empirical evidence, the world economy has indeed experienced some ''relative'' resource decoupling: In the period from 1970 to 2009, the 'energy intensity' \u2014 that is, the energy content embodied in world GDP\u2014decreased by 33 percent;<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|68f}} but as the world economy also kept growing, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have increased by 80 percent during the same period of time.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|71}} Hence, no ''absolute'' energy resource decoupling materialized. Regarding key metal resources, the development was even worse in that not even ''relative'' resource decoupling have materialized in the period from 1990 to 2007: The extraction of [[iron ore]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]] and [[nickel]] was rising faster than world GDP to the effect that \"resource efficiency is going in the wrong direction,\" mostly due to [[Emerging markets|emerging economies]] \u2014 notably China \u2014 building up their [[infrastructure]].<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|74f}} Jackson concludes his survey by noting that the 'dilemma of growth' is evident when any resource efficiency squeezed out of the economy will sooner or later be pushed back up again by a growing GDP.<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|130}} Jackson further cautions that \"simplistic assumptions that capitalism's propensity for efficiency will stabilize the climate and solve the problem of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt.\"<ref name=tj01/>{{rp|188}}\n\nHerman Daly has argued that the best way to increase natural resource efficiency (decouple) and to prevent the occurrence of any rebound effects is to impose quantitative restrictions on resource use by establishing a [[Emissions trading|cap and trade system of quotas]], managed by a government agency. Daly believes this system features a unique triple advantage:<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|61\u201364}}\n\n* Absolute and permanent limits are set on the extraction rate of, use of and pollution with the resources flowing through the economy; as opposed to taxes that merely alter the prevailing price structure without stopping growth; and as opposed to [[Pollution#Pollution control|pollution standards and control]] which are both costly and difficult to enact and enforce.\n* More efficiency and recycling efforts are induced by the higher resource prices resulting from the restrictions (quota prices plus regular extraction costs).\n* No rebound effects are able to appear, as any temporary excess demand will result only in [[inflation]] or [[shortage]]s, or both \u2014 and ''not'' in increased supply, which is to remain constant and limited on a permanent basis.\n\nFor all its merits, Daly himself points to the existence of physical, technological and practical limitations to how much efficiency and recycling can be achieved by this proposed system.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|77\u201380}} The idea of absolute decoupling ridding the economy as a whole of any dependence on natural resources is ridiculed polemically by Daly as 'angelizing GDP': It would work only if we ascended to become [[angel]]s ourselves.<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|118}}\n\n=== Declining-state economy ===\n{{Distinguish|Recession}}\n{{See also|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Criticising Daly's steady-state economics |Anarcho-primitivism}}\n{{Further|Degrowth}}\n\nA declining-state economy is an economy made up of a declining stock of physical wealth (capital) or a declining population size, or both. A declining-state economy is not to be confused with a [[recession]]: Whereas a declining-state economy is established as the result of deliberate political action, a recession is the unexpected and unwelcome failure of a growing or a steady economy.\n\nProponents of a declining-state economy generally believe that a steady-state economy is not far-reaching enough for the future of mankind. Some proponents may even reject modern [[civilization]] as such, either partly or completely, whereby the concept of a declining-state economy begins bordering on the ideology of [[anarcho-primitivism]], on [[Doomer|radical ecological doomsaying]] or on [[Survivalism#Outline of scenarios and outlooks|some variants of survivalism]].\n\n[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] was the teacher and mentor of Herman Daly and is presently considered the [[Degrowth#Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen|main intellectual figure influencing the degrowth movement]] that formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s. In his \nparadigmatic [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of earth \u2014 that is, earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels \u2014 is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently [[Mining|being extracted and put to use]]; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse]].<ref name=ngr01/> In effect, Georgescu-Roegen points out that the arguments advanced by Herman Daly in support of his steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still!<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|366\u2013369}} Instead of Daly's steady-state economics, Georgescu-Roegen proposed his own so-called 'minimal bioeconomic program', featuring restrictions even more severe than those propounded by his former student Daly [[#Daly's institutions|(see above)]].<ref name=ngr02/>{{rp|374\u2013379}} <ref name=jg02/>{{rp|150\u2013153}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|142\u2013146}}\n\nAmerican political advisor [[Jeremy Rifkin]], French champion of the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]] [[Serge Latouche]] and Austrian degrowth theorist Christian Kerschner \u2014 who all take their cue from Georgescu-Roegen's work \u2014 have argued in favour of declining-state strategies. Consider each in turn:\n\n* In his book on ''[[Entropy: A New World View]]'', Jeremy Rifkin argues that the impending exhaustion of earth's mineral resources will mark the decline of the [[Industrialisation|industrial age]], followed by the advent of a new solar age, based on renewable [[solar power]]. Due to the [[Sunlight#Summary|diffuse, low-intensity property of solar radiation]], this source of energy is incapable of sustaining industrialism, whether capitalist or socialist. Consequently, Rifkin advocates an [[Anarcho-primitivism|anarcho-primitivist]] future solar economy \u2014 or what he terms an 'entropic society' \u2014 based on [[anti-consumerism]], [[deindustrialization]], [[counterurbanization]], [[organic farming]] and [[Malthusianism#Modern Malthusianism|prudential restraints on childbirths]].<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|205\u2013224}} Rifkin cautions that the transition to the solar age is likely to become a troublesome phase in the history of mankind, as the present world economy is so dependent on the non-renewable mineral resources.<ref name=jr01/>{{rp|253\u2013256}}\n* In his manifesto on ''Farewell to Growth'', Serge Latouche develops a strategy of so-called 'ecomunicipalism' to initiate a 'virtuous cycle of quiet contraction' or degrowth of economic activity at the local level of society: Consumption patterns and addiction to work should be reduced; systems of fair taxation and consumption permits should redistribute the gains from economic activity within and among countries; obsolescence and waste should be reduced, products designed so as to make recycling easier. This bottom-up strategy opposes [[overconsumption]] in rich countries as well as emerging, poor countries to aspire this overconsumption of the rich. Instead, the purpose of degrowth is to establish the convivial and sustainable society where people can live better lives whilst working and consuming less.<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|9}} Latouche further cautions that \"the very survival of humanity ... means that ecological concerns must be a central part of our social, political, cultural and spiritual preoccupation with human life.\"<ref name=sl01/>{{rp|103}} <ref name=ap01/>{{rp|134\u2013138}}\n\nHerman Daly on his part is not opposed to the concept of a declining-state economy; but he does point out that the steady-state economy should serve as a preliminary first step on a declining path, once the optimal levels of population and capital have been properly defined. However, this first step is an important one:\n\n{{cquote|[T]he first issue remains to stop the momentum of growth and to learn to run a stable economy at historically given initial conditions. ... But we cannot go into reverse without first coming to a stop. Step one is to achieve a steady-state economy at existing or nearby levels. Step two is to decide whether the optimum level is greater or less than present levels. ... My own judgment on these issues lead me to think we have overshot the optimum.\"<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}}}}\n\nDaly concedes that it is 'difficult, probably impossible' to define such optimum levels;<ref name=hd02/>{{rp|52}} even more, in his final analysis Daly agrees with his teacher and mentor Georgescu-Roegen that no defined optimum will be able to last forever ([[#Daly's credo|see above]]).<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\n=== Capitalism without growth ===\n{{See also|Capitalism #Criticism|Criticism of capitalism #Sustainability |Market failure #Ecological}}\nSeveral [[Political radicalism|radical]] critics of [[capitalism]] have questioned the possibility of ever imposing a steady-state or a declining-state (degrowth) system as a superstructure on top of capitalism.<ref name=rs01/><ref name=jf01/><ref name=tt01/><ref name=rf01/>{{rp|97\u2013100}} <ref name=mm01/>{{rp|45\u201351}} <ref name=bb01/><ref name=pa01/> Taken together, these critics point to the following growth dynamics inherent in capitalism:\n[[File:I think he&#039;s running away from Wall Street... (3007506886).jpg|thumb|Could capitalism ever stop growing?]]\n* Economic activity is generally guided by the [[profit motive]], a competitive work [[Ethos#Current usage|ethos]] and the drive to [[Capital accumulation|accumulate capital and wealth]] for its own sake to gratify personal ambition, provide social prestige \u2014 or simply to [[Greed|get rich in a hurry]]. Psychologically, these [[Drive theory|drives]] in the work sphere [[Psychological repression|repress]] and [[Cognitive distortion|distort]] biological and social [[Homeostasis#History|homeostasis]] in most people.\n* [[Employment]]s and [[income]]s depend directly on [[sales]] revenues, that is, on people spending money on the [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of goods and services for sale on the [[Market (economics)|market]]. This dependency creates a [[Money|pecuniary incentive]] to increase sales as much as possible. To this end, much cunning [[advertising]] is devised to manipulate [[Want|human wants]] and prop up consumption patterns, often resulting in lavish and wasteful [[consumerism]].\n* The [[financial system]] is based on [[fractional-reserve banking]], enabling commercial banks to hold [[Bank reserves|reserves]] in amounts that are less than their [[Liability (financial accounting)|deposit liabilities]]. This credit creation is multiplying the [[monetary base]] supplied by the [[central bank]] in order to assist private [[corporation]]s expanding their activities.\n* [[Productivity improving technologies|Technological development exhibits a strong labour-saving bias]], creating the need to provide new employment elsewhere in the economy for workers displaced by the introduction of new technology.\n* Private corporations generally resist government regulations and restrictions that impede profits and deter [[Investment (macroeconomics)|investment opportunities]]. Attempts to downscale the economy would rapidly degenerate into economic crisis and political instability on this count alone.\n* Governments need [[tax revenue]]s to service their [[Government debt|debt obligations]], run their institutions and finance their [[Welfare|welfare programmes]] for the benefit of the public. Tax revenues are collected from general economic activity.\n* In the capitalist [[world economy]], [[Economic globalization|globalisation]] intensifies competition everywhere, both within and between countries. National governments are compelled to compete and struggle with each other to provide employment, investments, tax revenues and wealth for their own populations.\n\u2014 In short: There is no end to the systemic and ecologically harmful growth dynamics in modern capitalism, radical critics assert.\n\nFully aware of the massive growth dynamics of capitalism, Herman Daly on his part poses the rhetorical question whether his concept of a steady-state economy is essentially capitalistic or [[Socialism|socialistic]]. He provides the following answer (written in 1980):\n\n{{cquote|The growth versus steady-state debate really cuts across the old [[Left-wing politics|left]]-[[Right-wing politics|right]] rift, and we should resist any attempt to identify either growth or steady-state with either left or right, for two reasons. First, it will impose a logical distortion on the issue. Second, it will obscure the emergence of a third way, which might form a future synthesis of socialism and capitalism into a steady-state economy and eventually into a fully just and sustainable society.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}}}\n\nDaly concludes by inviting all (most) people \u2014 both liberal supporters of and radical critics of capitalism \u2014 to join him in his effort to develop a steady-state economy.<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|367}}\n\n=== Pushing some of the terrestrial limits into outer space ===\n{{Main| Asteroid mining}}\n{{See also| Human overpopulation #Extraterrestrial settlement | Space colonization #Reasons| Space manufacturing}}\n{{Further|Space advocacy}}\n\nEver since the beginning of the modern [[Space Age]] in the 1950s, [[Space advocacy|space advocates]] have developed plans for [[Space colonization|colonising space]] in order to counter [[human overpopulation]] and mitigate ecological pressures on earth (if not for other reasons).\n\n[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill wanted colonists to settle in [[O'Neill cylinder|specially designed cylinders]] in outer space]]\nIn the 1970s, physicist and space activist [[Gerard K.

According to O'Neill's vision, mankind could \u2014 and indeed ''should'' \u2014 expand on this man-made frontier to many times the current world population and generate large amounts of new wealth in space. Herman Daly countered O'Neill's vision by arguing that a space colony would become subject to much harsher limits to growth \u2014 and hence, would have to be secured and managed with much more care and discipline \u2014 than a steady-state economy on large and resilient earth. Although the number of individual colonies supposedly could be increased without end, living conditions in any one particular colony would become very restricted nonetheless. Therefore, Daly concluded: \"The alleged impossibility of a steady-state on earth provides a poor intellectual launching pad for space colonies.\"<ref name=hd01/>{{rp|369}}\n\nBy the 2010s, O'Neill's old vision of space colonisation had long since been turned upside down in many places: Instead of dispatching colonists from earth to live in remote space settlements, some ecology-minded space advocates conjecture that resources could be [[Asteroid mining|mined from asteroids in space]] and transported back to earth for use here. This new vision has the same double advantage of (partly) mitigating ecological pressures on earth's limited mineral reserves while also boosting [[Space exploration|exploration]] and [[Space colonization|colonisation]] of space. The building up of [[Space manufacturing|industrial infrastructure in space]] would be required for the purpose, as well as the establishment of a complete [[supply chain]] up to the level of self-sufficiency and then beyond, eventually developing into a permanent extraterrestrial source of wealth to provide an adequate [[return on investment]] for stakeholders. In the future, such an 'exo-economy' (off-planet economy) could possibly even serve as the first step towards mankind's [[Cosmos|cosmic]] ascension to a 'Type II' civilisation on the hypothetical [[Kardashev scale]], in case such an ascension will ever be accomplished.<ref name=wc01/><ref name=as02/><ref name=pm01/>\n\n[[File:Pioneer 10 images the sun.jpg|thumb|right| Astronomically long distances and time scales are ever present in space]]\nHowever, it is yet uncertain whether an off-planet economy of the type specified will develop in due time to match both the volume and the output mix needed to fully replace earth's [[Peak minerals|dwindling mineral reserves]]. Sceptics like Herman Daly and others point to exorbitant earth-to-orbit launch costs of any space mission, inaccurate identification of target asteroids suitable for mining, and remote ''[[in situ]]'' ore extraction difficulties as obvious barriers to success: Investing a lot of terrestrial resources in order to recover only a few resources from space in return is not worthwhile in any case, regardless of the scarcities, technologies and other mission parameters involved in the venture. In addition, even if an off-planet economy could somehow be established at some future point, one long-term predicament would then loom large regarding the continuous mining and transportation of massive volumes of materials from space back to earth: How to keep up that volume flowing on a steady and permanent basis in the face of the [[Astronomy|astronomically]] long distances and time scales ever present in space. In the worst of cases, all of these obstacles could forever prevent any substantial pushing of limits into outer space \u2014 and then limits to growth on earth will remain the only limits of concern throughout mankind's entire span of existence.<ref name=hd07/>{{rp|24}} <ref name=ub01/>{{rp|81\u201383}} <ref name=te01/><ref name=ws01/><ref name=kz01/>\n\n=== Economic growth as a condition of military capability ===\n{{See also|Peace|military capability}}\n{{off topic|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy (CASSE)]] mention on his site that the cold war was measured in GDP, and because of it was unsustainable referring to the book of Robert Collins, named: \"More: The Politics of Economic Growth in Postwar America\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Czech |first1=Brian |last2=Mastini |first2=Riccardo |title=Degrowth Toward a Steady State Economy: Unifying Non-Growth Movements for Political Impact |url=https://steadystate.org/degrowth-toward-a-steady-state-economy-unifying-non-growth-movements-for-political-impact/ |website=Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy |accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>.

In the 19th century the elaboration of [[anarchism|anarchist]] thought called the whole concept of leadership into question.

This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the \"[[trait leadership|trait theory of leadership]]\".\n\nA number of works in the 19th century \u2013 when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane \u2013 explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and of [[Francis Galton]], whose works have prompted decades of research. In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited. In other words, leaders were born, not developed. Both of these notable works lent great initial support for the notion that leadership is rooted in characteristics of a leader.\n\n[[Cecil Rhodes]] (1853\u20131902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with \"moral force of character and instincts to lead\", and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the [[University of Oxford]]) which further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help \"render war impossible\". This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.<ref>See [[Donald Markwell]], ''\"Instincts to Lead\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court: Australia, 2013. {{ISBN|9781922168702}} {{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222013842/http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |archivedate=2017-02-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Rise of alternative theories===\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews of these studies (e.g., Bird, 1940;<ref>Bird, C. (1940). ''Social Psychology''. New York: Appleton-Century.</ref> Stogdill, 1948;<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stogdill | first1 = R.

In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that people who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.\n\n===Reemergence of trait theory===\n\nNew methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish [[trait theory]] as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.<ref name=\"Kenny, D.A. 1983\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kenny | first1 = D.

This advent allowed trait theorists to create a comprehensive picture of previous leadership research rather than rely on the qualitative reviews of the past.

New York: Guilford Press.</ref> In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes.\n\n===Behavioral and style theories===\n{{Main|Managerial grid model}}\n\nIn response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.<ref>[[#refSpillane2004|Spillane (2004)]]</ref> [[David McClelland]], for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York: ''The CEO Paradox'' (1992)</ref>\n[[File:Management Grid.PNG|right|thumb|200px|A graphical representation of the managerial grid model]]\n\n[[Kurt Lewin]], Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of [[group decision making]], [[praise]] and [[criticism]] ([[feedback]]), and the management of the group tasks ([[project management]]) according to three styles: [[Leadership#Autocratic or authoritarian style|authoritarian]], [[Leadership#Participative or democratic|democratic]], and [[Leadership#Laissez-faire or free rein style|laissez-faire]].<ref>[[#refLewin1939|Lewin et al. (1939)]]</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders. They would then identify if these particular behaviors are reflective of leadership effectiveness. They were able to narrow their findings to two identifiable distinctions<ref>\"Ohio State Leadership Studies Explained with Examples\"(2017)</ref> The first dimension was identified as \"Initiating Structure\", which described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with their followers, defines goals, and determine how tasks are performed. These are considered \"task oriented\" behaviors. The second dimension is \"Consideration\", which indicates the leader's ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered \"social oriented\" behaviors.<ref>AAmodt (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they had similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they also contributed an additional behavior identified in leaders: participative behavior (also called \"servant leadership\"), or allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. This entails avoiding controlling types of leadership and allows more personal interactions between leaders and their subordinates.<ref>Stoker (2016)</ref>\n\nThe managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by [[Robert Blake (management)|Robert Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.<ref>[[#refBlake1964|Blake et al. (1964)]]</ref>\n\n====Positive reinforcement====\n[[B. F. Skinner]] is the father of [[behavior modification]] and developed the concept of [[positive reinforcement]]. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, increasing the likelihood of that behavior in the future.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G., (2004). ''Behavior Modification Principles and Procedures'' (3rd ed). Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.</ref> The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume [[praise]] is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.\n\nThe use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.<ref>Lussier, R. N., & Achua, C. F., (2010). ''Leadership, Theory, Application, & Skill Development.''(4th ed). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.</ref> Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that [[reinforcement theory]] has a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.\n\n===Situational and contingency theories===\n{{Main|Fiedler contingency model|Vroom\u2013Yetton decision model|path\u2013goal theory}}\n\nSituational theory also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership. [[social science|Social scientists]] argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] suggested. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1884) (and [[Karl Marx]]) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.<ref>[[#refSpencer1841|Spencer (1884)]], apud [[#refHeifetz1994|Heifetz (1994)]], p. 16</ref> This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, \"what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions.\"<ref>[[#refHemphill1949|Hemphill (1949)]]</ref>\n\nSome theorists started to synthesize the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics began to normalize the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the \"hearts and minds\" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not \"take charge\", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.<ref>[[#refWormer2007|Wormer et al. (2007)]], p. 198</ref> Thus, theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation, which is sometimes classified as contingency theory. Three contingency leadership theories appear more prominently in recent years: Fiedler contingency model, Vroom-Yetton decision model, and the path-goal theory.\n\nThe [[Fiedler contingency model]] bases the leader's effectiveness on what [[Fred Fiedler]] called ''situational contingency''. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called ''situational control''). The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).<ref>[[#refFiedler1967|Fiedler (1967)]]</ref> According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a \"favorable situation\". Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.\n\n[[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973)<ref>[[#refVroom1973|Vroom, Yetton (1973)]]</ref> and later with Arthur Jago (1988),<ref>[[#refVroom1988|Vroom, Jago (1988)]]</ref> developed a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|decision model]] where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.<ref>[[#refSternberg2002|Sternberg, Vroom (2002)]]</ref> This approach was novel because it supported the idea that the same manager could rely on different [[group decision making]] approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.<ref>[[#refLorsch1974|Lorsch (1974)]]</ref>\n\nThe [[path-goal theory]] of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the [[expectancy theory]] of [[Victor Vroom]].<ref>[[#refHouse1971|House (1971)]]</ref> According to House, the essence of the theory is \"the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance\".<ref>[[#refHouse1996|House (1996)]]</ref> The theory identifies four leader behaviors, ''achievement-oriented'', ''directive'', ''participative'', and ''supportive'', that are contingent to the environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the [[Fiedler contingency model]], the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a [[Contingency leadership theory|contingency theory]], as it depends on the circumstances, and as a [[Transactional leadership|transactional leadership theory]], as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.\n\n===Functional theory===\n{{Main|Functional leadership model}}\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 100805-F-7552L-211 - Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Gen. David H. Petraeus center U.S. Army talks with U.S. soldiers of the 2nd Battalion.jpg|thumb|250px|General Petraeus talks with U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan]]\nFunctional leadership theory (Hackman & Walton, 1986; [[McGrath]], 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes & Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion (Fleishman et al., 1991; Hackman & Wageman, 2005; Hackman & Walton, 1986). While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, & Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001). In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al. (1996), Zaccaro et al. (2001), Hackman and Walton (1986), Hackman & Wageman (2005), Morgeson (2005)), Klein, Zeigert, Knight, and Xiao (2006) observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization's effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.\n\nA variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as [[consideration and initiating structure]]. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.\n\n===Integrated psychological theory===\n{{Main|Three Levels of Leadership model}}\n\nThe Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, introducing a new element \u2013 the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of [[servant leadership]] and [[authentic leadership]].<ref>Businessballs management information website \u2013 Leadership Theories page, \"Integrated Psychological Approach\" section: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership</ref>\n\nIntegrated Psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller's [[Three Levels of Leadership model]] (2011).<ref>Scouller, J. (2011). ''The Three Levels of Leadership: How to Develop Your Leadership Presence, Knowhow and Skill''. Cirencester: Management Books 2000., {{ISBN|9781852526818}}</ref>\nScouller argued that the older theories offer only limited assistance in developing a person's ability to lead effectively.<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\nHe pointed out, for example, that:\n* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.\n* An ideal style (e.g. Blake & Mouton's team style) would not suit all circumstances.\n* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.\n* None of the old theories successfully address the challenge of developing \"[[Three Levels of Leadership model#Leadership presence|leadership presence]]\"; that certain \"something\" in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust and makes followers want to work with them.\n\nScouller proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an \"Integrated Psychological\" theory on the Businessballs education website.<ref>Businessballs information website: Leadership Theories Page, Integrated Psychological Approach section. Businessballs.com.: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership 2012-02-24. Retrieved 2012-08-15</ref> In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.\n\nThe three levels in his model are Public, Private and Personal leadership:\n* The first two \u2013 public and private leadership \u2013 are \"outer\" or behavioral levels. These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called \"the four dimensions of leadership\". These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Public leadership|Public leadership]] focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Private leadership|Private leadership]] covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one to one.\n* The third \u2013 [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Personal leadership|personal leadership]] \u2013 is an \"inner\" level and concerns a person's growth toward greater leadership presence, knowhow and skill. Working on one's personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical knowhow and skill (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people \u2013 which is the basis of servant leadership (3) Psychological self-mastery \u2013 the foundation for authentic leadership.\n\nScouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one's leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers and dissolving one's limiting beliefs and habits, thereby enabling behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one's core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of [[Mindfulness#Mindfulness meditation in organizations|mindfulness meditation]].<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 137\u2013237.</ref>\n\n===Transactional and transformational theories===\n{{Main|Transactional leadership|Transformational leadership}}\n\n[[Bernard Bass]] and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership, transactional that involves exchange of labor for rewards and transformational which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B.

It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.\n\n===Leader\u2013member exchange theory===\n{{Main|Leader\u2013member exchange theory}}\nThis LMX theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader\u2013member exchange (LMX) theory,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G.

Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16 16\u201317]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16}}</ref> LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''. In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|page=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17 17]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17}}</ref>\n\n====In-group members====\n\n[[In-group]] members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/> In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.\n\n====Out-group members====\n\n[[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]] members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate [[job performance]], good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a [[living wage|fair wage]] and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/>\n\n===Emotions===\n{{see also|Emotional intelligence}}\nLeadership can be perceived as a particularly emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J.

[[Group affective tone]] represents the consistent or homogeneous affective reactions within a group.

Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.<ref name=cote/>\nIn research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the [[leader]] improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.<ref name=george>{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J.

It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',<ref>[[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'', U of Chicago Press, 1995</ref> [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''<ref>[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009</ref>).\n\nDifferent situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or [[Laissez-faire]] style may be more effective. The style adopted should be the one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.<ref name=Lewin>{{cite journal| last=Lewin | first=K.| author-link=Kurt Lewin| last2=Lippitt | first2=R.| last3=White | first3=R.

The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.<ref>Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). \"Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile\". FM 6-22. Washington, D.C., 12 October 2006 p. 18. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil).</ref>\n\n===Autocratic or authoritarian===\n\nUnder the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.\n\nAutocratic leaders do not ask or entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.<ref name=Lewin/>\n\n===Participative or democratic===\nThe democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. This has also been called [[shared leadership]].\n\n=== Laissez-faire or Free-rein ===\nIn Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates. The sub-ordinates are given complete right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317115085|title=Modern leadership and management methods for development organizations|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Task-oriented and relationship-oriented===\n{{Main|Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership}}\nTask-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader is focused on the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet a certain production goal. Task-oriented leaders are generally more concerned with producing a step-by-step solution for given problem or goal, strictly making sure these deadlines are met, results and reaching target outcomes.\n\nRelationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ronald J. Ebert, Ricky W.|title=Business essentials|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-705349-0|pages=135\u2013136|edition=8th}}</ref> Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.\n\nTask-oriented leaders are typically less concerned with the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. These leaders have  absolute focus on the goal and the tasks cut out for each member. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer\n\n===Paternalism===\n{{Main|Paternalism}}\nPaternalism leadership styles often reflect a father-figure mindset. The structure of team is organized hierarchically where the leader is viewed above the followers. The leader also provides both professional and personal direction in the lives of the members.<ref name=\"Aycan\">{{cite book |last1=Aycan |first1=Z |title=Paternalism: Towards conceptual refinement and operationalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=London |pages=445\u2013446}}</ref> There is often a limitation on the choices that the members can choose from due to the heavy direction given by the leader.\n\nThe term paternalism is from the Latin pater meaning \"father\". The leader is most often a male. This leadership style is often found in Russia, Africa, and Pacific Asian Societies.<ref name=\"Aycan\"/>\n\n==Leadership differences affected by gender==\n{{One source|section|date=February 2013}}\nAnother factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an [[:agentic leadership]] style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.

These barriers also change according to different cultures. Despite the increasing number of female leaders in the world, only a small fraction come from non-westernized cultures. It is important to note that although the barriers listed below may be more severe in non-western culture, it does not imply that westernized cultures do not have these barriers as well. This aims to compare the differences between the two.\n\n'''Research and Literature'''\nAlthough there have been many studies done on leadership for women in the past decade, very little research has been done for women in paternalistic cultures. The literature and research done for women to emerge into a society that prefers males is lacking.  This ultimately hinders women from knowing how to reach their individual leadership goals, and fails to educate the male counterparts in this disparity.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tsui |author2=Nifadkar |author3=Ou |title=Cross-Cultural Organizational Behavior Research: Advances, Gaps, and Recommendations |journal=Journal of Management |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=426\u2013478 |doi=10.1177/0149206307300818 |year=2007}}</ref>\n\n'''Maternity Leave'''\nStudies have shown the importance of longer  paid maternity leave and the positive effects it has on a female employee's mental health and return to work. In Sweden, it was shown that the increased flexibility in timing for mothers to return to work, decreased the odds of poor mental health reports. In these non-western cultures that mostly follow paternalism, the lack of knowledge on the benefits of maternity leave impact the support given to the women during this important time in their life.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chatrerji |author2=Markowitz |title=Does the Length of Maternity Leave Affect Maternal Health? |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=2004 |volume=72 |issue=1 |page=16|doi=10.2307/20062092 |jstor=20062092 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10206.pdf }}</ref>\n\n'''Society and Laws'''\nCertain countries that follow paternalism, such as India, still allow for women to be treated unjustly. Child marriage and minor punishments for perpetrators in crime against women, shape the society's view on how females should be treated. This can prevent women from feeling comfortable to speak out in both a personal and professional setting.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Yadav |author2=Singh |title=Gender and Politics of Culture |journal=Political Science |date=2015 |page=77}}</ref>\n\n'''Glass Ceilings and Glass Cliffs'''\nWomen who work in a very paternalistic culture or industry (e.g. oil or engineering industry), often deal with a limitations in their career that prevent them from moving up any further. This association is often due to the mentality that only males carry leadership characteristics. The glass cliff term refers to undesired projects that are often given to women because they have an increase in risk of failure. These undesired projects are given to female employees where they are more likely to fail and leave the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vinkenberg |author2=Engen |author3=Eagly |author4=Johannesen-Schmidt |title=An exploration of stereotypical beliefs about leadership styles: Is transformational leadership a route to womens promotion? |journal=The Leadership Quarterly |date=2011 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=10\u201321|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.12.003 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/1313103/LQ_2011_VinkenburgVanEngenEaglyJohannesenSchmidt.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nIn the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl & Ehrlich, 1987). Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day & Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, & Craig, 2008). To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.\n\nJob performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990). Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of the dimensions that he identified. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance (Yukl, 2006). Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership [[performance]], including outcomes such as leader [[effectiveness]], leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008). For instance, leadership performance may be used to refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.\n\n[[File:HierarchyOfLeaderEfficiency.jpg|thumb|Hierarchy Of Leader Efficiency based on Hierarchy of Competence\nand the M5 Work Motivation Model <ref>Igor Kokcharov, Hierarchy of Skills http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015</ref>]]\n\n\"Another way to conceptualize leader performance is to focus on the outcomes of the leader\u2019s followers, group, team, unit, or organization. In evaluating this type of leader performance, two general strategies are typically used. The first relies on subjective perceptions of the leader\u2019s performance from subordinates, superiors, or occasionally peers or other parties. The other type of effectiveness measures are more objective indicators of follower or unit performance, such as measures of productivity, goal attainment, sales figures, or unit financial performance (Bass & Riggio, 2006, p. 47).\"\n<ref>Bass, B.

Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual. Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4 4\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4}}</ref> However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances. The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.\n\nDetermination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance and sometimes dominance. People with these traits often tend to wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive with others. Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Howell provides examples of Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln as encompassing the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nSelf-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Individuals who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions; they also have the ability to project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment. Integrity is demonstrated in individuals who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. It is often said that these leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts. Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example who embodies integrity, assertiveness, and [[soft skills|social abilities]] in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nFew great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed as front-runners of their organization or situation.\n\n==Ontological-phenomenological model==\nOne of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from [[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as \"an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn't going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...\". This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.  This differs from relating to the relevant parties as \"followers\" and calling up an image of a single leader with others following.  Rather, a future that fulfills on the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that wasn't going to happen is not the \"idea of the leader\", but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.<ref>Forthcoming in \"The Handbook for Teaching Leadership\", by Werner Erhard, Michael, C. Jensen, & Kari Granger; Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana (Editors) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682</ref>\n\n==Contexts==\n\n===Organizations===\nAn organization that is established as an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] or means for achieving defined [[Goal|objectives]] has been referred to as a ''formal organization''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work [[structure]]. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one's position in the hierarchy, the greater one's presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.<ref>{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1970|pages=884\u201389|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal [[Goal|objectives]] and [[goal]]s of the individual [[wikt:Membership|membership]]. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life \u2014 the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.\n\nIn prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.<ref name=\"Henry\">{{cite book |author1=Henry P. Knowles |author2=Borje O.

Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.<ref name=\"Henry\"/>\n\nA leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. It is not dependent on title or formal authority. (Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern & Lubar.) Ogbonnia (2007) defines an effective leader \"as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society.\" Leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist.<ref>Hoyle, John R. ''Leadership and Futuring: Making Visions Happen''. Thousand Oaks, California: Corwin Press, Inc., 1995.</ref> An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position. However, she or he must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority, because authority is only potentially available to him/her. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.<ref name=\"Henry\"/> Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=David|title=The Top 10 Leadership Qualities|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410090435/http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archivedate=2013-04-10|website=HR World}}</ref>\n\n===Management===\nOver the years the philosophical terminology of \"[[management]]\" and \"leadership\" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between \"transactional\" leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and \"transformational\" leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, creativity).<ref name=\"Burns\"/>\n\n===Group===\nIn contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called [[shared leadership]], more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation and mutual influence among the team members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=CARSON|first=J. B.|last2=TESLUK|first2=P.

Others may see the traditional leadership of a [[wikt:boss|boss]] as costing too much in team performance. In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders. Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ingrid Bens|year=2006|title=Facilitating to Lead|publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-7731-3}}</ref>\n\nLeaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups. Good leaders use their own inner [[Mentorship|mentors]] to energize their team and organizations and lead a team to achieve success.<ref>{{cite book |author= Bart Barthelemy|year=1997|title=The Sky Is Not The Limit \u2013 Breakthrough Leadership|publisher=St. Lucie Press}}</ref>\n\n'''''According to the National School Boards Association (USA):'''''<ref>National School Boards Association</ref>\n\nThese Group Leaderships or Leadership Teams have specific characteristics:\n\n'''Characteristics of a Team'''\n* There must be an awareness of unity on the part of all its members.\n* There must be interpersonal relationship. Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.\n* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.\n\n'''Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams:'''\n* Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.\n* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.\n* Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.\n* Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.\n* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.\n* Personal traits: members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.\n* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.\n* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.\n* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.\n* Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.\n\n===Self-leadership===\n[[Communication and Leadership During Change|Self-leadership]] is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act. It is an expression of who we are as people.<ref>Hackman, M. & Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc.</ref> Self-leadership is having a developed sense of who you are, what you can achieve, what are your goals coupled with the ability to affect your emotions, behaviors and communication. At the center of leadership is the person who is motivated to make the difference. Self-leadership is a way toward more effectively leading other people.  <ref>Browning, M (2018). \"Self-Leadership: Why It Matters\"</ref>\n\n===Biology and Evolution of Leadership===\n[[Mark van Vugt]] and [[Anjana Ahuja]] in ''Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership'' (2011) present evidence of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too.<ref>van Vugt, M., & Ahuja, A. (2011). ''Naturally Selected: the Evolutionary Science of Leadership''. HarperBusiness.</ref> They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership are different from that of dominance. In a study [[Mark van Vugt]] and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Van der Meij | first1 = L. | last2 = Schaveling | first2 = J. | last3 = van Vugt | first3 = M. | year = 2016 | title = Basal testosterone, leadership and dominance: A field study and meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychoneuroendocrinology | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 72\u201379 }}</ref>\n[[Richard Wrangham]] and [[Dale Peterson]], in ''[[Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]'' (1996), present evidence that only humans and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.<ref>Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson (1996). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm ''Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'']. Mariner Books</ref> This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which follow castrated bell[[wether (disambiguation)|wethers]]) and many others.\n\nBy comparison, [[bonobo]]s, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do ''not'' unite behind the chief male of the land. The bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a \"[[hippie]] chimp\".<ref>\n[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/30/070730fa_fact_parker Swingers - The New Yorker<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n</ref>\n\n==Myths==\nLeadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).<ref>Gardner, J. W. (1965). ''Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society.'' New York: Harper and Row.</ref><ref>Bennis, W. G. (1975). ''Where have all the leaders gone?'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Executive Institute.</ref>\n\n===Leadership is innate===\nAccording to some, leadership is determined by distinctive [[dispositional affect|dispositional characteristics]] present at birth (e.g., [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]; [[intelligence]]; [[ingenuity]]). However, according to Forsyth (2009) there is evidence to show that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation.<ref name=Forsyth>Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, California: Brooks/Cole.</ref> Thus, effective leadership can result from [[nature versus nurture|nature]] (i.e., innate talents) as well as [[nature versus nurture|nurture]] (i.e., acquired skills).\n\n===Leadership is possessing power over others===\nAlthough leadership is certainly a form of [[Power (social and political)|power]], it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people \u2013 rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).<ref name=Forsyth/> Despite popular belief, the use of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], [[coercion]], and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).\n\n===Leaders are positively influential===\nThe [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, according to Baumeister et al. (1988), the [[bystander effect]] (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R.

However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including his/her own followers (e.g., [[Pol Pot]]; [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]]). Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.<ref>Lipman-Blumen, J. (2005) ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders''. New York: Oxford. University Press Inc.</ref>\n\n===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===\nIn [[Western culture]]s it is generally assumed that group leaders make ''all'' the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. Although common, this romanticized view of leadership (i.e., the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups' outcomes) ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = J.

Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them.

Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schelten|first1=Andreas|title=Prof.|url=http://www.bpaed.edu.tum.de/fileadmin/tueds02/www/pdfs/publikationen/riedl/2002handoutvariantsriedl.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers. Zachary Hansen was an early adopter of Scrum/Kanban branch development methodologies during the mid 90's to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules satisfying the clients need to rapidly patch production environment bugs as needed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=B.W.|title=Software risk management: principles and practices|journal=IEEE Software|volume=8|pages=32\u201341|doi=10.1109/52.62930|year=1991|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.466}}</ref>\n\n==Critical thought==\n\n[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s 1840 \"[[Great Man theory]]\", which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n[[Karl Popper]] noted in 1945 that leaders can [[mislead]] and make mistakes - he warns against deferring to \"great men\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Popper\n| first1 = Karl\n| author-link1 = Karl Popper\n| year = 1945\n| chapter = Preface to the First Edition\n| title = The Open Society and Its Enemies \n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gw9wV2Unpe8C\n| edition = 7\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2012\n| page = xxxiii\n| isbn = 9781136749773\n| access-date = 2017-08-20\n| quote = [...] if our civilisation is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men.

This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the \"[[trait leadership|trait theory of leadership]]\".\n\nA number of works in the 19th century \u2013 when the traditional authority of monarchs, lords and bishops had begun to wane \u2013 explored the trait theory at length: note especially the writings of [[Thomas Carlyle]] and of [[Francis Galton]], whose works have prompted decades of research. In ''Heroes and Hero Worship'' (1841), Carlyle identified the talents, skills, and physical characteristics of men who rose to power. Galton's ''Hereditary Genius'' (1869) examined leadership qualities in the families of powerful men. After showing that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when his focus moved from first-degree to second-degree relatives, Galton concluded that leadership was inherited. In other words, leaders were born, not developed. Both of these notable works lent great initial support for the notion that leadership is rooted in characteristics of a leader.\n\n[[Cecil Rhodes]] (1853\u20131902) believed that public-spirited leadership could be nurtured by identifying young people with \"moral force of character and instincts to lead\", and educating them in contexts (such as the collegiate environment of the [[University of Oxford]]) which further developed such characteristics. International networks of such leaders could help to promote international understanding and help \"render war impossible\". This vision of leadership underlay the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], which have helped to shape notions of leadership since their creation in 1903.<ref>See [[Donald Markwell]], ''\"Instincts to Lead\": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'', Connor Court: Australia, 2013. {{ISBN|9781922168702}} {{cite web |url=http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222013842/http://www.connorcourt.com/catalog1/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=256 |archivedate=2017-02-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Rise of alternative theories===\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, a series of qualitative reviews of these studies (e.g., Bird, 1940;<ref>Bird, C.

In reviewing the extant literature, Stogdill and Mann found that while some traits were common across a number of studies, the overall evidence suggested that people who are leaders in one situation may not necessarily be leaders in other situations. Subsequently, leadership was no longer characterized as an enduring individual trait, as situational approaches (see alternative leadership theories below) posited that individuals can be effective in certain situations, but not others. The focus then shifted away from traits of leaders to an investigation of the leader behaviors that were effective. This approach dominated much of the leadership theory and research for the next few decades.\n\n===Reemergence of trait theory===\n\nNew methods and measurements were developed after these influential reviews that would ultimately reestablish [[trait theory]] as a viable approach to the study of leadership. For example, improvements in researchers' use of the round robin research design methodology allowed researchers to see that individuals can and do emerge as leaders across a variety of situations and tasks.<ref name=\"Kenny, D.A. 1983\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kenny | first1 = D.

New York: Guilford Press.</ref> In other words, the leader attribute pattern approach argues that integrated constellations or combinations of individual differences may explain substantial variance in both leader emergence and leader effectiveness beyond that explained by single attributes, or by additive combinations of multiple attributes.\n\n===Behavioral and style theories===\n{{Main|Managerial grid model}}\n\nIn response to the early criticisms of the trait approach, theorists began to research leadership as a set of behaviors, evaluating the behavior of successful leaders, determining a behavior taxonomy, and identifying broad leadership styles.<ref>[[#refSpillane2004|Spillane (2004)]]</ref> [[David McClelland]], for example, posited that leadership takes a strong personality with a well-developed positive ego. To lead, self-confidence and high self-esteem are useful, perhaps even essential.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York: ''The CEO Paradox'' (1992)</ref>\n[[File:Management Grid.PNG|right|thumb|200px|A graphical representation of the managerial grid model]]\n\n[[Kurt Lewin]], Ronald Lipitt, and Ralph White developed in 1939 the seminal work on the influence of leadership styles and performance. The researchers evaluated the performance of groups of eleven-year-old boys under different types of work climate. In each, the leader exercised his influence regarding the type of [[group decision making]], [[praise]] and [[criticism]] ([[feedback]]), and the management of the group tasks ([[project management]]) according to three styles: [[Leadership#Autocratic or authoritarian style|authoritarian]], [[Leadership#Participative or democratic|democratic]], and [[Leadership#Laissez-faire or free rein style|laissez-faire]].<ref>[[#refLewin1939|Lewin et al. (1939)]]</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Ohio State University conducted a study which investigated observable behaviors portrayed by effective leaders. They would then identify if these particular behaviors are reflective of leadership effectiveness. They were able to narrow their findings to two identifiable distinctions<ref>\"Ohio State Leadership Studies Explained with Examples\"(2017)</ref> The first dimension was identified as \"Initiating Structure\", which described how a leader clearly and accurately communicates with their followers, defines goals, and determine how tasks are performed. These are considered \"task oriented\" behaviors. The second dimension is \"Consideration\", which indicates the leader's ability to build an interpersonal relationship with their followers, to establish a form of mutual trust. These are considered \"social oriented\" behaviors.<ref>AAmodt (2015)</ref>\n\nThe Michigan State Studies, which were conducted in the 1950s, made further investigations and findings that positively correlated behaviors and leadership effectiveness. Although they had similar findings as the Ohio State studies, they also contributed an additional behavior identified in leaders: participative behavior (also called \"servant leadership\"), or allowing the followers to participate in group decision making and encouraged subordinate input. This entails avoiding controlling types of leadership and allows more personal interactions between leaders and their subordinates.<ref>Stoker (2016)</ref>\n\nThe managerial grid model is also based on a behavioral theory. The model was developed by [[Robert Blake (management)|Robert Blake]] and [[Jane Mouton]] in 1964 and suggests five different leadership styles, based on the leaders' concern for people and their concern for goal achievement.<ref>[[#refBlake1964|Blake et al. (1964)]]</ref>\n\n====Positive reinforcement====\n[[B. F. Skinner]] is the father of [[behavior modification]] and developed the concept of [[positive reinforcement]]. Positive reinforcement occurs when a positive stimulus is presented in response to a behavior, increasing the likelihood of that behavior in the future.<ref>Miltenberger, R. G., (2004). ''Behavior Modification Principles and Procedures'' (3rd ed). Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning.</ref> The following is an example of how positive reinforcement can be used in a business setting. Assume [[praise]] is a positive reinforcer for a particular employee. This employee does not show up to work on time every day. The manager of this employee decides to praise the employee for showing up on time every day the employee actually shows up to work on time. As a result, the employee comes to work on time more often because the employee likes to be praised. In this example, praise (the stimulus) is a positive reinforcer for this employee because the employee arrives at work on time (the behavior) more frequently after being praised for showing up to work on time.\n\nThe use of positive reinforcement is a successful and growing technique used by leaders to motivate and attain desired behaviors from subordinates. Organizations such as Frito-Lay, 3M, Goodrich, Michigan Bell, and Emery Air Freight have all used reinforcement to increase productivity.<ref>Lussier, R. N., & Achua, C. F., (2010). ''Leadership, Theory, Application, & Skill Development.''(4th ed). Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.</ref> Empirical research covering the last 20 years suggests that [[reinforcement theory]] has a 17 percent increase in performance. Additionally, many reinforcement techniques such as the use of praise are inexpensive, providing higher performance for lower costs.\n\n===Situational and contingency theories===\n{{Main|Fiedler contingency model|Vroom\u2013Yetton decision model|path\u2013goal theory}}\n\nSituational theory also appeared as a reaction to the trait theory of leadership. [[social science|Social scientists]] argued that history was more than the result of intervention of great men as [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] suggested. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1884) (and [[Karl Marx]]) said that the times produce the person and not the other way around.<ref>[[#refSpencer1841|Spencer (1884)]], apud [[#refHeifetz1994|Heifetz (1994)]], p. 16</ref> This theory assumes that different situations call for different characteristics; according to this group of theories, no single optimal psychographic profile of a leader exists. According to the theory, \"what an individual actually does when acting as a leader is in large part dependent upon characteristics of the situation in which he functions.\"<ref>[[#refHemphill1949|Hemphill (1949)]]</ref>\n\nSome theorists started to synthesize the trait and situational approaches. Building upon the research of Lewin et al., academics began to normalize the descriptive models of leadership climates, defining three leadership styles and identifying which situations each style works better in. The authoritarian leadership style, for example, is approved in periods of crisis but fails to win the \"hearts and minds\" of followers in day-to-day management; the democratic leadership style is more adequate in situations that require consensus building; finally, the laissez-faire leadership style is appreciated for the degree of freedom it provides, but as the leaders do not \"take charge\", they can be perceived as a failure in protracted or thorny organizational problems.<ref>[[#refWormer2007|Wormer et al. (2007)]], p. 198</ref> Thus, theorists defined the style of leadership as contingent to the situation, which is sometimes classified as contingency theory. Three contingency leadership theories appear more prominently in recent years: Fiedler contingency model, Vroom-Yetton decision model, and the path-goal theory.\n\nThe [[Fiedler contingency model]] bases the leader's effectiveness on what [[Fred Fiedler]] called ''situational contingency''. This results from the interaction of leadership style and situational favorability (later called ''situational control''). The theory defined two types of leader: those who tend to accomplish the task by developing good relationships with the group (relationship-oriented), and those who have as their prime concern carrying out the task itself (task-oriented).<ref>[[#refFiedler1967|Fiedler (1967)]]</ref> According to Fiedler, there is no ideal leader. Both task-oriented and relationship-oriented leaders can be effective if their leadership orientation fits the situation. When there is a good leader-member relation, a highly structured task, and high leader position power, the situation is considered a \"favorable situation\". Fiedler found that task-oriented leaders are more effective in extremely favorable or unfavorable situations, whereas relationship-oriented leaders perform best in situations with intermediate favorability.\n\n[[Victor Vroom]], in collaboration with Phillip Yetton (1973)<ref>[[#refVroom1973|Vroom, Yetton (1973)]]</ref> and later with Arthur Jago (1988),<ref>[[#refVroom1988|Vroom, Jago (1988)]]</ref> developed a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for describing leadership situations, which was used in a normative [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|decision model]] where leadership styles were connected to situational variables, defining which approach was more suitable to which situation.<ref>[[#refSternberg2002|Sternberg, Vroom (2002)]]</ref> This approach was novel because it supported the idea that the same manager could rely on different [[group decision making]] approaches depending on the attributes of each situation. This model was later referred to as situational contingency theory.<ref>[[#refLorsch1974|Lorsch (1974)]]</ref>\n\nThe [[path-goal theory]] of leadership was developed by Robert House (1971) and was based on the [[expectancy theory]] of [[Victor Vroom]].<ref>[[#refHouse1971|House (1971)]]</ref> According to House, the essence of the theory is \"the meta proposition that leaders, to be effective, engage in behaviors that complement subordinates' environments and abilities in a manner that compensates for deficiencies and is instrumental to subordinate satisfaction and individual and work unit performance\".<ref>[[#refHouse1996|House (1996)]]</ref> The theory identifies four leader behaviors, ''achievement-oriented'', ''directive'', ''participative'', and ''supportive'', that are contingent to the environment factors and follower characteristics. In contrast to the [[Fiedler contingency model]], the path-goal model states that the four leadership behaviors are fluid, and that leaders can adopt any of the four depending on what the situation demands. The path-goal model can be classified both as a [[Contingency leadership theory|contingency theory]], as it depends on the circumstances, and as a [[Transactional leadership|transactional leadership theory]], as the theory emphasizes the reciprocity behavior between the leader and the followers.\n\n===Functional theory===\n{{Main|Functional leadership model}}\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 100805-F-7552L-211 - Commander of the International Security Assistance Force Gen. David H. Petraeus center U.S. Army talks with U.S. soldiers of the 2nd Battalion.jpg|thumb|250px|General Petraeus talks with U.S. soldiers serving in Afghanistan]]\nFunctional leadership theory (Hackman & Walton, 1986; [[McGrath]], 1962; Adair, 1988; Kouzes & Posner, 1995) is a particularly useful theory for addressing specific leader behaviors expected to contribute to organizational or unit effectiveness. This theory argues that the leader's main job is to see that whatever is necessary to group needs is taken care of; thus, a leader can be said to have done their job well when they have contributed to group effectiveness and cohesion (Fleishman et al., 1991; Hackman & Wageman, 2005; Hackman & Walton, 1986). While functional leadership theory has most often been applied to team leadership (Zaccaro, Rittman, & Marks, 2001), it has also been effectively applied to broader organizational leadership as well (Zaccaro, 2001). In summarizing literature on functional leadership (see Kozlowski et al. (1996), Zaccaro et al. (2001), Hackman and Walton (1986), Hackman & Wageman (2005), Morgeson (2005)), Klein, Zeigert, Knight, and Xiao (2006) observed five broad functions a leader performs when promoting organization's effectiveness. These functions include environmental monitoring, organizing subordinate activities, teaching and coaching subordinates, motivating others, and intervening actively in the group's work.\n\nA variety of leadership behaviors are expected to facilitate these functions. In initial work identifying leader behavior, Fleishman (1953) observed that subordinates perceived their supervisors' behavior in terms of two broad categories referred to as [[consideration and initiating structure]]. Consideration includes behavior involved in fostering effective relationships. Examples of such behavior would include showing concern for a subordinate or acting in a supportive manner towards others. Initiating structure involves the actions of the leader focused specifically on task accomplishment. This could include role clarification, setting performance standards, and holding subordinates accountable to those standards.\n\n===Integrated psychological theory===\n{{Main|Three Levels of Leadership model}}\n\nThe Integrated Psychological theory of leadership is an attempt to integrate the strengths of the older theories (i.e. traits, behavioral/styles, situational and functional) while addressing their limitations, introducing a new element \u2013 the need for leaders to develop their leadership presence, attitude toward others and behavioral flexibility by practicing psychological mastery. It also offers a foundation for leaders wanting to apply the philosophies of [[servant leadership]] and [[authentic leadership]].<ref>Businessballs management information website \u2013 Leadership Theories page, \"Integrated Psychological Approach\" section: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership</ref>\n\nIntegrated Psychological theory began to attract attention after the publication of James Scouller's [[Three Levels of Leadership model]] (2011).<ref>Scouller, J. (2011). ''The Three Levels of Leadership: How to Develop Your Leadership Presence, Knowhow and Skill''. Cirencester: Management Books 2000., {{ISBN|9781852526818}}</ref>\nScouller argued that the older theories offer only limited assistance in developing a person's ability to lead effectively.<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 34\u201335.</ref>\nHe pointed out, for example, that:\n* Traits theories, which tend to reinforce the idea that leaders are born not made, might help us select leaders, but they are less useful for developing leaders.\n* An ideal style (e.g. Blake & Mouton's team style) would not suit all circumstances.\n* Most of the situational/contingency and functional theories assume that leaders can change their behavior to meet differing circumstances or widen their behavioral range at will, when in practice many find it hard to do so because of unconscious beliefs, fears or ingrained habits. Thus, he argued, leaders need to work on their inner psychology.\n* None of the old theories successfully address the challenge of developing \"[[Three Levels of Leadership model#Leadership presence|leadership presence]]\"; that certain \"something\" in leaders that commands attention, inspires people, wins their trust and makes followers want to work with them.\n\nScouller proposed the Three Levels of Leadership model, which was later categorized as an \"Integrated Psychological\" theory on the Businessballs education website.<ref>Businessballs information website: Leadership Theories Page, Integrated Psychological Approach section. Businessballs.com.: http://www.businessballs.com/leadership-theories.htm#integrated-psychological-leadership 2012-02-24. Retrieved 2012-08-15</ref> In essence, his model aims to summarize what leaders have to do, not only to bring leadership to their group or organization, but also to develop themselves technically and psychologically as leaders.\n\nThe three levels in his model are Public, Private and Personal leadership:\n* The first two \u2013 public and private leadership \u2013 are \"outer\" or behavioral levels. These are the behaviors that address what Scouller called \"the four dimensions of leadership\". These dimensions are: (1) a shared, motivating group purpose; (2) action, progress and results; (3) collective unity or team spirit; (4) individual selection and motivation. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Public leadership|Public leadership]] focuses on the 34 behaviors involved in influencing two or more people simultaneously. [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Private leadership|Private leadership]] covers the 14 behaviors needed to influence individuals one to one.\n* The third \u2013 [[Three Levels of Leadership model#Personal leadership|personal leadership]] \u2013 is an \"inner\" level and concerns a person's growth toward greater leadership presence, knowhow and skill. Working on one's personal leadership has three aspects: (1) Technical knowhow and skill (2) Developing the right attitude toward other people \u2013 which is the basis of servant leadership (3) Psychological self-mastery \u2013 the foundation for authentic leadership.\n\nScouller argued that self-mastery is the key to growing one's leadership presence, building trusting relationships with followers and dissolving one's limiting beliefs and habits, thereby enabling behavioral flexibility as circumstances change, while staying connected to one's core values (that is, while remaining authentic). To support leaders' development, he introduced a new model of the human psyche and outlined the principles and techniques of self-mastery, which include the practice of [[Mindfulness#Mindfulness meditation in organizations|mindfulness meditation]].<ref>Scouller, J. (2011), pp. 137\u2013237.</ref>\n\n===Transactional and transformational theories===\n{{Main|Transactional leadership|Transformational leadership}}\n\n[[Bernard Bass]] and colleagues developed the idea of two different types of leadership, transactional that involves exchange of labor for rewards and transformational which is based on concern for employees, intellectual stimulation, and providing a group vision.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bass | first1 = B.

It gives the opportunity to the manager to lead the group and the group agrees to follow his lead to accomplish a predetermined goal in exchange for something else. Power is given to the leader to evaluate, correct, and train subordinates when productivity is not up to the desired level, and reward effectiveness when expected outcome is reached.\n\n===Leader\u2013member exchange theory===\n{{Main|Leader\u2013member exchange theory}}\nThis LMX theory addresses a specific aspect of the leadership process is the leader\u2013member exchange (LMX) theory,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Graen | first1 = G.

Similar to the transactional approach, this interaction is viewed as a fair exchange whereby the leader provides certain benefits such as task guidance, advice, support, and/or significant rewards and the followers reciprocate by giving the leader respect, cooperation, commitment to the task and good performance. However, LMX recognizes that leaders and individual followers will vary in the type of exchange that develops between them.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16 16\u201317]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/16}}</ref> LMX theorizes that the type of exchanges between the leader and specific followers can lead to the creation of ''in-groups'' and ''out-groups''. In-group members are said to have ''high-quality exchanges'' with the leader, while out-group members have ''low-quality exchanges'' with the leader.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|page=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17 17]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/17}}</ref>\n\n====In-group members====\n\n[[In-group]] members are perceived by the leader as being more experienced, competent, and willing to assume responsibility than other followers. The leader begins to rely on these individuals to help with especially challenging tasks. If the follower responds well, the leader rewards him/her with extra coaching, favorable job assignments, and developmental experiences. If the follower shows high commitment and effort followed by additional rewards, both parties develop mutual trust, influence, and support of one another. Research shows the in-group members usually receive higher performance evaluations from the leader, higher satisfaction, and faster promotions than out-group members.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/> In-group members are also likely to build stronger bonds with their leaders by sharing the same social backgrounds and interests.\n\n====Out-group members====\n\n[[Ingroups and outgroups|Out-group]] members often receive less time and more distant exchanges than their in-group counterparts. With out-group members, leaders expect no more than adequate [[job performance]], good attendance, reasonable respect, and adherence to the job description in exchange for a [[living wage|fair wage]] and standard benefits. The leader spends less time with out-group members, they have fewer developmental experiences, and the leader tends to emphasize his/her formal authority to obtain compliance to leader requests. Research shows that out-group members are less satisfied with their job and organization, receive lower performance evaluations from the leader, see their leader as less fair, and are more likely to file grievances or leave the organization.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P.\"/>\n\n===Emotions===\n{{see also|Emotional intelligence}}\nLeadership can be perceived as a particularly emotion-laden process, with emotions entwined with the social influence process.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = George | first1 = J.

Group affective tone is an aggregate of the moods of the individual members of the group and refers to mood at the group level of analysis. Groups with leaders in a positive mood have a more positive affective tone than do groups with leaders in a negative mood.<ref name=cote/>\n# Group processes like coordination, effort expenditure, and [[Task (project management)|task]] [[strategy]]. Public expressions of mood impact how group members think and act. When people experience and express mood, they send signals to others. Leaders signal their goals, intentions, and attitudes through their expressions of moods. For example, expressions of positive moods by leaders signal that leaders deem progress toward goals to be good. The group members respond to those signals cognitively and behaviorally in ways that are reflected in the group processes.<ref name=cote/>\nIn research about client service, it was found that expressions of positive mood by the [[leader]] improve the performance of the group, although in other sectors there were other findings.<ref name=george>George J.

It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership ([[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'',<ref>[[Robert Hariman]], ''Political Style'', U of Chicago Press, 1995</ref> [[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination''<ref>[[Philippe-Joseph Salazar]], ''L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination'', Paris, 2009</ref>).\n\nDifferent situations call for different leadership styles. In an emergency when there is little time to converge on an agreement and where a designated authority has significantly more experience or expertise than the rest of the team, an autocratic leadership style may be most effective; however, in a highly motivated and aligned team with a homogeneous level of expertise, a more democratic or [[Laissez-faire]] style may be more effective. The style adopted should be the one that most effectively achieves the objectives of the group while balancing the interests of its individual members.<ref name=Lewin>{{cite journal| last=Lewin | first=K.| author-link=Kurt Lewin| last2=Lippitt | first2=R.| last3=White | first3=R.

The factors of physical presence are military bearing, physical fitness, confidence, and resilience. The leader's intellectual capacity helps to conceptualize solutions and acquire knowledge to do the job. A leader's conceptual abilities apply agility, judgment, innovation, interpersonal tact, and [[domain knowledge]]. Domain knowledge for leaders encompasses tactical and technical knowledge as well as cultural and geopolitical awareness.<ref>Headquarters, Department of the Army (2006). \"Army Leadership. Competent, Confident, and Agile\". FM 6-22. Washington, D.C., 12 October 2006 p. 18. Publication available at Army Knowledge Online (www.us.army.mil) and General Dennis J. Reimer Training and Doctrine Digital Library at (www.train.army.mil).</ref>\n\n===Autocratic or authoritarian===\n\nUnder the [[autocratic]] leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with [[dictator]]s.\n\nAutocratic leaders do not ask or entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.<ref name=Lewin/>\n\n===Participative or democratic===\nThe democratic leadership style consists of the leader sharing the decision-making abilities with group members by promoting the interests of the group members and by practicing social equality. This has also been called [[shared leadership]].\n\n=== Laissez-faire or Free-rein ===\nIn Laissez-faire or free-rein leadership, decision-making is passed on to the sub-ordinates. The sub-ordinates are given complete right and power to make decisions to establish goals and work out the problems or hurdles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317115085|title=Modern leadership and management methods for development organizations|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref>\n\n===Task-oriented and relationship-oriented===\n{{Main|Task-oriented and relationship-oriented leadership}}\nTask-oriented leadership is a style in which the leader is focused on the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet a certain production goal. Task-oriented leaders are generally more concerned with producing a step-by-step solution for given problem or goal, strictly making sure these deadlines are met, results and reaching target outcomes.\n\nRelationship-oriented leadership is a contrasting style in which the leader is more focused on the relationships amongst the group and is generally more concerned with the overall well-being and satisfaction of group members.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffin|first=Ronald J. Ebert, Ricky W.|title=Business essentials|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-13-705349-0|pages=135\u2013136|edition=8th}}</ref> Relationship-oriented leaders emphasize communication within the group, show trust and confidence in group members, and show appreciation for work done.\n\nTask-oriented leaders are typically less concerned with the idea of catering to group members, and more concerned with acquiring a certain solution to meet a production goal. For this reason, they typically are able to make sure that deadlines are met, yet their group members' well-being may suffer. These leaders have  absolute focus on the goal and the tasks cut out for each member. Relationship-oriented leaders are focused on developing the team and the relationships in it. The positives to having this kind of environment are that team members are more motivated and have support. However, the emphasis on relations as opposed to getting a job done might make productivity suffer\n\n===Paternalism===\n{{Main|Paternalism}}\nPaternalism leadership styles often reflect a father-figure mindset. The structure of team is organized hierarchically where the leader is viewed above the followers. The leader also provides both professional and personal direction in the lives of the members.<ref name=\"Aycan\">{{cite book |last1=Aycan |first1=Z |title=Paternalism: Towards conceptual refinement and operationalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=London |pages=445\u2013446}}</ref> There is often a limitation on the choices that the members can choose from due to the heavy direction given by the leader.\n\nThe term paternalism is from the Latin pater meaning \"father\". The leader is most often a male. This leadership style is often found in Russia, Africa, and Pacific Asian Societies.<ref name=\"Aycan\"/>\n\n==Leadership differences affected by gender==\n{{One source|section|date=February 2013}}\nAnother factor that covaries with leadership style is whether the person is male or female. When men and women come together in groups, they tend to adopt different leadership styles. Men generally assume an [[:agentic leadership]] style. They are task-oriented, active, decision focused, independent and goal oriented. Women, on the other hand, are generally more communal when they assume a leadership position; they strive to be helpful towards others, warm in relation to others, understanding, and mindful of others' feelings. In general, when women are asked to describe themselves to others in newly formed groups, they emphasize their open, fair, responsible, and pleasant communal qualities. They give advice, offer assurances, and manage conflicts in an attempt to maintain positive relationships among group members. Women connect more positively to group members by smiling, maintaining eye contact and respond tactfully to others' comments. Men, conversely, describe themselves as influential, powerful and proficient at the task that needs to be done. They tend to place more focus on initiating structure within the group, setting standards and objectives, identifying roles, defining responsibilities and standard operating procedures, proposing solutions to problems, monitoring compliance with procedures, and finally, emphasizing the need for productivity and efficiency in the work that needs to be done. As leaders, men are primarily task-oriented, but women tend to be both task- and relationship-oriented. However, it is important to note that these sex differences are only tendencies, and do not manifest themselves within men and women across all groups and situations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.

These barriers also change according to different cultures. Despite the increasing number of female leaders in the world, only a small fraction come from non-westernized cultures. It is important to note that although the barriers listed below may be more severe in non-western culture, it does not imply that westernized cultures do not have these barriers as well. This aims to compare the differences between the two.\n\n'''Research and Literature'''\nAlthough there have been many studies done on leadership for women in the past decade, very little research has been done for women in paternalistic cultures. The literature and research done for women to emerge into a society that prefers males is lacking.  This ultimately hinders women from knowing how to reach their individual leadership goals, and fails to educate the male counterparts in this disparity.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tsui |author2=Nifadkar |author3=Ou |title=Cross-Cultural Organizational Behavior Research: Advances, Gaps, and Recommendations |journal=Journal of Management |volume=33 |issue=3 |page=426 |doi=10.1177/0149206307300818}}</ref>\n\n'''Maternity Leave'''\nStudies have shown the importance of longer  paid maternity leave and the positive effects it has on a female employee's mental health and return to work. In Sweden, it was shown that the increased flexibility in timing for mothers to return to work, decreased the odds of poor mental health reports. In these non-western cultures that mostly follow paternalism, the lack of knowledge on the benefits of maternity leave impact the support given to the women during this important time in their life.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Chatrerji |author2=Markowitz |title=Does the Length of Maternity Leave Affect Maternal Health? |journal=Southern Economic Journal |date=2004 |volume=72 |issue=1 |page=16|doi=10.2307/20062092 |jstor=20062092 |url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w10206.pdf }}</ref>\n\n'''Society and Laws'''\nCertain countries that follow paternalism, such as India, still allow for women to be treated unjustly. Child marriage and minor punishments for perpetrators in crime against women, shape the society's view on how females should be treated. This can prevent women from feeling comfortable to speak out in both a personal and professional setting.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Yadav |author2=Singh |title=Gender and Politics of Culture |journal=Political Science |date=2015 |page=77}}</ref>\n\n'''Glass Ceilings and Glass Cliffs'''\nWomen who work in a very paternalistic culture or industry (e.g. oil or engineering industry), often deal with a limitations in their career that prevent them from moving up any further. This association is often due to the mentality that only males carry leadership characteristics. The glass cliff term refers to undesired projects that are often given to women because they have an increase in risk of failure. These undesired projects are given to female employees where they are more likely to fail and leave the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vinkenberg |author2=Engen |author3=Eagly |author4=Johannesen-Schmidt |title=An exploration of stereotypical beliefs about leadership styles: Is transformational leadership a route to womens promotion? |journal=The Leadership Quarterly |date=2011 |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=10|doi=10.1016/j.leaqua.2010.12.003 |url=https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/1313103/LQ_2011_VinkenburgVanEngenEaglyJohannesenSchmidt.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nIn the past, some researchers have argued that the actual influence of leaders on organizational outcomes is overrated and romanticized as a result of biased attributions about leaders (Meindl & Ehrlich, 1987). Despite these assertions, however, it is largely recognized and accepted by practitioners and researchers that leadership is important, and research supports the notion that leaders do contribute to key organizational outcomes (Day & Lord, 1988; Kaiser, Hogan, & Craig, 2008). To facilitate successful performance it is important to understand and accurately measure leadership performance.\n\nJob performance generally refers to behavior that is expected to contribute to organizational success (Campbell, 1990). Campbell identified a number of specific types of performance dimensions; leadership was one of the dimensions that he identified. There is no consistent, overall definition of leadership performance (Yukl, 2006). Many distinct conceptualizations are often lumped together under the umbrella of leadership [[performance]], including outcomes such as leader [[effectiveness]], leader advancement, and leader emergence (Kaiser et al., 2008). For instance, leadership performance may be used to refer to the career success of the individual leader, performance of the group or organization, or even leader emergence. Each of these measures can be considered conceptually distinct. While these aspects may be related, they are different outcomes and their inclusion should depend on the applied or research focus.\n\n[[File:HierarchyOfLeaderEfficiency.jpg|thumb|Hierarchy Of Leader Efficiency based on Hierarchy of Competence\nand the M5 Work Motivation Model <ref>Igor Kokcharov, Hierarchy of Skills http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/kokcharov-skillpyramid2015</ref>]]\n\n\"Another way to conceptualize leader performance is to focus on the outcomes of the leader\u2019s followers, group, team, unit, or organization. In evaluating this type of leader performance, two general strategies are typically used. The first relies on subjective perceptions of the leader\u2019s performance from subordinates, superiors, or occasionally peers or other parties. The other type of effectiveness measures are more objective indicators of follower or unit performance, such as measures of productivity, goal attainment, sales figures, or unit financial performance (Bass & Riggio, 2006, p. 47).\"\n<ref>Bass, B.

Current studies have indicated that leadership is much more complex and cannot be boiled down to a few key traits of an individual. Years of observation and study have indicated that one such trait or a set of traits does not make an extraordinary leader. What scholars have been able to arrive at is that leadership traits of an individual do not change from situation to situation; such traits include intelligence, assertiveness, or physical attractiveness.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\">{{cite book|last=Howell|first=Jon P.|title=Snapshots of Great Leadership|year=2012|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London, GBR|isbn=9780203103210|pages=[https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4 4\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/snapshotsofgreat0000howe/page/4}}</ref> However, each key trait may be applied to situations differently, depending on the circumstances. The following summarizes the main leadership traits found in research by Jon P. Howell, business professor at New Mexico State University and author of the book ''Snapshots of Great Leadership''.\n\nDetermination and drive include traits such as initiative, energy, assertiveness, perseverance and sometimes dominance. People with these traits often tend to wholeheartedly pursue their goals, work long hours, are ambitious, and often are very competitive with others. Cognitive capacity includes intelligence, analytical and verbal ability, behavioral flexibility, and good judgment. Individuals with these traits are able to formulate solutions to difficult problems, work well under stress or deadlines, adapt to changing situations, and create well-thought-out plans for the future. Howell provides examples of Steve Jobs and Abraham Lincoln as encompassing the traits of determination and drive as well as possessing cognitive capacity, demonstrated by their ability to adapt to their continuously changing environments.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nSelf-confidence encompasses the traits of high self-esteem, assertiveness, emotional stability, and self-assurance. Individuals who are self-confident do not doubt themselves or their abilities and decisions; they also have the ability to project this self-confidence onto others, building their trust and commitment. Integrity is demonstrated in individuals who are truthful, trustworthy, principled, consistent, dependable, loyal, and not deceptive. Leaders with integrity often share these values with their followers, as this trait is mainly an ethics issue. It is often said that these leaders keep their word and are honest and open with their cohorts. Sociability describes individuals who are friendly, extroverted, tactful, flexible, and interpersonally competent. Such a trait enables leaders to be accepted well by the public, use diplomatic measures to solve issues, as well as hold the ability to adapt their social persona to the situation at hand. According to Howell, Mother Teresa is an exceptional example who embodies integrity, assertiveness, and [[soft skills|social abilities]] in her diplomatic dealings with the leaders of the world.<ref name=\"Howell, Jon P. 4-6\"/>\n\nFew great leaders encompass all of the traits listed above, but many have the ability to apply a number of them to succeed as front-runners of their organization or situation.\n\n==Ontological-phenomenological model==\nOne of the more recent definitions of leadership comes from [[Werner Erhard]], [[Michael C. Jensen]], Steve Zaffron, and Kari Granger who describe leadership as \"an exercise in language that results in the realization of a future that wasn't going to happen anyway, which future fulfills (or contributes to fulfilling) the concerns of the relevant parties...\". This definition ensures that leadership is talking about the future and includes the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties.  This differs from relating to the relevant parties as \"followers\" and calling up an image of a single leader with others following.  Rather, a future that fulfills on the fundamental concerns of the relevant parties indicates the future that wasn't going to happen is not the \"idea of the leader\", but rather is what emerges from digging deep to find the underlying concerns of those who are impacted by the leadership.<ref>Forthcoming in \"The Handbook for Teaching Leadership\", by Werner Erhard, Michael, C. Jensen, & Kari Granger; Scott Snook, Nitin Nohria, Rakesh Khurana (Editors) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1681682</ref>\n\n==Contexts==\n\n===Organizations===\nAn organization that is established as an [[Legal instrument|instrument]] or means for achieving defined [[Goal|objectives]] has been referred to as a ''formal organization''. Its design specifies how goals are subdivided and reflected in subdivisions of the organization. Divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and tasks make up this work [[structure]]. Thus, the formal organization is expected to behave impersonally in regard to relationships with clients or with its members. According to Weber's definition, entry and subsequent advancement is by merit or seniority. Employees receive a salary and enjoy a degree of tenure that safeguards them from the arbitrary influence of superiors or of powerful clients. The higher one's position in the hierarchy, the greater one's presumed expertise in adjudicating problems that may arise in the course of the work carried out at lower levels of the organization. It is this bureaucratic structure that forms the basis for the appointment of heads or chiefs of administrative subdivisions in the organization and endows them with the authority attached to their position.<ref>{{cite book |author= Cecil A Gibb|title= Leadership (Handbook of Social Psychology)|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Massachusetts|year=1970|pages=884\u201389|isbn= 9780140805178|oclc=174777513|doi=}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the appointed head or chief of an administrative unit, a leader emerges within the context of the ''informal organization'' that underlies the formal structure. The informal organization expresses the personal [[Goal|objectives]] and [[goal]]s of the individual [[wikt:Membership|membership]]. Their objectives and goals may or may not coincide with those of the formal organization. The informal organization represents an extension of the social structures that generally characterize human life \u2014 the spontaneous emergence of groups and organizations as ends in themselves.\n\nIn prehistoric times, humanity was preoccupied with personal security, maintenance, protection, and survival. Now humanity spends a major portion of waking hours working for organizations. The need to identify with a community that provides security, protection, maintenance, and a feeling of belonging has continued unchanged from prehistoric times. This need is met by the informal organization and its emergent, or unofficial, leaders.<ref name=\"Henry\">{{cite book |author1=Henry P. Knowles |author2=Borje O.

Their personal qualities, the demands of the situation, or a combination of these and other factors attract followers who accept their leadership within one or several overlay structures. Instead of the authority of position held by an appointed head or chief, the emergent leader wields influence or power. Influence is the ability of a person to gain co-operation from others by means of persuasion or control over rewards. Power is a stronger form of influence because it reflects a person's ability to enforce action through the control of a means of punishment.<ref name=\"Henry\"/>\n\nA leader is a person who influences a group of people towards a specific result. It is not dependent on title or formal authority. (Elevos, paraphrased from Leaders, Bennis, and Leadership Presence, Halpern & Lubar.) Ogbonnia (2007) defines an effective leader \"as an individual with the capacity to consistently succeed in a given condition and be viewed as meeting the expectations of an organization or society.\" Leaders are recognized by their capacity for caring for others, clear communication, and a commitment to persist.<ref>Hoyle, John R. ''Leadership and Futuring: Making Visions Happen''. Thousand Oaks, California: Corwin Press, Inc., 1995.</ref> An individual who is appointed to a managerial position has the right to command and enforce obedience by virtue of the authority of their position. However, she or he must possess adequate personal attributes to match this authority, because authority is only potentially available to him/her. In the absence of sufficient personal competence, a manager may be confronted by an emergent leader who can challenge her/his role in the organization and reduce it to that of a figurehead. However, only authority of position has the backing of formal sanctions. It follows that whoever wields personal influence and power can legitimize this only by gaining a formal position in the hierarchy, with commensurate authority.<ref name=\"Henry\"/> Leadership can be defined as one's ability to get others to willingly follow. Every organization needs leaders at every level.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=David|title=The Top 10 Leadership Qualities|url=http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410090435/http://www.hrworld.com/features/top-10-leadership-qualities-031908|archivedate=2013-04-10|website=HR World}}</ref>\n\n===Management===\nOver the years the philosophical terminology of \"[[management]]\" and \"leadership\" have, in the organizational context, been used both as synonyms and with clearly differentiated meanings. Debate is fairly common about whether the use of these terms should be restricted, and generally reflects an awareness of the distinction made by Burns (1978) between \"transactional\" leadership (characterized by emphasis on procedures, contingent reward, management by exception) and \"transformational\" leadership (characterized by charisma, personal relationships, creativity).<ref name=\"Burns\"/>\n\n===Group===\nIn contrast to individual leadership, some organizations have adopted group leadership. In this so-called [[shared leadership]], more than one person provides direction to the group as a whole. It is furthermore characterized by shared responsibility, cooperation and mutual influence among the team members.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=CARSON|first=J. B.|last2=TESLUK|first2=P.

Others may see the traditional leadership of a [[wikt:boss|boss]] as costing too much in team performance. In some situations, the team members best able to handle any given phase of the project become the temporary leaders. Additionally, as each team member has the opportunity to experience the elevated level of empowerment, it energizes staff and feeds the cycle of success.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ingrid Bens|year=2006|title=Facilitating to Lead|publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-7731-3}}</ref>\n\nLeaders who demonstrate persistence, tenacity, determination, and synergistic communication skills will bring out the same qualities in their groups. Good leaders use their own inner [[Mentorship|mentors]] to energize their team and organizations and lead a team to achieve success.<ref>{{cite book |author= Bart Barthelemy|year=1997|title=The Sky Is Not The Limit \u2013 Breakthrough Leadership|publisher=St. Lucie Press}}</ref>\n\n'''''According to the National School Boards Association (USA):'''''<ref>National School Boards Association</ref>\n\nThese Group Leaderships or Leadership Teams have specific characteristics:\n\n'''Characteristics of a Team'''\n* There must be an awareness of unity on the part of all its members.\n* There must be interpersonal relationship. Members must have a chance to contribute, and learn from and work with others.\n* The members must have the ability to act together toward a common goal.\n\n'''Ten characteristics of well-functioning teams:'''\n* Purpose: Members proudly share a sense of why the team exists and are invested in accomplishing its mission and goals.\n* Priorities: Members know what needs to be done next, by whom, and by when to achieve team goals.\n* Roles: Members know their roles in getting tasks done and when to allow a more skillful member to do a certain task.\n* Decisions: Authority and decision-making lines are clearly understood.\n* Conflict: Conflict is dealt with openly and is considered important to decision-making and personal growth.\n* Personal traits: members feel their unique personalities are appreciated and well utilized.\n* Norms: Group norms for working together are set and seen as standards for every one in the groups.\n* Effectiveness: Members find team meetings efficient and productive and look forward to this time together.\n* Success: Members know clearly when the team has met with success and share in this equally and proudly.\n* Training: Opportunities for feedback and updating skills are provided and taken advantage of by team members.\n\n===Self-leadership===\n[[Communication and Leadership During Change|Self-leadership]] is a process that occurs within an individual, rather than an external act. It is an expression of who we are as people.<ref>Hackman, M. & Johnson, C. (2009). ''Leadership: A communication perspective''. Long Grove, Illinois: Waveland Press, Inc.</ref> Self-leadership is having a developed sense of who you are, what you can achieve, what are your goals coupled with the ability to affect your emotions, behaviors and communication. At the center of leadership is the person who is motivated to make the difference. Self-leadership is a way toward more effectively leading other people.  <ref>Browning, M (2018). \"Self-Leadership: Why It Matters\"</ref>\n\n===Biology and Evolution of Leadership===\n[[Mark van Vugt]] and [[Anjana Ahuja]] in ''Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership'' (2011) present evidence of leadership in non-human animals, from ants and bees to baboons and chimpanzees. They suggest that leadership has a long evolutionary history and that the same mechanisms underpinning leadership in humans appear in other social species, too.<ref>van Vugt, M., & Ahuja, A. (2011). ''Naturally Selected: the Evolutionary Science of Leadership''. HarperBusiness.</ref> They also suggest that the evolutionary origins of leadership are different from that of dominance. In a study [[Mark van Vugt]] and his team looked at the relation between basal testosterone and leadership versus dominance. They found that testosterone correlates with dominance but not with leadership. This was replicated in a sample of managers in which there was no relation between hierarchical position and testosterone level.<ref>Van der Meij, L., Schaveling, J., & van Vugt, M. (2016). Basal testosterone, leadership and dominance: A field study and meta-analysis. Psychoneuroendocrinology, 72, 72-79.</ref>\n[[Richard Wrangham]] and [[Dale Peterson]], in ''[[Demonic Males: Apes and the Origins of Human Violence]]'' (1996), present evidence that only humans and [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, among all the animals living on Earth, share a similar tendency for a cluster of behaviors: violence, [[Territory (animal)|territoriality]], and competition for uniting behind the one chief male of the land.<ref>Richard Wrangham and Dale Peterson (1996). [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/demonicmales.htm ''Demonic Males. Apes and the Origins of Human Violence'']. Mariner Books</ref> This position is contentious. Many animals apart from apes are territorial, compete, exhibit violence, and have a social structure controlled by a dominant male (lions, wolves, etc.), suggesting Wrangham and Peterson's evidence is not empirical. However, we must examine other species as well, including elephants (which are matriarchal and follow an alpha female), meerkats (which are likewise matriarchal), sheep (which follow castrated bell[[wether (disambiguation)|wethers]]) and many others.\n\nBy comparison, [[bonobo]]s, the second-closest species-relatives of humans, do ''not'' unite behind the chief male of the land. The bonobos show deference to an alpha or top-ranking female that, with the support of her coalition of other females, can prove as strong as the strongest male. Thus, if leadership amounts to getting the greatest number of followers, then among the bonobos, a female almost always exerts the strongest and most effective leadership. Incidentally, not all scientists agree on the allegedly peaceful nature of the bonobo or with its reputation as a \"[[hippie]] chimp\".<ref>\n[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/07/30/070730fa_fact_parker Swingers - The New Yorker<!-- Bot generated title -->]\n</ref>\n\n==Myths==\nLeadership, although largely talked about, has been described as one of the least understood concepts across all cultures and civilizations. Over the years, many researchers have stressed the prevalence of this misunderstanding, stating that the existence of several flawed assumptions, or myths, concerning leadership often interferes with individuals' conception of what leadership is all about (Gardner, 1965; Bennis, 1975).<ref>Gardner, J. W. (1965). ''Self-Renewal: The Individual and the Innovative Society.'' New York: Harper and Row.</ref><ref>Bennis, W. G. (1975). ''Where have all the leaders gone?'' Washington, D.C.: Federal Executive Institute.</ref>\n\n===Leadership is innate===\nAccording to some, leadership is determined by distinctive [[dispositional affect|dispositional characteristics]] present at birth (e.g., [[extraversion and introversion|extraversion]]; [[intelligence]]; [[ingenuity]]). However, according to Forsyth (2009) there is evidence to show that leadership also develops through hard work and careful observation.<ref name=Forsyth>Forsyth, D. R. (2009). ''Group dynamics'' (5th ed.). Pacific Grove, California: Brooks/Cole.</ref> Thus, effective leadership can result from [[nature versus nurture|nature]] (i.e., innate talents) as well as [[nature versus nurture|nurture]] (i.e., acquired skills).\n\n===Leadership is possessing power over others===\nAlthough leadership is certainly a form of [[Power (social and political)|power]], it is not demarcated by power ''over'' people \u2013 rather, it is a power ''with'' people that exists as a reciprocal relationship between a leader and his/her followers (Forsyth, 2009).<ref name=Forsyth/> Despite popular belief, the use of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]], [[coercion]], and domination to influence others is not a requirement for leadership. In actuality, individuals who seek group consent and strive to act in the best interests of others can also become effective leaders (e.g., class president; court judge).\n\n===Leaders are positively influential===\nThe [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the assertion that groups flourish when guided by effective leaders can be illustrated using several examples. For instance, according to Baumeister et al. (1988), the [[bystander effect]] (failure to respond or offer assistance) that tends to develop within groups faced with an emergency is significantly reduced in groups guided by a leader.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R.

However, the difference leaders make is '''not''' always positive in nature. Leaders sometimes focus on fulfilling their own agendas at the expense of others, including his/her own followers (e.g., [[Pol Pot]]; [[Joseph Stalin|Josef Stalin]]). Leaders who focus on personal gain by employing stringent and manipulative leadership styles often make a difference, but usually do so through negative means.<ref>Lipman-Blumen, J. (2005) ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders''. New York: Oxford. University Press Inc.</ref>\n\n===Leaders entirely control group outcomes===\nIn [[Western culture]]s it is generally assumed that group leaders make ''all'' the difference when it comes to group influence and overall goal-attainment. Although common, this romanticized view of leadership (i.e., the tendency to overestimate the degree of control leaders have over their groups and their groups' outcomes) ignores the existence of many other factors that influence group dynamics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Meindl | first1 = J.

Group members tend to be more contented and productive when they have a leader to guide them.

Leadership of people in these environments requires a different set of skills to that of front line management. These leaders must effectively operate remotely and negotiate the needs of the individual, team, and task within a changeable environment. This has been termed action oriented leadership. Some examples of demonstrations of action oriented leadership include extinguishing a rural fire, locating a missing person, leading a team on an outdoor expedition, or rescuing a person from a potentially hazardous environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schelten|first1=Andreas|title=Prof.|url=http://www.bpaed.edu.tum.de/fileadmin/tueds02/www/pdfs/publikationen/riedl/2002handoutvariantsriedl.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include modern technology deployments of small/medium-sized IT teams into client plant sites. Leadership of these teams requires hands on experience and a lead-by-example attitude to empower team members to make well thought out and concise decisions independent of executive management and/or home base decision makers. Zachary Hansen was an early adopter of Scrum/Kanban branch development methodologies during the mid 90's to alleviate the dependency that field teams had on trunk based development. This method of just-in-time action oriented development and deployment allowed remote plant sites to deploy up-to-date software patches frequently and without dependency on core team deployment schedules satisfying the clients need to rapidly patch production environment bugs as needed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=B.W.|title=Software risk management: principles and practices|journal=IEEE Software|volume=8|pages=32\u201341|doi=10.1109/52.62930|year=1991|citeseerx=10.1.1.381.466}}</ref>\n\n==Critical thought==\n\n[[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]]'s 1840 \"[[Great Man theory]]\", which emphasized the role of leading individuals, met opposition in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n[[Karl Popper]] noted in 1945 that leaders can [[mislead]] and make mistakes - he warns against deferring to \"great men\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1 = Popper\n| first1 = Karl\n| author-link1 = Karl Popper\n| year = 1945\n| chapter = Preface to the First Edition\n| title = The Open Society and Its Enemies \n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gw9wV2Unpe8C\n| edition = 7\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2012\n| page = xxxiii\n| isbn = 9781136749773\n| access-date = 2017-08-20\n| quote = [...] if our civilisation is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men.

{"title_page": "Probabilistic Turing machine", "text_new": "{{turing}}\nIn [[theoretical computer science]], a '''probabilistic Turing machine''' is a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] which chooses between the available transitions at each point according to some [[probability distribution]]. As a consequence, a probabilistic Turing machine can (unlike a deterministic Turing Machine) have [[stochastic]] results; that is, on a given input and instruction state machine, it may have different run times, or it may not halt at all; furthermore, it may accept an input in one execution and reject the same input in another execution.\n\nIn the case of equal probabilities for the transitions, it can be defined as a deterministic [[Turing machine]] having an additional \"write\" instruction where the value of the write is [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly distributed]] in the Turing Machine's alphabet (generally, an equal likelihood of writing a '1' or a '0' on to the  tape.) Another common reformulation is simply a [[deterministic Turing machine]] with an added tape full of random bits called the ''random tape''.\n\nA [[quantum computer]] is another model of computation that is inherently probabilistic.\n\n==Description==\nA probabilistic Turing machine is a type of [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] in which each nondeterministic step is a ''coin-flip''\u2014that is, there are two possible next moves, and the computation probabilistically selects which move to take.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|page=368|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}</ref>\n\n==Complexity classes==\n{{unsolved|computer science|Is '''P''' {{=}} '''BPP''' ?}}\nThe notion of acceptance of a string by a probabilistic Turing machine can be defined in different ways. Various polynomial-time randomized [[computational complexity theory|complexity classes]] that result from different definitions of acceptance include [[RP (complexity)|RP]], co-RP, [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] and [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]. If the machine is restricted to logarithmic space instead of polynomial time, the analogous [[RL (complexity)|RL]], co-RL, [[BPL (complexity)|BPL]], and [[ZPL (complexity)|ZPL]] complexity classes are obtained. By enforcing both restrictions, [[Randomized Logarithmic-space Polynomial-time|RLP]], co-RLP, [[BPLP]], and [[ZPLP]] are yielded.\n\nProbabilistic computation is also critical for the definition of most classes of [[interactive proof system]]s, in which the verifier machine depends on randomness to avoid being predicted and tricked by the all-powerful prover machine. For example, the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' equals '''[[PSPACE]]''', but if randomness is removed from the verifier, we are left with only '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', which is not known but widely believed to be a considerably smaller class.\n\nOne of the central questions of complexity theory is whether randomness adds power; that is, is there a problem that can be solved in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine but not a deterministic Turing machine? Or can deterministic Turing machines efficiently simulate all probabilistic Turing machines with at most a polynomial slowdown? It is currently widely believed by researchers{{Who|date=November 2010}} that the latter is the case, which would imply '''P''' = '''BPP'''.

As a consequence, a probabilistic Turing machine can (unlike a deterministic Turing Machine) have [[stochastic]] results; on a given input and instruction state machine, it may have different run times, or it may not halt at all; further, it may accept an input in one execution and reject the same input in another execution.\n\nIn the case of equal probabilities for the transitions, it can be defined as a deterministic [[Turing machine]] having an additional \"write\" instruction where the value of the write is [[uniform distribution (discrete)|uniformly distributed]] in the Turing Machine's alphabet (generally, an equal likelihood of writing a '1' or a '0' on to the  tape.) Another common reformulation is simply a [[deterministic Turing machine]] with an added tape full of random bits called the ''random tape''.\n\nA [[quantum computer]] is another model of computation that is inherently probabilistic.\n\n==Description==\nA probabilistic Turing machine is a type of [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] in which each nondeterministic step is a ''coin-flip''\u2014that is, there are two possible next moves, and the computation probabilistically selects which move to take.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|page=368|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}</ref>\n\n==Complexity classes==\n{{unsolved|computer science|Is '''P''' {{=}} '''BPP''' ?}}\nThe notion of acceptance of a string by a probabilistic Turing machine can be defined in different ways. Various polynomial-time randomized [[computational complexity theory|complexity classes]] that result from different definitions of acceptance include [[RP (complexity)|RP]], co-RP, [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]] and [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]. If the machine is restricted to logarithmic space instead of polynomial time, the analogous [[RL (complexity)|RL]], co-RL, [[BPL (complexity)|BPL]], and [[ZPL (complexity)|ZPL]] complexity classes are obtained. By enforcing both restrictions, [[Randomized Logarithmic-space Polynomial-time|RLP]], co-RLP, [[BPLP]], and [[ZPLP]] are yielded.\n\nProbabilistic computation is also critical for the definition of most classes of [[interactive proof system]]s, in which the verifier machine depends on randomness to avoid being predicted and tricked by the all-powerful prover machine. For example, the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' equals '''[[PSPACE]]''', but if randomness is removed from the verifier, we are left with only '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''', which is not known but widely believed to be a considerably smaller class.\n\nOne of the central questions of complexity theory is whether randomness adds power; that is, is there a problem that can be solved in polynomial time by a probabilistic Turing machine but not a deterministic Turing machine? Or can deterministic Turing machines efficiently simulate all probabilistic Turing machines with at most a polynomial slowdown? It is currently widely believed by researchers{{Who|date=November 2010}} that the latter is the case, which would imply '''P''' = '''BPP'''. The same question for log space instead of polynomial time (does '''L''' = '''BPLP'''?) is even more widely believed to be true. On the other hand, the power randomness gives to interactive proof systems, as well as the simple algorithms it creates for difficult problems such as polynomial-time primality testing and log-space graph connectedness testing, suggests that randomness may add power.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Randomized algorithm]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev|author1-link=Sanjeev Arora |last2=Barak |first2=Boaz|author2-link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4 |pages=201\u2013236}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/probablturng.html NIST website on probabilistic Turing machines]\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Probabilistic Turing Machine}}\n[[Category:Models of computation]]\n[[Category:Randomized algorithms]]\n[[Category:Turing machine]]\n", "name_user": "Jaydavidmartin", "label": "safe", "comment": "minor wording adjustments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_Turing_machine"}

He was born on 30 October 1909. His father was Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha, a well known [[Parsi]] lawyer and his mother was Meheren.<ref>{{cite web |author=Raj, Baldev and Amarendra, G. |publisher=[Indra just madam\nCentre for Atomic Research]]|url=http://www.igcar.ernet.in/press_releases/press29.htm |title=A legend lives on Homi Jehangir Bhabha (1909\u20131966) |accessdate=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522140825/http://www.igcar.ernet.in/press_releases/press29.htm |archivedate=22 May 2013}}></ref> He received his early studies at Bombay's [[Cathedral and John Connon School]] and entered [[Elphinstone College]] at age 15 after passing his [[Senior Cambridge|Senior Cambridge Examination]] with Honours.\n\nHe then attended the [[The Institute of Science, Mumbai|Royal Institute of Science]] in 1927 before joining [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. This was due to the insistence of his father and his uncle Dorabji, who planned for Bhabha to obtain a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] from Cambridge and then return to India, where he would join the [[Tata Steel]] or Tata Steel Mills in [[Jamshedpur]] as a metallurgist.\n\n===Research=== \nBhabha's father understood his son's predicament, and he along with his wife  agreed to finance his studies in mathematics provided that he obtain first class on his Mechanical Sciences [[Tripos]] exam. Bhabha took the Tripos exam in June 1930 and passed with first class. Afterwards, he excelled in his mathematical studies under [[Paul Dirac]] to complete the Mathematics Tripos. Meanwhile, he worked at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] while working towards his doctorate in theoretical physics. At the time, the laboratory was the centre of a number of scientific breakthroughs. [[James Chadwick]] had discovered the [[neutron]], [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] [[lithium]] with high-energy protons, and [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] and [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] used [[cloud chamber]]s to demonstrate the production of [[lone pair|electron pairs]] and [[particle shower|showers]] by gamma radiation.\n\nDuring the 1931\u20131932 academic year, Bhabha was awarded the Salomons Studentship in Engineering. In 1932, he obtained first class on his [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]] and was awarded the [[W. W. Rouse Ball|Rouse Ball]] travelling studentship in mathematics.\nDuring this time, nuclear physics was attracting the greatest minds and it was one of the most significantly emerging fields as compared to theoretical physics, the [[German physics|opposition]] towards theoretical physics attacked the field because it was lenient towards theories rather than proving natural phenomenon through experiments. Conducting experiments on particles which also released enormous amounts of radiation, was a lifelong passion of Bhabha, and his leading edge research and experiments brought great laurels to Indian physicists who particularly switched their fields to nuclear physics, one of the most notable being [[Piara Singh Gill]].\n\n===Work in nuclear physics===\n\nIn January 1933, Bhabha received his doctorate in nuclear physics after publishing his first scientific paper, \"''The Absorption of Cosmic radiation''\". In the publication, Bhabha offered an explanation of the absorption features and [[electron shower]] production in [[cosmic ray]]s. The paper helped him win the Isaac Newton Studentship in 1934, which he held for the next three years. The following year, he completed his doctoral studies in theoretical physics under [[Ralph H. Fowler]]. During his studentship, he split his time working at Cambridge and with [[Niels Bohr]] in Copenhagen. In 1935, Bhabha published a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A]]'', in which he performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering. Electron-positron scattering was later named [[Bhabha scattering]], in honour of his contributions in the field.\n\nIn 1936, with [[Walter Heitler]], he co-authored a paper, \"The Passage of Fast Electrons and the Theory of Cosmic Showers\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bhabha, Homi J.|author2= Heitler, Walter |author3=Mott, Nevill Francis |title=The passage of fast electrons and the theory of cosmic showers|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

Bhabha and Heitler then made numerical estimates of the number of electrons in the cascade process at different altitudes for different electron initiation energies. The calculations agreed with the experimental observations of cosmic ray showers made by [[Bruno Rossi]] and [[Pierre Victor Auger]] a few years before. Bhabha later concluded that observations of the properties of such particles would lead to the straightforward experimental verification of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. In 1937, Bhabha was awarded the [[Senior Studentship of the 1851 exhibition]], which helped him continue his work at Cambridge until the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939.\n\n==Return to India==\n\nIn September 1939, Bhabha was in India for a brief holiday when World War II started, and he decided not to return to [[England]] for the time being. He accepted an offer to serve as the Reader in the Physics Department of the [[Indian Institute of Science]], then headed by renowned physicist [[C. V. Raman]]. He received a special research grant from the Sir Dorab Tata Trust, which he used to establish the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute. Bhabha selected a few students, including [[Harish-Chandra]], to work with him. Later, on 20 March 1941, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. With the help of [[J. R. D. Tata]], he played an instrumental role in the establishment of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in Mumbai.\n\n==Career==\nStarting his [[nuclear physics]] career in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Bhabha had returned to India for his annual vacation before the start of [[World War II]] in September 1939. War prompted him to remain in India and he accepted a post of reader in physics at the [[Indian Institute of Science]] in [[Bengaluru]], headed by [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[C. V.

As part of this vision, Bhabha established the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute, began to work on the theory of [[point particles]] movement, while independently conducting research on nuclear weapons in 1944.<ref name=\"Published through National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 187\"/> In 1945, he established the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in Bombay, and the [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|Atomic Energy Commission]] in 1948, serving as its first chairman.<ref name=\"Published through National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 187\"/> In 1948, Nehru led the appointment of Bhabha as the director of the nuclear program and tasked Bhabha to develop the nuclear weapons soon after.<ref name=\"Published through National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 187\"/> In the 1950s, Bhabha represented India in [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] conferences, and served as President of the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in [[Geneva, Switzerland]] in 1955. During this time, he intensified his lobbying for the development of nuclear weapons. Soon after the [[Sino-Indian War|Sino-Indo war]], Bhabha aggressively and publicly began to call for the nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"nuclear weapon archive (Indian nuclear program)\"/>\n\nBhabha gained international prominence after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as [[Bhabha scattering]]. His major contribution included his work on [[Compton scattering]], [[R-process]], and furthermore the advancement of nuclear physics. He was awarded [[Padma Bhushan]] by Government of India in 1954.<ref name=\"Padma Awards\">{{cite web |url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015193758/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2015}}</ref> He later served as the member of the [[Union Cabinet of India|Indian Cabinet]]'s Scientific Advisory Committee and provided the pivotal role to [[Vikram Sarabhai]] to set up the [[Indian National Committee for Space Research]].

This prompted him to send a proposal in March 1944 to the [[Sir Dorabji Tata Trust]] for establishing 'a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics'. In his proposal he wrote:\n\n{{cquote| There is at the moment in India no big school of research in the fundamental problems of physics, both theoretical and experimental. There are, however, scattered all over India competent workers who are not doing as good work as they would do if brought together in one place under proper direction. It is absolutely in the interest of India to have a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics, for such a school forms the spearhead of research not only in less advanced branches of physics but also in problems of immediate practical application in industry. If much of the applied research done in India today is disappointing or of very inferior quality it is entirely due to the absence of sufficient number of outstanding pure research workers who would set the standard of good research and act on the directing boards in an advisory capacity&nbsp;... Moreover, when nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production in say a couple of decades from now, India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand. I do not think that anyone acquainted with scientific development in other countries would deny the need in India for such a school as I propose. The subjects on which research and advanced teaching would be done would be theoretical physics, especially on fundamental problems and with special reference to cosmic rays and nuclear physics, and experimental research on cosmic rays. It is neither possible nor desirable to separate nuclear physics from cosmic rays since the two are closely connected theoretically.<ref>[http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/bhabha/BHABHANEW.HTM Homi Jehangir Bhabha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162105/http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/bhabha/BHABHANEW.HTM |date=21 July 2011 }}.

[[Bombay]] was chosen as the location as the Government of Bombay showed interest in becoming a joint founder of the proposed institute. The institute, named [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]], was inaugurated in 1945 in 540 square meters of hired space in an existing building. In 1948 the Institute was moved into the old buildings of the Royal Yacht club.\n\nWhen Bhabha realised that technology development for the atomic energy programme could no longer be carried out within TIFR he proposed to the government to build a new laboratory entirely devoted to this purpose. For this purpose, 1200&nbsp;acres of land was acquired at Trombay from the Bombay Government. Thus the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay (AEET) started functioning in 1954. The same year the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was also established.<ref>{{cite book| author = Guha, Ramachandra | title = India After Gandhi |page= 216| year = 2008| publisher = Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0060958589 | author-link = Guha, Ramachandra | title-link = India After Gandhi }}</ref> He represented India in International Atomic Energy Forums, and as President of the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] in 1955.

The aim of long range atomic power programme in India must therefore be to base the nuclear power generation as soon as possible '''on thorium rather than uranium'''... The first generation of atomic power stations based on natural uranium can only be used to start off an atomic power programme... The plutonium produced by the first generation power stations can be used in a second generation of power stations designed to produce electric power and convert thorium into U-233, or depleted uranium into more plutonium with breeding gain... The second generation of power stations may be regarded as an intermediate step for the breeder power stations of the third generation all of which would produce more U-238 than they burn in the course of producing power.<ref>{{cite book| author = Venkataraman, Ganesan | title = Bhabha and his magnificent obsessions| page =157| year = 1994| publisher = Universities Press|isbn=978-8173710070}}</ref>}}\n\n==Death==\nHomi J.

He was born on 30 October 1909. His father was Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha, a well known [[Parsi]] lawyer and his mother was Meheren.<ref>{{cite web |author=Raj, Baldev and Amarendra, G. |publisher=[[Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research]]|url=http://www.igcar.ernet.in/press_releases/press29.htm |title=A legend lives on Homi Jehangir Bhabha (1909\u20131966) |accessdate=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522140825/http://www.igcar.ernet.in/press_releases/press29.htm |archivedate=22 May 2013}}></ref> He received his early studies at Bombay's [[Cathedral and John Connon School]] and entered [[Elphinstone College]] at age 15 after passing his [[Senior Cambridge|Senior Cambridge Examination]] with Honours.\n\nHe then attended the [[The Institute of Science, Mumbai|Royal Institute of Science]] in 1927 before joining [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]] of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. This was due to the insistence of his father and his uncle Dorabji, who planned for Bhabha to obtain a degree in [[mechanical engineering]] from Cambridge and then return to India, where he would join the [[Tata Steel]] or Tata Steel Mills in [[Jamshedpur]] as a metallurgist.\n\n===Research=== \nBhabha's father understood his son's predicament, and he along with his wife  agreed to finance his studies in mathematics provided that he obtain first class on his Mechanical Sciences [[Tripos]] exam. Bhabha took the Tripos exam in June 1930 and passed with first class. Afterwards, he excelled in his mathematical studies under [[Paul Dirac]] to complete the Mathematics Tripos. Meanwhile, he worked at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] while working towards his doctorate in theoretical physics. At the time, the laboratory was the centre of a number of scientific breakthroughs. [[James Chadwick]] had discovered the [[neutron]], [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] [[lithium]] with high-energy protons, and [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] and [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] used [[cloud chamber]]s to demonstrate the production of [[lone pair|electron pairs]] and [[particle shower|showers]] by gamma radiation.\n\nDuring the 1931\u20131932 academic year, Bhabha was awarded the Salomons Studentship in Engineering. In 1932, he obtained first class on his [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]] and was awarded the [[W. W. Rouse Ball|Rouse Ball]] travelling studentship in mathematics.\nDuring this time, nuclear physics was attracting the greatest minds and it was one of the most significantly emerging fields as compared to theoretical physics, the [[German physics|opposition]] towards theoretical physics attacked the field because it was lenient towards theories rather than proving natural phenomenon through experiments. Conducting experiments on particles which also released enormous amounts of radiation, was a lifelong passion of Bhabha, and his leading edge research and experiments brought great laurels to Indian physicists who particularly switched their fields to nuclear physics, one of the most notable being [[Piara Singh Gill]].\n\n===Work in nuclear physics===\n\nIn January 1933, Bhabha received his doctorate in nuclear physics after publishing his first scientific paper, \"''The Absorption of Cosmic radiation''\". In the publication, Bhabha offered an explanation of the absorption features and [[electron shower]] production in [[cosmic ray]]s. The paper helped him win the Isaac Newton Studentship in 1934, which he held for the next three years. The following year, he completed his doctoral studies in theoretical physics under [[Ralph H. Fowler]]. During his studentship, he split his time working at Cambridge and with [[Niels Bohr]] in Copenhagen. In 1935, Bhabha published a paper in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A]]'', in which he performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering. Electron-positron scattering was later named [[Bhabha scattering]], in honour of his contributions in the field.\n\nIn 1936, with [[Walter Heitler]], he co-authored a paper, \"The Passage of Fast Electrons and the Theory of Cosmic Showers\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bhabha, Homi J.|author2= Heitler, Walter |author3=Mott, Nevill Francis |title=The passage of fast electrons and the theory of cosmic showers|journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences|volume= 159|issue=898 |year=1937|pages=432\u2013458|doi= 10.1098/rspa.1937.0082|bibcode=1937RSPSA.159..432B}}</ref> in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A'', in which they used their theory to describe how primary cosmic rays from outer space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler then made numerical estimates of the number of electrons in the cascade process at different altitudes for different electron initiation energies. The calculations agreed with the experimental observations of cosmic ray showers made by [[Bruno Rossi]] and [[Pierre Victor Auger]] a few years before. Bhabha later concluded that observations of the properties of such particles would lead to the straightforward experimental verification of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]]. In 1937, Bhabha was awarded the [[Senior Studentship of the 1851 exhibition]], which helped him continue his work at Cambridge until the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939.\n\n==Return to India==\n\nIn September 1939, Bhabha was in India for a brief holiday when World War II started, and he decided not to return to [[England]] for the time being. He accepted an offer to serve as the Reader in the Physics Department of the [[Indian Institute of Science]], then headed by renowned physicist [[C. V. Raman]]. He received a special research grant from the Sir Dorab Tata Trust, which he used to establish the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute. Bhabha selected a few students, including [[Harish-Chandra]], to work with him. Later, on 20 March 1941, he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. With the help of [[J. R. D. Tata]], he played an instrumental role in the establishment of the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in Mumbai.\n\n==Career==\nStarting his [[nuclear physics]] career in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Bhabha had returned to India for his annual vacation before the start of [[World War II]] in September 1939. War prompted him to remain in India and he accepted a post of reader in physics at the [[Indian Institute of Science]] in [[Bengaluru]], headed by [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[C. V.

During this time, he intensified his lobbying for the development of nuclear weapons. Soon after the [[Sino-Indian War|Sino-Indo war]], Bhabha aggressively and publicly began to call for the nuclear weapons.<ref name=\"nuclear weapon archive (Indian nuclear program)\"/>\n\nBhabha gained international prominence after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as [[Bhabha scattering]]. His major contribution included his work on [[Compton scattering]], [[R-process]], and furthermore the advancement of nuclear physics. He was awarded [[Padma Bhushan]] by Government of India in 1954.<ref name=\"Padma Awards\">{{cite web |url=http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |title=Padma Awards |publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |date=2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015193758/http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2015}}</ref> He later served as the member of the [[Union Cabinet of India|Indian Cabinet]]'s Scientific Advisory Committee and provided the pivotal role to [[Vikram Sarabhai]] to set up the [[Indian National Committee for Space Research]].

This prompted him to send a proposal in March 1944 to the [[Sir Dorabji Tata Trust]] for establishing 'a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics'. In his proposal he wrote:\n\n{{cquote| There is at the moment in India no big school of research in the fundamental problems of physics, both theoretical and experimental. There are, however, scattered all over India competent workers who are not doing as good work as they would do if brought together in one place under proper direction. It is absolutely in the interest of India to have a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics, for such a school forms the spearhead of research not only in less advanced branches of physics but also in problems of immediate practical application in industry. If much of the applied research done in India today is disappointing or of very inferior quality it is entirely due to the absence of sufficient number of outstanding pure research workers who would set the standard of good research and act on the directing boards in an advisory capacity&nbsp;... Moreover, when nuclear energy has been successfully applied for power production in say a couple of decades from now, India will not have to look abroad for its experts but will find them ready at hand. I do not think that anyone acquainted with scientific development in other countries would deny the need in India for such a school as I propose. The subjects on which research and advanced teaching would be done would be theoretical physics, especially on fundamental problems and with special reference to cosmic rays and nuclear physics, and experimental research on cosmic rays. It is neither possible nor desirable to separate nuclear physics from cosmic rays since the two are closely connected theoretically.<ref>[http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/bhabha/BHABHANEW.HTM Homi Jehangir Bhabha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162105/http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/bhabha/BHABHANEW.HTM |date=21 July 2011 }}.

[[Bombay]] was chosen as the location as the Government of Bombay showed interest in becoming a joint founder of the proposed institute. The institute, named [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]], was inaugurated in 1945 in 540 square meters of hired space in an existing building. In 1948 the Institute was moved into the old buildings of the Royal Yacht club.\n\nWhen Bhabha realised that technology development for the atomic energy programme could no longer be carried out within TIFR he proposed to the government to build a new laboratory entirely devoted to this purpose. For this purpose, 1200&nbsp;acres of land was acquired at Trombay from the Bombay Government. Thus the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay (AEET) started functioning in 1954. The same year the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was also established.<ref>{{cite book| author = Guha, Ramachandra | title = India After Gandhi |page= 216| year = 2008| publisher = Harper Perennial|isbn=978-0060958589 | author-link = Guha, Ramachandra | title-link = India After Gandhi }}</ref> He represented India in International Atomic Energy Forums, and as President of the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] in 1955.

The approach proposed by Bhabha to achieve this strategic objective became [[India's three stage nuclear power programme]].\n\nBhabha paraphrased the three-stage approach as follows: {{cquote|The total reserves of thorium in India amount to over 500,000 tons in the readily extractable form, while the known reserves of uranium are less than a tenth of this. The aim of long range atomic power programme in India must therefore be to base the nuclear power generation as soon as possible '''on thorium rather than uranium'''... The first generation of atomic power stations based on natural uranium can only be used to start off an atomic power programme... The plutonium produced by the first generation power stations can be used in a second generation of power stations designed to produce electric power and convert thorium into U-233, or depleted uranium into more plutonium with breeding gain... The second generation of power stations may be regarded as an intermediate step for the breeder power stations of the third generation all of which would produce more U-238 than they burn in the course of producing power.<ref>{{cite book| author = Venkataraman, Ganesan | title = Bhabha and his magnificent obsessions| page =157| year = 1994| publisher = Universities Press|isbn=978-8173710070}}</ref>}}\n\n==Death==\nHomi J.
