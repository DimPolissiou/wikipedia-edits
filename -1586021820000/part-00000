The rebels took over most of the province by late 2013, leaving only small pockets of government control around the city of Deir ez-Zor.\n\nSince late 2013, ISIS became increasingly involved in the battle, but retreated tactically in February 2014. Still, in April 2014, ISIS launched a massive offensive, taking over all rebel areas. Heavy fighting continued in the city over the following years between government troops and ISIS. By mid-November 2016, it was reported that since the start of the fighting in Deir ez-Zor city five years earlier, around 3,000 anti-government jihadists and 2,500 pro-government fighters had been killed.

It is surrounded by water on three sides, the [[Arthur Kill]], a [[tidal strait]] to the east, and [[tidal river]]s to the south, [[Raritan River]], and north, [[Rahway River]]; and, much of the developed land in Woodbridge has low elevations, as little as five feet above sea level.

Woodbridge streams and rivers have been described as having a \"high flow, flashy nature.\" The land is relatively impervious, and flooding is exacerbated by steep slopes and urban cover. Flooding in the South Branch Rahway River and [[Pumpkin Patch Brook]] hazard zones is predominantly fluvial.  Prolonged coastal storms ([[nor'easters]]), which combine tidal and fluvial flooding, along with flow constrictions, cause an increase in the duration of flooding of the [[Woodbridge River]] and its tributaries, [[Heards Brook]] and [[Wedgewood Brook]], which may last for days before water levels subside.<ref name=:\"S\"/> Frequency of flooding has increased over time. Sea levels are rising and residential areas have moved into previous marsh land, decreasing the ability of the land to absorb excess water.

It is surrounded by water on three sides, the [[Arthur Kill]], a [[tidal strait]] to the east, and [[tidal river]]s to the south, [[Raritan River]], and north, [[Rahway River]]; and, much of the developed land in Woodbridge has low elevations, as little as five feet above sea level.

Woodbridge streams and rivers have been described as having a \"high flow, flashy nature.\" The land is relatively impervious, and flooding is exacerbated by steep slopes and urban cover. Flooding in the South Branch Rahway River and [[Pumpkin Patch Brook]] hazard zones is predominantly fluvial.  Prolonged coastal storms ([[nor'easters]]), which combine tidal and fluvial flooding, along with flow constrictions, cause an increase in the duration of flooding of the [[Woodbridge River]] and its tributaries, [[Heards Brook]] and [[Wedgewood Brook]], which may last for days before water levels subside.<ref name=:\"S\"/> Frequency of flooding has increased over time. Sea levels are rising and residential areas have moved into previous marsh land, decreasing the ability of the land to absorb excess water. A 1770 map shows that all land surrounding the Woodbridge River was [[salt marshes]]. In October 2012, New Jersey was devastated by [[Hurricane Sandy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nj.gov/dep/docs/njdep-accomplishments-january-2018.pdf|title=Accomplishments 2010-2018|last=|first=|date=2018|website=nj.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=February 10, 2020|access-date=}}</ref> and Woodbridge suffered significant flood damage.

In Fes el-Jdid they added three bastions to the already formidable city walls on its eastern side; namely, those known as Borj Sheikh Ahmed, Borj Twil, and Borj Sidi Bou Nafa'.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> It was only with the rise of the [[Alaouite dynasty]] that Fes became the capital again and reclaimed some of its prosperity. Further important developments took place in Fes el-Jdid during this period. \n\nIn 1671, the first Alaouite Sultan [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay Rashid]] ordered the creation of a vast rectangular courtyard in the eastern part of the palace.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|294}} This addition extended the Dar al-Makhzen grounds up to the edge of the Lalla ez-Zhar Mosque which had previously stood in the middle of a residential neighbourhood, cutting off one of the local streets.

Under sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Moulay Abd al-Rahman]] (ruled 1822-1859) the Bab Bou Jat Mechouar or Grand Mechouar was created to the west of the Moulay Abdallah quarter, providing the palace grounds with another ceremonial entrance to the northwest.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> This led to the western gate of the Moulay Abdallah quarter, Bab Bou Jat, eventually being closed off. A large garden area on the west side of the palace, the Lalla Mina Gardens, was also established by Moulay Abd al-Rahman, stretching to the old Marinid western walls of the city.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> To the west of these an even larger walled garden called the Agdal was established by Sultan [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hassan I]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> Moulay Hassan also connected Fes el-Jdid and [[Fes el Bali|Fes el-Bali]] (the old city) for the first time with a broad corridor of [[Fortifications of Fez|walls]], and inside this space he commissioned a number of royal gardens such as [[Jnan Sbil Gardens|Jnan Sbil]] and summer palaces such as [[Dar Batha]].<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /><ref name=\":03\" /> Additionally, he constructed the [[Dar al-Makina]], a modern arms factory, on the west side of the New Mechouar (which he likely also established).<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Lastly, it seems to have been under Moulay Hassan that the Dar al-Makhzen grounds were extended up to the south gate of the Old Mechouar, thus turning it into the main entrance of the palace, diverting the northern end of the main street of Fes el-Jdid, and cutting off the Moulay Abdallah district from the rest of the city.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Oued Fes, which flowed just outside the northern walls of the city, was diverted northward in the course of these 19th-century expansions, but continues to pass under the Old Mechouar before reemerging on its east side.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> \n\nIn 1912 [[French Protectorate in Morocco|French colonial rule]] was instituted over Morocco following the [[Treaty of Fes]].

In Fes el-Jdid they added three bastions to the already formidable city walls on its eastern side; namely, those known as Borj Sheikh Ahmed, Borj Twil, and Borj Sidi Bou Nafa'.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> It was only with the rise of the [[Alaouite dynasty]] that Fes became the capital again and reclaimed some of its prosperity. Further important developments took place in Fes el-Jdid during this period. \n\nIn 1671, the first Alaouite Sultan [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay Rashid]] ordered the creation of a vast rectangular courtyard in the eastern part of the palace.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|294}} This addition extended the Dar al-Makhzen grounds up to the edge of the Lalla ez-Zhar Mosque which had previously stood in the middle of a residential neighbourhood, cutting off one of the local streets.

Under sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Moulay Abd al-Rahman]] (ruled 1822-1859) the Bab Bou Jat Mechouar or Grand Mechouar was created to the west of the Moulay Abdallah quarter, providing the palace grounds with another ceremonial entrance to the northwest.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> This led to the western gate of the Moulay Abdallah quarter, Bab Bou Jat, eventually being closed off. A large garden area on the west side of the palace, the Lalla Mina Gardens, was also established by Moulay Abd al-Rahman, stretching to the old Marinid western walls of the city.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> To the west of these an even larger walled garden called the Agdal was established by Sultan [[Hassan I of Morocco|Moulay Hassan I]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> Moulay Hassan also connected Fes el-Jdid and [[Fes el Bali|Fes el-Bali]] (the old city) for the first time with a broad corridor of [[Fortifications of Fez|walls]], and inside this space he commissioned a number of royal gardens such as [[Jnan Sbil Gardens|Jnan Sbil]] and summer palaces such as [[Dar Batha]].<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /><ref name=\":03\" /> Additionally, he constructed the [[Dar al-Makina]], a modern arms factory, on the west side of the New Mechouar (which he likely also established).<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> Lastly, it seems to have been under Moulay Hassan that the Dar al-Makhzen grounds were extended up to the south gate of the Old Mechouar, thus turning it into the main entrance of the palace, diverting the northern end of the main street of Fes el-Jdid, and cutting off the Moulay Abdallah district from the rest of the city.<ref name=\":3\" /> The Oued Fes, which flowed just outside the northern walls of the city, was diverted northward in the course of these 19th-century expansions, but continues to pass under the Old Mechouar before reemerging on its east side.<ref name=\"Le Tourneau 1949\" /> \n\nIn 1912 [[French Protectorate in Morocco|French colonial rule]] was instituted over Morocco following the [[Treaty of Fes]].

{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]] and [[Peter Jackson]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art (which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref>) and Ackerman was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nAckerman did later file a request to prolong his lease on the film rights for another six months, but his inability to secure a producer made him unable to pay for the extension, and the negotiations were terminated.<ref>{{ME-ref|carpenter}}</ref><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the following years, Tolkien entered brief negotiations for an adaptation with Robert Gutwillig, but nothing came out of it. Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only recieved a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee\u200f|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=1119656028, 9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio.

Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits.

Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. The director, a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]],'' was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase.

He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. It was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program.

1977]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by J. R. R. Tolkien|Films]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth films| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation.  \n\nAn animated short of ''The Hobbit'' was shown once in 1967, and technically forms the first adaptation of Tolkien to the screen. The first commercial depiction of Middle Earth was in a 1977 TV special of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. In 1985, Middle-earth was depicted in a live-action film for the first time through an unlicensed [[The Hobbit (1985 film)|adaptation]] produced in the Soviet Union, and a 1993 Finnish miniseries was the first to adapt it to serialized television.\n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]] and [[Peter Jackson]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art (which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref>) and Ackerman was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project. In looking for a studio, he intended to make the film with [[American International Pictures]], but president James Nicholson declined, as did other studio heads.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTolkien was sent a 55-page<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bogstad|first=Janice M.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nAckerman did later file a request to prolong his lease on the film rights for another six months, but his inability to secure a producer made him unable to pay for the extension, and the negotiations were terminated.<ref>{{ME-ref|carpenter}}</ref><ref name=\"Screenplays\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the following years, Tolkien entered brief negotiations for an adaptation with Robert Gutwillig, but nothing came out of it. Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only recieved a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee\u200f|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R. Tolkien|publisher=Wiley|year=2020|isbn=1119656028, 9781119656029|location=|pages=518-521}}</ref> While Tolkien was aware that Snyder was \"sure to perpetrate [...] many objectionable things\",<ref name=\":0\" /> he agreed to lease the rights to the producer in 1962. In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. The director, a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]],'' was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo.

He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

Zaentz also acquired the rights to produce The Hobbit, but not to distribute it: perhaps because they saw The Hobbit are more film-friendly, UA kept the distribution rights to themselves.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

[[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. It was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel.

Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers).

In 2008, Guillermo Del Toro was chosen to direct a two-film adaptation of The Hobbit, produced by Jackson and co-written with Walsh, Boyens and Del Toro. Time constraints caused Del Toro to bow out, and Jackson stepped-in to direct.

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million.

It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace. When a nation employs a deceit and treachery, using periods of negotiations and the negotiations themselves as a cloak to screen a [[perfidy|perfidious]] attack, then there is a prime example of the crime of all crimes.<ref>Keenan, Joseph Berry and Brown, Brendan Francis, ''Crimes against International Law'', Public Affairs Press, Washington, 1950, pp.&nbsp;57\u201387</ref><ref>''Tokyo Transcript'', May 13, 1946, p.491</ref>}}\n\nAdmiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, was fully aware that if Japan lost the war, he would be tried as a war criminal for that attack {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} (although he was killed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in [[Operation Vengeance]] in 1943).

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

On the battlefield, we never really considered the Chinese humans. When you're winning, the losers look really miserable.

According to the [[Hague Convention of 1907]] (the only convention which Japan had ratified regarding the treatment of prisoners of war), any military personnel captured on land or at sea by enemy troops were to be treated as prisoners of war and not punished for simply being lawful combatants. Eight Doolittle Raiders captured upon landing in China (four months before the passage of the Act) were the first Allied aircrew to be brought before a [[kangaroo court]] in Shanghai under the act, charged with alleged (but unproven) strafing of Japanese civilians during the Doolittle Raid. The eight aircrew were forbidden to give any defense and, despite the lack of legitimate evidences, were found guilty of participating in aerial military operations against Japan. Five of the eight sentences were commuted to life imprisonment; the other three airmen were taken to a cemetery outside Shanghai, where they were [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] on October 14, 1942.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Doolittle Raid 1942: America's first strike back at Japan (Campaign) |author=Clayton Chun |date=January 31, 2006 |page=[https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 85] |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=1-84176-918-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/doolittleraid19400chun/page/85 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Strategic Bombing by the United States in World War II: The Myths and the Facts |author=Stewart Halsey Ross |date=December 13, 2002 |page=59 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=0-7864-1412-X}}</ref>\n\nThe Enemy Airmen's Act contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Allied airmen throughout the Pacific War.

In many cases this was inspired by ever-increasing Allied attacks on Japanese supply lines, and the death and illness of Japanese personnel as a result of hunger. According to historian Yuki Tanaka: \"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\".<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127</ref> This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: \"[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters&nbsp;...

[[Yoshio Tachibana]] (\u7acb\u82b1\u82b3\u592b,''Tachibana Yoshio''), who with 11 other Japanese personnel was tried in August 1946 in relation to the execution of U.S. Navy airmen, and the cannibalism of at least one of them, during August 1944, on [[Chichijima incident|Chichi Jima]], in the [[Bonin Islands]]. The airmen were beheaded on Tachibana's orders. Because military and international law did not specifically deal with cannibalism, they were tried for murder and \"prevention of honorable burial\".

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''.

Two Marines of [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] told cautionary tales.

The case set a precedent regarding the responsibility of commanders for war crimes, and is known as the [[Yamashita Standard]].]]\nSoon after the war, the Allied powers indicted 25 persons as [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Class-A war criminals]], and 5,700 persons were indicted as Class-B or Class-C war criminals by Allied criminal trials. Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial. These numbers included 178 ethnic Taiwanese and 148 ethnic Koreans.<ref>Dower, John (2000). ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II'', p. 447</ref> The Class-A charges were all tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], also known as \"the Tokyo Trials\". Other courts were formed in many different places in Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Tokyo Trials===\n{{Main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}\nThe International Military Tribunal for the Far East was formed to try accused people in Japan itself.\n\nHigh-ranking officers who were tried included [[K\u014dichi Kido]] and [[Sadao Araki]]. Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes. Many military leaders were also convicted. Two people convicted as Class-A war criminals later served as ministers in post-war Japanese governments.\n* [[Mamoru Shigemitsu]] served as foreign minister both during the war and in the post-war [[Ichir\u014d Hatoyama|Hatoyama government]].\n* [[Okinori Kaya]] was finance minister during the war and later served as justice minister in the government of [[Hayato Ikeda]]. These two had no direct connection to alleged war crimes committed by Japanese forces, and foreign governments never raised the issue when they were appointed.\n\n[[Hirohito]] and all members of the imperial family implicated in the war such as [[Prince Chichibu]], [[Prince Asaka]], [[Prince Takeda]] and [[Prince Higashikuni]] were exonerated from criminal prosecutions by MacArthur, with the help of [[Bonner Fellers]] who allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the Emperor would be spared from indictment.<ref>Kumao Toyoda, ''Senso saiban yoroku'', 1986, p.170\u2013172, H.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

Hashimoto Kingor\u014d, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jir\u014d, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichir\u014d, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido K\u014dichi, \u014cshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetar\u014d, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Sat\u014d Kenry\u014d, whom many, including Judge [[Bert R\u00f6ling|B.V.A. R\u00f6ling]] regarded as one of the convicted war criminals least deserving of imprisonment, was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

The activities of the fund have been controversial in Japan, as well as with international organisations supporting the women concerned.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\nSome argue that such a fund is part of an ongoing refusal by the Japanese government to face up to its responsibilities, while others say that the Japanese government has long since finalised its responsibility to individual victims and is merely correcting the failures of the victims' own governments. [[California]] [[Congressman]] [[Mike Honda]], speaking before U.S. House of Representatives on behalf of the women, said that \"without a sincere and unequivocal apology from the government of Japan, the majority of surviving Comfort Women refused to accept these funds.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea. Jung recorded the apologies of the persons.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAs these investigations continue more evidence is discovered each day. It has been claimed that the Japanese government intentionally destroyed the reports on Korean comfort women.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|last=Horsley |first=William |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4749467.stm |title=World &#124; Asia-Pacific &#124; Korean WWII sex slaves fight on |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-08-09 |accessdate=2013-07-21}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://theseoultimes.com/ST/?url=/ST/db/read.php?idx=1846 |title=''Ex-sex slave narrates: \"Japan Boiled Comfort Woman to Make Soup\".

For example, one of the names on the list was of a comfort woman who stated she was forced to be a prostitute by the Japanese. She was classified as a nurse along with at least a dozen other verified comfort women who were not nurses or secretaries. Currently, the South Korean government is looking into the hundreds of other names on these lists.<ref>[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200501/200501110028.html Digital Chosunilbo (English Edition) : Daily News in English About Korea.

For example, in 2011 it was alleged in an article published in the ''Japan Times'' newspaper that the British government were involved in the covering-up of Japanese war crimes as they wanted to end the warcrime trials early in order to re-establish good relations with Japan post-war to prevent the spread of communism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coskrey |first=Jason |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |title=Britain covered up Japan massacre of POWs |work=The Japan Times |accessdate=2013-07-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606151927/http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081017a3.html |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref> Meanwhile, scholars and public intellectuals continue to criticize Japan for what they view as a refusal to acknowledge and apologize fully for Japanese war crimes.

Much of the controversy regarding Japan's role in World War II revolves around the death rates of prisoners of war and civilians under Japanese occupation. Historian [[Sterling Seagrave]] has written that:\n\n{{quote| Arriving at a probable number of Japan\u2019s war victims who died is difficult for several interesting reasons, which have to do with Western perceptions. Both Americans and Europeans fell into the unfortunate habit of seeing [[World War I|WW1]] and [[World War II|WW2]] as separate wars, failing to comprehend that they were interlaced in a multitude of ways (not merely that one was the consequence of the other, or of the rash behavior of the victors after WW1). Wholly aside from this basic misconception, most Americans think of WW2 in Asia as having begun with [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], the British with the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], and so forth. The Chinese would correct this by identifying the [[Marco Polo Bridge incident]] as the start, or the earlier [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|Japanese seizure of Manchuria]]. It really began in 1895 with Japan\u2019s assassination of Korea\u2019s [[Empress Myeongseong|Queen Min]], and invasion of Korea, resulting in its absorption into Japan, followed quickly by Japan\u2019s seizure of southern Manchuria, etc. \u2013 establishing that Japan was at war from 1895\u20131945. Prior to 1895, [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598)|Japan had only briefly invaded Korea during the Shogunate]], long before the [[Meiji Restoration]], and the invasion failed. Therefore, [[Rudolph Rummel|Rummel]]\u2019s estimate of 6-million to 10-million dead between 1937 (the [[Rape of Nanjing]]) and 1945, may be roughly corollary to the time-frame of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi Holocaust]], but it falls far short of the actual numbers killed by the Japanese war machine. If you add, say, 2-million Koreans, 2-million Manchurians, Chinese, Russians, many East European Jews (both [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]]), and others killed by Japan between 1895 and 1937 (conservative figures), the total of Japanese victims is more like 10-million to 14-million.

Keenan]], the chief prosecutor in the Tokyo Trials, says that the attack on Pearl Harbor not only happened without a declaration of war but was also a [[Betrayal|treacherous]] and [[deceitful]] act. In fact, Japan and the U.S. were still negotiating for a possible peace agreement which kept U.S. officials very distracted when Japanese planes bombed Pearl Harbor. Keenan explained the definition of a war of aggression and the criminality of the attack on Pearl Harbor:\n\n{{quote|The concept of aggressive war may not be expressed with the precision of a scientific formula, or described like the objective data of the physical sciences. Aggressive War is not entirely a physical fact to be observed and defined like the operation of the laws of matter. It is rather an activity involving injustice between nations, rising to the level of criminality because of its disastrous effects upon the common good of international society. The injustice of a war of aggression is criminal of its extreme grosses, considered both from the point of view of the will of the aggressor to inflict injury and from the evil effects which ensue&nbsp;... Unjust war are plainly crimes and not simply torts or breaches of contracts. The act comprises the willful, intentional, and unreasonable destruction of life, limb, and property, subject matter which has been regarded as criminal by the laws of all civilized peoples&nbsp;... The Pearl Harbor attack breached the Kellogg\u2013Briand Pact and the Hague Convention III. In addition, it violated Article 23 of the Annex to the Hague Convention IV, of October 1907&nbsp;... But the attack of Pearl Harbor did not alone result in murder and the slaughter of thousands of human beings. It did not eventuate only in the destruction of property. It was an outright act of undermining and destroying the hope of a world for peace. When a nation employs a deceit and treachery, using periods of negotiations and the negotiations themselves as a cloak to screen a [[perfidy|perfidious]] attack, then there is a prime example of the crime of all crimes.<ref>Keenan, Joseph Berry and Brown, Brendan Francis, ''Crimes against International Law'', Public Affairs Press, Washington, 1950, pp.&nbsp;57\u201387</ref><ref>''Tokyo Transcript'', May 13, 1946, p.491</ref>}}\n\nAdmiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]], who planned the attack on Pearl Harbor, was fully aware that if Japan lost the war, he would be tried as a war criminal for that attack {{citation needed|date=May 2018}} (although he was killed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] in [[Operation Vengeance]] in 1943).

Most historians and scholars agreed that the oil embargo cannot be used as justification for using military force against a foreign nation imposing the oil embargo because there is a clear distinction between a perception that something is essential to the welfare of the nation-state and a threat truly being sufficiently serious to warrant an act of force in response, which Japan failed to consider. Japanese scholar and diplomat, Takeo Iguchi, states that it is \"[h]ard to say from the perspective of international law that exercising the right of self-defense against economic pressures is considered valid.\" While Japan felt that its dreams of further expansion would be brought to a screeching halt by the American embargo, this \"need\" cannot be considered [[Proportionality (law)|proportional]] with the destruction suffered by the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] at Pearl Harbor, intended by Japanese military planners to be as comprehensive as possible.<ref name=\"Pearl Harbor\" />\n\n===Mass killings===\n{{Infobox civilian attack\n| title =Japanese War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity\n| location =In and around East Asia and the Pacific\n| fatalities =3,000,000<ref name=rummel/> to 14,000,000<ref name=sterling/> civilians and P.O.W.s\n}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 220\n|footer = Japanese soldiers shooting blindfolded Sikh prisoners before bayonetting them.

According to historian Yuki Tanaka: \"cannibalism was often a systematic activity conducted by whole squads and under the command of officers\".<ref>Tanaka ''Hidden Horrors'' p. 127</ref> This frequently involved murder for the purpose of securing bodies. For example, an [[British Raj|Indian]] POW, ''[[Havildar]]'' Changdi Ram, testified that: \"[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot.

Yoshimi claimed that there was a direct link between imperial institutions such as the ''K\u014dain'' and \"comfort stations\". When Yoshimi's findings were published in the Japanese news media on 12 January 1993, they caused a sensation and forced the government, represented by Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Koichi Kato (LDP)|Kato Koichi]], to acknowledge some of the facts that same day. On 17 January Prime Minister [[Kiichi Miyazawa]] presented formal apologies for the suffering of the victims, during a trip in South Korea. On 6 July and 4 August, the Japanese government issued two statements by which it recognised that \"Comfort stations were operated in response to the request of the military of the day\", \"The Japanese military was, directly or indirectly, involved in the establishment and management of the comfort stations and the transfer of comfort women\" and that the women were \"recruited in many cases against their own will through coaxing and coercion\".<ref>Yoshiaki Yoshimi, 2001\u201302, ''Comfort Women: Sexual Slavery in the Japanese Military during World War II''.

Of these, 984 were initially condemned to death, 920 were actually executed, 475 received life sentences, 2,944 received some prison terms, 1,018 were acquitted, and 279 were not sentenced or not brought to trial.

Three former (unelected) [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime ministers]]: [[K\u014dki Hirota]], [[Hideki Tojo]] and [[Kuniaki Koiso]] were convicted of Class-A war crimes.

Some 5,600 Japanese personnel were prosecuted in more than 2,200 trials outside Japan. Class B defendants were accused of having committed such crimes themselves; class C defendants, mostly senior officers, were accused of planning, ordering or failing to prevent them.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[judge]]s presiding came from the [[United States]], [[China]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[France]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[Philippines]]. Additionally, the [[Chinese Communists]] also held a number of trials for Japanese personnel. More than 4,400 Japanese personnel were convicted and about 1,000 were sentenced to death.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe largest single trial was that of 93 Japanese personnel charged with the [[summary execution]] of more than 300 Allied POWs, in the [[Laha massacre]] (1942). The most prominent ethnic Korean convicted was Lieutenant General [[Hong Sa Ik]], who orchestrated the organisation of prisoner of war camps in Southeast Asia. In 2006, the [[South Korea]]n government \"pardoned\" 83 of the 148 convicted Korean war criminals.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> One hundred-sixty Taiwanese who had served in the forces of the Empire of Japan were convicted of war crimes and 11 were executed.<ref name=\"Harmsen, Peter 2012, p. 4\"/>\n\n==Post-war events and reactions==\n\n===The parole-for-war-criminals movement===\nIn 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and across Europe, detained in the countries where they were convicted. Some executions were still outstanding as many Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts, reducing sentences in some cases and instituting a system of parole, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their status as sovereign countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nAn intense and broadly supported campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued (more aggressively in Germany than in Japan at first), as attention turned away from the top wartime leaders and towards the majority of \"ordinary\" war criminals (Class B/C in Japan), and the issue of criminal responsibility was reframed as a humanitarian problem.\n\nOn March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole of those who had received life sentences after fifteen years. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill-health.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe Japanese popular reaction to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal found expression in demands for the mitigation of the sentences of war criminals and agitation for parole. Shortly after the [[San Francisco Peace Treaty]] came into effect in April 1952, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the \"unfairness of the war crimes tribunals\" and the \"misery and hardship of the families of war criminals\". The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. In the face of this surge of public opinion, the government commented that \"public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.\"{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe parole-for-war-criminals movement was driven by two groups: those from outside who had \"a sense of pity\" for the prisoners; and the war criminals themselves who called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement. The movement that arose out of \"a sense of pity\" demanded \"just set them free (''tonikaku shakuho o'') regardless of how it is done\".\n\nOn September 4, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals to advise the President with respect to recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole, with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by military tribunals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78495 |title=Harry S.

On April 7, 1957, the Japanese government announced that, with the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free from the terms of their parole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Official apologies===\n{{Further|List of war apology statements issued by Japan}}\n{{Synthesis|section|date=October 2008}}\nThe Japanese government considers that the legal and moral positions in regard to war crimes are separate. Therefore, while maintaining that Japan violated no international law or treaties, Japanese governments have officially recognised the suffering which the Japanese military caused, and numerous apologies have been issued by the Japanese government. For example, Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]], in August 1995, [[Murayama Statement|stated]] that Japan \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations\", and he expressed his \"feelings of deep remorse\" and stated his \"heartfelt apology\". Also, on September 29, 1972, Japanese Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] stated: \"[t]he Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war, and deeply reproaches itself.\"<ref>Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan (quoted on the Taiwan Documents Project), ''Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China'', [http://www.taiwandocuments.org/japan01.htm]</ref>\n\nThe official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]]. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed \"regret\" or \"remorse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html |title=PBS.

In the Japanese media, the opinions of the political centre and left tend to dominate the [[editorial]]s of newspapers, while the right tend to dominate magazines. Debates regarding war crimes were confined largely to the editorials of [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] magazines where calls for the overthrow of \"[[American Empire (term)|Imperialist America]]\" and revived veneration of the Emperor coexisted with pornography. In 1972, to commemorate the normalisation of relationship with China, ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', a major [[Liberalism|liberal]] newspaper, ran a series on Japanese war crimes in China including the [[Nanjing Massacre]]. This opened the floodgates to debates which have continued ever since. The 1990s are generally considered to be the period in which such issues become truly mainstream, and incidents such as the Nanking Massacre, [[Yasukuni Shrine]], comfort women, [[Japanese history textbook controversies|the accuracy of school history textbooks]], and the validity of the Tokyo Trials were debated, even on television.\n\nAs the consensus of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many [[uyoku dantai|right wing elements]] in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of [[victor's justice]]. They see those convicted of war crimes as {{Nihongo|\"Martyrs of Sh\u014dwa\"|\u662d\u548c\u6b89\u96e3\u8005|Sh\u014dwa Junnansha}}, Sh\u014dwa being the name given to the rule of Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically ''valid'', they were still ''just'', somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.\n\nBy the early 21st century, the revived interest in Japan's imperial past had brought new interpretations from a group which has been labelled both \"new right\" and \"new left\". This group points out that many acts committed by Japanese forces, including the Nanjing Incident, were violations of the Japanese military code. It is suggested that had war crimes tribunals been conducted by the post-war Japanese government, in strict accordance with Japanese military law, many of those who were accused would still have been convicted and executed. Therefore, the moral and legal failures in question were the fault of the Japanese military and the government, for not executing their constitutionally defined duty.\n\nThe new right/new left also takes the view that the Allies committed no war crimes against Japan, because Japan was not a signatory to the Geneva Convention, and as a victors, the Allies had every right to demand some form of retribution, to which Japan consented in various treaties.\n\n[[File:Revisionists Yasukuni 1.jpg|thumb|Member of the right-wing revisionist group \"[[Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform]]\" putting up a banner reading \"[Give] the children correct history textbooks\" in front of the [[Yasukuni Jinja]]]]\nUnder the same logic, the new right/new left considers the killing of Chinese who were suspected of guerrilla activity to be perfectly legal and valid, including some of those killed at Nanjing, for example. They also take the view that many Chinese civilian casualties resulted from the [[scorched earth]] tactics of the [[Kuomintang|Chinese nationalists]]. Though such tactics are arguably legal, the new right/new left takes the position that some of the civilian deaths caused by these scorched earth tactics are wrongly attributed to the Japanese military.\n\nSimilarly, they take the position that those who have attempted to sue the Japanese government for compensation have no legal or moral case.\n\nThe new right and new left also take a less sympathetic view of Korean claims of victimhood, because prior to annexation by Japan, Korea was a [[tributary]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] and, according to them, the Japanese colonisation, though undoubtedly harsh, was \"better\" than the previous rule in terms of human rights and economic development.\n\nThey also argue that, the ''[[Kant\u014dgun]]'' (also known as the Kwantung Army) was at least partly culpable. Although the ''Kant\u014dgun'' was nominally subordinate to the Japanese high command at the time, its leadership demonstrated significant self-determination, as shown by its involvement in the plot to assassinate [[Zhang Zuolin]] in 1928, and the [[Manchurian Incident]] of 1931, which led to the foundation of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. Moreover, at that time, it was the official policy of the Japanese high command to confine the conflict to Manchuria. But in defiance of the high command, the ''Kant\u014dgun'' invaded [[China proper]], under the pretext of the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]]. The Japanese government not only failed to court martial the officers responsible for these incidents, but it also accepted the war against China, and many of those who were involved were even promoted. (Some of the officers involved in the [[Nanking Massacre]] were also promoted.)\n\nWhether or not Hirohito himself bears any responsibility for such failures is a sticking point between the new right and new left. Officially, the imperial constitution, adopted under [[Emperor Meiji]], gave full powers to the Emperor. Article 4 prescribed that \"The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in Himself the rights of sovereignty, and exercises them, according to the provisions of the present Constitution\" and article 11 prescribed that \"The Emperor has the supreme command of the Army and the Navy\".\n\nFor historian Akira Fujiwara, the thesis that the emperor as an organ of responsibility could not reverse cabinet decisions is a myth (shinwa) fabricated after the war.<ref>Fujiwara, ''Sh\u00f4wa tenn\u00f4 no j\u00fb-go nen sens\u00f4'', Aoki Shoten, 1991, p.122</ref> Others argue that Hirohito deliberately styled his rule in the manner of the British [[constitutional monarchy]], and he always accepted the decisions and consensus reached by the high command. According to this position, the moral and political failure rests primarily with the Japanese High Command and the Cabinet, most of whom were later convicted at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal as class-A war criminals, apart all members of the imperial family such as [[Prince Chichibu]], Prince [[Yasuhiko Asaka]], [[Prince Higashikuni]], Prince [[Hiroyasu Fushimi]] and [[Prince Takeda]].\n\n====Nippon Kaigi, the main revisionist lobby====\nThe denial of Japanese war crimes is one of the key missions of the openly [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] lobby [[Nippon Kaigi]] (Japan Conference), a nationalistic nonparty organisation that was established in 1997 and also advocates patriotic education, the revision of the constitution, and official visits to Yasukuni Shrine.<ref>{{cite web |last=Penney |first=Matthew |date=January 28, 2013 |title=The Abe Cabinet \u2013 An Ideological Breakdown |journal=The Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus |url=http://apjjf.org/-Matthew-Penney/4747/article.html }}</ref><ref>Christian G.

With the wealth they had amassed during the years of collaboration, they were able to further benefit their families by obtaining higher education for their relatives.<ref name=\"koreatimes.co.kr\"/>\n\nNon-government bodies and persons have also undertaken their own investigations. For example, in 2005, a South Korean freelance journalist, Jung Soo-woong, located in Japan some descendants of people involved in the 1895 [[assassination]] of [[Empress Myeongseong of Korea|Empress Myeongseong]] (Queen Min). The assassination was conducted by the [[Geny\u014dsha]], perhaps under the auspices of the Japanese government, because of the Empress's involvement in attempts to reduce Japanese influence in Korea.

Founded in 1868 by [[Archbishop]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Algiers|Algiers]] [[Charles Lavigerie|Cardinal Charles Lavigerie]], the society focuses on [[evangelism]] and [[education]], mostly in Africa. As of 2020, there were 1247 Missionnaires of Africa, of 36 Nationalities, working in 42 Countries, in 217 communities.<ref name=blanc/> \n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[image:Maison-Carr\u00e9e P\u00e8res Blancs.jpg|thumb|right|The first convent in Maison-Carr\u00e9e.]] \nThe [[cholera]] epidemic 1867 left a large number of [[Algeria]]n orphans, and the education and Christian instruction of these children was the occasion of the founding of the society in Maison-Carr\u00e9e (now [[El-Harrach]]) near [[Algiers]]; but from its inception the founder had in mind the conversion of the Arabs and the peoples of Central Africa. Lavigerie instructed his missionaries to speak the language of the people, eat the same food, and wear the same clothing. They therefore, adopted the Arabian dress: the [[gandoura]], the Arab cloak and the [[Taqiyah (cap)|chechia]], with as a religious sign a rosary worn around the neck like necklace.<ref name=blanc>[http://peresblancs.org/histoi1a.htm Ceillier, Jean-Claude Ceillier. \"The origins and Presentation of Our Society\", ''Peres Blanc'']</ref> The nickname \"White Fathers\" derives from their garb.  \n\nA novitiate was established in 1868. Missionary posts were established in [[Kabylie]] and in the [[Sahara]]. In 1876 three missionaries on their way to [[Timbuktu]] were killed by desert nomads.<ref name=blanc/> In 1878 ten missionaries left [[Algiers]] to establish posts at Lakes [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Lake Malawi|Nyassa]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]].<ref name=Forbes>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15613d.htm Forbes, John. \"White Fathers.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 3 March 2020{{PD-notice}}</ref> In 1878, a caravan of several missionaries arrives at the port of [[Mombasa]], and after a three month trek reach [[Lake Victoria]]. \n\nIn 1880, at the request of the Holy See, the White Fathers established at Jerusalem a [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Melchite]] seminary for the formation of clergy of that rite. In 1894 a mission in [[French Sudan]] (now [[Mali]]) was founded.<ref name=Forbes/>\n\n==Present day==\nThese now form the present Lakes [[Archdiocese]]s of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala|Kampala]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gitega|Gitega]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tabora|Tabora]], and the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kigoma|Kigoma]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lilongwe|Lilongwe]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalemie-Kirungu|Kalemie-Kirungu]]. \n\nThe society is composed of missionary priests and brothers. The members are bound by an oath engaging them to labour for the conversion of Africa according to the constitutions of their society. The missionaries are not, strictly speaking, a [[religious institute]], whether \"[[Catholic religious order|order]]\" or \"[[Congregation of Papal Right|congregation]]\". Instead, they are a [[society of apostolic life]]. They may retain their own property; but they may expend it in the society only at the direction of the superiors. \n\n==Aims==\nOne of the chief points in the rule is in regard to community life in the missions, each house being obliged to contain at least three members. At the head of the society is a General-Superior, elected every six years by the chapter. He resides in Rome at the Generalate house on Via Aurelia. Those desiring to become priests or brothers are admitted to the [[novitiate]] after their [[Philosophy|philosophical]] studies. After the novitiate they spent two years of missionary training on the field and four years of [[theology]]. This training can be slightly different for brother candidates. The theological studies  are spent in scholasticate presently located in Abidjan ([[Ivory Coast]]), Nairobi ([[Kenya]]), [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale (Devon)]], [[South Africa]] and [[Jerusalem]]. The society admits persons of all nationalities.\n\n==Dress and membership==\nThe habit of the missionaries resembles the white robes of the Algerian Arabs and consists of a [[cassock]] or [[gandoura]], and a [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] or [[burnous]]. A [[rosary]] and [[cross]] are worn around the neck in imitation of the [[mesbaha]] of the [[marabout]]s.\n\nThe society depends directly on the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]]. The White Fathers succeeded in establishing small missions among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle Berbers]], there being at present nine hundred and sixty-two Christians; but the regions bordering on the Great Lakes and Sudan show the best results. The number of [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s in all the vicariates (as of June 1909) was 135,000; the number preparing for [[baptism]] 151,480. A test of four years is imposed on those desiring to be baptized. To religious instruction the missionaries add lessons in reading and writing, and teach also, in special classes, the tongue of the European nation governing the country, which was mostly French in these areas. The brothers train the young people for trades and agriculture. The number of boys in the schools (June, 1909) was 22,281.[[Image:Cypress Grove House.jpg|thumb|Cypress Grove House, home of the White Fathers in Ireland]]\n\nIn January 2006, the society numbered; 9 bishops, 1,498 priests, 156 brothers; 16 clerics with perpetual oath, and 5 associates. There were 354 students preparing to enter the society.\n\n==Leaders==\n\nUnder the leadership of Archbishop (later Cardinal) [[Charles Lavigerie|Charles-Martial Allemand-Lavigerie]], General Superiors were:<ref name=MafrGCatholic>{{cite web |ref={{harvid|Missionaries of Africa M.

They arrived from what is now called Tanzania in 1891, and established the first mission post called Mwambwe Mwela. They were hierarchically structured with Bishop Joseph Dupont firmly in charge , something that appealed to the Bemba overlords. One of the reasons that bloodshed was avoided was his reconciliation during one of their succession disputes. They settled down successfully in the North of what was then called Northern Rhodesia but did not follow those who migrated to the copper mines and the capital Lusaka during the 1930's. This practice was changed in 1965, after the Second Vatican Council, when a younger group of White Fathers responded to the national requirements of the apostolate. \nAround the beginning of the new millennium their missionary endeavour was taken over, almost entirely, by the local clergy.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Maison g\u00e9n\u00e9ralice.jpg|thumb|right|General House in Rome]]\n* [[Catholic missions]]\n* [[Burkard Huwiler|Bishop Burkhard Huwiler]]\n* [[Joseph Dupont (bishop)|Bishop Joseph Dupont]]\n* [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]\n* [[Kungoni|Mua Mission, Malawi]]\n* [[Catholic youth sports associations of French Algeria]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CathEncy|wstitle=White Fathers}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://mafrome.org/home/ International Website of the Missionaries of Africa]\n* [http://www.missionariesofafrica.org/ Missionaries of Africa UK]\n* [http://www.mafrwestafrica.net/ Missionaries of Africa in West Africa]\n\n[[Category:White Fathers| ]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1868]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Missionaries of Africa||Category:Christian missions in Africa}}\n{{Infobox organization\n| image = [[Image:Cardinal Lavigerie.jpg|frameless|centre|200px|]]\n| caption = [[Cardinal Lavigerie|Charles Martial Lavigerie]]\n| formation = {{start date and age|1868}}\n| type = Society of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right (for Men)\n| headquarters = Via Aurelia, 269, 00165 Roma, Italy\n| leader_title = Superior General\n| leader_name = Fr.

As of 2020, there were 1247 Missionnaires of Africa, of 36 Nationalities, working in 42 Countries, in 217 communities.<ref name=blanc/> \n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove|section|date=March 2020}}\n[[image:Maison-Carr\u00e9e P\u00e8res Blancs.jpg|thumb|right|The first convent in Maison-Carr\u00e9e.]] \nThe [[cholera]] epidemic 1867 left a large number of [[Algeria]]n orphans, and the education and Christian instruction of these children was the occasion of the founding of the society in Maison-Carr\u00e9e (now [[El-Harrach]]) near [[Algiers]]; but from its inception the founder had in mind the conversion of the Arabs and the peoples of Central Africa. Lavigerie instructed his missionaries to speak the language of the people, eat the same food, and wear the same clothing. They therefore, adopted the Arabian dress: the [[gandoura]], the Arab cloak and the [[Taqiyah (cap)|chechia]], with as a religious sign a rosary worn around the neck like necklace.<ref name=blanc>[http://peresblancs.org/histoi1a.htm Ceillier, Jean-Claude Ceillier. \"The origins and Presentation of Our Society\", ''Peres Blanc'']</ref> The nickname \"White Fathers\" derives from their garb.  \n\nA novitiate was established in 1868. Missionary posts were established in [[Kabylie]] and in the [[Sahara]]. In 1876 three missionaries on their way to [[Timbuktu]] were killed by desert nomads.<ref name=blanc/> In 1878 ten missionaries left [[Algiers]] to establish posts at Lakes [[Lake Victoria|Victoria]], [[Lake Malawi|Nyassa]] and [[Lake Tanganyika|Tanganyika]].<ref name=Forbes>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15613d.htm Forbes, John. \"White Fathers.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 3 March 2020{{PD-notice}}</ref> In 1878, a caravan of several missionaries arrives at the port of [[Mombasa]], and after a three month trek reach [[Lake Victoria]]. \n\nIn 1880, at the request of the Holy See, the White Fathers established at Jerusalem a [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Greek Melchite]] seminary for the formation of clergy of that rite. In 1894 a mission in [[French Sudan]] (now [[Mali]]) was founded.<ref name=Forbes/>\n\n==Present day==\nThese now form the present Lakes [[Archdiocese]]s of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kampala|Kampala]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Gitega|Gitega]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tabora|Tabora]], and the dioceses of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kigoma|Kigoma]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lilongwe|Lilongwe]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Kalemie-Kirungu|Kalemie-Kirungu]]. \n\nThe society is composed of missionary priests and brothers. The members are bound by an oath engaging them to labour for the conversion of Africa according to the constitutions of their society. The missionaries are not, strictly speaking, a [[religious institute]], whether \"[[Catholic religious order|order]]\" or \"[[Congregation of Papal Right|congregation]]\". Instead, they are a [[society of apostolic life]]. They may retain their own property; but they may expend it in the society only at the direction of the superiors. \n\n==Aims==\nOne of the chief points in the rule is in regard to community life in the missions, each house being obliged to contain at least three members. At the head of the society is a General-Superior, elected every six years by the chapter. He resides in Rome at the Generalate house on Via Aurelia. Those desiring to become priests or brothers are admitted to the [[novitiate]] after their [[Philosophy|philosophical]] studies. After the novitiate they spent two years of missionary training on the field and four years of [[theology]]. This training can be slightly different for brother candidates. The theological studies  are spent in scholasticate presently located in Abidjan ([[Ivory Coast]]), Nairobi ([[Kenya]]), [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale (Devon)]], [[South Africa]] and [[Jerusalem]]. The society admits persons of all nationalities.\n\n==Dress and membership==\nThe habit of the missionaries resembles the white robes of the Algerian Arabs and consists of a [[cassock]] or [[gandoura]], and a [[Mantle (vesture)|mantle]] or [[burnous]]. A [[rosary]] and [[cross]] are worn around the neck in imitation of the [[mesbaha]] of the [[marabout]]s.\n\nThe society depends directly on the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]]. The White Fathers succeeded in establishing small missions among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle Berbers]], there being at present nine hundred and sixty-two Christians; but the regions bordering on the Great Lakes and Sudan show the best results. The number of [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]]s in all the vicariates (as of June 1909) was 135,000; the number preparing for [[baptism]] 151,480. A test of four years is imposed on those desiring to be baptized. To religious instruction the missionaries add lessons in reading and writing, and teach also, in special classes, the tongue of the European nation governing the country, which was mostly French in these areas. The brothers train the young people for trades and agriculture. The number of boys in the schools (June, 1909) was 22,281.[[Image:Cypress Grove House.jpg|thumb|Cypress Grove House, home of the White Fathers in Ireland]]\n\nIn January 2006, the society numbered; 9 bishops, 1,498 priests, 156 brothers; 16 clerics with perpetual oath, and 5 associates. There were 354 students preparing to enter the society.\n\n==Leaders==\n\nUnder the leadership of Archbishop (later Cardinal) [[Charles Lavigerie|Charles-Martial Allemand-Lavigerie]], General Superiors were:<ref name=MafrGCatholic>{{cite web |ref={{harvid|Missionaries of Africa M.

They arrived from what is now called Tanzania in 1891, and established the first mission post called Mwambwe Mwela. They were hierarchically structured with Bishop Joseph Dupont firmly in charge , something that appealed to the Bemba overlords. One of the reasons that bloodshed was avoided was his reconciliation during one of their succession disputes. They settled down successfully in the North of what was then called Northern Rhodesia but did not follow those who migrated to the copper mines and the capital Lusaka during the 1930's. This practice was changed in 1965, after the Second Vatican Council, when a younger group of White Fathers responded to the national requirements of the apostolate. \nAround the beginning of the new millennium their missionary endeavour was taken over, almost entirely, by the local clergy.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:Maison g\u00e9n\u00e9ralice.jpg|thumb|right|General House in Rome]]\n* [[Catholic missions]]\n* [[Burkard Huwiler|Bishop Burkhard Huwiler]]\n* [[Joseph Dupont (bishop)|Bishop Joseph Dupont]]\n* [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church]]\n* [[Kungoni|Mua Mission, Malawi]]\n* [[Catholic youth sports associations of French Algeria]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{CathEncy|wstitle=White Fathers}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://mafrome.org/home/ International Website of the Missionaries of Africa]\n* [http://www.missionariesofafrica.org/ Missionaries of Africa UK]\n* [http://www.mafrwestafrica.net/ Missionaries of Africa in West Africa]\n\n[[Category:White Fathers| ]]\n[[Category:Religious organizations established in 1868]]\n", "name_user": "Jovin Joseph Rwetabula", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fathers"}

He made an immediate impact, creating the assist for Newcastle's equaliser. However, his time on Tyneside was blighted by inconsistency and off-field incidents, and Asprilla was blamed as one of the reasons Newcastle would go on to concede the 1995\u201396 Premier League title to eventual winners Manchester United.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAsprilla's second season for Newcastle ended with the club finishing in second place once again, behind Manchester United. His role was largely reduced to substitute appearances, although he retained his best performances for the club's [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] campaign, scoring five goals. His celebration of the goal he scored against [[FC Metz|Metz]], whereby he removed his shirt and swung it from a corner flag, resulted in Asprilla being given a yellow card, meaning a suspension from Newcastle's next UEFA Cup match against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]].\n\nThe 1997\u201398 season was Asprilla's last for Newcastle. With the sale of striker [[Les Ferdinand]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and a serious injury to [[Alan Shearer]] during the pre-season, Asprilla was preferred as first choice striker alongside the young, inexperienced [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]]. With the club competing in that season's [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], Asprilla [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|scored a hat-trick]] for Newcastle in a 3\u20132 win over [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], which would be his last goals for the club.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGe9OrT53Y \u2013 Highlight of the Newcastle 3\u20132 victory against Barcelona]</ref> By the end of January 1998, with Newcastle struggling in the league and eliminated from the Champions League, Asprilla's time at Newcastle came to an end.

Darlington successfully appealed an initial work permit refusal and had offered around \u00a317,000 per week plus 20% of gate receipts, a car and a rent-free flat. Chairman [[George Reynolds (business)|George Reynolds]] considered they were friends and in fact paraded Asprilla in front of 5,163 fans before Darlington's 2-0 win over [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] on 27 August, believing the intended two-year contract was good as signed. However, it was reported that after Asprilla stalled on taking a medical on 29 August, in the early hours of 30 August, Asprilla caught a flight from Newcastle Airport to the Middle East, apparently to accept a more lucrative contract offer. Reynolds described himself as \"absolutely gutted\" by the snub, complaining Asprilla \"did not even have the decency to say goodbye\" and said he would never talk to him again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/darlington/2222014.stm|title=Asprilla snubs Darlington|accessdate=6 February 2011|work=BBC Sport|date=30 August 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/darlington-left-furious-as-asprilla-flies-away-641529.html|title=Darlington left furious as Asprilla flies away|work=The Independent|date=31 August 2002 | location=London | first=Jim | last=Van Wijk}}</ref> This was the second time Darlington was snubbed by a high-profile ex-Newcastle player that summer, the first being [[Paul Gascoigne]].\n\nThe identity of the Middle East club has never been revealed and whether Asprilla did join them remains a mystery.\n\nThere is no official record of Asprilla playing for another professional team after his departure from Argentine side [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] in 2004.\n\n==International career==\n===Summary===\nAsprilla scored 20 goals in 57 matches for [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] from 1993 to 2001 and played for his country at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]s. Asprilla was expected to be one of the top players of the 1994 tournament, but failed to score a single goal as Colombia was eliminated in the first round.\n\n===1992 Summer Olympics===\nAsprilla was a member of the Colombian team at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]] where the team was eliminated in the first round following losses to Spain (4\u20130) and Egypt (3\u20134) and a draw with Qatar (1\u20131).\n\n===1993 Copa America===\nIn the [[1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Ecuador, Colombia finished third overall. After topping Group C with a 2\u20131 win over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and draws with [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (1\u20131) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (1\u20131), Colombia defeated [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 1\u20131 (5\u20133 on penalties) before losing 0\u20130 (6\u20135 on penalties) to Argentina in the semi-final, the eventual tournament winners. In the match for third place, Colombia defeated hosts [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] 1\u20130 to claim third place. Asprilla did not score in the tournament.\n\n===1994 FIFA World Cup===\nAsprilla was part of the Colombian team which demolished Argentina 5\u20130 in a World Cup Qualifier match in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1993, where Asprilla scored twice. Colombia finished undefeated in the South American qualifying group. Entering the 1994 World Cup, there were high expectations for Colombia as a dark horse favourite to win the tournament with a squad that included such notable players as [[Carlos Valderrama]], [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]] and Asprilla. However, with one win and two losses, Colombia finished at the bottom of their group and was eliminated after the first round. Asprilla himself had a disappointing tournament, failing to score, and even walked out on his teammates midway through the group stage.\n\n===1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nIn the [[1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held and won by Uruguay, Colombia again finished third. Colombia started out by finishing third in Group B with a 1\u20131 draw with [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (Asprilla scored the goal), a 1\u20130 win over Ecuador and a 0\u20133 loss to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. The nation then went on to defeat [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] 5\u20134 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw in the quarter-finals before losing to Uruguay 2\u20130 in the semi-final. In the third place match, Colombia faced the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], which Colombia easily defeated 4\u20131 with Asprilla scoring one of the Colombians' four goals in the match.\n\n===1998 FIFA World Cup===\nIn the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], held in France, expectations were again high for Colombia and Asprilla remained in the team. However, again Colombia was eliminated in the first round following one win and two losses. Asprilla was dismissed from the team after complaining to reporters about the head coach's decision to substitute him near the end of Colombia's opening loss against [[Romania national football team|Romania]].\n\nIn 2001, at age 32, Asprilla retired from international football.\n\n==Retirement==\nIn July 2009, Asprilla officially retired from top flight football following a retirement match in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. Although this marks his official retirement date, he had not been actively employed by a professional side in around five years.\n\nIn 2008, he was arrested for allegedly firing a machine gun at security forces near his farm in Colombia. He was placed under house arrest on charges of weapons possession and criminal damage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1029888/Newcastle-legend-Asprilla-arrested-peppering-defence-shots--using-machine-gun.html |title=Newcastle legend Asprilla arrested after peppering the defence with shots - using a machine gun|accessdate=6 February 2011|newspaper=Mail Online| location=London| author=Sportsmail Reporter| date=27 June 2008}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}} He has appeared in various Colombian Reality Shows, such as ''Desafio'' 2005 and ''Nomadas''.\n\nHe made a return to St James' Park on 22 January 2011 appearing on the pitch at half time during Newcastle United's Premier League home match against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and attended a charity dinner in [[Gateshead]] that evening, alongside Les Ferdinand and [[Peter Beardsley]], where he spoke of his affection for the Newcastle fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/01/22/faustino-asprilla-entertains-at-charity-event-72703-28035497/|title=Faustino Asprilla entertains at charity event|publisher=ChronicleLive, the Evening Chronicle newspaper online|date=22 January 2011 | location=North East | first=James | last=Moore}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, Asprilla was linked with a return to his former club Newcastle. Asprilla spoke of performing a coaching role with the youth squad as well as developing a special role in introducing young talent into the academy from his homeland Colombia. His intention is to give Colombians a chance to showcase their skills in European/English football, based on the sheer amount of talent that has come from Colombia in recent years.\n\nAsprilla played in former ''Magpies'' goalkeeper [[Steve Harper]]'s testimonial match on 11 September 2013 against [[A.C. Milan|A.C. Milan Glorie]]. He had a header disallowed for offside before the Italians won 2\u20131 on penalties.<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/steve-harper-testimonial-newcastle-milan-2267895</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, it was revealed Asprilla was preparing to launch a range of flavoured condoms in Colombia.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/25/faustino-asprilla-launch-line-condoms-colombia-guava-flavour</ref>\n\nAsprilla revealed in 2019 that a hitman wanted to murder Paraguay goalkeeper [[Jose Luis Chilavert]] after both were sent off during a [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier.<ref>https://www.thedailyawaaz.com/news/sports/839</ref>\n\n==Career

Thirty-five goals in seventy-eight games brought him to the attention to several Italian clubs who bid for him, with [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] winning the race to sign him for US$10.9 million in 1992.\n\n===Parma===\nIn [[1992\u201393 Serie A|his first season at Parma]], Asprilla scored some important goals, including a 27-yard second-half free-kick which helped Parma defeat [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] 1\u20130, ending [[1991\u201392 Serie A|the Italian champions']] unbeaten streak at 58 matches.<ref name=\"ESPN\">{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story/_/id/1031419/the-mavericks:-faustino-asprilla?cc=3436|title=The Mavericks: Faustino Asprilla|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=8 March 2012}}</ref> It was at Parma Asprilla arguably enjoyed his greatest club success. Asprilla was part of the Parma squad which won its first international tournament, the [[1992\u201393 European Cup Winners' Cup]], scoring four goals in eight matches. It was his brace in Spain that rallied the Italian team to a 2\u20131 victory over [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]] in the semi-final. However, an injury meant he was an unused substitute as Parma defeated Belgian club [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]] 3\u20131 in [[1993 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|the final]].<ref name=\"ESPN\" />\n\nIn early 1994, Asprilla was part of the Parma side which defeated Milan 0\u20132 at the [[San Siro]] to overturn a 0\u20131 first leg deficit and claim the [[1993 European Super Cup]].\n\nAlso in [[1993\u201394 Serie A|the 1993\u201394 season]], Parma reached a second [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] [[1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|final]]. However, a 0\u20131 defeat to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] meant they would not retain their trophy.\n\nIn [[1994\u201395 Serie A|1994\u201395]], Parma again reached the final of a major European competition as they faced Italian compatriots [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in the [[1995 UEFA Cup Final|final]] of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. Asprilla was instrumental in Parma's run to the final, with three goals over two legs in the semi-final against [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-italy-2-germany-0-1616278.html|title=Italy 2 Germany 0|newspaper=The Independent|date=19 April 1995}}</ref> In the final itself, Asprilla was in the starting XI for both legs as Parma defeated Juventus 2\u20131 on aggregate.\n\nAt the start of the [[1995\u201396 Serie A|1995\u201396 season]], Asprilla found himself out of head coach [[Nevio Scala]]'s plans.

At the time, Newcastle were ahead of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1995\u201396 FA Premier League|Premier League]], although their lead at the top of the table was narrowing. Asprilla's arrival on [[Tyneside]] came just months after earlier media reports of a move to England, with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] being linked with his signature.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/that-was-the-season-that-was-1345862.html]</ref>\n\nAsprilla made his league debut in Newcastle's 2\u20131 win over [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] at the [[Riverside Stadium]], coming on as a second-half substitute with the score 1\u20130 in Middlesbrough's favour. He made an immediate impact, creating the assist for Newcastle's equaliser. However, his time on Tyneside was blighted by inconsistency and off-field incidents, and Asprilla was blamed as one of the reasons Newcastle would go on to concede the 1995\u201396 Premier League title to eventual winners Manchester United.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAsprilla's second season for Newcastle ended with the club finishing in second place once again, behind Manchester United. His role was largely reduced to substitute appearances, although he retained his best performances for the club's [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] campaign, scoring five goals. His celebration of the goal he scored against [[FC Metz|Metz]], whereby he removed his shirt and swung it from a corner flag, resulted in Asprilla being given a yellow card, meaning a suspension from Newcastle's next UEFA Cup match against [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]].\n\nThe 1997\u201398 season was Asprilla's last for Newcastle. With the sale of striker [[Les Ferdinand]] to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and a serious injury to [[Alan Shearer]] during the pre-season, Asprilla was preferred as first choice striker alongside the young, inexperienced [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]]. With the club competing in that season's [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], Asprilla [[List of UEFA Champions League hat-tricks|scored a hat-trick]] for Newcastle in a 3\u20132 win over [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], which would be his last goals for the club.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPGe9OrT53Y \u2013 Highlight of the Newcastle 3\u20132 victory against Barcelona]</ref> By the end of January 1998, with Newcastle struggling in the league and eliminated from the Champions League, Asprilla's time at Newcastle came to an end. He was sold back to Parma for \u00a36&nbsp;million, having scored a total of 9 goals in 48 Premier League appearances and 9 goals in 11 European matches.\n\n===Return to Parma===\nIn his second spell at Parma, Asprilla won his second UEFA Cup, coming on as a substitute as Parma defeated [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in the [[1999 UEFA Cup Final|final]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-parma-seize-blancs-gift-1093340.html\n|title=Football: Parma seize Blanc's gift\n|newspaper=The Independent\n|date=12 May 1999 |accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Palmeiras===\nAsprilla played in the successful Palmeiras team in the 1999 and 2000 seasons.\n\n*[[Torneio Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo|Rio-S\u00e3o Paulo Tournament]] winner: 2000\n*[[Copa dos Campe\u00f5es|Brazilian Champions Cup]] winner: 2000\n\n===Later career and Darlington link===\nAlthough his brief time with Palmeiras saw the team achieve success, for Asprilla personally his time there marked the beginning of a pattern of short, relatively unproductive stays with various clubs across various countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Argentina.\n\nDuring a time which was generally low-key, he appeared in the public eye again in 2002 amid reports he had been approached by English [[Football League Third Division|Division Three]] side [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]]. Darlington successfully appealed an initial work permit refusal and had offered around \u00a317,000 per week plus 20% of gate receipts, a car and a rent-free flat. Chairman [[George Reynolds (business)|George Reynolds]] considered they were friends and in fact paraded Asprilla in front of 5,163 fans before Darlington's 2-0 win over [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] on 27 August, believing the intended two-year contract was good as signed. However, it was reported that after Asprilla stalled on taking a medical on 29 August, in the early hours of 30 August, Asprilla caught a flight from Newcastle Airport to the Middle East, apparently to accept a more lucrative contract offer. Reynolds described himself as \"absolutely gutted\" by the snub, complaining Asprilla \"did not even have the decency to say goodbye\" and said he would never talk to him again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/darlington/2222014.stm|title=Asprilla snubs Darlington|accessdate=2011-02-06|work=BBC Sport|date=30 August 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/football-league/darlington-left-furious-as-asprilla-flies-away-641529.html|title=Darlington left furious as Asprilla flies away|work=The Independent|date=31 August 2002 | location=London | first=Jim | last=Van Wijk}}</ref> This was the second time Darlington was snubbed by a high-profile ex-Newcastle player that summer, the first being [[Paul Gascoigne]].\n\nThe identity of the Middle East club has never been revealed and whether Asprilla did join them remains a mystery.\n\nThere is no official record of Asprilla playing for another professional team after his departure from Argentine side [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] in 2004.\n\n==International career==\n===Summary===\nAsprilla scored 20 goals in 57 matches for [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] from 1993 to 2001 and played for his country at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]s. Asprilla was expected to be one of the top players of the 1994 tournament, but failed to score a single goal as Colombia was eliminated in the first round.\n\n===1992 Summer Olympics===\nAsprilla was a member of the Colombian team at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]] where the team was eliminated in the first round following losses to Spain (4\u20130) and Egypt (3\u20134) and a draw with Qatar (1\u20131).\n\n===1993 Copa America===\nIn the [[1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held in Ecuador, Colombia finished third overall. After topping Group C with a 2\u20131 win over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and draws with [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] (1\u20131) and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] (1\u20131), Colombia defeated [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 1\u20131 (5\u20133 on penalties) before losing 0\u20130 (6\u20135 on penalties) to Argentina in the semi-final, the eventual tournament winners. In the match for third place, Colombia defeated hosts [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]] 1\u20130 to claim third place. Asprilla did not score in the tournament.\n\n===1994 FIFA World Cup===\nAsprilla was part of the Colombian team which demolished Argentina 5\u20130 in a World Cup Qualifier match in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1993, where Asprilla scored twice. Colombia finished undefeated in the South American qualifying group. Entering the 1994 World Cup, there were high expectations for Colombia as a dark horse favourite to win the tournament with a squad that included such notable players as [[Carlos Valderrama]], [[Freddy Rinc\u00f3n]] and Asprilla. However, with one win and two losses, Colombia finished at the bottom of their group and was eliminated after the first round. Asprilla himself had a disappointing tournament, failing to score, and even walked out on his teammates midway through the group stage.\n\n===1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nIn the [[1995 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], held and won by Uruguay, Colombia again finished third. Colombia started out by finishing third in Group B with a 1\u20131 draw with [[Peru national football team|Peru]] (Asprilla scored the goal), a 1\u20130 win over Ecuador and a 0\u20133 loss to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. The nation then went on to defeat [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] 5\u20134 on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw in the quarter-finals before losing to Uruguay 2\u20130 in the semi-final. In the third place match, Colombia faced the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], which Colombia easily defeated 4\u20131 with Asprilla scoring one of the Colombians' four goals in the match.\n\n===1998 FIFA World Cup===\nIn the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], held in France, expectations were again high for Colombia and Asprilla remained in the team. However, again Colombia was eliminated in the first round following one win and two losses. Asprilla was dismissed from the team after complaining to reporters about the head coach's decision to substitute him near the end of Colombia's opening loss against [[Romania national football team|Romania]].\n\nIn 2001, at age 32, Asprilla retired from international football.\n\n==Retirement==\nIn July 2009, Asprilla officially retired from top flight football following a retirement match in Medell\u00edn, Colombia. Although this marks his official retirement date, he had not been actively employed by a professional side in around five years.\n\nIn 2008, he was arrested for allegedly firing a machine gun at security forces near his farm in Colombia. He was placed under house arrest on charges of weapons possession and criminal damage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1029888/Newcastle-legend-Asprilla-arrested-peppering-defence-shots--using-machine-gun.html |title=Newcastle legend Asprilla arrested after peppering the defence with shots - using a machine gun|accessdate=2011-02-06|newspaper=Mail Online| location=London| author=Sportsmail Reporter| date=27 June 2008}}</ref>{{deprecated inline|certain=yes|date=November 2019}} He has appeared in various Colombian Reality Shows, such as ''Desafio'' 2005 and ''Nomadas''.\n\nHe made a return to St James' Park on 22 January 2011 appearing on the pitch at half time during Newcastle United's Premier League home match against [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and attended a charity dinner in [[Gateshead]] that evening, alongside Les Ferdinand and [[Peter Beardsley]], where he spoke of his affection for the Newcastle fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/north-east-news/evening-chronicle-news/2011/01/22/faustino-asprilla-entertains-at-charity-event-72703-28035497/|title=Faustino Asprilla entertains at charity event|publisher=ChronicleLive, the Evening Chronicle newspaper online|date=22 January 2011 | location=North East | first=James | last=Moore}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2013, Asprilla was linked with a return to his former club Newcastle. Asprilla spoke of performing a coaching role with the youth squad as well as developing a special role in introducing young talent into the academy from his homeland Colombia. His intention is to give Colombians a chance to showcase their skills in European/English football, based on the sheer amount of talent that has come from Colombia in recent years.\n\nAsprilla played in former ''Magpies'' goalkeeper [[Steve Harper]]'s testimonial match on 11 September 2013 against [[A.C. Milan|A.C. Milan Glorie]]. He had a header disallowed for offside before the Italians won 2\u20131 on penalties.<ref>https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/steve-harper-testimonial-newcastle-milan-2267895</ref>\n\nIn
