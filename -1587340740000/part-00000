A gradual trend towards increasing social liberalism in the Democratic Party, however, has turned the state (apart from Hispanic [[South Texas]], the [[Trans-Pecos]] and several large cities) into a Republican stronghold.

It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of the [[genus]] '''''Dicerorhinus'''''. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands {{convert|112|-|145|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of {{convert|2.36|-|3.18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a tail of {{convert|35|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The weight is reported to range from {{convert|500|to|1000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, averaging {{convert|700|-|800|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, although there is a single record of a {{convert|2000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.\n\nMembers of the species once inhabited [[rainforests]], [[swamp]]s, and [[cloud forest]]s in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China.

It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking [[soil]] with its feet, twisting [[sapling]]s into patterns, and leaving excrement.

No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting.

The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the [[rainy season]], they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/> When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from [[ectoparasite]]s and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, [[suppuration]]s, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80\u2013300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.<ref name=Wallows>{{cite journal| title = Wallows and Wallow Utilization of the Sumatran Rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis'') in a Natural Enclosure in Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia | year = 2001 | journal = Journal of Wildlife and Parks | volume = 19 | pages = 7\u201312 | last = Julia Ng | first = S.C. |author2=Z.

The eep, a short, one-second-long yelp, is the most common sound. The whale, named for its similarity to [[Whale sound|vocalizations]] of the [[humpback whale]], is the most song-like vocalization and the second-most common. The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds. The whistle-blow is named because it consists of a two-second-long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession. The whistle-blow is the loudest of the vocalizations, loud enough to make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate. The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown, though they are theorized to convey danger, sexual readiness, and location, as do other ungulate vocalizations. The whistle-blow could be heard at a great distance, even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives.

The [[gestation period]] is around 15\u201316 months. The calf, which typically weighs {{convert|40|\u2013|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/>\n\nThe reproductive habits of the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, [[urination]], and increased physical contact, with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the [[black rhinoceros]]. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.<ref name=ZZ2005>{{cite journal |last1=Zainal Zahari |first1=Z. |last2=Rosnina |first2=Y. |last3=Wahid |first3=H. |last4=Yap |first4=K.

In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.<ref name=LitStud/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Commons|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Mammals}}\n*[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/species/sumatran-rhino/ Sumatran Rhino Info] & [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=imgs&CODE=tax_images&taxon=8 Sumatran Rhino Pictures] on the [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com Rhino Resource Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111180859/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis/ Sumatran Rhino] at [[Arkive]].\n*[http://www.rhinoandforestfund.org Rhino and Forest Fund]\n*[http://www.borneorhinoalliance.org Borneo Rhino Alliance]\n*[http://www.michielhegener.nl/maps/Sumatraanse-neushoorn-def.pdf distribution map 2017]\n*[https://savesumatranrhinos.org/#reverseDecline Map by The National Geographic, 2018]\n\n{{Perissodactyla}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29220}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Sumatra|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Borneo|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of India|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Indonesia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Malaysia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1814]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered fauna of Asia]]\n[[Category:EDGE species|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Miocene mammals]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Hairy rhinoceros|the extinct megafauna|woolly rhinoceros}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Endangered species of small Asian rhinoceros}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date = November 2019}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Sumatran rhinoceros<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Perissodactyla |id=14100054 |page=635}}</ref>\n| fossil_range = {{Fossilrange|Early Pleistocene|Recent}}\n| image = Sumatran Rhinoceros at Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary Lampung Indonesia 2013.JPG\n| image_caption = Sumatran rhinoceros at Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Lampung, Indonesia\n| status = CR\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=IUCN/>\n| status2 = CITES_A1\n| status2_system = CITES\n| status2_ref = <ref>''[https://cites.org/eng/node/21233 Dicerorhinus sumatrensis]'' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</ref>\n| genus = Dicerorhinus\n| species = sumatrensis\n| authority = ([[Johann Fischer von Waldheim|Fischer]], 1814)<ref name=Taxhistory/>\n<imagemap>\nimage:Sumatran Rhinoceros Range.svg.png|250px|Sumatran rhino range \ncircle 320 510 12 [[Taman Negara National Park]]\ncircle 595 505 12 [[Tabin Wildlife Reserve]]\ncircle 250 550 12 [[Gunung Leuser National Park]]\ncircle 315 660 12 [[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]\ncircle 355 712 12 [[Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park]]\ncircle 375 700 12 [[Way Kambas National Park]]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n<center><small>\nSumatran rhinoceros range (excluding population in [[East Kalimantan]]) <ref>Derived from range maps in:\n* {{cite book | last = Foose | first = Thomas J. and [[van Strien, Nico]] | year = 1997 | title = Asian Rhinos \u2013 Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan | publisher = [[IUCN]], Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK | isbn = 2-8317-0336-0}}<br>and\n* {{cite book | title = The Return of the Unicorns; The Natural History and Conservation of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros | last = Dinerstein | first = Eric | publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-231-08450-1 }}<br>This map does not include unconfirmed historical sightings in Laos and Vietnam or possible remaining populations in Burma.</ref></small></center>\n| subdivision_ranks = Subspecies\n| subdivision = *''[[D. s. harrissoni]]'' <small>Groves, 1965</small>\n*''D. s. sumatrensis'' <small>Fischer, 1814</small>\n*''D. s. lasiotis'' <small>Buckland, 1872</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''Sumatran rhinoceros''', also known as the '''hairy rhinoceros''' or '''Asian two-horned rhinoceros''' (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis''), is a rare member of the family [[Rhinocerotidae]] and one of five extant species of [[rhinoceros]]. It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of the [[genus]] '''''Dicerorhinus'''''. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands {{convert|112|-|145|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of {{convert|2.36|-|3.18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a tail of {{convert|35|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The weight is reported to range from {{convert|500|to|1000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, averaging {{convert|700|-|800|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, although there is a single record of a {{convert|2000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.\n\nMembers of the species once inhabited [[rainforests]], [[swamp]]s, and [[cloud forest]]s in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China.

It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking [[soil]] with its feet, twisting [[sapling]]s into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive [[Javan rhinoceros]], in part because of a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species.

One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food.

[[Tiger]]s and wild [[dog]]s may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, and the frequency of such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with [[Asian Elephant|elephants]] and [[Malayan Tapir|tapirs]], the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (''Elephas maximus'') and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and wild dogs will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/><ref name=Borner/>\n\nThe Sumatran rhino maintains trails across its range. These trails fall into two types. Main trails will be used by generations of rhinos to travel between important areas in the rhino's range, such as between [[salt lick]]s, or in [[Wildlife corridor|corridors]] through inhospitable terrain that separates ranges. In feeding areas, the rhinos will make smaller trails, still covered by vegetation, to areas containing food the rhino eats. Sumatran rhino trails have been found that cross rivers deeper than {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and about {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. The currents of these rivers are known to be strong, but the rhino is a strong swimmer.<ref name=Groves1972/><ref name=LitStud/> A relative absence of wallows near rivers in the range of the Sumatran rhinoceros indicates they may occasionally bathe in rivers in lieu of wallowing.<ref name=Borner/>\n\n=== Diet ===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0; font-size:90%; width:150px;\"\n|-\n|[[File:MallotesPhilipensis.jpg|100x100px]]\n|[[File:Garcinia mangostana fruit1.jpg|100x100px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Eugenia1.jpg|100x100px]]\n|[[File:Ardisia crenata6.jpg|100x100px]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:150px;\"|Clockwise from top left: ''[[Mallotus philippensis|Mallotus]]'', [[mangosteen]]s, ''[[Ardisia]]'', and ''[[Eugenia]]''.<ref name=Borner/><ref name=Biotropica/>\n|}\nMost feeding occurs just before nightfall and in the morning.

The eep, a short, one-second-long yelp, is the most common sound. The whale, named for its similarity to [[Whale sound|vocalizations]] of the [[humpback whale]], is the most song-like vocalization and the second-most common. The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds. The whistle-blow is named because it consists of a two-second-long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession. The whistle-blow is the loudest of the vocalizations, loud enough to make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate. The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown, though they are theorized to convey danger, sexual readiness, and location, as do other ungulate vocalizations. The whistle-blow could be heard at a great distance, even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives.

The [[gestation period]] is around 15\u201316 months. The calf, which typically weighs {{convert|40|\u2013|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/>\n\nThe reproductive habits of the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, [[urination]], and increased physical contact, with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the [[black rhinoceros]]. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.<ref name=ZZ2005>{{cite journal |last1=Zainal Zahari |first1=Z. |last2=Rosnina |first2=Y. |last3=Wahid |first3=H. |last4=Yap |first4=K.

Proponents argue that the zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group.<ref>Nardelli F. 2016.

Recently, however, video footage of the Sumatran rhinoceros in its native habitat and in breeding centers has been featured in several nature documentaries. Extensive footage can be found in an Asia Geographic documentary ''The Littlest Rhino''. [[Natural History New Zealand]] showed footage of a Sumatran rhino, shot by freelance Indonesian-based cameraman Alain Compost, in the 2001 documentary ''The Forgotten Rhino'', which featured mainly Javan and Indian rhinos.<ref name=AG>{{cite web |title=The Littlest Rhino |work=Asia Geographic |url=http://www.asiageographic.com/html/lilrhino.htm |accessdate=6 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009210441/http://www.asiageographic.com/html/lilrhino.htm |archivedate=9 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Forgotten Rhino |work=[[NHNZ]] |url=http://www.nhnz.tv/cat/forgottenrhino.html |accessdate=6 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001224056/http://www.nhnz.tv/cat/forgottenrhino.html |archivedate=1 October 2006  }}</ref>\n\nThough they were documented by droppings and tracks, pictures of the Bornean rhinoceros were first taken and widely distributed by modern conservationists in April 2006, when camera traps photographed a healthy adult in the jungles of Sabah in [[Malaysian Borneo]].<ref name=NST7-2>{{cite news | work = [[New Straits Times]] (Malaysia) | date = 2 July 2006 | title = Rhinos alive and well in the final frontier }}</ref> On 24 April 2007, it was announced that cameras had captured the first-ever video footage of a wild Bornean rhino.

In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.<ref name=LitStud/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Commons|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Mammals}}\n*[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/species/sumatran-rhino/ Sumatran Rhino Info] & [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=imgs&CODE=tax_images&taxon=8 Sumatran Rhino Pictures] on the [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com Rhino Resource Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111180859/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis/ Sumatran Rhino] at [[Arkive]].\n*[http://www.rhinoandforestfund.org Rhino and Forest Fund]\n*[http://www.borneorhinoalliance.org Borneo Rhino Alliance]\n*[http://www.michielhegener.nl/maps/Sumatraanse-neushoorn-def.pdf distribution map 2017]\n*[https://savesumatranrhinos.org/#reverseDecline Map by The National Geographic, 2018]\n\n{{Perissodactyla}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29220}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Sumatra|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Borneo|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of India|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Indonesia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Malaysia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1814]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered fauna of Asia]]\n[[Category:EDGE species|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Miocene mammals]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n", "name_user": "AuH2ORepublican", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_rhinoceros"}
