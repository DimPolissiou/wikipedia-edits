The [[Monpa people|Monpa]] and [[Sherdukpen]] keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul, which flourished between 500 B.C. and 600 A.D. The remaining parts of the state, especially Southern and those bordering [[Myanmar]], were under the control of the [[Chutiya Kingdom|Chutiya Kings]].\n\nRecent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples, such as the 14th century Malinithan at the foot of the Siang hills in [[West Siang]], indicate they were built during the [[Chutiya]] reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar (built in 8th century), has led to suggestions that the Chutiya people had an advanced culture and administration. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old [[Tawang Monastery]] in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth [[Dalai Lama]] [[Tsangyang Gyatso, 6th Dalai Lama|Tsangyang Gyatso]] was born in [[Tawang Town|Tawang]].\n\nThe main archaeological sites of the state include:<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Baruah\n  | first = Dr. Swarnalata \n  | title = Chutia Jaatir Buranji\n  | year = 2004\n  | publisher = Banalata Publications\n  | location = Guwahati \n  | isbn = }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Among the crops grown here are rice, maize, millet, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, ginger, and oilseeds. Arunachal is also ideal for horticulture and fruit orchards.

In between there are transition zones, such as the [[Aka (tribe)|Aka]]/[[Hruso people|Hruso]]/[[Miji people|Miji]]/[[Sherdukpen]] area, which provides a \"buffer\" of sorts between the Tibetan Buddhist tribes and the animist [[Tani (tribes)|Tani hill tribes]]. In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state, such as the Sulung.\n\nWithin each of these cultural spheres, one finds populations of related tribes speaking related languages and sharing similar traditions. In the Tibetic area, one finds large numbers of [[Monpa people|Monpa]] tribespeople, with several subtribes speaking closely related but mutually incomprehensible languages, and also large numbers of Tibetan refugees. Within the [[Tani people|Tani]] area, major tribes include the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]]. [[Apatani people|Apatani]] also live among the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]], but are distinct. In the centre, one finds predominantly [[Galo people]], with the major sub-groups of Karka, Lodu, Bogum, Lare and Pugo among others, extending to the Ramo and Pailibo areas (which are close in many ways to Galo). In the east, one finds the [[Adi people|Adi]] with many subtribes including [[Padam tribe|Padam]], Pasi, [[Minyong]] and [[Bokar language|Bokar]], among others. [[Milang tribe|Milang]], while also falling within the general \"Adi\" sphere, are in many ways quite distinct. Moving east, the [[Idu Mishmi language|Idu]], [[Miju Mishmi tribe|Miju]] and [[Digaro Mishmi language|Digaru]] make up the \"[[Mishmi people|Mishmi]]\" cultural-linguistic area, which may or may not form a coherent historical grouping.\n\nMoving southeast, the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] [[Khamti people|Khamti]] are linguistically distinct from their neighbours and culturally distinct from the majority of other Arunachalese tribes. They follow the [[Theravada]] sect of Buddhism.  They also exhibit considerable convergence with the [[Singpho people|Singpho]] and [[Tangsa]] Naga tribes of the same area, all of which are also found in Burma. The Khamptis and Singphos have a huge demographic presence even in the neighbouring state of Assam, in places viz. [[Naharkatiya]], [[Narayanpur, Assam|Narayanpur]] of Lakhimpur districts of Assam. They one of the most recent people group migrated to Arunachal region from Burma and Assam. The [[Nocte language|Nocte]] Naga and [[Wancho language|Wancho]] Naga are another two major ethnic tribes. Both the tribes exhibit very much cultural similarities. Finally the [[Deori people|Deori]] tribe is also a major community in the state, with their own distinctive identity. They are the descendants of the priestly class of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia people]] who were allowed to continue their livelihood after the defeat of the Chutias. Deoris are one of the only Arunachal tribe in the historical records-which shows they are among the first ethnic groups to inhabit the Himalayas of the districts of Dibang Valley and Lohit, before the arrival of other many tribes in the region between 1600 and 1900.\n\n[[File:BuddhaTwang.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Buddhism]] is practised by 13% of the population.

Boundaries between languages very often correlate with tribal divisions\u2014for example, the [[Apatani people|Apatani]] and [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]] are tribally and linguistically distinct\u2014but shifts in tribal identity and alignment over time have also ensured that a certain amount of complication enters into the picture\u2014for example, the [[Galo language]] is and has seemingly always been linguistically distinct from [[Adi language|Adi]], whereas the earlier tribal alignment of Galo with Adi (i.e., \"Adi Gallong\") has only recently been essentially dissolved.\n\nThe vast majority of languages indigenous to modern-day Arunachal Pradesh belong to the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman family]]. The majority of these in turn belong to a single branch of Tibeto-Burman, namely Abo-Tani language. Almost all [[Tani languages]] are indigenous to central Arunachal Pradesh, including (moving from west to east) the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]], the [[Apatani people|Apatani]], the [[Tagin people|Tagin]], the [[Galo people|Galo]], the [[Bokar language|Bokar]], the [[Adi people|Adi]], the [[Padam people|Padam]], the [[Pasi people|Pasi]], and the [[Minyong people|Minyong]]. The Tani languages are noticeably characterised by an overall relative uniformity, suggesting relatively recent origin and dispersal within their present-day area of concentration. Most of the [[Tani languages|Tani]] languages are mutually intelligible with at least one other Tani language, meaning that the area constitutes a [[dialect chain]], as was once found in much of Europe; only [[Apatani language|Apatani]] and [[Milang language|Milang]] stand out as relatively unusual in the Tani context. Tani languages are among the better-studied languages of the region.\n\nTo the east of the Tani area lie three virtually undescribed and highly endangered languages of the \"[[Mishmic languages|Mishmi]]\" group of Tibeto-Burman: [[Idu Mishmi language|Idu]], [[Digaro Mishmi language|Digaru]] and [[Miju Mishmi tribe|Miju]]. A number of speakers of these languages are also found in [[Tibet]]. The relationships of these languages, both amongst one another and to other area languages, are as yet uncertain. Further south, one finds the [[Jingpho language|Singpho (Kachin) language]], which is primarily spoken by large populations in [[Myanmar]]'s [[Kachin State]], and the [[Nocte language|Nocte]] and [[Wancho language]]s, which show affiliations to certain [[Naga languages]] spoken to the south in modern-day [[Nagaland]].\n\nTo the west and north of the Tani area are found at least one and possibly as many as four [[Bodic languages]], including [[Dakpa language|Dakpa]] and [[Tshangla language]]; within modern-day India, these languages go by the cognate but, in usage, distinct designations [[Monpa language|Monpa]] and [[Memba]]. Most speakers of these languages or closely related Bodic languages are found in neighbouring [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]], and Monpa and Memba populations remain closely adjacent to these border regions.\n\nBetween the Bodic and Tani areas lie many almost completely undescribed and unclassified languages, which, speculatively considered Tibeto-Burman, exhibit many unique structural and lexical properties that probably reflect both a long history in the region and a complex history of language contact with neighbouring populations. Among them are [[Sherdukpen]], [[Bugun]], [[Aka (tribe)|Aka]]/[[Hruso languages|Hruso]], [[Koro language (India)|Koro]], [[Miji language|Miji]], [[Bangru language (Arunachal Pradesh)|Bangru]] and [[Puroik language|Puroik]]/[[Sulung]]. The high linguistic significance these languages is belied by the extreme paucity of documentation and description of them, even in view of their highly endangered status. Puroik, in particular, is perhaps one of the most culturally and linguistically unique and significant populations in all of Asia from proto-historical and anthropological-linguistic perspectives, and yet virtually no information of any real reliability regarding their culture or language can be found in print.\n\nFinally, other than the Bodic and Tani groups, there are also certain migratory languages which are largely spoken by migratory and central government employees serving in the state in different departments and institutions in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh. They are classified as Non-Tribal as per the provisions of the [[Constitution of India]].\n\nOutside of Tibeto-Burman, one finds in Arunachal Pradesh a single representative of the [[Tai languages|Tai family]], spoken by [[Khamti people|Tai Khamti tribe]], which is closely affiliated to the [[Shan language]] of [[Myanmar]]'s [[Shan State]]. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern [[Myanmar]].\n\nIn addition to these non-[[Indo-European languages]], the Indo-European languages [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[English language|English]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and especially [[Hindi]] are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily as a result of the primary education system\u2014in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking immigrant teachers from [[Bihar]] and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-[[Creolization|creolised]] variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scroll.in/article/675419/how-hindi-became-the-language-of-choice-in-arunachal-pradesh |title=How Hindi became the language of choice in Arunachal Pradesh |access-date=18 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211120138/http://scroll.in/article/675419/how-hindi-became-the-language-of-choice-in-arunachal-pradesh |archive-date=11 December 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Despite, or perhaps because of, the linguistic diversity of the region, [[English language|English]] is the only official language recognised in the state.\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Air ===\n[[Itanagar Airport]], a [[Greenfield project]] serving Itanagar is being planned at Holongi at a cost of Rs. 6.50&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news|title=PMO ends tussle between AAI and Arunachal |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article3696836.ece |accessdate=4 August 2012 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=28 July 2012 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730222350/http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article3696836.ece |archivedate=30 July 2012 }}</ref> [[Alliance Air (India)|Alliance Air]] operates the only scheduled flights to the state flying from [[Kolkata]] via [[Guwahati]] to [[Pasighat Airport]].

College, Bomdila (Grade B), Donyi Polo Govt. College, Kamki (Grade B), and Rang Frah Govt. College, Changeling (Grade C).\n\nThere are also trust institutes, like Pali Vidyapith, run by Buddhists. They teach Pali and [[Khamti language|Khamti]] scripts in addition to typical education subjects. [[Khamti people|Khamti]] is the only tribe in Arunachal Pradesh that has its own script. Libraries of scriptures are in a number of places in [[Lohit district]], the largest one being in [[Chowkham]].\n\nThe state has two polytechnic institutes: Rajiv Gandhi Government Polytechnic in Itanagar established in 2002 and Tomi Polytechnic College in Basar established in 2006. There is one law college called Arunachal Law Academy at Itanagar. The College of Horticulture and Forestry is affiliated to the [[Central Agricultural University]], [[Imphal]].\n\n== State symbols ==\n\n{{see also|List of symbols of Indian states and territories}}\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\"  style=\"margin:0.2em;\"\n\n|-\n|-\n| '''Emblem''' \n| [[Emblem of Arunachal Pradesh]] || [[File:..Arunachal Pradesh Flag(INDIA).png|50px]]\n|-\n| '''Animal'''\n| Mithun (''[[Bos frontalis]]'') || [[File:Wild Bos frontalis Upparabeeranahalli.jpg|50px]]\n|-\n| '''Bird'''\n| Hornbill (''[[Buceros bicornis]]'') || [[File:Great-Hornbill.jpg|50px]]\n|-\n| '''Flower'''\n| Foxtail orchid (''[[Rhynchostylis retusa]]'') || [[File:Rhynchostylis retusa.JPG|50px]]\n|-\n| '''Tree'''\n| [[Hollong]] (''Dipterocarpus macrocarpus'')<ref name=\"State Symbols of Arunachal Pradesh\">{{Cite web |url=http://knowindia.gov.in/national-identity-elements/states-ut-symbol.php |title=Arunachal Pradesh Symbols |website=knowindia.gov.in |access-date=19 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171127114512/http://knowindia.gov.in/national-identity-elements/states-ut-symbol.php |archive-date=27 November 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> || [[File:Dipterocarpus macrocarpus Hollong young leafIMG 1920 05.jpg|50px]]\n|-\n\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|India}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Cuisine of Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* [[Religion in Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* [[Tani people]]\n* [[List of people from Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* [[List of institutions of higher education in Arunachal Pradesh]]\n* [[Ministry for Development of North Eastern Region]]\n* [[Sino-Indian border dispute]]\n** [[South Tibet]]\n** [[McMahon Line]]\n** [[North-East Frontier Agency]]\n**[[2014 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election]];\n**[[2009 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly election]]\n**[[Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly ]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Arunachal Pradesh}} \n;

The [[Monpa people|Monpa]] and [[Sherdukpen]] keep historical records of the existence of local chiefdoms in the northwest as well. Northwestern parts of this area came under the control of the Monpa kingdom of Monyul, which flourished between 500 B.C. and 600 A.D. The remaining parts of the state, especially Southern and those bordering [[Myanmar]], were under the control of the [[Chutiya Kingdom|Chutiya Kings]].\n\nRecent excavations of ruins of Hindu temples, such as the 14th century Malinithan at the foot of the Siang hills in [[West Siang]], indicate they were built during the [[Chutiya]] reign. Another notable heritage site, Bhismaknagar (built in 8th century), has led to suggestions that the Chutiya people had an advanced culture and administration. The third heritage site, the 400-year-old [[Tawang Monastery]] in the extreme north-west of the state, provides some historical evidence of the Buddhist tribal people. The sixth [[Dalai Lama]] [[Tsangyang Gyatso, 6th Dalai Lama|Tsangyang Gyatso]] was born in [[Tawang Town|Tawang]].\n\nThe main archaeological sites of the state include:<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Baruah\n  | first = Dr. Swarnalata \n  | title = Chutia Jaatir Buranji\n  | year = 2004\n  | publisher = Banalata Publications\n  | location = Guwahati \n  | isbn = }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In between there are transition zones, such as the [[Aka (tribe)|Aka]]/[[Hruso people|Hruso]]/[[Miji people|Miji]]/[[Sherdukpen]] area, which provides a \"buffer\" of sorts between the Tibetan Buddhist tribes and the animist [[Tani (tribes)|Tani hill tribes]]. In addition, there are isolated peoples scattered throughout the state, such as the Sulung.\n\nWithin each of these cultural spheres, one finds populations of related tribes speaking related languages and sharing similar traditions. In the Tibetic area, one finds large numbers of [[Monpa people|Monpa]] tribespeople, with several subtribes speaking closely related but mutually incomprehensible languages, and also large numbers of Tibetan refugees. Within the [[Tani people|Tani]] area, major tribes include the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]]. [[Apatani people|Apatani]] also live among the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]], but are distinct. In the centre, one finds predominantly [[Galo people]], with the major sub-groups of Karka, Lodu, Bogum, Lare and Pugo among others, extending to the Ramo and Pailibo areas (which are close in many ways to Galo). In the east, one finds the [[Adi people|Adi]] with many subtribes including [[Padam tribe|Padam]], Pasi, [[Minyong]] and [[Bokar language|Bokar]], among others. [[Milang tribe|Milang]], while also falling within the general \"Adi\" sphere, are in many ways quite distinct. Moving east, the [[Idu Mishmi language|Idu]], [[Miju Mishmi tribe|Miju]] and [[Digaro Mishmi language|Digaru]] make up the \"[[Mishmi people|Mishmi]]\" cultural-linguistic area, which may or may not form a coherent historical grouping.\n\nMoving southeast, the [[Tai peoples|Tai]] [[Khamti people|Khamti]] are linguistically distinct from their neighbours and culturally distinct from the majority of other Arunachalese tribes. They follow the [[Theravada]] sect of Buddhism.  They also exhibit considerable convergence with the [[Singpho people|Singpho]] and [[Tangsa]] Naga tribes of the same area, all of which are also found in Burma. The Khamptis and Singphos have a huge demographic presence even in the neighbouring state of Assam, in places viz. [[Naharkatiya]], [[Narayanpur, Assam|Narayanpur]] of Lakhimpur districts of Assam. They one of the most recent people group migrated to Arunachal region from Burma and Assam. The [[Nocte language|Nocte]] Naga and [[Wancho language|Wancho]] Naga are another two major ethnic tribes. Both the tribes exhibit very much cultural similarities. Finally the [[Deori people|Deori]] tribe is also a major community in the state, with their own distinctive identity. They are the descendants of the priestly class of [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutia people]] who were allowed to continue their livelihood after the defeat of the Chutias. Deoris are one of the only Arunachal tribe in the historical records-which shows they are among the first ethnic groups to inhabit the Himalayas of the districts of Dibang Valley and Lohit, before the arrival of other many tribes in the region between 1600 and 1900.\n\n[[File:BuddhaTwang.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Buddhism]] is practised by 13% of the population.

Boundaries between languages very often correlate with tribal divisions\u2014for example, the [[Apatani people|Apatani]] and [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]] are tribally and linguistically distinct\u2014but shifts in tribal identity and alignment over time have also ensured that a certain amount of complication enters into the picture\u2014for example, the [[Galo language]] is and has seemingly always been linguistically distinct from [[Adi language|Adi]], whereas the earlier tribal alignment of Galo with Adi (i.e., \"Adi Gallong\") has only recently been essentially dissolved.\n\nThe vast majority of languages indigenous to modern-day Arunachal Pradesh belong to the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman family]]. The majority of these in turn belong to a single branch of Tibeto-Burman, namely Abo-Tani language. Almost all [[Tani languages]] are indigenous to central Arunachal Pradesh, including (moving from west to east) the [[Nyishi people|Nyishi]], the [[Apatani people|Apatani]], the [[Tagin people|Tagin]], the [[Galo people|Galo]], the [[Bokar language|Bokar]], the [[Adi people|Adi]], the [[Padam people|Padam]], the [[Pasi people|Pasi]], and the [[Minyong people|Minyong]]. The Tani languages are noticeably characterised by an overall relative uniformity, suggesting relatively recent origin and dispersal within their present-day area of concentration. Most of the [[Tani languages|Tani]] languages are mutually intelligible with at least one other Tani language, meaning that the area constitutes a [[dialect chain]], as was once found in much of Europe; only [[Apatani language|Apatani]] and [[Milang language|Milang]] stand out as relatively unusual in the Tani context. Tani languages are among the better-studied languages of the region.\n\nTo the east of the Tani area lie three virtually undescribed and highly endangered languages of the \"[[Mishmic languages|Mishmi]]\" group of Tibeto-Burman: [[Idu Mishmi language|Idu]], [[Digaro Mishmi language|Digaru]] and [[Miju Mishmi tribe|Miju]]. A number of speakers of these languages are also found in [[Tibet]]. The relationships of these languages, both amongst one another and to other area languages, are as yet uncertain. Further south, one finds the [[Jingpho language|Singpho (Kachin) language]], which is primarily spoken by large populations in [[Myanmar]]'s [[Kachin State]], and the [[Nocte language|Nocte]] and [[Wancho language]]s, which show affiliations to certain [[Naga languages]] spoken to the south in modern-day [[Nagaland]].\n\nTo the west and north of the Tani area are found at least one and possibly as many as four [[Bodic languages]], including [[Dakpa language|Dakpa]] and [[Tshangla language]]; within modern-day India, these languages go by the cognate but, in usage, distinct designations [[Monpa language|Monpa]] and [[Memba]]. Most speakers of these languages or closely related Bodic languages are found in neighbouring [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]], and Monpa and Memba populations remain closely adjacent to these border regions.\n\nBetween the Bodic and Tani areas lie many almost completely undescribed and unclassified languages, which, speculatively considered Tibeto-Burman, exhibit many unique structural and lexical properties that probably reflect both a long history in the region and a complex history of language contact with neighbouring populations. Among them are [[Sherdukpen]], [[Bugun]], [[Aka (tribe)|Aka]]/[[Hruso languages|Hruso]], [[Koro language (India)|Koro]], [[Miji language|Miji]], [[Bangru language (Arunachal Pradesh)|Bangru]] and [[Puroik language|Puroik]]/[[Sulung]]. The high linguistic significance these languages is belied by the extreme paucity of documentation and description of them, even in view of their highly endangered status. Puroik, in particular, is perhaps one of the most culturally and linguistically unique and significant populations in all of Asia from proto-historical and anthropological-linguistic perspectives, and yet virtually no information of any real reliability regarding their culture or language can be found in print.\n\nFinally, other than the Bodic and Tani groups, there are also certain migratory languages which are largely spoken by migratory and central government employees serving in the state in different departments and institutions in modern-day Arunachal Pradesh. They are classified as Non-Tribal as per the provisions of the [[Constitution of India]].\n\nOutside of Tibeto-Burman, one finds in Arunachal Pradesh a single representative of the [[Tai languages|Tai family]], spoken by [[Khamti people|Tai Khamti tribe]], which is closely affiliated to the [[Shan language]] of [[Myanmar]]'s [[Shan State]]. Seemingly, Khampti is a recent arrival in Arunachal Pradesh whose presence dates to 18th and/or early 19th-century migrations from northern [[Myanmar]].\n\nIn addition to these non-[[Indo-European languages]], the Indo-European languages [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[English language|English]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and especially [[Hindi]] are making strong inroads into Arunachal Pradesh. Primarily as a result of the primary education system\u2014in which classes are generally taught by Hindi-speaking immigrant teachers from [[Bihar]] and other Hindi-speaking parts of northern India, a large and growing section of the population now speaks a semi-[[Creolization|creolised]] variety of Hindi as a mother tongue. Hindi acts as a lingua franca for most of the people in the state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://scroll.in/article/675419/how-hindi-became-the-language-of-choice-in-arunachal-pradesh |title=How Hindi became the language of choice in Arunachal Pradesh |access-date=18 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211120138/http://scroll.in/article/675419/how-hindi-became-the-language-of-choice-in-arunachal-pradesh |archive-date=11 December 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Despite, or perhaps because of, the linguistic diversity of the region, [[English language|English]] is the only official language recognised in the state.\n\n== Transport ==\n\n=== Air ===\n[[Itanagar Airport]], a [[Greenfield project]] serving Itanagar is being planned at Holongi at a cost of Rs. 6.50&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news|title=PMO ends tussle between AAI and Arunachal |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article3696836.ece |accessdate=4 August 2012 |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=28 July 2012 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730222350/http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/other-states/article3696836.ece |archivedate=30 July 2012 }}</ref> [[Alliance Air (India)|Alliance Air]] operates the only scheduled flights to the state flying from [[Kolkata]] via [[Guwahati]] to [[Pasighat Airport]].

PreCure#Characters|Mana]]  receives a wedding dress from her mother, which was previously worn by her late grandmother and her mother. Later, whilst discussing their elementary school days with Alice, Rikka,  and Makoto, Mana recalls owning a dog named Mallow, who died when she was little. That night, a mysterious man named Marsh uses a clarinet to call forth forgotten and discarded objects that still feel they have use, combining together into a giant whale-shaped blimp in the sky. Marsh, who Mana doesn't seem to recognise, starts trapping people inside film reels, forcing them to relive their past memories for eternity, depriving them of their futures. He then summons three henchmen; Purple Buggy, Silver Clock, and Mannequin Carmine, to fight against the Cure, reassembling them no matter how many times they are destroyed. Overwhelming the Cures, Marsh traps them inside their own memories, with Mana finding herself in her elementary school days when both her grandmother and Maro were still alive. Meanwhile, Sharuru  and the other fairies are approached by Bebel, a former acquaintance of Marsh, who informs them that they must venture inside the memories of their partners in order to save them. As Mana tries to find a way back to the real world, she finds the memories in this world are different from her own, as Rikka and Alice are nowhere to be found, but seems to enjoy being with Mallow. With help from Bebel, Sharuru and the others dive into their partners's memories, with Sharuru joining Mana just before she learns Mallow was hit by a car, which ends her film reels when she gives into the grief of losing her beloved dog. Cautious about Bebel's words that Mana will never give up, Matthew sends his henchmen after Rikka, Alice, and Makoto, deeming them a threat. Rikka and Alice manage to find each other within their memories, soon joined by their partners, whilst Davi convinces Makoto not to run away from the reality of the Trump Kingdom's situation. Rikka and Alice fight off against their opponents whilst Makoto is assisted by the arrival of Aguri, Cure Ace. Meanwhile, Mana, who can't stand returning to a world without Mallow, receives words of encouragement from her grandmother, allowing her to hear the support of her friends and find a way back to her world along with the others. As Marsh transforms into his true form, Mana, realising that Marsh is actually Mallow himself, takes on his attack, stating she has never once forgotten him, helping him to see the light. Just then, the clarinet that had been influencing Mallow travels forward in time to try and destroy the Cures's future. Using the Miracle Bouquet Lights, the Cures travel forward in time to the day of Mana's wedding and, with help from Mallow, reach the clarinet, who proves resilient to their attacks and delivers a critical blow to Mallow. Being left with no regrets, Mallow leaves behind his psyche, which gives Mana the powerful Engage Mode, allowing her to defeat the clarinet. After the girls return to the present and everyone who was imprisoned is freed, Bebel takes care of Maro's psyche, revealing herself to be Mana's grandmother.\n\n===''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls'' (2014)===\n{{Main|HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls}}\n{{nihongo|''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls''|\u6620\u753b \u30cf\u30d4\u30cd\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\uff01\u4eba\u5f62\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30d0\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca|Eiga HapinesuCh\u0101ji Purikyua!

Back in the present, Miyuki, Akane, Yayoi, Nao, and Reika all go to a book expo where they come across a quaint little movie theater. Whilst watching the movie, a strange girl named Nico suddenly pops out of the screen, pursued by [[Journey to the West|Kingaku and Gingaku]]. After the Cures manage to beat the two monsters, Nico takes them to the World of Picture Books, where characters from various fairy tales live. There, the girls are given the opportunity to live out roles of their favourite book protagonists; [[Cinderella]], [[Issun-b\u014dshi]], [[Sun Wukong]], [[Urashima Tar\u014d]] and [[Momotar\u014d]]. Things soon start turning weird, however, when the true protagonists wind up in each other's stories. These heroes are soon possessed by a dark force, causing them to show resentment towards the girls and attack them, wanting a world where stories have no endings. With the assistance of the stories's antagonists, the Cures fight to try and revert the heroes to normal. They soon learn the culprit is Nico, who holds resentment towards Miyuki for forgetting her promise to finish the story she lived in. Chasing Nico to the world of her story, Miyuki explains that in her book, Nico was a girl who brought smiles to others but was kidnapped by a dark force, at which point the ending was unknown. Miyuki had attempted to draw the rest of her story but gave up because she couldn't draw very well at the time. After some encouragement from Akane and the others, Miyuki becomes determined to make up with Nico and together they head towards the castle where she was captured. As Nico's hatred is fuelled by the Demon Lord that captured her, the girls fight off the fairytale heroes so Miyuki can try and reach Nico. Backed up by the support of her friends, who will never hate her despite their injuries, Miyuki conveys her feelings of gratitude to Nico for helping her learn to smile. Just then, the Demon Lord ensnares Nico, wanting to use the power of her hatred to take over the world. As she and the other's struggle against his attacks, Nico realises her true feelings which restores the lost pages of her book.

PreCure#Characters|Mana]]  receives a wedding dress from her mother, which was previously worn by her late grandmother and her mother. Later, whilst discussing their elementary school days with Alice, Rikka,  and Makoto, Mana recalls owning a dog named Mallow, who died when she was little. That night, a mysterious man named Marsh uses a clarinet to call forth forgotten and discarded objects that still feel they have use, combining together into a giant whale-shaped blimp in the sky. Marsh, who Mana doesn't seem to recognise, starts trapping people inside film reels, forcing them to relive their past memories for eternity, depriving them of their futures. He then summons three henchmen; Purple Buggy, Silver Clock, and Mannequin Carmine, to fight against the Cure, reassembling them no matter how many times they are destroyed. Overwhelming the Cures, Marsh traps them inside their own memories, with Mana finding herself in her elementary school days when both her grandmother and Maro were still alive. Meanwhile, Sharuru  and the other fairies are approached by Bebel, a former acquaintance of Marsh, who informs them that they must venture inside the memories of their partners in order to save them. As Mana tries to find a way back to the real world, she finds the memories in this world are different from her own, as Rikka and Alice are nowhere to be found, but seems to enjoy being with Mallow. With help from Bebel, Sharuru and the others dive into their partners's memories, with Sharuru joining Mana just before she learns Mallow was hit by a car, which ends her film reels when she gives into the grief of losing her beloved dog. Cautious about Bebel's words that Mana will never give up, Matthew sends his henchmen after Rikka, Alice, and Makoto, deeming them a threat. Rikka and Alice manage to find each other within their memories, soon joined by their partners, whilst Davi convinces Makoto not to run away from the reality of the Trump Kingdom's situation. Rikka and Alice fight off against their opponents whilst Makoto is assisted by the arrival of Aguri, Cure Ace. Meanwhile, Mana, who can't stand returning to a world without Mallow, receives words of encouragement from her grandmother, allowing her to hear the support of her friends and find a way back to her world along with the others. As Marsh transforms into his true form, Mana, realising that Marsh is actually Mallow himself, takes on his attack, stating she has never once forgotten him, helping him to see the light. Just then, the clarinet that had been influencing Mallow travels forward in time to try and destroy the Cures's future. Using the Miracle Bouquet Lights, the Cures travel forward in time to the day of Mana's wedding and, with help from Mallow, reach the clarinet, who proves resilient to their attacks and delivers a critical blow to Mallow. Being left with no regrets, Mallow leaves behind his psyche, which gives Mana the powerful Engage Mode, allowing her to defeat the clarinet. After the girls return to the present and everyone who was imprisoned is freed, Bebel takes care of Maro's psyche, revealing herself to be Mana's grandmother.\n\n===''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls'' (2014)===\n{{Main|HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls}}\n{{nihongo|''HappinessCharge PreCure! the Movie: The Ballerina of the Land of Dolls''|\u6620\u753b \u30cf\u30d4\u30cd\u30b9\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30b8\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\uff01\u4eba\u5f62\u306e\u56fd\u306e\u30d0\u30ec\u30ea\u30fc\u30ca|Eiga HapinesuCh\u0101ji Purikyua!

He made his debut as Kane the Undertaker at a taping of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' on November 19, 1990. The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. Calaway made his official on-camera debut on November 22 at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]] as a villainous character when he was the mystery partner of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Team.<ref name=pwi89>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\", p. 88\u201389.</ref> Approximately one minute into the match, The Undertaker eliminated [[Koko B.

He also eliminated [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] before being [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]]; however, his team won the match with DiBiase being the sole survivor. During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name). At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] \u2013 a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents.

The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at [[WrestleMania VIII]].<ref name=legacy /> He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by [[Harvey Wippleman]] throughout 1992 and 1993, such as [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] and [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Giant Gonz\u00e1lez]].

The Undertaker defeated the impostor after three ''Tombstone Piledrivers''.<ref name=pwi92 /> At [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in a casket match rematch. Throughout most of 1995, Undertaker feuded with members of Ted DiBiase's [[Million Dollar Corporation]]. At [[WrestleMania XI]], while The Undertaker was facing [[King Kong Bundy]], [[The Godfather (wrestler)|Kama]] stole the urn and antagonized him by melting it into a large gold necklace.<ref name=pwi92 /> In August, Undertaker defeated Kama in a casket match at [[SummerSlam (1995)|SummerSlam]].<ref name=pwi92 /> Several weeks later, Undertaker injured his [[Orbit (anatomy)|orbital bone]] near his eye, forcing a period of absence for surgery, until his return at [[Survivor Series (1995)|Survivor Series]].\n\nThe Undertaker returned in November at Survivor Series, wearing a ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Phantom of the Opera]]''-like, gray upper-face mask.<ref name=pwi92 /> In the main event of the [[Royal Rumble (1996)|Royal Rumble]] in January 1996, The Undertaker was unmasked in a WWF Championship match against [[Bret Hart]], but [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]] interfered during the match, costing The Undertaker the championship.<ref name=pwi95>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p.95)</ref> A rematch for the title on the February 5 episode of ''Raw'' saw similar interference.{{cn|date=December 2019}} At that month's [[In Your House 6|In Your House: Rage in the Cage]], while Diesel was facing Hart in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cages|steel cage match]], The Undertaker delivered a surprise attack, emerging from a hole he had ripped through the ring canvas and dragging Diesel with him down under, allowing Hart the victory.<ref name=pwi95 /> After several weeks of more tit for tat between Diesel and The Undertaker, the feud culminated in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Singles match|singles match]] between the two at [[WrestleMania XII]], where Undertaker was victorious.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Undertaker's next feud started the next night on ''Raw'', when [[Mick Foley|Mankind]] made his debut and interfered in Undertaker's match against [[John Layfield|Justin \"Hawk\" Bradshaw]]. For the next few months, Mankind ambushed and cost The Undertaker several matches.<ref name=pwi95 /> The feud intensified and they began taking their battles into crowds, backstage areas and in the boiler rooms of different arenas. Mankind cost The Undertaker the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog]], assisting champion [[Goldust]] to victory. As a result, the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Location-based variations|Boiler Room Brawl]] was booked between the two at [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]].

In this then-new form, he took on a Gothic, brash and [[Rebellion|rebelling]] persona (perhaps to better fit in with the then-budding, more adult-oriented Attitude Era). In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival. At [[In Your House 12: It's Time]], The Undertaker defeated The Executioner in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Armageddon rules match]].<ref name=pwi97 /> He then moved on to feud with [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], whom he faced in January 1997 at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]] in a singles match, which Undertaker lost after Bearer interfered on behalf of his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9.<ref name=pwi97 /> The two then clashed in the Royal Rumble match itself as they made it to the final moments of the match, but both were eliminated by [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who had crept back into the match after his elimination was unseen.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]], defeating [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]] in a singles match.<ref name=PWInsiderTakervs.Hakushi>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=22474&p=1|title=PWInsider.com \u2014 Undertaker in Japan|accessdate=March 19, 2013|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lcw1_michinoku-pro-undertaker-vs-hakushi_sport#.UUipFBzry5c|title=Michinoku Pro: Undertaker vs. Hakushi|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Undertaker standing 1997.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Undertaker in September 1997]]\nConcurrent to the deep, dark secret storyline directed by Bearer, Undertaker began a new rivalry at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] when [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Shawn Michaels]] accidentally hit The Undertaker with a steel chair shot meant for Bret Hart, costing Undertaker the WWF Championship.<ref name=pwi98 /> After a double count-out draw during [[Ground Zero: In Your House]], Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell match]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]]. During this match, The Undertaker's storyline half-brother Kane finally made his debut under the control of Paul Bearer, ripping off the door to the cell and giving The Undertaker a ''Tombstone Piledriver'', Undertaker's trademark finisher, allowing Michaels to pin him.<ref name=pwi98 /> As the storyline progressed through Bearer, Kane challenged The Undertaker, but Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half-brother. The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory. The Undertaker, however, had disappeared when the casket lid was reopened.<ref name=pwi100>PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 100\u2013101).</ref> After a two-month hiatus, The Undertaker returned and defeated Kane at [[WrestleMania XIV]].<ref name=pwi100 /> The two had a rematch, the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Inferno match|Inferno match]], one month later at [[Unforgiven: In Your House]], which The Undertaker won by setting Kane's right arm on fire.<ref name=pwi100 />\n\nThe Undertaker's feud with Mankind was concluded afterward and they [[The Undertaker vs. Mankind (Hell in a Cell match)|faced each other in a Hell in a Cell match]] at [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]]. During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary. In September 1999, on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against [[Triple H]].

After signing for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1989, he enjoyed a brief stint as a mid-card performer named \"Mean Mark\" Callous, before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990.\n\nIn the WWF, Calaway was rebranded as \"The Undertaker\" and gained significant mainstream popularity as a [[Horror film|horror]]-themed, [[macabre]] entity who employed [[Fear mongering|scare tactics]] and held links to the [[supernatural]]. The Undertaker became one of the most prominent figures of the [[Attitude Era]], featuring in various pivotal storylines and matches as WWF sustained a boom period in business in the late 1990s. His character transitioned into a biker in the early 2000s, before returning to a refined version of his previous gimmick in 2004. The Undertaker is known for [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Streak]], a series of 21 straight victories at WWE's flagship annual event, [[WrestleMania]].\n\nCalaway has held 17 [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]].

The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks.

At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] \u2013 a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents.

The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family. It was during this time that The Undertaker also made an appearance in [[Michinoku Pro Wrestling]], defeating [[Jinsei Shinzaki|Hakushi]] in a singles match.<ref name=PWInsiderTakervs.Hakushi>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=22474&p=1|title=PWInsider.com \u2014 Undertaker in Japan|accessdate=March 19, 2013|publisher=PWInsider.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2lcw1_michinoku-pro-undertaker-vs-hakushi_sport#.UUipFBzry5c|title=Michinoku Pro: Undertaker vs. Hakushi|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Undertaker standing 1997.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Undertaker in September 1997]]\nConcurrent to the deep, dark secret storyline directed by Bearer, Undertaker began a new rivalry at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] when [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] [[Shawn Michaels]] accidentally hit The Undertaker with a steel chair shot meant for Bret Hart, costing Undertaker the WWF Championship.<ref name=pwi98 /> After a double count-out draw during [[Ground Zero: In Your House]], Undertaker challenged Michaels to the first [[Hell in a Cell|Hell in a Cell match]] at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]]. During this match, The Undertaker's storyline half-brother Kane finally made his debut under the control of Paul Bearer, ripping off the door to the cell and giving The Undertaker a ''Tombstone Piledriver'', Undertaker's trademark finisher, allowing Michaels to pin him.<ref name=pwi98 /> As the storyline progressed through Bearer, Kane challenged The Undertaker, but Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half-brother. The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo compensate for his lack of physical activity, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making [[Know-it-all|smart-aleck]] remarks and performing commentary. In September 1999, on ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the [[Unforgiven (1999)|Unforgiven]] main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against [[Triple H]].

The engine has six cylinders arranged in a horizontally-opposed [[Flat engine#Boxer engine|boxer]] configuration. The Turbo-Air 6 was used in the Corvair and all models derived from it, as well as a wide variety of other applications.\n\nThe engine's use of air-cooling made it appealing to [[Homebuilt aircraft|aircraft amateur builders]], and small volume engine builders established a [[cottage industry]] modifying Corvair engines for aircraft.<ref name=\"WDLA11\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[Ed Cole]], Chief Engineer for Chevrolet from 1952 to 1956 and Chevrolet General Manager from 1956 to 1961, was the person primarily responsible for getting the Corvair and its engine into production. Cole's experience with rear-engined vehicles began during his time as chief design engineer of light tanks and combat vehicles for [[Cadillac]] during [[World War II]]. He designed powertrains for the M24 Chaffee light tank and M5 Stuart tank, the latter of which used two rear-mounted [[Cadillac V8 engine]]s driving through [[Hydramatic]] transmissions.\n\nAfter the war Cole was promoted to Chief Engineer at Cadillac. In 1946 he began experimenting with rear-engined passenger car prototypes, nicknamed \"Cadibacks\".<ref name=\"reuters\"/><ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|12, 13}}\n\nIn 1950 Cole was asked to oversee production of the M41 Walker Bulldog tank at Cadillac's Cleveland facility. The M41 was powered by a Continental AOS-895-3 engine.<ref name=\"lvcc-jan2012\"/> This was a six-cylinder, air-cooled, [[four-stroke]] [[supercharged]] boxer engine that displaced {{convert|895|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nCole also logged over 300 hours piloting a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] powered by a smaller Continental engine with the same basic layout.<ref name=\"excellencemag\"/><ref name=\"muellerbook\"/>{{rp|95}}\n\nAfter moving to Chevrolet, Cole instructed engineer [[Maurice Olley]] to come up with \"something different\". Olley and his team assessed both [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine/front-wheel-drive]] and [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]]s and determined that the rear/rear layout would need an engine of aluminum, and that air-cooling would be preferred.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nResponsibility for development of the engine fell primarily to Senior Project Engineer Robert P. Benzinger and engine designer Adelbert \u201cAl\u201d Kolbe.<ref name=\"vv-benzinger\"/> The first engine was fired up in the Chevrolet Engineering department in December 1957.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|24, 25, 26}} For the earliest road tests a prototype was installed in a [[Porsche 356]]. Later development mules were either called LaSalle II or badged as [[Holden]]s.\n\nA new casting foundry was built in [[Massena (village), New York|Massena, New York]].<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|22}} GM convinced [[Reynolds Aluminum]] to build an aluminum reduction plant nearby to supply it. Aluminum parts included the block, heads, [[flywheel]] housing, [[crankcase]] cover, clutch housing and pistons. {{convert|92|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} of aluminum was used in each engine. New casting and machining techniques had to be developed to produce the light-alloy parts. The aluminum parts were cast with a low-pressure casting technique using machines built and installed by Karl Schmidt GmbH of Neckarsulm, Germany.<ref name=\"dce-sep2006\"/><ref name=\"auwm-corpage2\"/> All of the engines were assembled at GM's [[Tonawanda Engine]] plant.<ref name=\"vv-jan2011\"/><ref name=\"auwm-corpage2\"/>\n\nThe car and engine were officially introduced on 29 September 1959, and debuted in showrooms on 2 October.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|33}} Advertising prepared by the Campbell-Ewald agency highlighted the fact that the air-cooled engine did not require anti-freeze, and that much of the engine was made of \"aircraft-type\" aluminum.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|33, 36, 37}} The same ad agency gave the engine its official name; the \"Turbo-Air 6\".<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|40}}\n\nThe Turbo-Air 6 engine was used in all Corvair car models in all trim levels, including the 500, 700, 900 Monza, Corsa, and Spyder coupes sedans and convertibles, as well as the Corvair and Lakewood station-wagons. It also powered the Forward-Control 95 series vans, including the Corvan and the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, and both the Loadside and Rampside pickup trucks.\n\nTuned versions of the engine appeared in some modified Corvairs sold under the customizer's name, such as the Fitch Sprint, the [[Yenko Stinger]], and the Solar Cavalier. [[Don Yenko]] claimed as much as {{convert|240| - |250|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} from his Stage IV and racing Stingers.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|126, 132\u2013134}}\n\nManufacturing of the Turbo-Air 6 ended with the cessation of Corvair production after 1969.\n\n==Technical features==\nThe Turbo-Air is a [[flat-six engine]] that is primarily air-cooled. The engine's major components include an [[aluminum]] [[crankcase]], two three-cylinder aluminum cylinder heads with integral [[intake manifold]]s, and six individual iron cylinder barrels. The #1 cylinder is at the right rear with cylinders 1, 3, and 5 on the right, while #2 is the left rear with cylinders 2, 4, and 6 on the left.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|24}} The [[firing order]] is: 1-4-5-2-3-6.\n\nThe crankcase is cast as two box-section halves. The assembled crankcase provides for four [[main bearing]]s. There are four cylinder head studs per cylinder, for a total of twelve on each side.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}} The [[crankshaft]] for the earliest versions was of forged alloy steel and had six throws but no counterweights, permitting a weight-saving of {{convert|25|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nEach cylinder head has two overhead valves per cylinder activated through stamped-steel [[rocker arm]]s and [[hydraulic tappet]]s by pushrods that run through tubes below each cylinder barrel. The engine developed a reputation for leaking oil past the seals of the pushrod tubes. New seals of [[Viton]] solved the problem.<ref name=\"hemmings-feb2009\"/><ref name=\"lvcc=may2017\"/><ref name=\"startribune\"/>\n\nViewed from the rear, the Corvair engine's crankshaft rotates counter-clockwise; opposite that of most other engines.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|24}}<ref name=\"tribune-25\"/> This allows it to use regular transmission and pinion-gear arrangements when mounted in a rear-engine configuration.\n\nPrimary cooling is done by a shrouded cooling fan mounted horizontally on top of the engine. The fans were revised throughout the production run, with early fans made of steel and later ones of magnesium. The fan is driven by a long V-belt from the back of the engine with an adjustable idler gear. The belt makes two 90\u00b0 turns to reach the fan. An early problem with the fan drive-belt jumping off the pulley was solved by making the groove in the idler pulley deeper. A metal bellows thermostat modulated either a ring valve on early engines or a set of damper doors on later ones to regulate the flow of cooling air.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|40}}\n\nEngine oil is also used as a coolant. To remove heat from the oil the engine used a variety of types of oil coolers throughout its production run.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nMost Turbo-Air 6 engines use two one-barrel Rochester H carburetors; one per cylinder head. A later high performance engine uses four carburetors; one Rochester HV primary and one Rochester H secondary per head. The secondary carb had no choke plate, idle circuit, accelerator pump, power circuit, or vapor vent.<ref name=\"carb-manual\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nThe arrangement of intake and [[exhaust valve]]s in the Turbo-Air 6 is considered noteworthy, with the valves arranged as intake/exhaust, intake/exhaust, intake/exhaust down both sides.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}} The use of separate exhaust ports rather than twinned or siamesed ports helps avoid problems with distortion caused by a concentration of heat at these locations.<ref name=\"m-technic\"/>\n\nThere is a single cast-iron [[camshaft]] located in the crankcase. The shaft only has nine cam lobes on it - the symmetrical arrangement of valves allows three, double-width cam lobes to operate all six exhaust valves.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\n===Turbocharging===\n[[File:Corvair turbo engine.jpg|thumb|Turbocharged Corvair engine]]\nChevrolet introduced a [[turbocharged]] version of the engine for the 1962 [[model year]].<ref name=\"carbuzz\"/> Development of this version was done by engineers James Brafford and Robert Thoreson, under the oversight of Bob Benzinger, who had become chief engine designer for the Corvair in 1959.<ref name=\"auwm-corvair\"/> The turbocharged Corvair was released one month after the turbocharged [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Turbo-Rocket|Turbo-Rocket engine]] in the Oldsmobile F-85 Jetfire, making it just the second turbocharged car in volume production.<ref name=\"tc-23jan2015\"/> This engine was not marketed under the ''Turbo-Air'' name, being listed initially as the ''Super Charged Spyder'' engine.<ref name=\"62-63-supplement\"/>\n\nMany of the internal components were strengthened or otherwise revised to deal with the stresses of [[forced induction]]. The engine received heavy-duty rod and main bearings, chromed upper piston rings, and nickel/chromium alloy exhaust valves.

Winchell then proposed casting individual cylinder barrels and cylinder heads as a single piece, eliminating the head-gasket completely. A team was assembled that was led by Al Kolbe, who was responsible for the design of the original Turbo-Air 6. Heading up design for the new engine was Joe Bertsch, who was joined by engineers Len Kutkus and Jerry Mrlik. The engine they designed and developed kept the Turbo-Air 6 engine's boxer configuration and use of air cooling, and became known as the modular engine.\n\nAs with Winchell's earlier engine, bore and stroke were increased to {{convert|3.56|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.94|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} respectively.<ref name=\"cc-apr1995\"/> The combined barrel-head was to be die-cast in aluminum with cast-iron [[cylinder liner]]s. Each of these castings also included a channel for the pushrod path, doing away with the previous design's pushrod tubes. Valve covers were held in place by quick-release clips. Rather than use four long bolts per cylinder, the bottom of each cylinder barrel had a heavy flange which was bolted to the crankcase. The single horizontal cooling fan was replaced by three vertical fans on a common shaft.\n\nProblems with heat-distortion of the early alloy cylinder barrel/head units led to a subsequent redesign that included cooling fins angled at 45\u00b0 to eliminate cutouts needed for access to the bolts holding the barrels to the crankcase, and the reintroduction of push-rod tubes.\n\nThe engine was \"modular\" in that the individual cylinder/head units allowed Chevrolet to design engines with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 cylinders, of which versions with 2, 4, 6 and 10 cylinders were built. The 6 cylinder version produced about {{convert|120|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} and was tested in a Corvair, while 2 and 4 cylinder engines were installed in a [[Renault Caravelle]] and two [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta]]s. The 10 cylinder version was called P-10 and was installed in a 1962 Chevrolet Impala converted to [[front-wheel drive]]. This engine produced {{convert|200|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}}. Design project XP-790 was originally meant to be the basis for a front-wheel drive replacement for GM's E-body cars, and incorporate [[flat-10]] engines based on the P-10. Project XP-787 was split off from XP-790 to allow further development, while XP-790 was returned to the Research Studio, where it became the basis for the Firebird IV concept car. Project XP-787 was cancelled. Engines with 8 and 12 cylinders were designed but not built.\n\nA private Corvair owner bought a collection of engines and parts and installed a running modular engine in his personal car.<ref name=\"lvcc-jul2016\"/>\n\n===Overhead camshafts===\nChevrolet developed a prototype of the Turbo-Air 6 with a [[single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC) in each cylinder head.<ref name=\"vegasvairs-sohc\"/> This was during the time from 1964 to 1966, with the SOHC project lagging the modular engine by approximately a year.\n\nThe camshafts were driven off the crankshaft by a [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. The valves were operated through rocker arms. The engine used three cooling fans, each directing air to one pair of opposed cylinders. The air/fuel intake used one Chevrolet-designed three-barrel carburetor per side. The original {{convert|2.94|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} stroke was retained while the bore was increased to {{convert|3.56|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}, giving a total displacement of {{convert|175|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. The pistons were a pent-roof type, and the [[combustion chamber]] shape approximated a hemisphere. The compression ratio was 10.5:1. While claimed output was as high as {{convert|240|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 7200 rpm, none of the three prototype engines developed more than {{convert|190|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 5700 rpm and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm.\n\nIn the Chevrolet Final Report on the engine written 22 February 1966, the need for improvements in cooling was highlighted. Power losses to the cooling fan was reported to be {{convert|26|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and was expected to nearly double at the engine's [[redline]], bringing useful power down to the vicinity of the naturally aspirated {{convert|140|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} engine.\n\nOne of the SOHC engines was displayed alongside the Astro I concept car, although it is reported that it was ever installed in the car.<ref name=\"lvcc-aug2016\"/> All three prototype engines are believed to have been destroyed.\n\n===Fuel injection===\nGeneral Motors began investigating the use of [[fuel injection]] on the Turbo-Air engine on 11 August 1962.<ref name=\"vv-dec2008\"/> A mechanical injection system made by the Marvel Schebler division of [[BorgWarner]] was installed on a pre-production {{convert|164|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The engine received Bill Thomas 4X1 cylinder heads with larger valves; {{convert|1.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} intake and {{convert|1.38|in|mm|abbr=on}} exhaust. A camshaft from Iskendarian provided high-lift and longer duration. After the initial feasibility study serious development started on 12 February 1963.\n\nExtensive testing of intake systems was done. Eventually the team settled on {{convert|1+3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter ram tubes each {{convert|25|in|mm|abbr=on}} long and a central plenum. This configuration was tested against both a 1963 and 1964 turbo engine as well as engines with six individual carburetors and two three-barrel [[Weber carburetor|Webers]]. The injected engine's output of {{convert|133|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} was higher than both turbos but lower than either carbureted engine. Road testing of the injected engine began on 19 April 1963.\n\nIn May 1963 a new injection system designed by Rochester was installed that produced nearly the same output as the Marvel-Schebler system. Performance of the most recent development engine was compared with a 4X1 {{convert|140|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} engine on 5 November 1963; the injected engine produced approximately {{convert|14|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} more. Another extensive road-test evaluation began on 15 November 1963. During October and November 1964 four more injected engines were built, one of which underwent road testing. By 2 February 1965 the injected engine was producing {{convert|180|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} [[Horsepower#SAE gross power|gross]] and {{convert|147|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} net. On 24 February 1965 a final lab comparison was run, that concluded the 30-month development program. The extra cost of fuel injection could not be justified based on the power gains achieved.\n\nSome versions of the Yenko Stinger were available with fuel injection.<ref name=\"cc-v4n2\"/> This system was based on GM's work.<ref name=\"org-fi\"/>\n\n===Water-cooling===\nWhile not a Chevrolet project, at least one water-cooled Turbo-Air 6 was built by independent engine designer Lloyd Taylor.<ref name=\"cc-nov1981\"/>\n\n==Other applications==\nApart from the production Corvair models, the Turbo-Air 6 engine was used in a variety of other applications.\n\n===Prototypes and styling exercises===\nBoth General Motors and some major carrozzeria have used the engine in several Corvair-based concept and show cars.\n\n* ''Corvair Monza'' - The first Corvair Monza was a Show car that pre-dated the production Monza.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|110}} This two-door coupe was first seen at the Chicago Auto Show.\n* ''Corvair Super Monza'' - Mechanically unmodified, the Super Monza was an exercise ordered by Bill Mitchell that saw a 900 coupe fitted with a luxurious interior and special exterior paint and trim, including a sunroof and wire wheels.<ref name=\"mt-aug1960\"/> It debuted at the 1960 New York Auto Show.\n* ''XP-709 \"Pinky\"'' - The first Corvair convertible, this car was eventually given to Harley J.

The Trail Blazer is considered by some to be the forerunner to the Chevrolet Blazer.<ref name=\"bj-lot256\"/>\n\n===Volkswagen conversions===\nSeveral options existed for adapting the Turbo-Air 6 engine to the transaxle in Volkswagen-based cars, or to fit a complete Corvair power-train into a modified VW chassis.\n\n* ''Crown Manufacturing'' - Sold adapters that allowed the Corvair engine to bolt directly up to a Volkswagen transaxle. This conversion required either flipping the pinion over to the other side of the transaxle case (on swing-axle VWs) or installing a Crown-supplied reverse-rotation camshaft (for IRS VWs) to compensate for the rotation of the Corvair engine.<ref name=\"fisherbook\"/>\n* ''Hadley Engineering'' - Developed a kit sold under the name \"Trans-Vair\". This product included a full sub-frame that allowed a complete Corvair powertrain to be installed in a modified Volkswagen chassis.<ref name=\"transvair\"/>\n* ''Lukes and Shorman'' - One of the first companies to offer a kit to adapt the Turbo-Air 6 to a Volkswagen transaxle.<ref name=\"lvcc-sep2018\"/> Lukes and Shorman produced an adapter plate of cast aluminum to mate the engine to the transaxle. The need to machine the flywheel end of the crankshaft was avoided by the use of a Porsche flywheel with a steel plate drilled to the Corvair bolt pattern welded into its centre. The clutch used was a VW commercial disc mated to the diaphragm pressure plate from a Porsche Carrera. Engine rotation was compensated for by flipping the ring gear to the other side of the transaxle. A revised starter was needed, and the early engines were converted to 6 volt operation to make them compatible with the electrical systems on early Volkswagens.\n\n===Motorhomes===\n* ''Travalon'' and ''UltraVan'' - Aircraft designer David Peterson created this monocoque-framed motorhome, built using aircraft methods.<ref name=\"ultravan1\"/> The early Travalon models built by the Prescolite Corporation were used as mobile showrooms.

The engine has six cylinders arranged in a horizontally-opposed [[Flat engine#Boxer engine|boxer]] configuration. The Turbo-Air 6 was used in the Corvair and all models derived from it, as well as a wide variety of other applications.\n\nThe engine's use of air-cooling made it appealing to [[Homebuilt aircraft|aircraft amateur builders]], and small volume engine builders established a [[cottage industry]] modifying Corvair engines for aircraft.<ref name=\"WDLA11\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[Ed Cole]], Chief Engineer for Chevrolet from 1952 to 1956 and Chevrolet General Manager from 1956 to 1961, was the person primarily responsible for getting the Corvair and its engine into production. Cole's experience with rear-engined vehicles began during his time as chief design engineer of light tanks and combat vehicles for [[Cadillac]] during [[World War II]]. He designed powertrains for the M24 Chaffee light tank and M5 Stuart tank, the latter of which used two rear-mounted [[Cadillac V8 engine]]s driving through [[Hydramatic]] transmissions.\n\nAfter the war Cole was promoted to Chief Engineer at Cadillac. In 1946 he began experimenting with rear-engined passenger car prototypes, nicknamed \"Cadibacks\".<ref name=\"reuters\"/><ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|12, 13}}\n\nIn 1950 Cole was asked to oversee production of the M41 Walker Bulldog tank at Cadillac's Cleveland facility. The M41 was powered by a Continental AOS-895-3 engine.<ref name=\"lvcc-jan2012\"/> This was a six-cylinder, air-cooled, [[four-stroke]] [[supercharged]] boxer engine that displaced {{convert|895|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nCole also logged over 300 hours piloting a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] powered by a smaller Continental engine with the same basic layout.<ref name=\"excellencemag\"/><ref name=\"muellerbook\"/>{{rp|95}}\n\nAfter moving to Chevrolet, Cole instructed engineer [[Maurice Olley]] to come up with \"something different\". Olley and his team assessed both [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|front-engine/front-wheel-drive]] and [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]]s and determined that the rear/rear layout would need an engine of aluminum, and that air-cooling would be preferred.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nResponsibility for development of the engine fell primarily to Senior Project Engineer Robert P. Benzinger and engine designer Adelbert \u201cAl\u201d Kolbe.<ref name=\"vv-benzinger\"/> The first engine was fired up in the Chevrolet Engineering department in December 1957.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|24, 25, 26}} For the earliest road tests a prototype was installed in a [[Porsche 356]]. Later development mules were either called LaSalle II or badged as [[Holden]]s.\n\nA new casting foundry was built in [[Massena (village), New York|Massena, New York]].<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|22}} GM convinced [[Reynolds Aluminum]] to build an aluminum reduction plant nearby to supply it. Aluminum parts included the block, heads, [[flywheel]] housing, [[crankcase]] cover, clutch housing and pistons. {{convert|92|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} of aluminum was used in each engine. New casting and machining techniques had to be developed to produce the light-alloy parts. The aluminum parts were cast with a low-pressure casting technique using machines built and installed by Karl Schmidt GmbH of Neckarsulm, Germany.<ref name=\"dce-sep2006\"/><ref name=\"auwm-corpage2\"/> All of the engines were assembled at GM's [[Tonawanda Engine]] plant.<ref name=\"vv-jan2011\"/><ref name=\"auwm-corpage2\"/>\n\nThe car and engine were officially introduced on 29 September 1959, and debuted in showrooms on 2 October.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|33}} Advertising prepared by the Campbell-Ewald agency highlighted the fact that the air-cooled engine did not require anti-freeze, and that much of the engine was made of \"aircraft-type\" aluminum.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|33, 36, 37}} The same ad agency gave the engine its official name; the \"Turbo-Air 6\".<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|40}}\n\nThe Turbo-Air 6 engine was used in all Corvair car models in all trim levels, including the 500, 700, 900 Monza, Corsa, and Spyder coupes sedans and convertibles, as well as the Corvair and Lakewood station-wagons. It also powered the Forward-Control 95 series vans, including the Corvan and the [[Chevrolet Greenbrier]] van, and both the Loadside and Rampside pickup trucks.\n\nTuned versions of the engine appeared in some modified Corvairs sold under the customizer's name, such as the Fitch Sprint, the [[Yenko Stinger]], and the Solar Cavalier. [[Don Yenko]] claimed as much as {{convert|240| - |250|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} from his Stage IV and racing Stingers.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|126, 132\u2013134}}\n\nManufacturing of the Turbo-Air 6 ended with the cessation of Corvair production after 1969.\n\n==Technical features==\nThe Turbo-Air is a [[flat-six engine]] that is primarily air-cooled. The engine's major components include an [[aluminum]] [[crankcase]], two three-cylinder aluminum cylinder heads with integral [[intake manifold]]s, and six individual iron cylinder barrels. The #1 cylinder is at the right rear with cylinders 1, 3, and 5 on the right, while #2 is the left rear with cylinders 2, 4, and 6 on the left.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|24}} The [[firing order]] is: 1-4-5-2-3-6.\n\nThe crankcase is cast as two box-section halves. The assembled crankcase provides for four [[main bearing]]s. There are four cylinder head studs per cylinder, for a total of twelve on each side.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}} The [[crankshaft]] for the earliest versions was of forged alloy steel and had six throws but no counterweights, permitting a weight-saving of {{convert|25|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nEach cylinder head has two overhead valves per cylinder activated through stamped-steel [[rocker arm]]s and [[hydraulic tappet]]s by pushrods that run through tubes below each cylinder barrel. The engine developed a reputation for leaking oil past the seals of the pushrod tubes. New seals of [[Viton]] solved the problem.<ref name=\"hemmings-feb2009\"/><ref name=\"lvcc=may2017\"/><ref name=\"startribune\"/>\n\nViewed from the rear, the Corvair engine's crankshaft rotates counter-clockwise; opposite that of most other engines.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|24}}<ref name=\"tribune-25\"/> This allows it to use regular transmission and pinion-gear arrangements when mounted in a rear-engine configuration.\n\nPrimary cooling is done by a shrouded cooling fan mounted horizontally on top of the engine. The fans were revised throughout the production run, with early fans made of steel and later ones of magnesium. The fan is driven by a long V-belt from the back of the engine with an adjustable idler gear. The belt makes two 90\u00b0 turns to reach the fan. An early problem with the fan drive-belt jumping off the pulley was solved by making the groove in the idler pulley deeper. A metal bellows thermostat modulated either a ring valve on early engines or a set of damper doors on later ones to regulate the flow of cooling air.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|40}}\n\nEngine oil is also used as a coolant. To remove heat from the oil the engine used a variety of types of oil coolers throughout its production run.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}}\n\nMost Turbo-Air 6 engines use two one-barrel Rochester H carburetors; one per cylinder head. A later high performance engine uses four carburetors; one Rochester HV primary and one Rochester H secondary per head. The secondary carb had no choke plate, idle circuit, accelerator pump, power circuit, or vapor vent.<ref name=\"carb-manual\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nThe arrangement of intake and [[exhaust valve]]s in the Turbo-Air 6 is considered noteworthy, with the valves arranged as intake/exhaust, intake/exhaust, intake/exhaust down both sides.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|44}} The use of separate exhaust ports rather than twinned or siamesed ports helps avoid problems with distortion caused by a concentration of heat at these locations.<ref name=\"m-technic\"/>\n\nThere is a single cast-iron [[camshaft]] located in the crankcase. The shaft only has nine cam lobes on it - the symmetrical arrangement of valves allows three, double-width cam lobes to operate all six exhaust valves.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\n===Turbocharging===\n[[File:Corvair turbo engine.jpg|thumb|Turbocharged Corvair engine]]\nChevrolet introduced a [[turbocharged]] version of the engine for the 1962 [[model year]].<ref name=\"carbuzz\"/> Development of this version was done by engineers James Brafford and Robert Thoreson, under the oversight of Bob Benzinger, who had become chief engine designer for the Corvair in 1959.<ref name=\"auwm-corvair\"/> The turbocharged Corvair was released one month after the turbocharged [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#Turbo-Rocket|Turbo-Rocket engine]] in the Oldsmobile F-85 Jetfire, making it just the second turbocharged car in volume production.<ref name=\"tc-23jan2015\"/> This engine was not marketed under the ''Turbo-Air'' name, being listed initially as the ''Super Charged Spyder'' engine.<ref name=\"62-63-supplement\"/>\n\nMany of the internal components were strengthened or otherwise revised to deal with the stresses of [[forced induction]]. The engine received heavy-duty rod and main bearings, chromed upper piston rings, and nickel/chromium alloy exhaust valves. The crankshaft in the turbocharged engine was made of forged 5140 chrome-steel.<ref name=\"hemmings-nov2006\"/> The compression ratio was reduced to the 8.0:1 of the original 1960 [[naturally aspirated engine]].<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|62}} The multiple-carburetor intake system was replaced with a single side-draft Carter Yh carburetor.<ref name=\"hemmings-aug2004\"/>\n\nThe turbocharger was made by the Thompson Valve Division of Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge Inc., which became [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] in 1965.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\"/> The model selected weighed {{convert|13.5|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"hemmings-nov2006\"/> It had a {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter impeller and was capable of spinning at up to 70,000 rpm.<ref name=\"hemmings-apr2015\"/>\n\nThe turbocharged Corvair engine did not use a wastegate to limit boost pressure. Instead, boost was controlled by an exhaust system designed to create back-pressure sufficient to limit the maximum boost.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|62, 63, 64}} To prevent the engine from running too lean a metering rod and jet were selected that supplied an over-rich mixture when at full throttle.<ref name=\"macinnesbook\"/> Static timing advance was set to 24\u00b0 [[BTDC]], with an additional 12\u00b0 of centrifugal advance coming in above 4000 rpm. To prevent pre-ignition, a diaphragm on the [[distributor]] provided a pressure retard function rather than a vacuum advance, and could retard timing by up to 9\u00b0 at manifold pressures above {{convert|0.14|bar|psi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"autouniversum\"/>\n\nWith maximum boost pressure limited to {{convert|10|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, power output from this engine in 1962 was {{convert|150|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}}, a 47% increase over the {{convert|102|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} output of the naturally aspirated engine. Torque was also increased by 58% to {{convert|210|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Production running changes==\n===1960===\n* Engine debuts. Bore and stroke are {{convert|3.375| x |2.6|in|mm|abbr=on}}, for a total displacement of {{convert|140|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. The compression ratio is 8.0:1, and power and torque outputs are {{convert|80|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm and {{convert|125|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm.\n* The 1960 engine has two carburetors, but a common [[air intake]] and filter with a single integrated automatic choke.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|23, 24}} Air is fed to the carburetors through two large rubber hoses.\n* The cooling fan is {{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter with 24 blades, and is made of steel.\n* Cooling airflow is controlled by a large-diameter bellows thermostat that drives a ring-shaped air valve in the eye of the blower.\n* The oil is cooled by a folded-fin cooler.\n* The engine does not have a harmonic balancer.\n* A high-output version of the engine called the \"Special Camshaft package\" is offered this year.<ref name=\"sci-may1960\"/>{{rp|60, 72}} This engine uses a different Rochester carburetor than stock, a different camshaft profile with revised timing and stiffer valve springs as well as a larger diameter exhaust system, and a [[Delco Electronics|Delco]]-[[Remy International|Remy]] ignition. Power output is up to {{convert|95|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"fiorebook\"/>{{rp|36}}\n\n===1961===\n*  Bore diameter in increased to {{convert|3.4375|in|mm|abbr=on}}, raising engine displacement to {{convert|2372|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|51}}\n* A high performance Super Turbo-Air version is released.

Winchell then proposed casting individual cylinder barrels and cylinder heads as a single piece, eliminating the head-gasket completely. A team was assembled that was led by Al Kolbe, who was responsible for the design of the original Turbo-Air 6. Heading up design for the new engine was Joe Bertsch, who was joined by engineers Len Kutkus and Jerry Mrlik. The engine they designed and developed kept the Turbo-Air 6 engine's boxer configuration and use of air cooling, and became known as the modular engine.\n\nAs with Winchell's earlier engine, bore and stroke were increased to {{convert|3.56|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2.94|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} respectively.<ref name=\"cc-apr1995\"/> The combined barrel-head was to be die-cast in aluminum with cast-iron [[cylinder liner]]s. Each of these castings also included a channel for the pushrod path, doing away with the previous design's pushrod tubes. Valve covers were held in place by quick-release clips. Rather than use four long bolts per cylinder, the bottom of each cylinder barrel had a heavy flange which was bolted to the crankcase. The single horizontal cooling fan was replaced by three vertical fans on a common shaft.\n\nProblems with heat-distortion of the early alloy cylinder barrel/head units led to a subsequent redesign that included cooling fins angled at 45\u00b0 to eliminate cutouts needed for access to the bolts holding the barrels to the crankcase, and the reintroduction of push-rod tubes.\n\nThe engine was \"modular\" in that the individual cylinder/head units allowed Chevrolet to design engines with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 cylinders, of which versions with 2, 4, 6 and 10 cylinders were built. The 6 cylinder version produced about {{convert|120|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} and was tested in a Corvair, while 2 and 4 cylinder engines were installed in a [[Renault Caravelle]] and two [[Alfa Romeo Giulietta]]s. The 10 cylinder version was called P-10 and was installed in a 1962 Chevrolet Impala converted to [[front-wheel drive]]. This engine produced {{convert|200|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}}. Design project XP-790 was originally meant to be the basis for a front-wheel drive replacement for GM's E-body cars, and incorporate [[flat-10]] engines based on the P-10. Project XP-787 was split off from XP-790 to allow further development, while XP-790 was returned to the Research Studio, where it became the basis for the Firebird IV concept car. Project XP-787 was cancelled. Engines with 8 and 12 cylinders were designed but not built.\n\nA private Corvair owner bought a collection of engines and parts and installed a running modular engine in his personal car.<ref name=\"lvcc-jul2016\"/>\n\n===Overhead camshafts===\nChevrolet developed a prototype of the Turbo-Air 6 with a [[single overhead camshaft]] (SOHC) in each cylinder head.<ref name=\"vegasvairs-sohc\"/> This was during the time from 1964 to 1966, with the SOHC project lagging the modular engine by approximately a year.\n\nThe camshafts were driven off the crankshaft by a [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. The valves were operated through rocker arms. The engine used three cooling fans, each directing air to one pair of opposed cylinders. The air/fuel intake used one Chevrolet-designed three-barrel carburetor per side. The original {{convert|2.94|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} stroke was retained while the bore was increased to {{convert|3.56|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}, giving a total displacement of {{convert|175|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}. The pistons were a pent-roof type, and the [[combustion chamber]] shape approximated a hemisphere. The compression ratio was 10.5:1. While claimed output was as high as {{convert|240|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 7200 rpm, none of the three prototype engines developed more than {{convert|190|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 5700 rpm and {{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 5200 rpm.\n\nIn the Chevrolet Final Report on the engine written 22 February 1966, the need for improvements in cooling was highlighted. Power losses to the cooling fan was reported to be {{convert|26|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 6000 rpm and was expected to nearly double at the engine's [[redline]], bringing useful power down to the vicinity of the naturally aspirated {{convert|140|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} engine.\n\nOne of the SOHC engines was displayed alongside the Astro I concept car, although it is reported that it was ever installed in the car.<ref name=\"lvcc-aug2016\"/> All three prototype engines are believed to have been destroyed.\n\n===Fuel injection===\nGeneral Motors began investigating the use of [[fuel injection]] on the Turbo-Air engine on 11 August 1962.<ref name=\"vv-dec2008\"/> A mechanical injection system made by the Marvel Schebler division of [[BorgWarner]] was installed on a pre-production {{convert|164|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} engine. The engine received Bill Thomas 4X1 cylinder heads with larger valves; {{convert|1.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} intake and {{convert|1.38|in|mm|abbr=on}} exhaust. A camshaft from Iskendarian provided high-lift and longer duration. After the initial feasibility study serious development started on 12 February 1963.\n\nExtensive testing of intake systems was done. Eventually the team settled on {{convert|1+3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}} diameter ram tubes each {{convert|25|in|mm|abbr=on}} long and a central plenum. This configuration was tested against both a 1963 and 1964 turbo engine as well as engines with six individual carburetors and two three-barrel [[Weber carburetor|Webers]]. The injected engine's output of {{convert|133|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} was higher than both turbos but lower than either carbureted engine. Road testing of the injected engine began on 19 April 1963.\n\nIn May 1963 a new injection system designed by Rochester was installed that produced nearly the same output as the Marvel-Schebler system. Performance of the most recent development engine was compared with a 4X1 {{convert|140|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} engine on 5 November 1963; the injected engine produced approximately {{convert|14|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} more. Another extensive road-test evaluation began on 15 November 1963. During October and November 1964 four more injected engines were built, one of which underwent road testing. By 2 February 1965 the injected engine was producing {{convert|180|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} [[Horsepower#SAE gross power|gross]] and {{convert|147|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} net. On 24 February 1965 a final lab comparison was run, that concluded the 30-month development program. The extra cost of fuel injection could not be justified based on the power gains achieved.\n\nSome versions of the Yenko Stinger were available with fuel injection.<ref name=\"cc-v4n2\"/> This system was based on GM's work.<ref name=\"org-fi\"/>\n\n===Water-cooling===\nWhile not a Chevrolet project, at least one water-cooled Turbo-Air 6 was built by independent engine designer Lloyd Taylor.<ref name=\"cc-nov1981\"/>\n\n==Other applications==\nApart from the production Corvair models, the Turbo-Air 6 engine was used in a variety of other applications.\n\n===Prototypes and styling exercises===\nBoth General Motors and some major carrozzeria have used the engine in several Corvair-based concept and show cars.\n\n* ''Corvair Monza'' - The first Corvair Monza was a Show car that pre-dated the production Monza.<ref name=\"knepperbook\"/>{{rp|110}} This two-door coupe was first seen at the Chicago Auto Show.\n* ''Corvair Super Monza'' - Mechanically unmodified, the Super Monza was an exercise ordered by Bill Mitchell that saw a 900 coupe fitted with a luxurious interior and special exterior paint and trim, including a sunroof and wire wheels.<ref name=\"mt-aug1960\"/> It debuted at the 1960 New York Auto Show.\n* ''XP-709 \"Pinky\"'' - The first Corvair convertible, this car was eventually given to Harley J.

Several members of the LeVeque family have raced the Velociraptor.\n* ''Lola T320'' \u2013 Built by Seth Emerson, the car started as pre-1976 Formula Vee chassis #19 and was lengthened by {{convert|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} to make room for the longer Corvair engine.<ref name=\"formulacar1\"/> A Crown Manufacturing adapter plate mated the engine to the Lola's Hewland transaxle. The engine was turbocharged.\n* ''E-Econo class dragster'' \u2013 The owner and engine builder was Ray Clayton. The chassis was built by Kenny Bowers at Advanced Chassis.<ref name=\"tca-dragster1\"/>\n* ''Silver Fox'' \u2013 An autocross car that was originally built by Brian Harding, the car was first sold to Gary Bailey and eventually to Dan Cole.<ref name=\"lvcc-may2016\"/> As part of restoring the car Cole had the engine bored and rebuilt by Bill Bamford.\n\n===Motorcycles===\nSeveral Corvair-powered motorcycles have been built by individual fabricators and bike shops. Some of the most well-known are listed below.\n\n* ''Corvair Trike'' - Built by Tom McMullen of AEE Choppers.<ref name=\"scw1\"/>\n* ''Grasshopper'' - Built by \"Wild\" Bill Gelbke.<ref name=\"grasshopper\"/>\n* ''Six-Pack'' - Built by Norm Grabowski.<ref name=\"sixpack\"/>\n\n===Off-road vehicles===\n* ''Manx-Vair and the Queen Manx'' - Actor Steve McQueen contracted off-road expert Pete Condos and his company Con-Ferr engineering to build a special car for \"The Thomas Crown Affair\" movie.<ref name=\"zimmbook\"/>{{rp|99}} Starting with a standard Meyers Manx, Condos and his staff modified the body and installed a 140-horsepower four-carburetor Corvair engine in the car to create the \"Queen Manx\". Con-Ferr and Meyers went on to build over 50 copies, called the \"Manx-Vair\".<ref name=\"sema1\"/> The car was later revived as the Hunter Buggy by Universal Fiberglass.<ref name=\"bangshift1\"/>\n* ''Deserter GS'' - Sold by Dearborn Automobile Company Inc., much of the engineering was done by a company called Autodynamics, which shared shop space with Dearborn Automobile. Autodynamics background building successful Formula Vee cars was reflected in the custom tubular chassis and VW-based suspension of the car. The Deserter GS was a mid-engined car, with a long-wheelbase that allowed the Turbo-Air 6 engine to be mounted ahead of the rear wheels.<ref name=\"lvcc-apr2014\"/>{{rp|2\u20134}}<ref name=\"lvcc-oct2015\"/><ref name=\"dearbornauto\"/>\n* ''Bugetta'' - A rear-engined Buggy built by veteran Indianapolis and Group 7 car builder Jerry Eisert and his company, Eisert Racing Enterprises. The Corvair engine was mounted in a unique monocoque chassis.<ref name=\"halehandbook\"/>{{rp|42\u201343}}\n* ''Trail Blazer'' - A four-wheel drive car designed by Vic Hickey of the Hickey Manufacturing Company, it is powered by a Corvair engine. The engine is mounted behind the front wheels in a front-mid-engine arrangement. Engine power goes back through a Borg-Warner three-speed transmission to a transfer case that corrects for engine rotation and sends power to the front and rear differentials.<ref name=\"mt-jul1961\"/><ref name=\"fw-jan1964\"/> General Motors bought the rights to the car, and hired Hickey. The Trail Blazer is considered by some to be the forerunner to the Chevrolet Blazer.<ref name=\"bj-lot256\"/>\n\n===Volkswagen conversions===\nSeveral options existed for adapting the Turbo-Air 6 engine to the transaxle in Volkswagen-based cars, or to fit a complete Corvair power-train into a modified VW chassis.\n\n* ''Crown Manufacturing'' - Sold adapters that allowed the Corvair engine to bolt directly up to a Volkswagen transaxle. This conversion required either flipping the pinion over to the other side of the transaxle case (on swing-axle VWs) or installing a Crown-supplied reverse-rotation camshaft (for IRS VWs) to compensate for the rotation of the Corvair engine.<ref name=\"fisherbook\"/>\n* ''Hadley Engineering'' - Developed a kit sold under the name \"Trans-Vair\". This product included a full sub-frame that allowed a complete Corvair powertrain to be installed in a modified Volkswagen chassis.<ref name=\"transvair\"/>\n* ''Lukes and Shorman'' - One of the first companies to offer a kit to adapt the Turbo-Air 6 to a Volkswagen transaxle.<ref name=\"lvcc-sep2018\"/> Lukes and Shorman produced an adapter plate of cast aluminum to mate the engine to the transaxle. The need to machine the flywheel end of the crankshaft was avoided by the use of a Porsche flywheel with a steel plate drilled to the Corvair bolt pattern welded into its centre. The clutch used was a VW commercial disc mated to the diaphragm pressure plate from a Porsche Carrera. Engine rotation was compensated for by flipping the ring gear to the other side of the transaxle. A revised starter was needed, and the early engines were converted to 6 volt operation to make them compatible with the electrical systems on early Volkswagens.\n\n===Motorhomes===\n* ''Travalon'' and ''UltraVan'' - Aircraft designer David Peterson created this monocoque-framed motorhome, built using aircraft methods.<ref name=\"ultravan1\"/> The early Travalon models built by the Prescolite Corporation were used as mobile showrooms. The UltraVan models were built by Ultra Inc. The vehicles were powered by either the {{convert|110|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} or, later, an optional {{convert|140|hp|kW|1|abbr=on}} version of the Corvair flat-six engine. Weighing about {{convert|3500|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}}, the Ultravan could cruise at {{convert|60|mph|kph|0|abbr=on}} and return fuel economy in the range of {{convert|15|\u2013|20|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"cc-ultravan\"/>\n\n===Military===\n* ''Canadair CL-91 / DynaTrac XM-571'' - A two-body amphibious track vehicle, the CL-91/XM-571 was powered by an industrial version of the Turbo-Air 6.<ref name=\"casr1\"/><ref name=\"bf-xm571\"/>\n* ''AGL-4'' - The Articulated General Purpose Logistical Truck was a prototype vehicle produced by GM Defense Research Laboratories.<ref name=\"autoweek-agl4\"/> Powered by a Corvair flat-six engine, the AGL-4 had an articulated joint between the cab and bed that allowed the two to rotate with respect to each other. It did not reach production.\n* ''[[Gama Goat]] XM561'' - Designed by Roger Gamaunt and built by the Chance-Vought Aircraft company, the Gama Goat was a six-wheel drive military vehicle with [[four-wheel steering]] and an articulated body.<ref name=\"sgamaa\"/> A Turbo-Air 6 engine powered two of the earliest prototypes, but was replaced by a Detroit Diesel 53 engine in the production version, which had the designation M561.\n* ''XM-808 Twister'' - Built by Lockheed Ground Vehicles, the first prototype of this eight-wheeled dual-body military off-roader used two {{convert|2683|cc|L cuin|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Corvair engines \u2014 one in front and one in back \u2014 to propel the vehicle.<ref name=\"hemmings-twist\"/><ref name=\"ps-aug1968\"/>\n\n===Marine===\n* ''Wayne 100 inboard marine engine'' - This was a version of the Corvair pancake six engine adapted to marine use by Wayne F. Horning and his company, Inboard Marine.<ref name=\"marinepatent\"/> The engine was installed vertically, flywheel end up, and drove a lower unit that went through the bottom of the hull. The engines were first put in 16 foot Glasspar Avalons, and later in Tahiti hulls.\n\n===Scientific prototypes===\n* ''MGL/MOLAB'' - The Mobile Geological Laboratory was a test platform for lunar exploration powered by a modified Corvair engine. The vehicle was designed and built by Vic Hickey while at General Motors.<ref name=\"hemmings-nov2012\"/><ref name=\"vox-lunar\"/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[File:PantherLSA.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Sport Performance Aviation Panther]] airframe under construction, fitted with a Corvair engine]]\nThe air-cooled Corvair engine has been widely used in [[homebuilt aircraft]]. Some aircraft, such as the [[Pro-Composites Personal Cruiser]] have been specifically designed for them.<ref name=\"WDLA11\"/> The defunct American company [[Hegy Propellers]], which was based in [[Marfa, Texas]], produced propellers specifically for Corvair engines.<ref name=\"Aerocrafter\"/>\n\nA variation on the six-cylinder engine is an opposed-twin version based on the Corvair pancake six.<ref name=\"tca\"/><ref name=\"ultraligero\"/> Some individuals have also experimented with inline-triple configurations based on half of a Turbo-Air six.<ref name=\"fly-news\"/>\n\n====Aircraft applications====\n*[[Ace Baby Ace]]<ref name=\"babyace\"/>\n*[[AMD Zodiac]]<ref name=\"Zenith650Corvair\"/>\n*[[Azalea Saberwing]]<ref name=\"WDLA15\"/>\n*[[Bowers Fly Baby]]<ref name=\"corvairflybaby\"/>\n*[[Custom Flight Lite Star]]<ref name=\"KitplanesDec2011\"/>\n*[[Pietenpol Air Camper]]<ref name=\"airtrails-w71\"/>\n*[[Pro-Composites Personal Cruiser]]<ref name=\"WDLA11\"/>\n*[[Sport Performance Aviation Panther]]<ref name=\"spa1\"/>\n*[[ZenithAir CH601]]<ref name=\"zenair601\"/>\n*[[ZenithAir CH750]]<ref name=\"zenair750\"/>\n\n==Engine Serial Number Codes==\nThe following codes (last two characters of engine serial number) identify the year, size, power, and transmission of the engine<ref name=\"tca-codes\"/>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*YC 6 cyl with M/T, 1962-64 \n*YH 6 cyl with M/T, 1962 \n*YL 6 cyl with M/T A/C, 1962-64 \n*YM 6 cyl with A/C HPE, 1962-63 \n*YM 6 cyl with T/C 4 sp Tr, 1964 \n*YN 6 cyl with M/T HPE, 1962-64 \n*YR 6 cyl with T/C 4 sp fr, 1962\n*Z 6 cyl with A/T, 1960-64 \n*ZB 6 cyl with A/T, 1962 \n*ZD 6 cyl with A/T A/C, 1962-64 \n*ZF 6 cyl with A/T HPE, 1962-64 \n*ZG 6 cyl with A/T, A/C, HPE, 1962-64 \n*ZH 6 cyl with A/T, 1962-64 \n*ZJ 6 cyl with A/T, A/C, 1962\n*Y 6 cyl with M/T HPE, 1962-63 \n*RL 6-164 with T/C, 1966 \n*RM 6-164 with M/T, SHPE, 1965-67 \n*RN 6-164 with SHPE, P/G, 1965-67 \n*RQ 6-164 with SHPE, AIR, 1966-67 \n*RR 6-164 with A/C, 1966 \n*RS 6-164 with M/T, AIR, 1965-68 \n*RS 6-164 with AIR, 1966 \n*RU 6-164 with M/T, HPE, AIR, 1965-68 \n*RV 6-164 with P/G, AIR, 1965-68 \n*RW 6-164 with HPE, AIR, P/G, 1966-68 \n*RX 6-164 with P/G, HPE, AIR, 1965-67 \n*RY 6-164 with A/C, SHPE, 1966-67 \n*RZ 6-164 with SHPE, A/C, 1966-67 \n*RA 6-164 with M/T and A/T, 1965-67 \n*RB 6-164, 1965-66 \n*RD 6-164 with HPE, 1965-67 \n*RE 6-164 with A/C, 1965-68 \n*RF 6-164 with HPE, A/C, 1965-68 \n*RG 6-164 with P/G, 1965-67 \n*RH 6-164 with P/G, HPE, 1965-67 \n*RJ 6-164 with P/G, A/C, 1965-68 \n*RK 6-164 with P/G, HPE, A/C, 1965-68 \n*QO 6-164 with P/G, AIR, A/C, 1967 \n*QP 6-164 with HPE, P/G, AIR, A/C, 1967 \n*QQ 6-164 with SHPE, AIR, A/C, 1967 \n*QR 6-164 with SHPE, AIR, A/C, P/G, 1967 \n*QS 6-164 with HPE, AIR, A/C, 1967\n}}\n\n;Terms\n* A/C - Air Conditioning\n* AIR - Air Injection Reactor\n* A/T - Automatic Transmission\n* HPE - High Performance Engine\n* P/G: Power-Glide automatic transmission.\n* SHPE - Special High Performance Engine\n* T/C - Turbo-Charged\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!
