{"title_page": "List of attacks related to secondary schools", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nThis is a '''list of attacks related to secondary schools''' that have occurred around the world. These are attacks that have occurred on school property or related primarily to school issues or events. A narrow definition of the word ''attacks'' is used for this list so as to exclude warfare, robberies, gang violence, public attacks (as in political protests), accidental shootings, and [[suicide]]s and [[murder\u2013suicide]]s by rejected spouses or suitors. Incidents that involved only staff who work at the school have been classified as belonging at [[List of rampage killers|List of workplace killings]]. It also excludes events where no injuries take place, if an attack is foiled.\n\nThe listed attacks include [[shooting]]s, [[stabbing]]s, [[Cutting|slashings]], [[bombing]]s, and [[Battery (crime)|beatings]] administered with [[blunt instrument]]s.\n\n==Secondary school incidents==\n\n===1850s===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:85px;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:75px;\"| Attacker(s)\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Dead{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:75px;\"| Injured{{r|group=lower-alpha|note_a}}\n!

It triumphantly exemplifies the nature, tendency, and results of Christian non-resistance. We are curious to know whether Mrs. Stowe is a believer in the duty of non-resistance for the White man, under all possible outrage and peril, as for the Black man ... [For whites in parallel circumstances, it is often said] Talk not of overcoming evil with good\u2014it is madness! Talk not of peacefully submitting to chains and stripes\u2014it is base servility! Talk not of servants being obedient to their masters\u2014let the blood of tyrants flow! How is this to be explained or reconciled? Is there one law of submission and non-resistance for the Black man, and another of rebellion and conflict for the white man? When it is the whites who are trodden in the dust, does Christ justify them in taking up arms to vindicate their rights? And when it is the blacks who are thus treated, does Christ require them to be patient, harmless, long-suffering, and forgiving?

Talk not of servants being obedient to their masters\u2014let the blood of tyrants flow! How is this to be explained or reconciled? Is there one law of submission and non-resistance for the Black man, and another of rebellion and conflict for the white man?

From 2012 onwards, the winner has been chosen by an LSA jury. [[Tere Pyaar Mein]] was the first winner. Every year, LSA jury short lists number of films between 1 and 10. Only those short listed films are nominated in the ceremony. Usually, five films are nominated for Best Film. In 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011, no nominations were announced due to lack of films releases. In 2010 and 2012, no award was given because jury did not find any film worth winning. Three films were nominated in 2001, 2002 and 2008. In 2013, four films were nominated for the award. \n=== Best Film and Best Director ===\nBest Film and Best Director are closely linked.

The awards celebrate \"style\" in the Pakistani entertainment industry, and it is the oldest event dedicated to [[Cinema of Pakistan|cinema]], [[television in Pakistan|television]], [[Pakistani clothing|fashion]], [[music of Pakistan|music]] and [[film industry]] in Pakistan. Categories have changed over the years, but most are awarded by panels of judges who are experts in the respective industries, with some \"people's choice\" awards in the film and TV categories.\n\nThe ceremonies, which are televised, have usually been held in [[Karachi]], but in some years have taken place in [[Lahore]], [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Dubai]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Lux Style Awards were conceptualised and created in 2002 by Naheed Chowdhry, the female executive who headed the [[Unilever Pakistan Limited|Unilever]] Lux team at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onfrontiers.com/profile/nchowdhry|title=Naheed Chowdhry|website=On Frontiers|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref> in collaboration with Frieha Altaf, TV and event producer and former model.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siddysays.com/interview-frieha-altaf/|title=In Conversation With Frieha Altaf|website=SiddySays|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.somethinghaute.com/lux-style-awards-3/|title=Why the show must go on!|website=Haute|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> It is the largest annual awards ceremony held in Pakistan as well as the oldest.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.siddysays.com/the-siddysays-winners-of-lux-style-awards-2019/|title=The Siddysays Winners Of Lux Style Awards 2019|website=SiddySays|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parhlo.com/unforgettable-highlights-lux-style-awards-2018/|website=parhlo|title=7 Major Highlights of LUX Style Awards 2018 Which Are Absolutely Unforgettable|first=Zain |last=Kazi|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first awards were presented in 2002 at the [[Karachi Naval Dockyard|Naval Base]] in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] due to heightened security and high-profile attendance. The Awards Ceremony was preceded by seven days of exhibitions and fashion shows at different smaller venues throughout Karachi and on [[Manora, Karachi|Manora island]], as a build-up to the final show. Since 2002, the event has been condensed to three days, hosting various events and activities relating to the [[Cinema of Pakistan|Pakistan film industry]].{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ceremony was postponed in 2008 owing to security concerns and economic conditions, and in the same year, it was decided to provide annual scholarships to students of the National College of Arts (TV and Film), National Academy of Performing Arts (Music) and to two fashion schools.<ref name=\"casualty\">{{cite news | url = http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Lahore/01-Aug-2008/Showbiz-events-latest-casualty | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110112100059/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Lahore/01-Aug-2008/Showbiz-events-latest-casualty/ | archivedate = 6 March 2016 | title = Showbiz events latest casualty | author =  Emanuel Sarfraz | date = 2008-08-01 | publisher = The Nation }}</ref>\n\nPeople's Choice awards for best actor and actress had originally been added to engage audiences viewing the show, but in 2019 it was decided to add critics' choice awards for these categories as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://images.dawn.com/news/1181452|website=Images Dawn|title=The LSAs just introduced critics choice awards|first=Maliha|last= Rehman|date=11 December 2018|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\nThe Lux Awards have been televised in most years.<ref>{{cite web|website=IMDb|url=https://www.imdb.com/find?ref_=nv_sr_fn&q=lux+style+awards&s=all|title=Results for \"lux style awards\"|accessdate=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Ceremonies ==\nThe following is a listing of all Lux Style Awards ceremonies since 2002.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

From 2012 onwards, the winner has been chosen by an LSA jury. [[Tere Pyaar Mein]] was the first winner. Every year, LSA jury short lists number of films between 1 and 10. Only those short listed films are nominated in the ceremony. Usually, five films are nominated for Best Film. In 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2011, no nominations were announced due to lack of films releases. In 2010 and 2012, no award was given because jury did not find any film worth winning. Three films were nominated in 2001, 2002 and 2008. In 2013, four films were nominated for the award. \n=== Best Film and Best Director ===\nBest Film and Best Director are closely linked.
