A settlement known as \"New Town\" grew in the area around the college which in 1831 was renamed Yorktown, after [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Philip Ralph Johnston |url=http://www.philipjohnston.com/rmas/history.htm |title=History of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst |publisher=Philipjohnston.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> At this time, the population was 702. In 1848, the first [[parish church]] of St. Michael, Yorktown was built by [[Henry Woodyer]], in an area formerly part of [[Frimley]], itself only a [[chapelry]] of [[Ash, Surrey|Ash]].\n\nLater, the [[Staff College, Camberley|Staff College]] was established to the east of the Academy, and a property speculator built the nearby Cambridge Hotel. The surrounding area became known as Cambridge Town, but was renamed \"Camberley\" in January 1877 to avoid confusion by the [[General Post Office]] with [[Cambridge]] in Cambridgeshire. The renaming of Camberley was mentioned in the 1963 film adaptation of [[William Golding]]'s ''[[Lord of the Flies (1963 film)|Lord of the Flies]]''. The character [[Lord of the Flies#Piggy|Piggy]] states that the new name consisted of three parts; \"Cam\" taken from the original name of Cambridgetown, \"ber\" which means 'river', because there are many rivers in the area, and \"ley\" because it is a common ending for English town names in the area (as in neighbouring [[Frimley]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/l/lord-of-the-flies-script.html |title=Film script for Lord of the Flies |publisher=Script-o-rama.com |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref> although the name was actually derived from the \"Cam\" stream which runs through the town (mainly underground), \"Amber\" Hill which was marked on [[John Norden]]'s map of the area in 1607 and \"ley\" usually meaning a clearing in the woodland.<ref>George C. B. Poulter, ''The History of Camberley'', 1937</ref> Hugh Edwards, the child actor who played Piggy, attended Camberley Primary School which was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the town centre redevelopment.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Camberley grew in size. This was given added impetus with the arrival of the branch-line railway and [[Camberley railway station|railway station]] in 1878 and a reputation for healthy air, due to the vast number of pine trees, which were said to be good for those suffering from [[pulmonary disorder]]s. By the end of the century the population had reached 8,400. Since then, the town has absorbed the original settlement of Yorktown, which is now regarded as part of Camberley.\n\n===20th century===\nThe Southern Scott Scramble, the first known [[motorcycle scrambling]] event, took place on Camberley Heath on 29 March 1924. The event, won by A.B. Sparks, attracted a crowd in the thousands and is considered to be the first instance of what later developed in the sport of [[motocross]]. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Old Dean]] common was used as an instruction camp of the Free French Forces. The [[Kremer prize]] was conceived in the Cambridge Hotel in Camberley in 1959 after Henry Kremer toured a Microcell factory.\n\nBarossa Golf Club (now defunct) was located on Barossa Common. The club was founded in 1893 and continued until WW2.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=802 \u201cBarossa Golf Club, Camberley\u201d], \u201cGolf\u2019s Missing Links\u201d.</ref>\n\nThe Old Dean housing estate was built in the 1950s on the \"Old Dean Common\" for residents of heavily bombed Surrey-area's homeless after World War II. Many of the roads on that half of the Old Dean are named after areas of London, with the others named after places on the common.\n\nCamberley falls under the siren test area of [[Broadmoor Hospital]], a secure mental hospital in nearby [[Crowthorne]]. The siren was installed following a public outcry at the escape of child-murderer [[John Thomas Straffen]] in April 1952. The siren is still tested every Monday at 10am.\n\nIn 1969 there was an outbreak of [[rabies]] when a dog, just released from a sixth month [[quarantine]] after returning from Germany, attacked two people on Camberley Common. The scare resulted in restriction orders for dogs and large-scale shoots to carry out the destruction of foxes and other wildlife.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.historytoday.com/neil-pemberton/mad-dogs-and-englishmen|title=Mad Dogs and Englishmen|magazine=History Today|issue=9|volume=57|author=Neil Pemberton|year=2007|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nAfter debate and delay (plans having been discussed for over half a decade), in 2006, a {{convert|7|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed-use development west of Park Street named The Atrium was built of residential, leisure and retail buildings with wide pedestrianised areas and 683 public parking spaces. Its 217 mid-rise apartments split into courtyards in the [[Barcelona]] style.  Fourteen new retail units face directly onto Park Street, opposite the Main Square shopping centre. Park Street has been [[pedestrianised]] and landscaped as part of the development. Leisure facilities include a nine-screen cinema, a [[bowling alley]], a health and fitness club, caf\u00e9s and restaurants. Various elements of The Atrium was opened during 2008, with the final elements, the main cinema and bowling alley, opening in October and November 2008, respectively.<ref>[http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/council/theatrium/default.htm Surrey Heath Website \u2013 Atrium Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719115737/http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/council/theatrium/default.htm |date=19 July 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, the town's households were named by [[Experian]] as having the highest [[carbon footprint]] in the UK, estimated at 28.05 tonnes per household per year (compared to 18.36 tonnes for the lowest, South Shields).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.experian.co.uk/search/index.html?cx=018221729092257204127%3A2-4ig1wazeo&cof=FORID%3A10%3BNB%3A1&ie=UTF-8&q=camberley&sa.x=0&sa.y=0&sa=Search|title=Carbon footprint |publisher=Experian.co.uk |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCamberley is in the far west of Surrey, adjacent to the boundaries of [[Hampshire]]'s [[Hart district]] and [[Berkshire]]'s [[Bracknell Forest]] district.

It is at the northern edge of the [[Blackwater Valley]] conurbation, {{convert|5|mi|km}} north of [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} south of [[Bracknell]] and {{convert|17|mi|km}} east of [[Basingstoke]].\n\nThe smaller town of [[Frimley]], being so close to Camberley, is often regarded as part of the town, although the two are, for the most part, separated by the M3 motorway. Frimley has its own town centre, a major regional hospital ([[Frimley Park Hospital|Frimley Park]]) and extensive suburban areas. In the 19th century, York Town and Camberley were in the ecclesiastical parish of Frimley.\n\nThe exurb [[Blackwater, Hampshire|Blackwater]], {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west is identified by the Government Statistical Service (including its ONS office) as within the Built-up-Area but is in the Hart District of Hampshire and has its own town council (both take in [[Hawley, Hampshire|Hawley]]). The same could be said for [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]] which is home of \"The Meadows\" retail park which is in the Bracknell Forest borough of [[Berkshire]].

Poulter, ''The History of Camberley'', 1937</ref> Hugh Edwards, the child actor who played Piggy, attended Camberley Primary School which was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the town centre redevelopment.\n\nDuring the 19th century, Camberley grew in size. This was given added impetus with the arrival of the branch-line railway and [[Camberley railway station|railway station]] in 1878 and a reputation for healthy air, due to the vast number of pine trees, which were said to be good for those suffering from [[pulmonary disorder]]s. By the end of the century the population had reached 8,400. Since then, the town has absorbed the original settlement of Yorktown, which is now regarded as part of Camberley.\n\n===20th century===\nThe Southern Scott Scramble, the first known [[motorcycle scrambling]] event, took place on Camberley Heath on 29 March 1924. The event, won by A.B. Sparks, attracted a crowd in the thousands and is considered to be the first instance of what later developed in the sport of [[motocross]]. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Old Dean]] common was used as an instruction camp of the Free French Forces. The [[Kremer prize]] was conceived in the Cambridge Hotel in Camberley in 1959 after Henry Kremer toured a Microcell factory.\n\nBarossa Golf Club (now defunct) was located on Barossa Common. The club was founded in 1893 and continued until WW2.<ref>[http://www.golfsmissinglinks.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=802 \u201cBarossa Golf Club, Camberley\u201d], \u201cGolf\u2019s Missing Links\u201d.</ref>\n\nThe Old Dean housing estate was built in the 1950s on the \"Old Dean Common\" for residents of heavily bombed Surrey-area's homeless after World War II. Many of the roads on that half of the Old Dean are named after areas of London, with the others named after places on the common.\n\nCamberley falls under the siren test area of [[Broadmoor Hospital]], a secure mental hospital in nearby [[Crowthorne]]. The siren was installed following a public outcry at the escape of child-murderer [[John Thomas Straffen]] in April 1952. The siren is still tested every Monday at 10am.\n\nIn 1969 there was an outbreak of [[rabies]] when a dog, just released from a sixth month [[quarantine]] after returning from Germany, attacked two people on Camberley Common. The scare resulted in restriction orders for dogs and large-scale shoots to carry out the destruction of foxes and other wildlife.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.historytoday.com/neil-pemberton/mad-dogs-and-englishmen|title=Mad Dogs and Englishmen|magazine=History Today|issue=9|volume=57|author=Neil Pemberton|year=2007|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\nAfter debate and delay (plans having been discussed for over half a decade), in 2006, a {{convert|7|acre|ha|adj=on}} mixed-use development west of Park Street named The Atrium was built of residential, leisure and retail buildings with wide pedestrianised areas and 683 public parking spaces. Its 217 mid-rise apartments split into courtyards in the [[Barcelona]] style.  Fourteen new retail units face directly onto Park Street, opposite the Main Square shopping centre. Park Street has been [[pedestrianised]] and landscaped as part of the development. Leisure facilities include a nine-screen cinema, a [[bowling alley]], a health and fitness club, caf\u00e9s and restaurants.

Frimley has its own town centre, a major regional hospital ([[Frimley Park Hospital|Frimley Park]]) and extensive suburban areas. In the 19th century, York Town and Camberley were in the ecclesiastical parish of Frimley.\n\nThe exurb [[Blackwater, Hampshire|Blackwater]], {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west is identified by the Government Statistical Service (including its ONS office) as within the Built-up-Area but is in the Hart District of Hampshire and has its own town council (both take in [[Hawley, Hampshire|Hawley]]). The same could be said for [[Sandhurst, Berkshire|Sandhurst]] which is home of \"The Meadows\" retail park which is in the Bracknell Forest borough of [[Berkshire]].

He was placed under house arrest with his family by the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], and the family was surrounded by guards and confined to their quarters.<ref>Tames, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn August 1917, [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s provisional government evacuated the Romanovs to [[Tobolsk]], Siberia, allegedly to protect them from the rising tide of revolution. There they lived in the [[Governor's Mansion (Tobolsk, Russia)|former governor's mansion]] in considerable comfort. After the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter. Talk in the government of putting Nicholas on trial grew more frequent. Nicholas was forbidden to wear [[epaulette]]s, and the sentries scrawled lewd drawings on the fence to offend his daughters. On 1 March 1918, the family was placed on soldiers' rations. Their 10 servants were dismissed, and they had to give up butter and coffee.<ref>Tames, p. 62.</ref> \n\nAs the [[Bolsheviks]] gathered strength, the government in April moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and their daughter Maria to [[Yekaterinburg]] under the direction of [[Vasily Yakovlev]]. Alexei, who had severe [[haemophilia]], was too ill to accompany his parents and remained with his sisters Olga, Tatiana, and Anastasia, not leaving Tobolsk until May 1918. The family was imprisoned with a few remaining retainers in Yekaterinburg's [[Ipatiev House]], which was designated The House of Special Purpose ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u043e\u043c \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f}}).\n[[File:Grand Duchess Tatiana carrying a litter of dirt during internment at Tsarskoe-Selo 1917.jpg|thumb|Nicholas II, Tatiana and [[Countess Anastasia Hendrikova|Anastasia Hendrikova]] working on a [[kitchen garden]] at Alexander Palace in May 1917.

The senior aides were retained but were designated to guard the hallway area and no longer had access to the Romanovs' rooms; only Yurovsky's men had it. The local Cheka chose replacements from the volunteer battalions of the Verkh-Isetsk factory at Yurovsky's request. He wanted dedicated Bolsheviks who could be relied on to do whatever was asked of them. They were hired on the understanding that they would be prepared, if necessary, to kill the tsar, about which they were sworn to secrecy. Nothing at that stage was said about killing the family or servants. To prevent a repetition of the [[fraternization]] that had occurred under Avdeev, Yurovsky chose mainly foreigners. Nicholas noted in his diary on 8 July that \"new [[Latvians]] are standing guard\", describing them as ''Letts'' \u2013 a term commonly used in Russia to classify someone as of European, non-Russian origin. The leader of the new guards was Adolf Lepa, a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].<ref>Rappaport, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nThe Romanovs were being held by the Red Army in Yekaterinburg, since the Bolsheviks initially wanted to put them on trial. As the civil war continued and the White Army (a loose alliance of anti-Communist forces) was threatening to capture the city, the fear was that the Romanovs would fall into White hands. This was unacceptable to the Bolsheviks for two reasons: first, the tsar or any of his family members could provide a beacon to rally support to the White cause; second, the tsar, or any of his family members if the tsar were dead, would be considered the legitimate ruler of Russia by the other European nations. This would have given the Whites some power to negotiate for greater foreign intervention on their behalf. Soon after the family was executed, Yekaterinburg fell to the White Army. \n\nIn mid-July 1918, forces of the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] were closing on Yekaterinburg, to protect the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], of which they had control. According to historian David Bullock, the Bolsheviks, falsely believing that the Czechoslovaks were on a mission to rescue the family, panicked and executed their wards.

He took a Mauser and Colt while Ermakov armed himself with three Nagants, one Mauser and a bayonet; he was the only one assigned to kill two prisoners (Alexandra and Botkin). Yurovsky instructed his men to \"shoot straight at the heart to avoid an excessive quantity of blood and get it over quickly.\"<ref>Montefiore, p. 644.</ref> At least two of the Letts, an [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] [[prisoner of war]] named Andras Verhas and Adolf Lepa, himself in charge of the Lett contingent, refused to shoot the women.

The Empress and Grand Duchess Olga, according to a guard's reminiscence, had tried to [[Sign of the Cross|bless]] themselves, but failed amid the shooting. Yurovsky reportedly raised his Colt gun at Nicholas's torso and fired; Nicholas fell dead, pierced with at least three bullets in his upper chest. The intoxicated [[Peter Ermakov]], the military commissar for Verkh-Isetsk, shot and killed Alexandra with a bullet wound to the head.

The ''Biographical Chronicle'' of Lenin's political life confirms that first Lenin (between 6 and 7 pm) and then Lenin and Sverdlov together (between 9:30 and 11:50 pm) had direct telegraph contact with the Ural Soviets about Yakovlev's change of route. Despite Yakovlev's request to take the family further away to the more remote Simsky Gorny District in Ufa province (where they could hide in the mountains), warning that \"the baggage\" would be destroyed if given to the Ural Soviets, Lenin and Sverdlov were adamant that they be brought to Yekaterinburg.<ref>Rappaport, p. 139.</ref> On 16 July, the editors of a Danish newspaper queried Lenin to \"kindly wire facts\" in regards to a rumour that Nicholas II \"has been murdered\"; he responded, \"Rumor not true.

He was placed under house arrest with his family by the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], and the family was surrounded by guards and confined to their quarters.<ref>Tames, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn August 1917, [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s provisional government evacuated the Romanovs to [[Tobolsk]], Siberia, allegedly to protect them from the rising tide of revolution. There they lived in the [[Governor's Mansion (Tobolsk, Russia)|former governor's mansion]] in considerable comfort. After the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter. Talk in the government of putting Nicholas on trial grew more frequent. Nicholas was forbidden to wear [[epaulette]]s, and the sentries scrawled lewd drawings on the fence to offend his daughters. On 1 March 1918, the family was placed on soldiers' rations. Their 10 servants were dismissed, and they had to give up butter and coffee.<ref>Tames, p. 62.</ref> \n\nAs the [[Bolsheviks]] gathered strength, the government in April moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and their daughter Maria to [[Yekaterinburg]] under the direction of [[Vasily Yakovlev]]. Alexei, who had severe [[haemophilia]], was too ill to accompany his parents and remained with his sisters Olga, Tatiana, and Anastasia, not leaving Tobolsk until May 1918. The family was imprisoned with a few remaining retainers in Yekaterinburg's [[Ipatiev House]], which was designated The House of Special Purpose ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u043e\u043c \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f}}).\n[[File:Grand Duchess Tatiana carrying a litter of dirt during internment at Tsarskoe-Selo 1917.jpg|thumb|Nicholas II, Tatiana and [[Countess Anastasia Hendrikova|Anastasia Hendrikova]] working on a [[kitchen garden]] at Alexander Palace in May 1917.

The senior aides were retained but were designated to guard the hallway area and no longer had access to the Romanovs' rooms; only Yurovsky's men had it. The local Cheka chose replacements from the volunteer battalions of the Verkh-Isetsk factory at Yurovsky's request. He wanted dedicated Bolsheviks who could be relied on to do whatever was asked of them. They were hired on the understanding that they would be prepared, if necessary, to kill the tsar, about which they were sworn to secrecy. Nothing at that stage was said about killing the family or servants. To prevent a repetition of the [[fraternization]] that had occurred under Avdeev, Yurovsky chose mainly foreigners. Nicholas noted in his diary on 8 July that \"new [[Latvians]] are standing guard\", describing them as ''Letts'' \u2013 a term commonly used in Russia to classify someone as of European, non-Russian origin. The leader of the new guards was Adolf Lepa, a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].<ref>Rappaport, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nThe Romanovs were being held by the Red Army in Yekaterinburg, since the Bolsheviks initially wanted to put them on trial. As the civil war continued and the White Army (a loose alliance of anti-Communist forces) was threatening to capture the city, the fear was that the Romanovs would fall into White hands. This was unacceptable to the Bolsheviks for two reasons: first, the tsar or any of his family members could provide a beacon to rally support to the White cause; second, the tsar, or any of his family members if the tsar were dead, would be considered the legitimate ruler of Russia by the other European nations. This would have given the Whites some power to negotiate for greater foreign intervention on their behalf. Soon after the family was executed, Yekaterinburg fell to the White Army. \n\nIn mid-July 1918, forces of the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] were closing on Yekaterinburg, to protect the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], of which they had control. According to historian David Bullock, the Bolsheviks, falsely believing that the Czechoslovaks were on a mission to rescue the family, panicked and executed their wards.

He took a Mauser and Colt while Ermakov armed himself with three Nagants, one Mauser and a bayonet; he was the only one assigned to kill two prisoners (Alexandra and Botkin). Yurovsky instructed his men to \"shoot straight at the heart to avoid an excessive quantity of blood and get it over quickly.\"<ref>Montefiore, p. 644.</ref> At least two of the Letts, an [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] [[prisoner of war]] named Andras Verhas and Adolf Lepa, himself in charge of the Lett contingent, refused to shoot the women.

The Empress and Grand Duchess Olga, according to a guard's reminiscence, had tried to [[Sign of the Cross|bless]] themselves, but failed amid the shooting. Yurovsky reportedly raised his Colt gun at Nicholas's torso and fired; Nicholas fell dead, pierced with at least three bullets in his upper chest. The intoxicated [[Peter Ermakov]], the military commissar for Verkh-Isetsk, shot and killed Alexandra with a bullet wound to the head.

The ''Biographical Chronicle'' of Lenin's political life confirms that first Lenin (between 6 and 7 pm) and then Lenin and Sverdlov together (between 9:30 and 11:50 pm) had direct telegraph contact with the Ural Soviets about Yakovlev's change of route. Despite Yakovlev's request to take the family further away to the more remote Simsky Gorny District in Ufa province (where they could hide in the mountains), warning that \"the baggage\" would be destroyed if given to the Ural Soviets, Lenin and Sverdlov were adamant that they be brought to Yekaterinburg.<ref>Rappaport, p. 139.</ref> On 16 July, the editors of a Danish newspaper queried Lenin to \"kindly wire facts\" in regards to a rumour that Nicholas II \"has been murdered\"; he responded, \"Rumor not true.

Bilaspur is the administrative headquarters of Bilaspur District and Bilaspur Division. The [[Chhattisgarh High Court]], located at Bodri, District Bilaspur has privileged it with the title 'Nyayadhani' (Law Capital) of the state.  This city is the commercial center and business hub of North East [[Chhattisgarh]] region. It is also an important city for the [[Indian Railways]], as it is the headquarters for [[South East Central Railway Zone (India)|South East Central Railway Zone]] and the Bilaspur Railway Division. Bilaspur is 3rd cleanest and 4th longest railway station in India. Bilaspur is also the headquarters of [[South Eastern Coalfields Limited]].NTPC, Sipat is near Bilaspur too.\n\nBilaspur is known for its aromatic rice variety named Doobraj [[rice]], [[loom|handloom]] [[woven]] colourful soft Kosa [[silk]] [[sari]]s. Basic Tasar Silkworm Seed Organisation (BTSSO) {{URL|http://www.btsso.org/}} under the Central Silk Board, Government of India collects, executes the production and supply of nucleus and basic Tasar seed from surrounding areas.\n\nBilaspur has been selected as one of the 100 Indian cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under the [[Smart Cities Mission]].<ref>{{cite web |work=firstpost.com |url= http://www.firstpost.com/business/why-only-98-cities-instead-of-100-announced-all-questions-answered-about-smart-cities-project-2410576.html |title=Why only 98 cities instead of 100 announced: All questions answered about smart cities project |date= 28 August 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, Bilaspur was controlled by the [[Kalachuris of Ratnapura|Kalachuri dynasty]] of [[Ratanpur]]. The city, however, came into prominence around 1741, the year of the [[Maratha Empire]] rule, when a Maratha official took up his abode there.\n\nThe management of Bilaspur district was taken over by the [[British East India Company]]  in 1818 after [[Bhosale]] lost territory in [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. Under Bhosale of the Nagpur kingdom there were many subedars or zamindars/landlords like Akbar Khan, Vazeer Khan, Sao and others in Bilaspur.\n\nBilaspur district was constituted in 1861, followed by Bilaspur municipality in 1867. Famines in the Bilaspur district were recorded by the British administration in 1828\u20139, 1834\u20135, 1845\u20136, 1868\u20139 and 1899\u20131900. In 1868-9 and 1899\u20131900, the rains failed almost completely, resulting in severe distress, migration and desertion of villages. After the 1868-9 famine there was prosperity for the next 25 years; but in 1895 there was a very poor harvest, followed in 1896 by a complete failure of crops, and severe famine continued throughout 1897. In that year the mortality rate was as high as one in six people. The famine of 1897 was followed by two favorable years; but in 1899 the [[monsoon]] failed completely and the rice crop was wholly destroyed.\n\n[[Satguru Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]] (1756\u20131836) started a religious movement, Satnamis (meaning the worshippers of [[Satnam]]), between 1820 and 1830 primarily around the Sonakhan forests. This religious movement preached against idol-worship, and instead stressed that God is synonymous with truth. His community was a farming community. The university at Bilaspur is named after him as [[Guru Ghasidas University]].\n\nRailways arrived at Bilaspur in the decade 1880\u201390, with the arrival of the [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]]. In 1888 [[Mistri]] Jagmal Gangji and other [[Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas contributions to the Indian railways#1880-1890|Mistri Railway Contractors]] laid the first railway tracks from [[Rajnandgaon]] to Bilaspur, and in that same year fellow [[Kutchi people|Kutchi]] contractor [[Khoda Ramji Chawda|Khoda Ramji]] and others built the line from Bilaspur to [[Jharsuguda]], including the bridge over the Champa river.\n\nIn 1890, the present railway station and yard were constructed by the Gujarati railway contractor Jagmal Gangji. His son [[Mulji Jagmal Sawaria]] was later given the title of \"Rao Sahib\" by the British for his contribution to the development of the town, railways and the district. Jagmal Block and Jagmal Chowk in the city are named after Jagmal Gangji Sawaria.\n\nThe first newspaper in the state of Chhattisgarh was \"Chhattisgarh Mitra\".  Madhava Rao Sapre published in 1900 as a monthly magazine from pendra road (Bilaspur).  This newspaper was published for 3 years.\n\nIn 1901, the population of Bilaspur was 18,937 and it was the eighth-largest town in the [[Central Provinces]] of [[British India]]. In 1908, weaving of tasar silk and cotton clothes were recorded as the major industries of Bilaspur.\n\nBilaspur enjoys the distinctiveness of being one of the major cities in Chhattisgarh with considerable historical significance. Located in the eastern part of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur is nearly four centuries old. Referred to as the \"Rice Bowl of India\", Bilaspur abounds in lush greenery and boasts of a myriad number of tourist attractions. If the historical records are to be given any credence, then there is no reason to disbelieve the fact that Bilaspur owes its name to a fisherwoman, Bilasa in the 17th century. Bilaspur during that time and for many more years to come remained a fishing hamlet consisting of a few fishermen's huts. According to the census conducted in 1901, the total population of Bilaspur was somewhere around 18,937 and it was considered the 8th largest town in the Central Provinces of British India. One interesting fact that one comes across while flipping through pages of history is that even as early as in 1908, Bilaspur had already made a mark as home to the major tasar silk and cotton clothes manufacturers.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh.jpg|thumb|Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]]\nHistorical records like [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V08_239.gif ''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', Vol 8, 1908] note that the city is said to be named after a fisherwoman by the name of \"Bilasa\" in the 17th century, and for a long period it consisted only of a few fishermen's huts.\n\n== Geography ==\nBilaspur is located at {{Coord|22.09|N|82.15|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/37/Bilaspur.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Bilaspur]</ref> It has an average elevation of 264&nbsp;metres (866&nbsp;ft).\n\nBilaspur is situated on the banks of the rain-fed Arpa River, which originates from the high hills of the [[Maikal Hills|Maikal]] Range of central India.

An integrated action plan for development of civic infrastructure, including hi-tech water purifier system, proper drainage facilities and cleanliness, is being planned by the state government for cities and towns, while the proposed 'Arpa Project' would give a new life to the city of Bilaspur, minister for urban administration and health Amar Agrawal said in an interview to the ''Times of India'', a leading newspaper of India. The State Government has drawn up an ambitious plan of Rs2,000 crore to develop the Arpa river bank in Bilaspur district during the next seven years. For this, the Government has constituted a \u2018Special Area Development Authority\u2019 (SADA) for the development of the Arpa river bank near Bilaspur city.\n\nThe Government has invited proposals from interested national and international institutions for the development of the river bank on a PPP model. The Authority has prepared a project for the development of the river and is now in search of organisations that would be interested in developing the river on a Public Private Partnership (PPP).\n\nAccording to SADA, about 653 hectares of area on the banks of the river would be developed. This area is 13.4&nbsp;km in length. Commercial, residential, entertainment and other institutional facilities would be developed in this area. On both the sides of the river, 13.4-km-long retaining wall, houses and commercial complexes would be constructed, besides bridge, roads and walkways. Water supply, sewerage, drainage, electricity supply would be provided in the area.\n\nThe estimated cost of all the works is Rs2,000 crore. The development works would be taken up in phases during the next seven years.\n\nOf the total 653-hectare area, some of the land is owned privately. In lieu of acquisition of private land, the affected people would be given land at other areas. After development about 267 hectares of land will be made available for sale. By selling this land, the developer could recover the invested amount. The downtown is called Gol Bazaar (Circular Market). Gol Bazaar, Sadar Bazaar and company Garden Chowk are buzzing and vibrant but overcrowded with slow-moving traffic. In contrast there are some newly developed areas as well. The Vyapar Vihar is a newly developed commercial and goods transport area.

Bilaspur is the administrative headquarters of Bilaspur District and Bilaspur Division. The [[Chhattisgarh High Court]], located at Bodri, District Bilaspur has privileged it with the title 'Nyayadhani' (Law Capital) of the state.  This city is the commercial center and business hub of North East [[Chhattisgarh]] region. It is also an important city for the [[Indian Railways]], as it is the headquarters for [[South East Central Railway Zone (India)|South East Central Railway Zone]] and the Bilaspur Railway Division. Bilaspur is 3rd cleanest and 4th longest railway station in India. Bilaspur is also the headquarters of [[South Eastern Coalfields Limited]].NTPC, Sipat is near Bilaspur too.\n\nBilaspur is known for its aromatic rice variety named Doobraj [[rice]], [[loom|handloom]] [[woven]] colourful soft Kosa [[silk]] [[sari]]s. Basic Tasar Silkworm Seed Organisation (BTSSO) {{URL|http://www.btsso.org/}} under the Central Silk Board, Government of India collects, executes the production and supply of nucleus and basic Tasar seed from surrounding areas.\n\nBilaspur has been selected as one of the 100 Indian cities to be developed as a [[smart city]] under the [[Smart Cities Mission]].<ref>{{cite web |work=firstpost.com |url= http://www.firstpost.com/business/why-only-98-cities-instead-of-100-announced-all-questions-answered-about-smart-cities-project-2410576.html |title=Why only 98 cities instead of 100 announced: All questions answered about smart cities project |date= 28 August 2015 |accessdate=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHistorically, Bilaspur was controlled by the [[Kalachuris of Ratnapura|Kalachuri dynasty]] of [[Ratanpur]]. The city, however, came into prominence around 1741, the year of the [[Maratha Empire]] rule, when a Maratha official took up his abode there.\n\nThe management of Bilaspur district was taken over by the [[British East India Company]]  in 1818 after [[Bhosale]] lost territory in [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]. Under Bhosale of the Nagpur kingdom there were many subedars or zamindars/landlords like Akbar Khan, Vazeer Khan, Sao and others in Bilaspur.\n\nBilaspur district was constituted in 1861, followed by Bilaspur municipality in 1867. Famines in the Bilaspur district were recorded by the British administration in 1828\u20139, 1834\u20135, 1845\u20136, 1868\u20139 and 1899\u20131900. In 1868-9 and 1899\u20131900, the rains failed almost completely, resulting in severe distress, migration and desertion of villages. After the 1868-9 famine there was prosperity for the next 25 years; but in 1895 there was a very poor harvest, followed in 1896 by a complete failure of crops, and severe famine continued throughout 1897. In that year the mortality rate was as high as one in six people. The famine of 1897 was followed by two favorable years; but in 1899 the [[monsoon]] failed completely and the rice crop was wholly destroyed.\n\n[[Satguru Ghasidas|Guru Ghasidas]] (1756\u20131836) started a religious movement, Satnamis (meaning the worshippers of [[Satnam]]), between 1820 and 1830 primarily around the Sonakhan forests. This religious movement preached against idol-worship, and instead stressed that God is synonymous with truth. His community was a farming community. The university at Bilaspur is named after him as [[Guru Ghasidas University]].\n\nRailways arrived at Bilaspur in the decade 1880\u201390, with the arrival of the [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]]. In 1888 [[Mistri]] Jagmal Gangji and other [[Kutch Gurjar Kshatriyas contributions to the Indian railways#1880-1890|Mistri Railway Contractors]] laid the first railway tracks from [[Rajnandgaon]] to Bilaspur, and in that same year fellow [[Kutchi people|Kutchi]] contractor [[Khoda Ramji Chawda|Khoda Ramji]] and others built the line from Bilaspur to [[Jharsuguda]], including the bridge over the Champa river.\n\nIn 1890, the present railway station and yard were constructed by the Gujarati railway contractor Jagmal Gangji. His son [[Mulji Jagmal Sawaria]] was later given the title of \"Rao Sahib\" by the British for his contribution to the development of the town, railways and the district. Jagmal Block and Jagmal Chowk in the city are named after Jagmal Gangji Sawaria.\n\nIn 1901, the population of Bilaspur was 18,937 and it was the eighth-largest town in the [[Central Provinces]] of [[British India]]. In 1908, weaving of tasar silk and cotton clothes were recorded as the major industries of Bilaspur.\n\nBilaspur enjoys the distinctiveness of being one of the major cities in Chhattisgarh with considerable historical significance. Located in the eastern part of Chhattisgarh, Bilaspur is nearly four centuries old. Referred to as the \"Rice Bowl of India\", Bilaspur abounds in lush greenery and boasts of a myriad number of tourist attractions. If the historical records are to be given any credence, then there is no reason to disbelieve the fact that Bilaspur owes its name to a fisherwoman, Bilasa in the 17th century. Bilaspur during that time and for many more years to come remained a fishing hamlet consisting of a few fishermen's huts. According to the census conducted in 1901, the total population of Bilaspur was somewhere around 18,937 and it was considered the 8th largest town in the Central Provinces of British India. One interesting fact that one comes across while flipping through pages of history is that even as early as in 1908, Bilaspur had already made a mark as home to the major tasar silk and cotton clothes manufacturers.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh.jpg|thumb|Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]]\nHistorical records like [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V08_239.gif ''Imperial Gazetteer of India'', Vol 8, 1908] note that the city is said to be named after a fisherwoman by the name of \"Bilasa\" in the 17th century, and for a long period it consisted only of a few fishermen's huts.\n\n== Geography ==\nBilaspur is located at {{Coord|22.09|N|82.15|E|}}.<ref>[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/37/Bilaspur.html Falling Rain Genomics, Inc \u2013 Bilaspur]</ref> It has an average elevation of 264&nbsp;metres (866&nbsp;ft).\n\nBilaspur is situated on the banks of the rain-fed Arpa River, which originates from the high hills of the [[Maikal Hills|Maikal]] Range of central India.
