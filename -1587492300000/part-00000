In the animated cartoon series ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' produced by [[DIC Entertainment]], the '''Koopa Kids''' were given different names based on their given personalities. Their ages are also changed. From oldest to youngest, they are '''Bully Koopa''' (Roy), '''Big Mouth Koopa''' (Morton), '''Kooky Von Koopa''' (Ludwig), '''Cheatsy Koopa''' (Larry), '''Kootie Pie Koopa''' (Wendy), and '''Hip and Hop Koopa''' (Lemmy and Iggy respectively). After this, they appear in another animated cartoon series ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' with the same names, though they more closely resemble their portrayals in the video games. Aside from their names and personalities, they look slightly different and serve their father King Koopa (as Bowser was called in the series) differently compared to their video game counterparts. Instead of their subordinate role, they act directly as his children, and do things such as seek his attention, and even plot against him. They would also appear in the [[Nintendo Adventure Books]] and comic books, wherein they use their official names and designs closer to the games.{{cn|date=September 2017}}\n{{br}}\n==Voice actors and namesakes==\nMost of the Koopalings were named after celebrities\u2014mainly famous musicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/how-a-mario-character-was-named-after-motorheads-lemmy-1750180427|title=How A Mario Character Was Named After Motorhead's Lemmy|first=Patrick|last=Klepek}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Vintage Games: An Insider Look at the History of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the Most Influential Games of All Time|last1=Loguidice|first1=Bill|last2=Barton|first2=Matt|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2012|isbn=9781136137587|page=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKF5AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA326}}</ref> Each Koopaling has had four or five voice actors in different media.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| Name !! rowspan=2|Amada Anime series (1989) !! rowspan=2|DiC animated series (1990\u20131991) !! rowspan=2|''[[Mario Is Missing!]]'' (DOS, 1992) !! colspan=2|Video games (2009\u2013present) !! rowspan=2|Named after\n|-\n! <small>2009\u20132013,<br>2014\u20132019</small>{{refn|group=note|According to voice actor Mike Vaughn (Ludwig and Iggy), only one recording session was done in October of 2009 for ''New Super Mario Bros.

In the animated cartoon series ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' produced by [[DIC Entertainment]], the '''Koopa Kids''' were given different names based on their given personalities. Their ages are also changed. From oldest to youngest, they are '''Bully Koopa''' (Roy), '''Big Mouth Koopa''' (Morton), '''Kooky Von Koopa''' (Ludwig), '''Cheatsy Koopa''' (Larry), '''Kootie Pie Koopa''' (Wendy), and '''Hip and Hop Koopa''' (Lemmy and Iggy respectively). After this, they appear in another animated cartoon series ''[[Super Mario World (TV series)|Super Mario World]]'' with the same names, though they more closely resemble their portrayals in the video games. Aside from their names and personalities, they look slightly different and serve their father King Koopa (as Bowser was called in the series) differently compared to their video game counterparts. Instead of their subordinate role, they act directly as his children, and do things such as seek his attention, and even plot against him.

The cathedral is also the seat of the [[Bishop of Agder and Telemark]].  The brick church was completed in 1885 and is one of the largest cathedrals in Norway. This cathedral is the fourth church and third cathedral to be located on this site over the centuries.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkesok.no/eng/kirker/Kristiansand-domkirke|title=Kristiansand domkirke|publisher=Kirkes\u00f8k: Kirkebyggdatabasen|accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkekonsulenten.no/kirker.htm|title=Oversikt over N\u00e5v\u00e6rende Kirker|language=Norwegian|publisher=KirkeKonsulenten.no |accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref><ref name=\"KB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kristiansanddomkirke.no/kirkebygget.html|title=Kirkebygget|publisher=Kristiansand kirkelige fellesr\u00e5d|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2017-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nKristiansand Cathedral is a [[Neo-Gothic]] church built of brick and cement, of [[cruciform]] plan with 1,750 seats.

The first was laid across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum Bay, [[Valentia Island]] in western [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content Cable Station|Heart's Content]] in eastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The first communications occurred August 16, 1858, reducing the communication time between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] from ten days\u2014the time it took to deliver a message by ship\u2014to a matter of minutes. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by [[transatlantic telecommunications cable]]s.\n\n[[Cyrus West Field]] and the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] were behind the construction of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=The Conquest of the Atlantic|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=1|pages=53\u201356/67|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2299492|ref=harv}}</ref> The project began in 1854 and was completed in 1858. The cable functioned for only three weeks, but it was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] to [[President of the United States]] [[James Buchanan]] on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when [[Wildman Whitehouse]] applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the faulty manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Cogan|first1=D.|title=Dr E.O.W.

A second attempt was undertaken in 1865 with much-improved material and, following some setbacks, a connection was completed and put into service on July 28, 1866. This cable proved more durable.\n\nBefore the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Five attempts to lay a cable were made over a nine-year period \u2013 one in 1857, two in 1858, one in 1865, and one in 1866.  Lasting connections were finally achieved with the 1866 cable and the 1865 cable, which was repaired by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s ship {{SS|Great Eastern||6}}, captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

Morse]] proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. By 1850 a cable was run between England and France. That same year Bishop [[John T. Mullock]], head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], proposed a telegraph line through the forest from [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] to [[Cape Ray]], and cables across the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] from Cape Ray to [[Nova Scotia]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAt about the same time a similar plan occurred to [[Frederic Newton Gisborne]], a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1851, Gisborne procured a grant from the legislature of Newfoundland and, having formed a company, began the construction of the landline. In 1853 his company collapsed, he was arrested for debt and he lost everything.\n\n== A plan takes shape ==\nIn 1854 Gisborne was introduced to [[Cyrus West Field]]. Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project. From his visitor, Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nField was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea. He consulted Morse as well as Lieutenant [[Matthew Maury]], an authority on [[oceanography]]. Field adopted Gisborne's scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking, and promoted the [[New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company]] to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe.\n\nThe first step was to finish the line between St. John's and Nova Scotia, which was undertaken by Gisborne and Fields brother, Matthew.<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref>  In 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It was laid out from a [[barque]] in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a [[gale]] rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a [[steamboat]] was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid.<ref name=\"HindKeefer1864\">{{cite book|author1=Henry Youle Hind|author2=Thomas C.

Brett's [[Submarine Telegraph Company]] laid the first ocean cable in 1850 across the [[English Channel]] and his [[English and Irish Magnetic Telegraph Company]] had laid a cable to Ireland in 1853 which was the deepest cable laid up to that date.<ref>Bright, p. 14</ref>  Further reason for the trip were that all the commercial manufacturers of submarine cable were in Britain,<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref> and Field had failed to raise significant funds for the project in New York.<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>\n\nField pushed the project ahead with tremendous energy and speed.  Even before forming the a company to carry out the project, Field ordered 2,500 miles of cable from the [[Gutta Percha Company]].<ref>Lindley, p. 129</ref>  The [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] was formed in October 1856 with Brett as president and Field as vice-president.  [[Charles Tilston Bright]], who already worked for Brett, was made chief engineer.  [[Wildman Whitehouse]], a medical doctor, was appointed chief electrician.  Field provided a quarter of the capital himself.<ref>Clayton, p. 30</ref>  After the  remaining shares were sold, largely to existing investors in Brett's company,<ref>Kieve, pp. 106\u2013107</ref> an unpaid board of directors was formed which included [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]], the future Lord Kelvin and a respected scientist.

It weighed nearly 550&nbsp;kg/km (1.1&nbsp;tons per nautical mile), was relatively flexible and was able to withstand a pull of several tens of [[kilonewton]]s (several tons). It was made jointly by two English firms \u2013 [[Enderby's Wharf|Glass, Elliot & Co.]], of [[Greenwich]], and [[R.S. Newall and Company]], of [[Birkenhead]]. Late in manufacturing it was discovered that the respective sections had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions. While the two sections proved a simple matter to join, this mistake subsequently became magnified in the public mind.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cable|first=Gillian|last=Cookson|page=[https://archive.org/details/cable0000cook/page/73 73]|year=2006|edition=2|publisher=Tempus Publishing|isbn=0-7524-3903-0|url=https://archive.org/details/cable0000cook/page/73}}</ref>\n\nThe British government gave Field a subsidy of \u00a31,400 a year (\u00a3{{inflation|UK|1400|1856|fmt=c|r=-4}} today) and loaned the ships needed. Field also solicited aid from the U.S. government. A bill authorizing a subsidy was submitted in [[United States Congress|Congress]]. The subsidy bill passed the [[United States Senate|Senate]] by a single vote, due to opposition from protectionist senators. In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the bill encountered similar resistance, but passed, and was signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nThe first attempt, in 1857, was a failure. The cable-laying vessels were the converted warships [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and [[USS Niagara (1855)|USS ''Niagara'']] borrowed from their respective governments.  Both ships were needed as neither was sufficient to hold 2,500 miles of cable alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  The cable was started at the white strand near [[Ballycarbery Castle]] in [[County Kerry]], on the southwest coast of [[Ireland]], on August 5, 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Books/1857Isaac/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 1857 \u2013 Laying the Atlantic Telegraph From Ship To Shore |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref> The cable broke on the first day, but was [[Grappling hook|grappled]] and repaired; it broke again over the [[Telegraph Plateau]], nearly 3,200&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;[[statute mile]]s) deep, and the operation was abandoned for the year.  300 miles of cable had been lost, but with 1,800 miles still remaining, the director's agreed to try again the following year.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n\nThe problems with cables breaking were largely due to difficulty controlling the tension of the cable with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out.  A new mechanism was designed and successfully trialed in the [[Bay of Biscay]] with ''Agamemnon'' in the summer of 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  ''Agamemnon'' and ''Niagara'' then tried again. The vessels were to meet in the middle of the Atlantic, where the two halves of the cable were to be [[wikt:splice|spliced]] together, and while ''Agamemnon'' paid out eastwards to Valentia Island, ''Niagara'' was to pay out westward to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. On June 26, the middle splice was made and the cable was dropped. Again the cable broke, the first time after less than 5.5&nbsp;km (three nautical miles), again after some 100&nbsp;km (54&nbsp;nautical miles) and for a third time when about 370&nbsp;km (200 nautical miles) of cable had run out of each vessel.\n\nThe expedition returned to [[Queenstown, County Cork]], Ireland, and set out again on July 17, with little enthusiasm among the crews. The middle splice was finished on July 29, 1858. The cable ran easily this time. ''Niagara'' arrived in [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay, Newfoundland]] on August 4 and the next morning the shore end was landed. ''Agamemnon'' made an equally successful run. On August 5, she arrived at Valentia Island, and the shore end was landed at Knightstown and then laid to the nearby cable house.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1858Leslies/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper 1858 Cable News |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==First contact==\n[[File:Irl-ValentiaTelegraph.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Telegraph Field,<ref name=tel-field>{{cite web|url=http://thetelegraphfield.com|title=\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|website=thetelegraphfield.com}}</ref> [[Valentia Island]], Ireland, the site of the earliest message sent from Ireland to North America.

Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and had given up his medical practice to follow a new career.  He had no formal training in physics; all his knowledge had been gained through practical experience.  The two clashed even before the project had started when Whitehouse disputed Thomson's [[law of squares]] when he presented it to a [[British Association]] meeting in 1855.  Thomson's law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation.<ref>Lindley, p. 125</ref>  Whitehouse, with access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company's lines, was able to join several lines to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declare that there would be no problem.<ref>Bright, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed, which would improve the retardation problem predicted by the law of squares.  In mid-1857, Thomson, on his own initiative, examined samples of copper core of alleged identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two.  But the cable manufacturing was already underway and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable so Field went with the cheaper option.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n\nAnother point of contention was the itinerary for cable laying.  Thomson favoured starting mid-Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions.  This would halve the time taken to complete.  Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress can be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Whitehouse overruled Thomson's suggestion on the 1857 voyage, but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid-ocean start on the subsequent 1858 voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  Whitehouse, as chief electrician, was supposed to be on board the cable laying vessel, but he declined to go at the last moment.  He repeatedly did this; for the 1857 attempt, the trials in the [[Bay of Biscay]],<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref> and the attempt in 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  In 1857, Thomson was sent in his place,<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref> and in 1858 Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflict, but in the event Thomson went alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n\nAfter his experience on the 1857 voyage, Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required.  He spent the time waiting for a new voyage inventing his [[mirror galvanometer]].  This was an extremely sensitive instrument, much better than any existing equipment.  He requested \u00a32,000 from the board to build several of them, but was only given \u00a3500 for a prototype, and permission to trial it on the next voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>  The mirror galvanometer was extremely good at detecting the positive, or negative edge of a telegraph pulse respectively representing a Morse 'dash' and a Morse 'dot' (this was the standard system on submarine cables \u2013 both pulse types were the same length, unlike overland telegraph).  Thomson believed he could use this instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment.\n\nWhitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme.<ref>Voice Across the Sea \u2013 Arthur C Clarke</ref>  He believed that, in order to have the current at the receiving end change as rapidly as possible, the cable should be driven from a high-voltage source (several thousand volts from [[induction coil]]s). The position was made worse because every time intelligible Morse code was seen on the mirror galvanometer at the eastern end, Whitehouse insisted that the galvanometer be disconnected and replaced with his own patented telegraph recorder, which was far less sensitive.\n\nThe effects of the poor handling and design of the cable, coupled with Whitehouse's repeated attempts to drive the cable with high voltages, resulted in the insulation of the cable being compromised.  All the while, it was taking longer and longer to send messages.  Towards the end, sending half a page of message text was taking as long as a day.\n\nIn September 1858, after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation, the cable failed. The reaction to this news was tremendous. Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax, and others pronounced it a stock exchange speculation.  In the enquiry that followed, Dr Whitehouse was deemed responsible for the failure, and the company did not escape criticism for employing an electrical engineer with no recognised qualifications.\n\nAlthough the cable was never put into service for public use, and never worked well, there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing.  The collision between the [[Cunard Line]] ships ''Europa'' and ''Arabia'' was reported on 17 August. The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England, saving \u00a350,000.  A total of 732 messages were passed before failure.<ref name=\"Kieve, p. 109\"/>\n\n== Preparing a new attempt ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012|Just about all this section can be cited to the Kieve source I added}}\n\nField was undaunted by the failure. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of [[Thomas Brassey]] and [[John Pender]], he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|BICC]]), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. [[C.F. Varley]] replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, long cables had been submerged in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. With this experience, an improved cable was designed. The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing 300 pounds per nautical mile (73&nbsp;kg/km), coated with [[Chatterton's compound]], then covered with four layers of [[gutta-percha]], alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole, and bringing the weight of the insulator to 400&nbsp;lb/nmi (98&nbsp;kg/km). This core was covered with [[hemp]] saturated in a preservative solution, and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by [[Webster and Horsfall|Webster & Horsfall Ltd]] of Hay Mills [[Birmingham]], each covered with fine strands of [[manila hemp|manila]] yarn steeped in the preservative. The weight of the new cable was 35.75 long [[hundredweight]] (4000&nbsp;lb) per nautical mile (980&nbsp;kg/km), or nearly twice the weight of the old. The Haymills site successfully manufactured {{convert|30,000|mi|km}} of wire (1,600 tons), made by 250 workers over eleven months.\n\n== ''Great Eastern'' and the second attempt ==\n[[File:Great Eastern 1866.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Great Eastern'' at [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]]]]\nThe new cable was laid by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']] captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cableships/GreatEastern/|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - Great Eastern|website=www.atlantic-cable.com}}</ref> Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of {{convert|2,300|nmi|km}} of cable, and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. At noon on July 15, 1865, ''Great Eastern'' left the [[Nore]] for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by ''Caroline''. This attempt failed on July 31 when, after 1,062&nbsp;miles (1968&nbsp;km) had been paid out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/Gooch/index.html |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Daniel Gooch |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|1866}}<!--[[1866 transatlantic telegraph cable]] redirects here -->\n''Great Eastern'' steamed back to England, where Field issued another prospectus, and formed the [[Anglo-American Telegraph Company]],<ref>http://atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/AngloAmerican/index.htm Anglo-American Telegraph Company</ref> to lay a new cable and complete the broken one. On July 13, 1866, ''Great Eastern'' started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, July 27, the expedition reached the port of Heart's Content in a thick fog. The next morning at 9&nbsp;a.m. a message from England cited these words from the [[editorial|leader]] in ''[[The Times]]'': \"It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race.\" \"Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria.\" The shore end was landed during the day by ''Medway''. Congratulations poured in, and friendly telegrams were again exchanged between Queen Victoria and the United States.\n\n[[File:Great Eastern Grappling Hook.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Grappling hook]] used for lifting the cable]]\nIn August 1866, several ships, including ''Great Eastern'', put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of 1865.

Suddenly, on August 10, ''Albany'' \"caught\" the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success, and that is how it turned out. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. ''Great Eastern'' and another grappling ship, ''Medway'', arrived to join the search on the 12th. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board ''Great Eastern''. The cable was carried to the electrician's room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content, Newfoundland]], where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines.\n\n== Repairing the cable ==\nBroken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=transatlantic+cable+buoy&source=bl&ots=vM5O99xNRP&sig=3J7hvgSPZ2usC7pZwgw3-ZfJgo0&hl=en&ei=ugXKTcmWC-jkiAKmoaWjBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=transatlantic+cable+buoy&f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=March 18, 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia britannica Company|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1915CCC/index.htm|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - 1915: How submarine cables are made and laid|website=atlantic-cable.com}}</ref>\n\n==Communication speeds==\nInitially messages were sent by an operator sending [[Morse code]].

This is despite the use of a highly sensitive [[mirror galvanometer]], a new invention at the time.\n\nThe first message on the 1858 cable took over 17 hours to transmit.<ref name=lac-fam-msg>{{cite web |url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/cable/fmessages.htm |work=Famous Messages Received and Sent |title=1858 August 16 Queen Victoria Sends Telegram to President Buchanan |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate = July 9, 2010}}</ref>  For the 1866 cable, the methods of cable manufacture, as well as sending messages, had been vastly improved.

[[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin]] in later decades understood that the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]], which causes a severe [[dispersion relation|dispersion]] and hence a signal distortion; see [[Telegrapher's equations]]. This has to be solved by iron tape or by [[load coil]]s. It was not until the 20th century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even 120 words per minute. Despite this, London had become the world center in telecommunications. Eventually, no fewer than eleven cables radiated from [[Porthcurno]] Cable Station near [[Land's End]] and formed with their Commonwealth links a \"live\" girdle around the world; the [[All Red Line]].\n\n== Later cables ==\nAdditional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart's Content in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1894. By the end of the 19th century, British-, French-, German-, and American-owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Need a citation for both sentences here.}}\n\nThe original cables were not fitted with [[repeater]]s, which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation.  Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line.  On telegraph lines this is done with [[relay]]s, but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable. The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was [[TAT-1]] in 1956.  This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters.\n\n==Impact==\nA 2018 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Steinwender|first=Claudia|date=2018|title=Real Effects of Information Frictions: When the States and the Kingdom Became United|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150681|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=657\u2013696|doi=10.1257/aer.20150681|issn=0002-8282|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The study estimates that \"the efficiency gains of the telegraph to be equivalent to 8 percent of export value\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robert Halpin]] \u2013 Captain of ''Great Eastern''\n* [[Transatlantic telephone cable]]\n* [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] \u2013 overland alternative via Russia\n* [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake]]\n* [[Commercial Cable Company]]\n* [[Enderby's Wharf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* [[Charles Tilston Bright|Bright, Charles Tilston]], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_00867/page/n3 ''Submarine Telegraphs''], London: Crosby Lockwood, 1898 {{oclc|776529627}}.\n* [[Arthur C.

The first was laid across the floor of the Atlantic from Telegraph Field, Foilhommerum Bay, [[Valentia Island]] in western [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content Cable Station|Heart's Content]] in eastern [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The first communications occurred August 16, 1858, reducing the communication time between [[North America]] and [[Europe]] from ten days\u2014the time it took to deliver a message by ship\u2014to a matter of minutes. Transatlantic telegraph cables have been replaced by [[transatlantic telecommunications cable]]s.\n\n[[Cyrus West Field]] and the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]] were behind the construction of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\">{{Cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|year=2014|title=The Conquest of the Atlantic|journal=IEEE Industrial Electronics Magazine|volume=8|issue=1|pages=53\u201356/67|doi=10.1109/MIE.2014.2299492|ref=harv}}</ref> The project began in 1854 and was completed in 1858. The cable functioned for only three weeks, but it was the first such project to yield practical results. The first official telegram to pass between two continents was a letter of congratulations from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom]] to [[President of the United States]] [[James Buchanan]] on August 16. Signal quality declined rapidly, slowing transmission to an almost unusable speed. The cable was destroyed the following month when [[Wildman Whitehouse]] applied excessive voltage to it while trying to achieve faster operation. It has been argued that the faulty manufacture, storage and handling of the 1858 cable would have led to premature failure in any case.<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Cogan|first1=D.|title=Dr E.O.W.

A second attempt was undertaken in 1865 with much-improved material and, following some setbacks, a connection was completed and put into service on July 28, 1866. This cable proved more durable.\n\nBefore the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took place only by ship. Sometimes, however, severe winter storms delayed ships for weeks. The transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Five attempts to lay a cable were made over a nine-year period \u2013 one in 1857, two in 1858, one in 1865, and one in 1866.  Lasting connections were finally achieved with the 1866 cable and the 1865 cable, which was repaired by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s ship {{SS|Great Eastern||6}}, captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>Wilson, Arthur (1994).

Morse]] proclaimed his faith in the idea of a submarine line across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. By 1850 a cable was run between England and France. That same year Bishop [[John T. Mullock]], head of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], proposed a telegraph line through the forest from [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] to [[Cape Ray]], and cables across the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] from Cape Ray to [[Nova Scotia]] across the [[Cabot Strait]].\n\nAt about the same time a similar plan occurred to [[Frederic Newton Gisborne]], a telegraph engineer in Nova Scotia. In the spring of 1851, Gisborne procured a grant from the legislature of Newfoundland and, having formed a company, began the construction of the landline. In 1853 his company collapsed, he was arrested for debt and he lost everything.\n\n== A plan takes shape ==\nIn 1854 Gisborne was introduced to [[Cyrus West Field]]. Field invited Gisborne to his house to discuss the project. From his visitor, Field considered the idea that the cable to Newfoundland might be extended across the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nField was ignorant of submarine cables and the deep sea. He consulted Morse as well as Lieutenant [[Matthew Maury]], an authority on [[oceanography]]. Field adopted Gisborne's scheme as a preliminary step to the bigger undertaking, and promoted the [[New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company]] to establish a telegraph line between America and Europe.\n\nThe first step was to finish the line between St. John's and Nova Scotia, which was undertaken by Gisborne and Fields brother, Matthew.<ref>Lindley, p. 128</ref>  In 1855 an attempt was made to lay a cable across the Cabot Strait in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. It was laid out from a [[barque]] in tow of a steamer. When half the cable was laid, a [[gale]] rose, and the line was cut to keep the barque from sinking. In 1856 a [[steamboat]] was fitted out for the purpose, and the link from Cape Ray, Newfoundland to Aspy Bay, Nova Scotia was successfully laid.<ref name=\"HindKeefer1864\">{{cite book|author1=Henry Youle Hind|author2=Thomas C.

It was made jointly by two English firms \u2013 [[Enderby's Wharf|Glass, Elliot & Co.]], of [[Greenwich]], and [[R.S. Newall and Company]], of [[Birkenhead]]. Late in manufacturing it was discovered that the respective sections had been made with strands twisted in opposite directions.

In the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], the bill encountered similar resistance, but passed, and was signed by President [[Franklin Pierce]].\n\nThe first attempt, in 1857, was a failure. The cable-laying vessels were the converted warships [[HMS Agamemnon (1852)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and [[USS Niagara (1855)|USS ''Niagara'']] borrowed from their respective governments.  Both ships were needed as neither was sufficient to hold 2,500 miles of cable alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  The cable was started at the white strand near [[Ballycarbery Castle]] in [[County Kerry]], on the southwest coast of [[Ireland]], on August 5, 1857.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Books/1857Isaac/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 1857 \u2013 Laying the Atlantic Telegraph From Ship To Shore |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref> The cable broke on the first day, but was [[Grappling hook|grappled]] and repaired; it broke again over the [[Telegraph Plateau]], nearly 3,200&nbsp;m (2&nbsp;[[statute mile]]s) deep, and the operation was abandoned for the year.  300 miles of cable had been lost, but with 1,800 miles still remaining, the director's agreed to try again the following year.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n\nThe problems with cables breaking were largely due to difficulty controlling the tension of the cable with the braking mechanism as the cable was payed out.  A new mechanism was designed and successfully trialed in the [[Bay of Biscay]] with ''Agamemnon'' in the summer of 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  ''Agamemnon'' and ''Niagara'' then tried again. The vessels were to meet in the middle of the Atlantic, where the two halves of the cable were to be [[wikt:splice|spliced]] together, and while ''Agamemnon'' paid out eastwards to Valentia Island, ''Niagara'' was to pay out westward to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. On June 26, the middle splice was made and the cable was dropped. Again the cable broke, the first time after less than 5.5&nbsp;km (three nautical miles), again after some 100&nbsp;km (54&nbsp;nautical miles) and for a third time when about 370&nbsp;km (200 nautical miles) of cable had run out of each vessel.\n\nThe expedition returned to [[Queenstown, County Cork]], Ireland, and set out again on July 17, with little enthusiasm among the crews. The middle splice was finished on July 29, 1858. The cable ran easily this time. ''Niagara'' arrived in [[Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity Bay, Newfoundland]] on August 4 and the next morning the shore end was landed. ''Agamemnon'' made an equally successful run. On August 5, she arrived at Valentia Island, and the shore end was landed at Knightstown and then laid to the nearby cable house.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Article/1858Leslies/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper 1858 Cable News |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==First contact==\n[[File:Irl-ValentiaTelegraph.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The Telegraph Field,<ref name=tel-field>{{cite web|url=http://thetelegraphfield.com|title=\u30b6\u30c6\u30ec\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|website=thetelegraphfield.com}}</ref> [[Valentia Island]], Ireland, the site of the earliest message sent from Ireland to North America.

Whitehouse was a medical doctor by training but had taken an enthusiastic interest in the new electrical technology and had given up his medical practice to follow a new career.  He had no formal training in physics; all his knowledge had been gained through practical experience.  The two clashed even before the project had started when Whitehouse disputed Thomson's [[law of squares]] when he presented it to a [[British Association]] meeting in 1855.  Thomson's law predicted that transmission speed on the cable would be very slow due to an effect called retardation.<ref>Lindley, p. 125</ref>  Whitehouse, with access to the Magnetic Telegraph Company's lines, was able to join several lines to a distance similar to the transatlantic route and declare that there would be no problem.<ref>Bright, pp. 25\u201326</ref>  Thomson believed that a larger cable was needed, which would improve the retardation problem predicted by the law of squares.  In mid-1857, Thomson, on his own initiative, examined samples of copper core of alleged identical specification and found variations in resistance up to a factor of two.  But the cable manufacturing was already underway and Whitehouse supported use of a thinner cable so Field went with the cheaper option.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>\n\nAnother point of contention was the itinerary for cable laying.  Thomson favoured starting mid-Atlantic and the two ships heading in opposite directions.  This would halve the time taken to complete.  Whitehouse wanted both ships to travel together from Ireland so that progress can be reported back to the base in Valentia through the cable.<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref>  Whitehouse overruled Thomson's suggestion on the 1857 voyage, but Bright convinced the directors to approve a mid-ocean start on the subsequent 1858 voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  Whitehouse, as chief electrician, was supposed to be on board the cable laying vessel, but he declined to go at the last moment.  He repeatedly did this; for the 1857 attempt, the trials in the [[Bay of Biscay]],<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref> and the attempt in 1858.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>  In 1857, Thomson was sent in his place,<ref>Lindley, p. 130</ref> and in 1858 Field diplomatically assigned the two to different ships to avoid conflict, but in the event Thomson went alone.<ref>Lindley, p. 134</ref>\n\nAfter his experience on the 1857 voyage, Thomson realised that a better method of detecting the telegraph signal was required.  He spent the time waiting for a new voyage inventing his [[mirror galvanometer]].  This was an extremely sensitive instrument, much better than any existing equipment.  He requested \u00a32,000 from the board to build several of them, but was only given \u00a3500 for a prototype, and permission to trial it on the next voyage.<ref>Lindley, p. 133</ref>  The mirror galvanometer was extremely good at detecting the positive, or negative edge of a telegraph pulse respectively representing a Morse 'dash' and a Morse 'dot' (this was the standard system on submarine cables \u2013 both pulse types were the same length, unlike overland telegraph).  Thomson believed he could use this instrument with the low voltages from regular telegraph equipment.\n\nWhitehouse wanted to work the cable with a very different scheme.<ref>Voice Across the Sea \u2013 Arthur C Clarke</ref>  He believed that, in order to have the current at the receiving end change as rapidly as possible, the cable should be driven from a high-voltage source (several thousand volts from [[induction coil]]s). The position was made worse because every time intelligible Morse code was seen on the mirror galvanometer at the eastern end, Whitehouse insisted that the galvanometer be disconnected and replaced with his own patented telegraph recorder, which was far less sensitive.\n\nThe effects of the poor handling and design of the cable, coupled with Whitehouse's repeated attempts to drive the cable with high voltages, resulted in the insulation of the cable being compromised.  All the while, it was taking longer and longer to send messages.  Towards the end, sending half a page of message text was taking as long as a day.\n\nIn September 1858, after several days of progressive deterioration of the insulation, the cable failed. The reaction to this news was tremendous. Some writers even hinted that the line was a mere hoax, and others pronounced it a stock exchange speculation.  In the enquiry that followed, Dr Whitehouse was deemed responsible for the failure, and the company did not escape criticism for employing an electrical engineer with no recognised qualifications.\n\nAlthough the cable was never put into service for public use, and never worked well, there was time for a few messages to be passed that went beyond testing.  The collision between the [[Cunard Line]] ships ''Europa'' and ''Arabia'' was reported on 17 August. The British Government used the cable to countermand an order for two regiments in Canada to embark for England, saving \u00a350,000.  A total of 732 messages were passed before failure.<ref name=\"Kieve, p. 109\"/>\n\n== Preparing a new attempt ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012|Just about all this section can be cited to the Kieve source I added}}\n\nField was undaunted by the failure. He was eager to renew the work, but the public had lost confidence in the scheme and his efforts to revive the company were futile. It was not until 1864 that, with the assistance of [[Thomas Brassey]] and [[John Pender]], he succeeded in raising the necessary capital. The Glass, Elliot, and Gutta-Percha Companies were united to form the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company (Telcon, later part of [[British Insulated Callender's Cables|BICC]]), which undertook to manufacture and lay the new cable. [[C.F. Varley]] replaced Whitehouse as chief electrician.<ref name=\"guarnieri 7-1\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, long cables had been submerged in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. With this experience, an improved cable was designed. The core consisted of seven twisted strands of very pure copper weighing 300 pounds per nautical mile (73&nbsp;kg/km), coated with [[Chatterton's compound]], then covered with four layers of [[gutta-percha]], alternating with four thin layers of the compound cementing the whole, and bringing the weight of the insulator to 400&nbsp;lb/nmi (98&nbsp;kg/km). This core was covered with [[hemp]] saturated in a preservative solution, and on the hemp were helically wound eighteen single strands of high tensile steel wire produced by [[Webster and Horsfall|Webster & Horsfall Ltd]] of Hay Mills [[Birmingham]], each covered with fine strands of [[manila hemp|manila]] yarn steeped in the preservative. The weight of the new cable was 35.75 long [[hundredweight]] (4000&nbsp;lb) per nautical mile (980&nbsp;kg/km), or nearly twice the weight of the old. The Haymills site successfully manufactured {{convert|30,000|mi|km}} of wire (1,600 tons), made by 250 workers over eleven months.\n\n== ''Great Eastern'' and the second attempt ==\n[[File:Great Eastern 1866.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Great Eastern'' at [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]]]]\nThe new cable was laid by the ship [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']] captained by [[Sir James Anderson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantic-cable.com/Cableships/GreatEastern/|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - Great Eastern|website=www.atlantic-cable.com}}</ref> Her immense hull was fitted with three iron tanks for the reception of {{convert|2,300|nmi|km}} of cable, and her decks furnished with the paying-out gear. At noon on July 15, 1865, ''Great Eastern'' left the [[Nore]] for Foilhommerum Bay, Valentia Island, where the shore end was laid by ''Caroline''. This attempt failed on July 31 when, after 1,062&nbsp;miles (1968&nbsp;km) had been paid out, the cable snapped near the stern of the ship, and the end was lost.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/Gooch/index.html |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy \u2013 Daniel Gooch |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|1866}}<!--[[1866 transatlantic telegraph cable]] redirects here -->\n''Great Eastern'' steamed back to England, where Field issued another prospectus, and formed the [[Anglo-American Telegraph Company]],<ref>http://atlantic-cable.com/CableCos/AngloAmerican/index.htm Anglo-American Telegraph Company</ref> to lay a new cable and complete the broken one. On July 13, 1866, ''Great Eastern'' started paying out once more. Despite problems with the weather on the evening of Friday, July 27, the expedition reached the port of Heart's Content in a thick fog. The next morning at 9&nbsp;a.m. a message from England cited these words from the [[editorial|leader]] in ''[[The Times]]'': \"It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men who have achieved it deserve to be honoured among the benefactors of their race.\" \"Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria.\" The shore end was landed during the day by ''Medway''. Congratulations poured in, and friendly telegrams were again exchanged between Queen Victoria and the United States.\n\n[[File:Great Eastern Grappling Hook.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Grappling hook]] used for lifting the cable]]\nIn August 1866, several ships, including ''Great Eastern'', put to sea again in order to grapple the lost cable of 1865. Their goal was to find the end of the lost cable, splice it to new cable, and complete the run to Newfoundland.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Recovery/index.htm |title = History of the Atlantic Cable \u2013 Submarine Telegraphy-Recovery of the Lost Cable |accessdate = August 5, 2008}}</ref>   They were determined to find it, and their search was based solely upon positions recorded \"principally by Captain Moriarty, R.N.\" who placed the end of the lost cable at longitude 38\u00b0 50' W.<ref>Bright, Edward B., \"[http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1866Bright/index.htm Description of the Manufacture, Laying and Working of the Cables of 1865 and 1866...],\" History of the Atlantic Cable & Undersea Communications, Retrieved April 18, 2019.</ref>\n\nThere were some who thought it hopeless to try, declaring that to locate a cable {{cvt|2.5|mi|||}} down would be like looking for a small needle in a large haystack. However, [[Robert Halpin]] navigated HMS ''Terrible'' and grappling ship ''Albany'' to the correct location.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Laying the French Atlantic Cable|journal=Nautical Magazine|year=1869|volume=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7o4EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA460|accessdate=September 10, 2011|page=460|publisher=Brown, Son and Ferguson|quote=To have navigated the ship in a fog so exactly to her proper position was certainly a most wonderful testimony to Captain Halpin's judgment and skill, ...}}</ref>  ''Albany'' moved slowly here and there, \"fishing\" for the lost cable with a five-pronged [[grappling hook]] at the end of a stout rope. Suddenly, on August 10, ''Albany'' \"caught\" the cable and brought it to the surface. It seemed to be an unrealistically easy success, and that is how it turned out. During the night, the cable slipped from the buoy to which it had been secured and the process had to start all over again. This happened several more times, with the cable slipping after being secured in a frustrating battle against rough seas. One time, a sailor even was flung across the deck when the grapnel rope snapped and recoiled around him. ''Great Eastern'' and another grappling ship, ''Medway'', arrived to join the search on the 12th. It was not until over a fortnight later, in early September 1866, that the cable was finally retrieved so that it could be worked on; it took 26 hours to get it safely on board ''Great Eastern''. The cable was carried to the electrician's room, where it was determined that the cable was connected. All on the ship cheered or wept as rockets were sent up into the sky to light the sea. The recovered cable was then spliced to a fresh cable in her hold, and paid out to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content, Newfoundland]], where she arrived on Saturday, September 7. There were now two working telegraph lines.\n\n== Repairing the cable ==\nBroken cables required an elaborate repair procedure. The approximate distance to the break is determined by measuring the resistance of the broken cable. The repair ship navigated to the location. The cable was hooked with a grapple and brought on board to test for electrical continuity. Buoys were deployed to mark the ends of good cable and a splice was made between the two ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoxAwrVzc88C&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=transatlantic+cable+buoy&source=bl&ots=vM5O99xNRP&sig=3J7hvgSPZ2usC7pZwgw3-ZfJgo0&hl=en&ei=ugXKTcmWC-jkiAKmoaWjBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=transatlantic+cable+buoy&f=false|title=The Encyclopaedia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|first=Hugh|last=Chisholm|date=March 18, 2018|publisher=Encyclopaedia britannica Company|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlantic-cable.com/Article/1915CCC/index.htm|title=History of the Atlantic Cable & Submarine Telegraphy - 1915: How submarine cables are made and laid|website=atlantic-cable.com}}</ref>\n\n==Communication speeds==\nInitially messages were sent by an operator sending [[Morse code]]. The reception was very bad on the 1858 cable, and it took two minutes to transmit just one character (a single letter or a single number), a rate of about 0.1 [[words per minute]]. This is despite the use of a highly sensitive [[mirror galvanometer]], a new invention at the time.\n\nThe first message on the 1858 cable took over 17 hours to transmit.<ref name=lac-fam-msg>{{cite web |url=http://epe.lac-bac.gc.ca/100/205/301/ic/cdc/cable/fmessages.htm |work=Famous Messages Received and Sent |title=1858 August 16 Queen Victoria Sends Telegram to President Buchanan |publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate = July 9, 2010}}</ref>  For the 1866 cable, the methods of cable manufacture, as well as sending messages, had been vastly improved.

[[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin]] in later decades understood that the [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of a cable is hindered by an imbalance between capacitive and inductive [[reactance (electronics)|reactance]], which causes a severe [[dispersion relation|dispersion]] and hence a signal distortion; see [[Telegrapher's equations]]. This has to be solved by iron tape or by [[load coil]]s. It was not until the 20th century that message transmission speeds over transatlantic cables would reach even 120 words per minute. Despite this, London had become the world center in telecommunications. Eventually, no fewer than eleven cables radiated from [[Porthcurno]] Cable Station near [[Land's End]] and formed with their Commonwealth links a \"live\" girdle around the world; the [[All Red Line]].\n\n== Later cables ==\nAdditional cables were laid between Foilhommerum and Heart's Content in 1873, 1874, 1880, and 1894. By the end of the 19th century, British-, French-, German-, and American-owned cables linked Europe and North America in a sophisticated web of telegraphic communications.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016|reason=Need a citation for both sentences here.}}\n\nThe original cables were not fitted with [[repeater]]s, which potentially could completely solve the retardation problem and consequently speed up operation.  Repeaters amplify the signal periodically along the line.  On telegraph lines this is done with [[relay]]s, but there was no practical way to power them in a submarine cable. The first transatlantic cable with repeaters was [[TAT-1]] in 1956.  This was a telephone cable and used a different technology for its repeaters.\n\n==Impact==\nA 2018 study in the ''[[The American Economic Review|American Economic Review]]'' found that the transatlantic telegraph substantially increased trade over the Atlantic and reduced prices.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Steinwender|first=Claudia|date=2018|title=Real Effects of Information Frictions: When the States and the Kingdom Became United|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20150681|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=108|issue=3|pages=657\u2013696|doi=10.1257/aer.20150681|issn=0002-8282|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> The study estimates that \"the efficiency gains of the telegraph to be equivalent to 8 percent of export value\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Robert Halpin]] \u2013 Captain of ''Great Eastern''\n* [[Transatlantic telephone cable]]\n* [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] \u2013 overland alternative via Russia\n* [[1929 Grand Banks earthquake]]\n* [[Commercial Cable Company]]\n* [[Enderby's Wharf]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n* [[Charles Tilston Bright|Bright, Charles Tilston]], [https://archive.org/details/cihm_00867/page/n3 ''Submarine Telegraphs''], London: Crosby Lockwood, 1898 {{oclc|776529627}}.\n* [[Arthur C.
