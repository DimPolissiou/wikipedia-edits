{"title_page": "Damon Buxton", "text_new": "'''Damon Buxton''' is an American contemporary classical acoustic guitarist and composer. He uses silent spaces, open tunings, natural reverb, and double picking. Buxton is a self-taught musician who began playing the guitar at age 21 and developed his trademark fingerpicking style.

His father was a businessman who negotiated the manufacture of aircraft components in Naples, Italy, and played the Hammond organ and accordion. His mother was a homemaker and church singer.

Formerly a [[Korean Empire|single nation]] that was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1910, the two nations have been [[Division of Korea|divided]] since the end of [[World War II]] in 1945 and engaged in the [[Korean War]] from 1950\u20131953.  North Korea is an authoritarian [[one-party state]] [[Communist state]] run by the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]. South Korea was formerly governed by one-party military dictatorships until 1987 when it held [[direct election]]s. Both nations claim the entire [[Korean peninsula]] and outlying islands. Both nations joined the [[United Nations]] in 1991 and are recognized by most member states. Since the 1970s, both nations have held informal diplomatic dialogues in order to ease military tensions. In 2000, President [[Kim Dae-jung]] became the first [[President of South Korea]] to visit [[North Korea]], 55 years after the peninsula was divided.\n\nUnder President Kim, South Korea adopted [[Sunshine Policy|the Sunshine Policy]] in pursuit of more peaceful relationships with North Korea.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moon |first1=Jong-In |last2=Steinberg |first2=David I. |title=Kim Dae-jung government and sunshine policy: promises and challenges |url=https://archive.org/details/kimdaejunggovern00moon |url-access=registration |date=1999 |publisher=Yonsei University Press |location=Seoul |isbn=8971414936}}</ref> The policy established the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]], among other things. This policy was continued by the next president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] who also visited North Korea in 2007 and met with North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]]. Through this meeting both leaders signed a declaration to pursue peace and recover inter-Korean relations. However, faced with growing criticism, the Sunshine Policy was discontinued under the next two governments. During [[Lee Myung-bak]] and [[Park Geun-Hye]]'s presidency, the relationship between North and South Korea became more hostile.\n \nIn 2018, beginning with North Korea's participation in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the relationship has seen a major diplomatic breakthrough and become significantly warmer. In April 2018, the two countries signed the [[Panmunjom Declaration|Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula]].<ref name=april272018>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-panmmunjom-declaration-full-text-of-agreement-between-north-korea-and-south-korea/|title=The full text of North and South Korea\u2019s agreement, annotated|first=Adam|last=Taylor|date=27 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232536/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-panmmunjom-declaration-full-text-of-agreement-between-north-korea-and-south-korea/|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2018, a majority of South Koreans approved the new relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/majority-of-south-koreans-favor-north-korea-friendship/a-42643399|title=Majority of South Koreans favor North Korea 'friendship' {{!}} DW {{!}} 19.02.2018|work=DW.COM|access-date=2018-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190315/https://www.dw.com/en/majority-of-south-koreans-favor-north-korea-friendship/a-42643399|archive-date=2018-08-01|url-status=live|publisher=Deutsche Welle|language=en}}</ref> The summits between North and South Korea have also facilitated positive relationships between North Korea and the United States.

On August 9, 1945, in the closing days of [[World War Two]], the Soviet Union [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War|declared war on Japan]] and advanced into Korea. Though the Soviet declaration of war had been agreed by the Allies at the [[Yalta Conference]], the US government became concerned at the prospect of all of Korea falling under Soviet control. The US government therefore requested Soviet forces halt their advance at the [[38th parallel north]], leaving the south of the peninsula, including the capital, [[Seoul]], to be occupied by the US. This was incorporated into [[General Order No. 1]] to Japanese forces after the [[Surrender of Japan]] on August 15. On August 24, the Red Army entered [[Pyongyang]] and established a military government over Korea north of the parallel. American forces landed in the south on September 8 and established the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]].<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=50}}</ref>\n\nThe Allies had originally envisaged a joint trusteeship which would steer Korea towards independence, but most Korean nationalists wanted independence immediately.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=59}}</ref> Meanwhile, the wartime co-operation between the Soviet Union and the US deteriorated as the [[Cold War]] took hold.

Formerly a [[Korean Empire|single nation]] that was [[Korea under Japanese rule|annexed]] by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1910, the two nations have been [[Division of Korea|divided]] since the end of [[World War II]] in 1945 and engaged in the [[Korean War]] from 1950\u20131953.  North Korea is an authoritarian [[one-party state]] [[Communist state]] run by the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim dynasty]]. South Korea was formerly governed by one-party military dictatorships until 1987 when it held [[direct election]]s. Both nations claim the entire [[Korean peninsula]] and outlying islands. Both nations joined the [[United Nations]] in 1991 and are recognized by most member states. Since the 1970s, both nations have held informal diplomatic dialogues in order to ease military tensions. In 2000, President [[Kim Dae-jung]] became the first [[President of South Korea]] to visit [[North Korea]], 55 years after the peninsula was divided.\n\nUnder President Kim, South Korea adopted [[Sunshine Policy|the Sunshine Policy]] in pursuit of more peaceful relationships with North Korea.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moon |first1=Jong-In |last2=Steinberg |first2=David I. |title=Kim Dae-jung government and sunshine policy: promises and challenges |url=https://archive.org/details/kimdaejunggovern00moon |url-access=registration |date=1999 |publisher=Yonsei University Press |location=Seoul |isbn=8971414936}}</ref> The policy established the [[Kaesong Industrial Region]], among other things. This policy was continued by the next president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] who also visited North Korea in 2007 and met with North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-il]]. Through this meeting both leaders signed a declaration to pursue peace and recover inter-Korean relations. However, faced with growing criticism, the Sunshine Policy was discontinued under the next two governments. During [[Lee Myung-bak]] and [[Park Geun-Hye]]'s presidency, the relationship between North and South Korea became more hostile.\n \nIn 2018, beginning with North Korea's participation in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], the relationship has seen a major diplomatic breakthrough and become significantly warmer. In April 2018, the two countries signed the [[Panmunjom Declaration|Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula]].<ref name=april272018>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-panmmunjom-declaration-full-text-of-agreement-between-north-korea-and-south-korea/|title=The full text of North and South Korea\u2019s agreement, annotated|first=Adam|last=Taylor|date=27 April 2018|via=www.washingtonpost.com|access-date=4 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232536/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/04/27/the-panmmunjom-declaration-full-text-of-agreement-between-north-korea-and-south-korea/|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2018, a majority of South Koreans approved the new relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dw.com/en/majority-of-south-koreans-favor-north-korea-friendship/a-42643399|title=Majority of South Koreans favor North Korea 'friendship' {{!}} DW {{!}} 19.02.2018|work=DW.COM|access-date=2018-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801190315/https://www.dw.com/en/majority-of-south-koreans-favor-north-korea-friendship/a-42643399|archive-date=2018-08-01|url-status=live|publisher=Deutsche Welle|language=en}}</ref> The summits between North and South Korea have also facilitated positive relationships between North Korea and the United States.

On August 9, 1945, in the closing days of [[World War Two]], the Soviet Union [[Soviet\u2013Japanese War|declared war on Japan]] and advanced into Korea. Though the Soviet declaration of war had been agreed by the Allies at the [[Yalta Conference]], the US government became concerned at the prospect of all of Korea falling under Soviet control. The US government therefore requested Soviet forces halt their advance at the [[38th parallel north]], leaving the south of the peninsula, including the capital, [[Seoul]], to be occupied by the US. This was incorporated into [[General Order No. 1]] to Japanese forces after the [[Surrender of Japan]] on August 15. On August 24, the Red Army entered [[Pyongyang]] and established a military government over Korea north of the parallel. American forces landed in the south on September 8 and established the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]].<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=50}}</ref>\n\nThe Allies had originally envisaged a joint trusteeship which would steer Korea towards independence, but most Korean nationalists wanted independence immediately.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Making of Modern Korea | last = Buzo | first = Adrian | year = 2002| publisher = Routledge| location = London | isbn = 0-415-23749-1 |p=59}}</ref> Meanwhile, the wartime co-operation between the Soviet Union and the US deteriorated as the [[Cold War]] took hold.
