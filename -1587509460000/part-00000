{"title_page": "Canadian Mental Health Association", "text_new": "{{short description|Canadian mental health non-profit organization}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{advert|date=September 2012}}\n}}\nThe '''Canadian Mental Health Association''' (CMHA) is the [[Canada|Canadian]] association founded on April 26, 1918 by Dr. [[Clarence M. Hincks]] and [[Clifford W. Beers]]. Originally named the ''Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene'', it is one of the largest and oldest [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] [[health organization]]s operating in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-05-17 | url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha | title=About the Canadian Mental Health Association}}</ref> \n\nEach year, CMHA divisions and branches across Canada provide service to more than 1.3 million Canadians annually through the combined efforts of more than 10,000 volunteers and 5,000 staff in locally run organizations in more than 300 communities in every province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1149979/canadian-mental-health-association-marks-earth-day-with-support-from-bell-let-s-talk|title=Canadian Mental Health Association marks Earth Day with support from Bell Let's Talk|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> Its functions are to provide the resources and programs necessary to combat mental health issues and support recovery. \n\n==History==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association originally started as the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH) in response to the hundreds of soldiers retuning from World War I experiencing [[mental illness]].<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha|title=History of CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Veterans' were place in prisons and asylums and Dr. Clarence M. Hincks noticed the lack of support, doctors and treatment inside these institutions, thus creating the need to change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha|title=About CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Hincks, unsure how to proceed, partnered with Clifford W. Beers who had experience in the National Committee of Mental Hygiene in the United States to being mental hygiene to Canada.\n\nThe first official meeting of the CNCMH was held in Ottawa on April 26, 1918. A provisional constitution was adopted, Dr C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine at McGill University, was elected President, Dr C.K. Clarke was appointed Medical Director, and Dr. C.M. Hincks was appointed Associate Medical Director and Secretary.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe meeting aimed to devised a plan to best assist those already in need as well as preventative measures in the future. This included objectives like a psychiatric and mental examinations of recruits, insuring adequate facilities for diagnosis and proper treatment for soldiers returning suffering from a mental disability or disease, and prevention of mental disease and deficiency.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nHincks then worked on finding doctors, creating a Board of Directors, and gaining donors to build his committee. With an importance of having a team of approved medical professions, Hincks discovered C.K. Clarke, Dean of Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the medical faculty of McGill. Hincks selected 18 members for his Board of Directors, including well known names like Lord Shaughnessy, President of the CPR; Richard B. Angus, Montreal financier and philanthropist; Dr. C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine, McGill University; Sir Vincent Meredith, President, Bank of Montreal; and F.W. Molson, President of Molson's Brewery.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nHincks utilized co-founder Clifford W. Beers personal experience in mental health as a tool to share during \"drawing-room meetings\", or afternoon teas with influential women in order to gain the support of their wealthy friends. The strategy was extended to homes of friends in Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa, and it proved successful by recruiting an impressive list of potential members and donors.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n=== Surveys ===\nOne of the first opportunities for the association was a project given by Lieutenant Colonel Colin Russel who asked CNCMH to visit all mental institutions-- jails, schools, hospitals, and special homes-- in the province of Manitoba caring for soldiers. Russel had previously visited these sites and was distressed with the conditions of the facilities as well as the treatment and hoped to change them.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nOn September 30, 1918, Hincks and his secretary Miss Marjorie Keyes arrived and visited several institutions including the Salvation Army Industrial Home and the Home for Incurables in Portage la Prairie. Shocked by what they discovered, Hincks and Keyes submitted a formal report of surveys to the government and the Public Welfare Commission. Thus sparking a request for similar surveys to occur in other provinces. During the next four years, requests for surveys were received from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]], Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Surveys reviled the impact war had on individuals, highlighting neuropsychiatric disorders and mental health diseases, as well as the improper treatment and care of soldiers. This project helped to pave the way of the National Committee and extend their focus to more than just soldiers.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nOriginal surveys conducted for the Lieutenant showed the extent of mental disorder was found to be greater than expected and extended beyond veterans. Surveys in schools showed a large number of mental retardation and psychiatric disorders in children. However, programs to address the children's needs were non-existent. CNCMH recommended the government spend over six million dollars to improve facilities and establish auxiliary classes for the special education of such children.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nAs a result from these surveys, 150 special classes were established, rehabilitation of soldiers suffering from mental health issues was properly addressed, and there was a reduction in the new  number of cases of Canadians with mental disorders.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== Current Programs ==\n\n=== Peer Support Canada ===\nPeer Support Canada is an organization which specializes in connecting certified people who have experienced and beaten mental health issues with current sufferers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/peer-support-canada|title=Peer Support Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group also offers a certification, a three-phase program where individuals are be assessed and verified based on the national Standards of Practice regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to assist those with mental health challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peersupportcanada.ca/|title=Peer Support Canada|website=peersupportcanada.ca|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Not Myself Today ===\nNot Myself Today is a campaign addressing mental health issues by cultivating a better workplace culture through training and services in corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/not-myself-today|title=Not Myself Today|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Companies that use the program receive a toolkit containing planning support, awareness and engagement activities, and evaluation tools. Participants also have access to an exclusive online portal, as well as national recognition from the Canadian Mental Health Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.notmyselftoday.ca/what-you-receive/|title=Not Myself Today - What You Receive|website=www.notmyselftoday.ca|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Carryit ===\nThe CMHA introduced Carryit in 2019, a toolkit to be used by those involved in schools to carry with them in case of opioid overdoses. The kit includes a method by which schools can create opioid overdose protocols through providing educational materials on opioids and [[naloxone]], fact sheets related to drug use, social media content examples, posters, and other useful tools to create an understanding and blueprint of how to combat drug overdoses in educational institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/carryit|title=Carry It Toolkit|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery Colleges ===\nThe CMHA has introduced Recovery Colleges that bring together both trained professionals and those who have lived with mental health issues to develop and deliver courses designed to facilitate the hope and skills necessary to help students recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/recovery-college|title=Recovery Colleges|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> They are based off of a similar system that was started in 2009 in the UK and have spread to several locations in Canada, thus far. Peer Support Canada has also played an integral role in connecting those with shared experiences to provide emotional support and have collaborative discussions in how to achieve recovery.\n\n== Public Policy Statements ==\nThe CMHA releases public statements criticizing local, provincial, and federal regulation as they pertain to mental health. Often, the statements express the organization\u2019s perspective on a certain issue and subsequently call for action.\n\n=== Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) ===\nThe Canadian Bill C-14 formally legalized assisted dying and laid out the foundations of how it can be accessed by the patients in need. In September 2017, CMHA released a statement declaring their position that MAiD for psychiatric patients should remain illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> This statement is rooted in the organization\u2019s core belief in recovery from illness. The organization continued to provide the government with a number of recommendations including:\n\n* Ensuring that recovery-oriented practices are implemented\n* Continuing to invest in community mental health and addictions services and supports\n* Developing and funding the implementation of a national suicide prevention strategy\n* Investing in research to better understand mental illnesses.\n\n=== Call for Mental Health Legislation ===\nIn September 2018, CMHA called for new legislation to bring mental health into balance with physical health. This statement followed a survey commissioned by the CMHA discovered that over half of Canadians (53%) consider anxiety and depression to be \u2018epidemic\u2019 in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/over-half-of-canadians-consider-anxiety-and-depression-epidemic|title=Over half of Canadians consider anxiety and depression \u2018epidemic\u2019|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Opioid Crisis Response ===\nFollowing the escalating rates of opioid-related injuries and deaths in Canada in 2009, CMHA developed and in-depth evidence-based policy and regulation paper directed at the Canadian government, policy markers and health organizations. CMHA gathered resources and organizations such as the Public Policy Working Group, the National Council of Persons with Lived Experience, the national provincial executive team and the national board of directors in drafting this policy paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/care-not-corrections-relieving-the-opioid-crisis-in-canada|title=Care not Corrections: Relieving the Opioid Crisis in Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund ===\nIn August 2009, the CMHA endorsed Health Action Lobby\u2019s (HEAL) document concluding that a health human resources infrastructure is required in Canada. CMHA cited an aging workforce and a higher volume and complexity of population health needs as reasons to establish this fund, along with the fact that the last similar act (Health Resources Fund Act) was introduced over 50 years ago in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/a-proposal-to-establish-a-national-health-human-resources-infrastructure-fund|title=A Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== Shortcomings ==\n\n=== Kingston Branch Closure ===\nIn March of 2020, the Canadian Mental Health Association was forced to close down its Kingston Branch due to a lack of financial support.

Hincks]] and [[Clifford W. Beers]]. Originally named the ''Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene'', it is one of the largest and oldest [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] [[health organization]]s operating in [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-05-17 | url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha | title=About the Canadian Mental Health Association}}</ref> \n\nEach year, CMHA divisions and branches across Canada provide service to more than 1.3 million Canadians annually through the combined efforts of more than 10,000 volunteers and 5,000 staff in locally run organizations in more than 300 communities in every province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1149979/canadian-mental-health-association-marks-earth-day-with-support-from-bell-let-s-talk|title=Canadian Mental Health Association marks Earth Day with support from Bell Let's Talk|website=www.newswire.ca}}</ref> Its functions are to provide the resources and programs necessary to combat mental health issues and support recovery. \n\n==History==\n{{unsourced|section|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Creation ===\nThe Canadian Mental Health Association originally started as the Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene (CNCMH) in response to the hundreds of soldiers retuning from World War I experiencing [[mental illness]].<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha/history-of-cmha|title=History of CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Veterans' were place in prisons and asylums and Dr. Clarence M. Hincks noticed the lack of support, doctors and treatment inside these institutions, thus creating the need to change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/about-cmha|title=About CMHA|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> Hincks, unsure how to proceed, partnered with Clifford W. Beers who had experience in the National Committee of Mental Hygiene in the United States to being mental hygiene to Canada.\n\nThe first official meeting of the CNCMH was held in Ottawa on April 26, 1918. A provisional constitution was adopted, Dr C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine at McGill University, was elected President, Dr C.K. Clarke was appointed Medical Director, and Dr. C.M. Hincks was appointed Associate Medical Director and Secretary.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe meeting aimed to devised a plan to best assist those already in need as well as preventative measures in the future. This included objectives like a psychiatric and mental examinations of recruits, insuring adequate facilities for diagnosis and proper treatment for soldiers returning suffering from a mental disability or disease, and prevention of mental disease and deficiency.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nHincks then worked on finding doctors, creating a Board of Directors, and gaining donors to build his committee. With an importance of having a team of approved medical professions, Hincks discovered C.K. Clarke, Dean of Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto, and the medical faculty of McGill. Hincks selected 18 members for his Board of Directors, including well known names like Lord Shaughnessy, President of the CPR; Richard B. Angus, Montreal financier and philanthropist; Dr. C.F. Martin, Professor of Medicine, McGill University; Sir Vincent Meredith, President, Bank of Montreal; and F.W. Molson, President of Molson's Brewery.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nHincks utilized co-founder Clifford W. Beers personal experience in mental health as a tool to share during \"drawing-room meetings\", or afternoon teas with influential women in order to gain the support of their wealthy friends. The strategy was extended to homes of friends in Quebec City, Montreal and Ottawa, and it proved successful by recruiting an impressive list of potential members and donors.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n<br />\n\n=== Hospital Surveys ===\nLieutenant Colonel Colin Russel soon gave the CNCMH an opportunity to undertake a project. Russel was the consultant neurologist to the Department of Soldiers and had visited many of the provincial mental hospitals which were caring for soldier patients. He was particularly distressed with those facilities in Manitoba. That province's government included with the mental hospitals in the province, all the institutions presently caring for the mentally disordered or defective including jails, schools, special homes and juvenile courts.\n\nOn September 30, 1918, Hincks and Keyes arrived in Winnipeg, where they visited several institutions. They also toured the Salvation Army Industrial Home and the Home for Incurables in Portage la Prairie and were so shocked by what they found that they immediately returned to Winnipeg to consult with government representatives. The CNCMH prepared a confidential report on its findings which was submitted to the government and the Public Welfare Commission.\n\nAs a result of the Manitoba Survey, and that province's quick response in implementing the recommendations, other provinces became interested in having similar surveys. During the next four years, requests for surveys were received from British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, [[Prince Edward Island]], Alberta, and Saskatchewan. As in Manitoba, these surveys included all institutions. Results of these surveys, however, have had controversial implications, including how they were used to argue for pro-sterilization policies by the [[Alberta Eugenics Board#Historical context|Alberta Eugenics Board]] and in the form of the ''[[Sexual Sterilization Act]]'' of Alberta.\n\nThe CNCMH also was very involved in the plight of soldiers. It became evident to Hincks that soldiers under care were not receiving adequate treatment. Assisted by Miss Keyes, Dr. Clarke conducted a quick inspection of soldier patients in 10 hospitals in the western. The results of this preliminary survey were published in 1920. Highlighting the problem of shell shock and other neuropsychiatric disorders affecting so many able-bodied men helped pave the way for the work of the National Committee.\n\n=== Schoolchildren Surveys ===\nSchools were other areas of involvement. Dr. Hincks and Dr. Helen MacMurchy pressed for surveys to assess the extent of mental retardation and other psychiatric disorders among schoolchildren and to provide support for the establishment of auxiliary classes for the special education of such children. In its first five years, the CNCMH built a firm foundation for meeting the objectives established in 1918. Surveys on the care and treatment of people suffering from mental disorders were conducted in every province. Mental hospitals in all provinces, except Ontario and Quebec, were inspected at the request of provincial governments. The extent of mental disorder was found to be greater than expected, and preventive programs were non-existent. Under the committee's recommendations, provincial governments spent over six million dollars on improving facilities for the mentally ill.\n\nCNCMH surveys of schoolchildren, conducted in several centres in Ontario and Quebec, resulted in over 150 special classes for retarded children being established by school boards. Mental Hygiene clinics were promoted and, in some cases, partially supported. A study of the psychiatric screening of immigrants resulted in a reduction in the number of new Canadians with mental disorders. The problem of \"shell shock\" and the rehabilitation of soldiers suffering from mental and nervous disorders was addressed through co-operation with DSCR and the Director General of Medical Services in the army. A beginning was made on public and professional education in mental hygiene and psychiatry.\n\n== Current Programs ==\n\n=== Peer Support Canada ===\nPeer Support Canada is an organization which specializes in connecting certified people who have experienced and beaten mental health issues with current sufferers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/peer-support-canada|title=Peer Support Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> The group also offers a certification, a three-phase program where individuals are be assessed and verified based on the national Standards of Practice regarding the knowledge and skills necessary to assist those with mental health challenges.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peersupportcanada.ca/|title=Peer Support Canada|website=peersupportcanada.ca|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Not Myself Today ===\nNot Myself Today is a campaign addressing mental health issues by cultivating a better workplace culture through training and services in corporations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/not-myself-today|title=Not Myself Today|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Companies that use the program receive a toolkit containing planning support, awareness and engagement activities, and evaluation tools.

The kit includes a method by which schools can create opioid overdose protocols through providing educational materials on opioids and [[naloxone]], fact sheets related to drug use, social media content examples, posters, and other useful tools to create an understanding and blueprint of how to combat drug overdoses in educational institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/carryit|title=Carry It Toolkit|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n=== Recovery Colleges ===\nThe CMHA has introduced Recovery Colleges that bring together both trained professionals and those who have lived with mental health issues to develop and deliver courses designed to facilitate the hope and skills necessary to help students recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/programs-services/recovery-college|title=Recovery Colleges|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> They are based off of a similar system that was started in 2009 in the UK and have spread to several locations in Canada, thus far. Peer Support Canada has also played an integral role in connecting those with shared experiences to provide emotional support and have collaborative discussions in how to achieve recovery.\n\n== Public Policy Statements ==\nThe CMHA releases public statements criticizing local, provincial, and federal regulation as they pertain to mental health. Often, the statements express the organization\u2019s perspective on a certain issue and subsequently call for action.\n\n=== Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) ===\nThe Canadian Bill C-14 formally legalized assisted dying and laid out the foundations of how it can be accessed by the patients in need. In September 2017, CMHA released a statement declaring their position that MAiD for psychiatric patients should remain illegal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/cmha-position-on-medical-assistance-in-dying|title=CMHA Position on Medical Assistance in Dying|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> This statement is rooted in the organization\u2019s core belief in recovery from illness. The organization continued to provide the government with a number of recommendations including:\n\n* Ensuring that recovery-oriented practices are implemented\n* Continuing to invest in community mental health and addictions services and supports\n* Developing and funding the implementation of a national suicide prevention strategy\n* Investing in research to better understand mental illnesses.\n\n=== Call for Mental Health Legislation ===\nIn September 2018, CMHA called for new legislation to bring mental health into balance with physical health. This statement followed a survey commissioned by the CMHA discovered that over half of Canadians (53%) consider anxiety and depression to be \u2018epidemic\u2019 in Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/over-half-of-canadians-consider-anxiety-and-depression-epidemic|title=Over half of Canadians consider anxiety and depression \u2018epidemic\u2019|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Opioid Crisis Response ===\nFollowing the escalating rates of opioid-related injuries and deaths in Canada in 2009, CMHA developed and in-depth evidence-based policy and regulation paper directed at the Canadian government, policy markers and health organizations. CMHA gathered resources and organizations such as the Public Policy Working Group, the National Council of Persons with Lived Experience, the national provincial executive team and the national board of directors in drafting this policy paper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/care-not-corrections-relieving-the-opioid-crisis-in-canada|title=Care not Corrections: Relieving the Opioid Crisis in Canada|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund ===\nIn August 2009, the CMHA endorsed Health Action Lobby\u2019s (HEAL) document concluding that a health human resources infrastructure is required in Canada. CMHA cited an aging workforce and a higher volume and complexity of population health needs as reasons to establish this fund, along with the fact that the last similar act (Health Resources Fund Act) was introduced over 50 years ago in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cmha.ca/documents/a-proposal-to-establish-a-national-health-human-resources-infrastructure-fund|title=A Proposal to Establish a National Health Human Resources Infrastructure Fund|website=CMHA National|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\n== Shortcomings ==\n\n=== Kingston Branch Closure ===\nIn March of 2020, the Canadian Mental Health Association was forced to close down its Kingston Branch due to a lack of financial support.

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] wore a dark brown wig to play Katniss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/43990-hows-jennifer-lawrences-wig-in-mockingjay-holding-up-lets-see-here-photos|title=How's J Law's 'Mockingjay' Wig Holding Up?|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/jennifer-lawrence-gets-lead-role-hunger-games-25482 | title=Jennifer Lawrence Gets Lead Role in 'The Hunger Games' | author=Joshua L.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay.

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

He served as the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|grand vizier]] of sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. R\u00fcstem Pasha is also known as Damat R\u00fcstem Pasha (the epithet ''[[damat]]'' meaning \"son-in-law\" to the [[Ottoman dynasty]]) as a result of his marriage to the sultan's daughter, [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. He is known as one of the most influential and successful grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nRustem Pasha was taken as a child to [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), where he built a military and bureaucracy career. He was very well educated. On 26 November 1539, he married Mihrimah Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife [[Hurrem Sultan]]. His brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] was an Ottoman grand admiral.\n\n==Early life==\nOttoman sources speak about Rustem as a [[Croat]] or [[Albanians|Albanian]]. He is referred to as a Serbian by Turkey's historiographer [[Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee]]  . Rustem is referred to as a Croat by Tayib  Osman-zade Ahmed, writer of the work \"Hadikatul vuzara\" and the Turkish encyclopedia Kamus-ul-alam. Julias Ceasar also mentions him as a serb.<ref> \nHamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107, Veliki vezir Rustem-pa\u0161a, ZNAKOVI VREMENA \u2022 SARAJEVO \u2022  2018 http://www.ibn-sina.net/images/pdf/znakovi/82/45_Hamdija_Kre%C5%A1evljakovi%C4%87___znakovi_82.pdf #page=47</ref>\nR\u00fcstem owes his career to the support of [[Hurrem Sultan]], he was extremely ambitious. [[Rustem Pasha]] was a man of very humble origins. He came as a child to Constantinople where he studied at [[Enderun]], an institute for the education/indoctrination of talented boys stolen from christian parents in the Balkans. At the end, the graduates were able to speak, read and write at least three languages, able to understand the latest developments in [[science]], [[finance]] and excel in army command as well as in [[close combat]] skills. That was the perfect start for a career in the [[military]] and bureaucracy. In 1526, R\u00fcstem took part in the [[Battle of Mohacs]] as [[silahdar]] (weapon bearer in a cavalry division). Silahdars were an elite division of the [[Ottoman army]]. Members of this division could also become ordinary soldiers (non-aristocrat), if they proved to be extraordinarily courageous and loyal. \n\nA few years later R\u00fcstem advanced to [[mirahur-i evvel]] aga (chief supervisor of the sultan's stables) and [[rikab-dar]] (the [[stirrup holder]] when the ruler got on the horse). The [[mirahur]] accompanied the Sultan during his travels, so the Sultan knew R\u00fcstem a long time before he appointed him, possibly inspired by Hurrem, the tutor of his sons. In making this decision, he was surely influenced by R\u00fcstem's character. Most historical sources describe R\u00fcstem as a reasonable and calm man with a keen intellect, who always keeps a cool head, and who is always unconditionally devoted to his ruler. These characteristics reflected R\u00fcstem's faith, and brought R\u00fcstem, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and the famous jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi]] (Mehmed Ebussuud Efendi), permanently closer together. R\u00fcstem was a Sunni and preferred the spiritual order of Sunni Islam Sufism Naqshbandi.\n\n==Wealth and legacy==\n[[File:Rustem Pasha Mosque.JPG|thumb|175px|right]]\nAs Grand Vizier, he collected vast wealth. Even R\u00fcstem's sworn opponents admitted, that he never boasted of his wealth or power (although he was a man of fortune), and that he was the very first Grand Vizier in the history of the [[Ottoman Empire]] who significantly contributed to the development of the state from his own funds. According to most period testimonies (excluding Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's \"[[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] Mersiyesi\"), R\u00fcstem was considered one of the few state dignitaries who didn't take bribes. Nonetheless, R\u00fcstem's famous economic talent and his modest way of life, both highly valued by the Sultan, made him rich, even before his marriage to [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. In his last will (a part of endowment charter from 1561), R\u00fcstem made an inventory of every single detail of his property, in order to secure his great foundation projects after his death. R\u00fcstem's testament determines exactly which part of his property belongs to the state, to his foundations, to the [[Hurrem Sultan]]'s foundation and to Mihrimah's foundations, what he leaves to his wife Mihrimah and to their daughter [[Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan]]. He determines his wife Mihrimah Sultan as executor of his last will and his daughter Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah as the executor and administrator of his foundations.\n\nAll historians emphasize [[R\u00fcstem]]'s relentless hard work to consolidate the troubled economy of the Ottoman Empire - impoverished by excessive spending on wars and a lavish lifestyle of the court - and his efforts to improve it. The period documents say that he also generously financed this upswing from his own resources. On his lands were built toll free bridges, roads, covered bazaars, granaries, baths, hospices, caravanserais, convents, schools and various other establishments for the public benefit. Their funding was largely secured by the leasing of R\u00fcstem's estates. He supported agriculture, founded new trading centers, like the bazaar in Sarajevo or silk factories in [[Bursa]] and [[Istanbul]], social and educational institutions. He developed the domestic economy by encouraging major public works projects and built a modern infrastructure: trade routes, and water networks in Istanbul, [[Mecca]] and [[Jerusalem]].\n\nHe also found enough money in the treasury to make Suleiman's dream come true ([[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], 1550\u201357), as well as to fund other monumental architectural projects realized by the legendary [[Mimar Sinan]]. To reduce protectionism in the state administration, an official installment fee was introduced, and confiscated when the officials misused his authority. R\u00fcstem's reform of the military remained unfinished. At the time of his death in Constantinople on 10 July 1561, his personal property included 815 lands in Rumelia and Anatolia, 476 mills, 1700 slaves, 2,900 war horses, 1,106 camels, 800 gold ambroidery Holy Qur'ans, 500 books, 5000 Caftan, 130 kinds of armors, 860 gold embroidered swords, 1500 silver tolga, 1000 silver balls, 33 precious jewels etc.\n\nThe [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque]] (Turkish: R\u00fcstem Pa\u015fa Camii) is an Ottoman mosque located in Has\u0131rc\u0131lar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131 (Strawmat Weavers Market) in Fatih, Turkey, which was designed by Ottoman imperial architect [[Mimar Sinan]] for Grand Vizier R\u00fcstem Pasha. It was built between 1561 and 1563.\n\n==Political career==\nAt first, R\u00fcstem Pasha was a [[Sanjak-bey|sanjak bey]]. After the death of [[Pargali Ibrahim Pasha]] his way became very easy. He was promoted to Baylerbey of the [[Diyarbakir]]. When he married [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]], Rustem was already a vizier. [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] made Rustem the grand vizier for the first time in 1544. But in 1553, Rustem was dismissed from his position. After two years he took this position again from 1555 until his death in 1561.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LE9QAAAAMAAJ&q=Rustem+pasa+power&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIQTAF|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|last=Necipo\u011flu|first=G\u00fclru|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|isbn=9780262140508|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a diplomat, R\u00fcstem initiated many trade agreements with European countries and India. His biggest success in the diplomatic area, was the agreement with the King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], which confirmed, without firing a shot, the western border of the Ottoman Empire for more than 14 years (signed in 1547). Ferdinand renounced his claim to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and agreed to pay a tax of 30,000 gold ducats per year into the Ottoman treasury. The ambassador of the Emperor Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq wrote that Charles had tried on several occasions to revise the unfavourable agreement, but R\u00fcstem had always prevented it. R\u00fcstem also worked on the agreement with the [[Safavids]] (signed 1554), which ended the long-standing Ottoman-Safavid wars, and secured the eastern borders of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSuleiman was manipulated by Hurrem's intrigues when he murdered Ibrahim and replaced him with his son-in-law, R\u00fcstem Pasha. R\u00fcstem was not Suleiman's son-in-law when Ibrahim Pasha was executed. The background of Ibrahim's execution was much more complicated (e.g. he used the seal \"Sultan Ibrahim\", retained the majority of the confiscated property of Suleiman's \"minister of finance\" [[\u0130skender \u00c7elebi]], whose execution he ordered etc.). Ibrahim was replaced with [[Ayas Mehmed Pasha]], followed by [[L\u00fctfi Pasha]] and [[Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha]]. R\u00fcstem's career developed, unlike Ibrahim, exactly according to the rules. He became Grand Vizier eight years after Ibrahim's death.\n\nLater Hurrem and R\u00fcstem conspired against [[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] for many years. The very ambitious Mustafa received foreign ambassadors as well as Ottoman commanders many times, without his father's knowledge, and was regarded by them as an important ally against Suleiman. So the Austrian ambassador Ghislain de Busbecq (visiting Mustafa before S\u00fcleyman), informed his ruler: \"Mustafa will be an excellent sultan, receptive and open to talks.\" And the Papal ambassador Navagero said: \"Mustafa lives with his mother. She says that people adore him.\" Understanding the danger of the situation, Suleiman remembered his father Selim dethroning his grandfather Bayezid (who was killed only a month after his abdication in 1512). Officers loyal to him advised that a part of the army is getting ready to put Mustafa on the throne. In 1552, while preparing a campaign against Persia, Suleiman appointed R\u00fcstem \"Serasker\" (commander-in-chief) of the campaign. But soldiers assembled in the military camp in Karaman (Anatolia), rejected Suleiman's appointment, and insisted R\u00fcstem should be replaced with Mustafa (the same problem was faced by R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]], as admiral of the Ottoman fleet during the Tripolis siege, even though he achieved many victories until his death in 1553).\n\nThe destabilization continued. Mustafa's so-often cited correspondence with the [[Safavid]]s signed \"Sultan Mustafa\" (kept today in archives), was, in this context, probably not so relevant. It could be authentic, it could be a Safavids' or a Hurrem-R\u00fcstem deception, or maybe Suleiman's safeguard to calm public opinion after Mustafa's death. There are various versions of reports on Mustafa's end in the Ere\u011fli valley. According to one of them, R\u00fcstem Pasha made an offer to Mustafa to join his father's army and at the same time he warned Suleiman that Mustafa was coming to kill him. According to another version, it was Suleiman himself who summoned his son to Ere\u011fli, and Mustafa came, \"confident that the army would protect him\".\n\nOnly R\u00fcstem appears in all the versions as the antagonist. However, it is not surprising, as they are all based on Mustafa's PR chief consultant [[Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey]]'s elegy, \"\u015eehzade Mustafa Mersiyesi\". Even the report of the Austrian ambassador de Busbecq, who claims to have received an account from an eyewitness, had the same origin. R\u00fcstem, suspended and banished, was fair game as an object of violence. No one dared to criticize the Sultan himself. Suleiman probably realized this, and called R\u00fcstem back two years later.\n\nR\u00fcstem's scapegoating as the seemingly dominant figure of the \"conspiracy against Mustafa\", radically changed public opinion. And so the R\u00fcstem extolled years ago as the \"pillar of the Ottoman empire\", brilliant economist and sophisticated statesman, was forgotten, as well as his great projects and charitable foundations. He became R\u00fcstem the \"black heart, the murderer of the loved Prince Mustafa\". Nothing was enough to make him dirty: his \"dirty\" origin, the imputation of bribery, the story with the louse... Some foreign ambassadors like Ghiselin de Busbecq or Bernardo Navagero, repeated it spitefully in their reports (all the more that R\u00fcstem was as a diplomat an invincible opponent, the agreement from 1547 must not be forgotten). Unlike them, Jean Chesneau, the secretary of the French ambassador, wrote about him: \"The grand vizier is a man of humble origin, who, thanks to his talent and will, worked his way up from nothing. He is an agreeable companion, engaging your interest with his acute faculty of judgment, an insightful way of thinking and magnanimous manners. During the negotiations, he is calm and dispassionate, although in his views determined.\" \n\nTa\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's elegy, the reports of ambassadors, administrative dossiers, foundation charters and some private documents like Hurrem's and Mihrimah's plea to Suleiman when R\u00fcstem was expelled to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, are the only period sources reporting on R\u00fcstem's life. They were also the basis of the often cited \u0130br\u0101h\u012bm Pe\u00e7ev\u012b's work \"T\u0101r\u012b\u1e2b-i Pe\u00e7ev\u012b\", published 80 years after R\u00fcstem's death.\n\n==Relationship with Mihrimah==\n[[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]] was married off to the governor of [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] R\u00fcstem in 1539.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2014/03/11/notable-life-of-mihrimah-sultan|title=Notable life of Mihrimah Sultan|work=DailySabah|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref> After his marriage, he was nominated to the vizierate in November 1544.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xf3h3Z1YQtIC&pg=PA88&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Rustem&f=false|title=The Ottoman Age of Exploration|last=Casale|first=Giancarlo|date=2010-02-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199798797|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the union was unhappy, Mihrimah flourished as a patroness of the arts and continued her travels with her father until her husband's death. This marriage had, like many dynastic unions, a political character. Hurrem's role was probably important. Nonetheless, according to the rules, it was a decision of the father. R\u00fcstem was at that time already a wealthy man and had, since 1538, a splendid career as Governor of Anatolya, one of the two most important administrative regions in the Ottoman Empire. This post was considered to be a preliminary stage to Grand Vizier. Mihrimah knew R\u00fcstem for a very long time as the mentor of her brothers and the adviser of her father.\n \nAfter his death Mihrimah accomplished his work, as well as the R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque (1561\u201363), one of [[Mimar Sinan]]'s most impressive projects. R\u00fcstem supported Mihrimah's charitable foundations, for example, the Mihrimah Sultan \u0130skele Camii ([[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (\u00dcsk\u00fcdar)|Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar]], 1540\u201348; a known [[k\u00fclliye]] in Istanbul, [[Mimar Sinan]] project). R\u00fcstem was also Mihrimah's mentor, particularly concerning political and financial decisions. His last will from 1561, provides evidence of his confidence in his wife. R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] (who died in December 1553, a turbulent year for the family), was later buried in Mihrimah Sultan Complex in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, as well as the two sons of R\u00fcstem and Mihrimah. The daughter, Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan (1542\u20131594), was married in 1561 to [[Semiz Ali Pasha]] (R\u00fcstem's successor as Grand Vizier).\n\n==Death==\nR\u00fcstem Pasha died after a long illness, on 10 July 1561 of [[hydrocephalus]]. He was buried in the wonderful [[Sehzade Mosque]], dedicated to Suleiman's favourite son [[Sehzade Mehmed]] (1520-1543), because his dream project, the [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque]], was not yet built. His tomb is alongside that of \u015eehzade Mehmed's.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn the acclaimed Turkish television series ''[[Muhte\u015fem Y\u00fczy\u0131l]]'', he is portrayed by actor [[Ozan G\u00fcven]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers]]\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Caravanserai]], Erzurum\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Caravanserai (Edirne)]], Edirne\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Caravanserai (Ere\u011fli)]], Ere\u011fli, Konya\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Medrese]], Fatih, Istanbul\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Medrese (K\u00fctahya)]]\n* [[Rustem Pasha Mosque]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Lybyer|first=Albert Howe|title=The government of the Ottoman empire in the time of Suleiman the Magnificent |url=https://archive.org/details/governmentottom01lybygoog|year=1913 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |oclc=1562148}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Denny\n | first = Walter B.\n | year = 2005\n | title = Iznik: The Artistry of Ottoman Ceramics\n| publisher = Thames & Hudson\n | location = \n | isbn = 0-500-51192-6\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Faroqhi\n | first = Suraiyah\n | year = 2005\n | title = Subjects of the Sultan: Culture and Daily Life in the Ottoman Empire \n| publisher = I B Tauris\n | location = \n | isbn = 1-85043-760-2\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire]]|before=[[Had\u0131m S\u00fcleyman Pasha]]|after=[[Kara Ahmed Pasha]]|years=28 November 1544 \u2013 6 October 1553}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire]]|before=[[Kara Ahmed Pasha]]|after=[[Semiz Ali Pasha]]|years=29 September 1555 \u2013 10 July 1561}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Grand Viziers of Ottoman Empire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rustem}}\n[[Category:1500 births]]\n[[Category:1561 deaths]]\n[[Category:Government of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Pashas]]\n[[Category:Military personnel of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:16th-century Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Dev\u015firme]]\n[[Category:Suleiman the Magnificent]]\n[[Category:Grand Viziers of Suleiman the Magnificent]]\n[[Category:Converts to Islam from Roman Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Damats]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{peacock|date=January 2019}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{for|the 19th/20th Century Ottoman diplomat|Ahmet R\u00fcstem Bey}}\n{{Ottoman Turkish name|R\u00fcstem|Pasha|Hirvati}}\n{{Infobox Officeholder\n| honorific-prefix    = [[Damat]]\n| name                = R\u00fcstem Opukovi\u0107\n|ethnicity            = Croatian\n| honorific-suffix    = [[Pasha]] \n| image               = Ruestem presumably.jpg\n| caption             =\n| office1             = [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|32nd]] [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire]]\n| term_start1         = 28 November 1544\n| term_end1           = 6 October 1553\n| monarch1            = [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]\n| predecessor1        = [[Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha]]\n| successor1          = [[Kara Ahmed Pasha]]\n| office2             =\n| term_start2         = 29 September 1555\n| term_end2           = 10 July 1561\n| monarch2            = [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]\n| predecessor2        = [[Kara Ahmed Pasha]]\n| successor2          = [[Semiz Ali Pasha]]\n| office3             =\n| term_start3         =\n| term_end3           =\n| monarch3            =\n| predecessor3        =\n| successor3          =\n| office4             =\n| term_start4         =\n| term_end4           =\n| monarch4            =\n| predecessor4        =\n| successor4          =\n| succeeding          =\n| birth_date          = {{circa}}1500\n| birth_place         = [[Skradin]],[[Ottoman Empire]]\n| death_date          = 10 July 1561 (aged 60\u201361)\n| death_place         = [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), [[Ottoman Empire]]\n| blank1              = Ethnicity\n| data1               = [[Croatia]]n \n| party               =\n| spouse              = {{marriage|[[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]|1539}}\n| children            = [[Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan]]<br/> Sultanzade Osman\n| relations           =\n| residence           =\n| alma_mater          =\n| occupation          = \n| profession          =\n| resting_place       = [[Sehzade Mosque]]\n| signature           =\n| website             =\n| footnotes           =\n}}\n'''R\u00fcstem Pasha Hirvati''' ({{IPA-tr|\u027eys\u02c8tem pa\u02c8\u0283a}}; {{lang-ota|\u0631\u0633\u062a\u0645 \u067e\u0627\u0634\u0627}}; {{lang-hr|Rustem-Pa\u0161a Opukovi\u0107}} {{circa}} 1500 \u2013 10 July 1561) was a Croatian born {{sfn|Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|1994|pp=640}}{{sfn|Ko\u00e7o Luarasi|2003|pp=45}}{{sfn|Selim Islami|1968|pp=90}} [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] statesman. He served as the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|grand vizier]] of sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. R\u00fcstem Pasha is also known as Damat R\u00fcstem Pasha (the epithet ''[[damat]]'' meaning \"son-in-law\" to the [[Ottoman dynasty]]) as a result of his marriage to the sultan's daughter, [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. He is known as one of the most influential and successful grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nRustem Pasha was taken as a child to [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), where he built a military and bureaucracy career. He was very well educated. On 26 November 1539, he married Mihrimah Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife [[Hurrem Sultan]]. His brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] was an Ottoman grand admiral.\n\n==Early life==\nOttoman sources speak about Rustem as a [[Croat]] or [[Albanians|Albanian]]. He is referred to as a Serbian by Turkey's historiographer [[Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee]]  . Rustem is referred to as a Croat by Tayib  Osman-zade Ahmed, writer of the work \"Hadikatul vuzara\" and the Turkish encyclopedia Kamus-ul-alam.<ref> \nHamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107, Veliki vezir Rustem-pa\u0161a, ZNAKOVI VREMENA \u2022 SARAJEVO \u2022  2018 http://www.ibn-sina.net/images/pdf/znakovi/82/45_Hamdija_Kre%C5%A1evljakovi%C4%87___znakovi_82.pdf #page=47</ref>\nR\u00fcstem owes his career to the support of [[Hurrem Sultan]], he was extremely ambitious. [[Rustem Pasha]] was a man of very humble origins. He came as a child to Constantinople where he studied at [[Enderun]], an institute for the education/indoctrination of talented boys stolen from christian parents in the Balkans. At the end, the graduates were able to speak, read and write at least three languages, able to understand the latest developments in [[science]], [[finance]] and excel in army command as well as in [[close combat]] skills. That was the perfect start for a career in the [[military]] and bureaucracy. In 1526, R\u00fcstem took part in the [[Battle of Mohacs]] as [[silahdar]] (weapon bearer in a cavalry division). Silahdars were an elite division of the [[Ottoman army]]. Members of this division could also become ordinary soldiers (non-aristocrat), if they proved to be extraordinarily courageous and loyal. \n\nA few years later R\u00fcstem advanced to [[mirahur-i evvel]] aga (chief supervisor of the sultan's stables) and [[rikab-dar]] (the [[stirrup holder]] when the ruler got on the horse). The [[mirahur]] accompanied the Sultan during his travels, so the Sultan knew R\u00fcstem a long time before he appointed him, possibly inspired by Hurrem, the tutor of his sons. In making this decision, he was surely influenced by R\u00fcstem's character. Most historical sources describe R\u00fcstem as a reasonable and calm man with a keen intellect, who always keeps a cool head, and who is always unconditionally devoted to his ruler. These characteristics reflected R\u00fcstem's faith, and brought R\u00fcstem, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and the famous jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi]] (Mehmed Ebussuud Efendi), permanently closer together. R\u00fcstem was a Sunni and preferred the spiritual order of Sunni Islam Sufism Naqshbandi.\n\n==Wealth and legacy==\n[[File:Rustem Pasha Mosque.JPG|thumb|175px|right]]\nAs Grand Vizier, he collected vast wealth. Even R\u00fcstem's sworn opponents admitted, that he never boasted of his wealth or power (although he was a man of fortune), and that he was the very first Grand Vizier in the history of the [[Ottoman Empire]] who significantly contributed to the development of the state from his own funds. According to most period testimonies (excluding Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's \"[[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] Mersiyesi\"), R\u00fcstem was considered one of the few state dignitaries who didn't take bribes. Nonetheless, R\u00fcstem's famous economic talent and his modest way of life, both highly valued by the Sultan, made him rich, even before his marriage to [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. In his last will (a part of endowment charter from 1561), R\u00fcstem made an inventory of every single detail of his property, in order to secure his great foundation projects after his death. R\u00fcstem's testament determines exactly which part of his property belongs to the state, to his foundations, to the [[Hurrem Sultan]]'s foundation and to Mihrimah's foundations, what he leaves to his wife Mihrimah and to their daughter [[Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan]]. He determines his wife Mihrimah Sultan as executor of his last will and his daughter Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah as the executor and administrator of his foundations.\n\nAll historians emphasize [[R\u00fcstem]]'s relentless hard work to consolidate the troubled economy of the Ottoman Empire - impoverished by excessive spending on wars and a lavish lifestyle of the court - and his efforts to improve it. The period documents say that he also generously financed this upswing from his own resources. On his lands were built toll free bridges, roads, covered bazaars, granaries, baths, hospices, caravanserais, convents, schools and various other establishments for the public benefit. Their funding was largely secured by the leasing of R\u00fcstem's estates. He supported agriculture, founded new trading centers, like the bazaar in Sarajevo or silk factories in [[Bursa]] and [[Istanbul]], social and educational institutions. He developed the domestic economy by encouraging major public works projects and built a modern infrastructure: trade routes, and water networks in Istanbul, [[Mecca]] and [[Jerusalem]].\n\nHe also found enough money in the treasury to make Suleiman's dream come true ([[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], 1550\u201357), as well as to fund other monumental architectural projects realized by the legendary [[Mimar Sinan]]. To reduce protectionism in the state administration, an official installment fee was introduced, and confiscated when the officials misused his authority. R\u00fcstem's reform of the military remained unfinished. At the time of his death in Constantinople on 10 July 1561, his personal property included 815 lands in Rumelia and Anatolia, 476 mills, 1700 slaves, 2,900 war horses, 1,106 camels, 800 gold ambroidery Holy Qur'ans, 500 books, 5000 Caftan, 130 kinds of armors, 860 gold embroidered swords, 1500 silver tolga, 1000 silver balls, 33 precious jewels etc.\n\nThe [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque]] (Turkish: R\u00fcstem Pa\u015fa Camii) is an Ottoman mosque located in Has\u0131rc\u0131lar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131 (Strawmat Weavers Market) in Fatih, Turkey, which was designed by Ottoman imperial architect [[Mimar Sinan]] for Grand Vizier R\u00fcstem Pasha. It was built between 1561 and 1563.\n\n==Political career==\nAt first, R\u00fcstem Pasha was a [[Sanjak-bey|sanjak bey]]. After the death of [[Pargali Ibrahim Pasha]] his way became very easy. He was promoted to Baylerbey of the [[Diyarbakir]]. When he married [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]], Rustem was already a vizier. [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] made Rustem the grand vizier for the first time in 1544. But in 1553, Rustem was dismissed from his position. After two years he took this position again from 1555 until his death in 1561.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LE9QAAAAMAAJ&q=Rustem+pasa+power&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIQTAF|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|last=Necipo\u011flu|first=G\u00fclru|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|isbn=9780262140508|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a diplomat, R\u00fcstem initiated many trade agreements with European countries and India. His biggest success in the diplomatic area, was the agreement with the King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], which confirmed, without firing a shot, the western border of the Ottoman Empire for more than 14 years (signed in 1547). Ferdinand renounced his claim to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and agreed to pay a tax of 30,000 gold ducats per year into the Ottoman treasury. The ambassador of the Emperor Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq wrote that Charles had tried on several occasions to revise the unfavourable agreement, but R\u00fcstem had always prevented it. R\u00fcstem also worked on the agreement with the [[Safavids]] (signed 1554), which ended the long-standing Ottoman-Safavid wars, and secured the eastern borders of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSuleiman was manipulated by Hurrem's intrigues when he murdered Ibrahim and replaced him with his son-in-law, R\u00fcstem Pasha. R\u00fcstem was not Suleiman's son-in-law when Ibrahim Pasha was executed. The background of Ibrahim's execution was much more complicated (e.g. he used the seal \"Sultan Ibrahim\", retained the majority of the confiscated property of Suleiman's \"minister of finance\" [[\u0130skender \u00c7elebi]], whose execution he ordered etc.). Ibrahim was replaced with [[Ayas Mehmed Pasha]], followed by [[L\u00fctfi Pasha]] and [[Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha]]. R\u00fcstem's career developed, unlike Ibrahim, exactly according to the rules. He became Grand Vizier eight years after Ibrahim's death.\n\nLater Hurrem and R\u00fcstem conspired against [[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] for many years. The very ambitious Mustafa received foreign ambassadors as well as Ottoman commanders many times, without his father's knowledge, and was regarded by them as an important ally against Suleiman. So the Austrian ambassador Ghislain de Busbecq (visiting Mustafa before S\u00fcleyman), informed his ruler: \"Mustafa will be an excellent sultan, receptive and open to talks.\" And the Papal ambassador Navagero said: \"Mustafa lives with his mother. She says that people adore him.\" Understanding the danger of the situation, Suleiman remembered his father Selim dethroning his grandfather Bayezid (who was killed only a month after his abdication in 1512). Officers loyal to him advised that a part of the army is getting ready to put Mustafa on the throne. In 1552, while preparing a campaign against Persia, Suleiman appointed R\u00fcstem \"Serasker\" (commander-in-chief) of the campaign. But soldiers assembled in the military camp in Karaman (Anatolia), rejected Suleiman's appointment, and insisted R\u00fcstem should be replaced with Mustafa (the same problem was faced by R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]], as admiral of the Ottoman fleet during the Tripolis siege, even though he achieved many victories until his death in 1553).\n\nThe destabilization continued. Mustafa's so-often cited correspondence with the [[Safavid]]s signed \"Sultan Mustafa\" (kept today in archives), was, in this context, probably not so relevant. It could be authentic, it could be a Safavids' or a Hurrem-R\u00fcstem deception, or maybe Suleiman's safeguard to calm public opinion after Mustafa's death. There are various versions of reports on Mustafa's end in the Ere\u011fli valley. According to one of them, R\u00fcstem Pasha made an offer to Mustafa to join his father's army and at the same time he warned Suleiman that Mustafa was coming to kill him. According to another version, it was Suleiman himself who summoned his son to Ere\u011fli, and Mustafa came, \"confident that the army would protect him\".\n\nOnly R\u00fcstem appears in all the versions as the antagonist. However, it is not surprising, as they are all based on Mustafa's PR chief consultant [[Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey]]'s elegy, \"\u015eehzade Mustafa Mersiyesi\". Even the report of the Austrian ambassador de Busbecq, who claims to have received an account from an eyewitness, had the same origin. R\u00fcstem, suspended and banished, was fair game as an object of violence. No one dared to criticize the Sultan himself. Suleiman probably realized this, and called R\u00fcstem back two years later.\n\nR\u00fcstem's scapegoating as the seemingly dominant figure of the \"conspiracy against Mustafa\", radically changed public opinion. And so the R\u00fcstem extolled years ago as the \"pillar of the Ottoman empire\", brilliant economist and sophisticated statesman, was forgotten, as well as his great projects and charitable foundations. He became R\u00fcstem the \"black heart, the murderer of the loved Prince Mustafa\". Nothing was enough to make him dirty: his \"dirty\" origin, the imputation of bribery, the story with the louse... Some foreign ambassadors like Ghiselin de Busbecq or Bernardo Navagero, repeated it spitefully in their reports (all the more that R\u00fcstem was as a diplomat an invincible opponent, the agreement from 1547 must not be forgotten). Unlike them, Jean Chesneau, the secretary of the French ambassador, wrote about him: \"The grand vizier is a man of humble origin, who, thanks to his talent and will, worked his way up from nothing. He is an agreeable companion, engaging your interest with his acute faculty of judgment, an insightful way of thinking and magnanimous manners. During the negotiations, he is calm and dispassionate, although in his views determined.\" \n\nTa\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's elegy, the reports of ambassadors, administrative dossiers, foundation charters and some private documents like Hurrem's and Mihrimah's plea to Suleiman when R\u00fcstem was expelled to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, are the only period sources reporting on R\u00fcstem's life. They were also the basis of the often cited \u0130br\u0101h\u012bm Pe\u00e7ev\u012b's work \"T\u0101r\u012b\u1e2b-i Pe\u00e7ev\u012b\", published 80 years after R\u00fcstem's death.\n\n==Relationship with Mihrimah==\n[[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]] was married off to the governor of [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] R\u00fcstem in 1539.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2014/03/11/notable-life-of-mihrimah-sultan|title=Notable life of Mihrimah Sultan|work=DailySabah|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref> After his marriage, he was nominated to the vizierate in November 1544.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xf3h3Z1YQtIC&pg=PA88&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Rustem&f=false|title=The Ottoman Age of Exploration|last=Casale|first=Giancarlo|date=2010-02-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199798797|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the union was unhappy, Mihrimah flourished as a patroness of the arts and continued her travels with her father until her husband's death. This marriage had, like many dynastic unions, a political character. Hurrem's role was probably important. Nonetheless, according to the rules, it was a decision of the father. R\u00fcstem was at that time already a wealthy man and had, since 1538, a splendid career as Governor of Anatolya, one of the two most important administrative regions in the Ottoman Empire. This post was considered to be a preliminary stage to Grand Vizier. Mihrimah knew R\u00fcstem for a very long time as the mentor of her brothers and the adviser of her father.\n \nAfter his death Mihrimah accomplished his work, as well as the R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque (1561\u201363), one of [[Mimar Sinan]]'s most impressive projects. R\u00fcstem supported Mihrimah's charitable foundations, for example, the Mihrimah Sultan \u0130skele Camii ([[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (\u00dcsk\u00fcdar)|Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar]], 1540\u201348; a known [[k\u00fclliye]] in Istanbul, [[Mimar Sinan]] project). R\u00fcstem was also Mihrimah's mentor, particularly concerning political and financial decisions. His last will from 1561, provides evidence of his confidence in his wife. R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] (who died in December 1553, a turbulent year for the family), was later buried in Mihrimah Sultan Complex in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, as well as the two sons of R\u00fcstem and Mihrimah. The daughter, Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan (1542\u20131594), was married in 1561 to [[Semiz Ali Pasha]] (R\u00fcstem's successor as Grand Vizier).\n\n==Death==\nR\u00fcstem Pasha died after a long illness, on 10 July 1561 of [[hydrocephalus]]. He was buried in the wonderful [[Sehzade Mosque]], dedicated to Suleiman's favourite son [[Sehzade Mehmed]] (1520-1543), because his dream project, the [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque]], was not yet built. His tomb is alongside that of \u015eehzade Mehmed's.\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn the acclaimed Turkish television series ''[[Muhte\u015fem Y\u00fczy\u0131l]]'', he is portrayed by actor [[Ozan G\u00fcven]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers]]\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Caravanserai]], Erzurum\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Caravanserai (Edirne)]], Edirne\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Caravanserai (Ere\u011fli)]], Ere\u011fli, Konya\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Medrese]], Fatih, Istanbul\n* [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Medrese (K\u00fctahya)]]\n* [[Rustem Pasha Mosque]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Lybyer|first=Albert Howe|title=The government of the Ottoman empire in the time of Suleiman the Magnificent |url=https://archive.org/details/governmentottom01lybygoog|year=1913 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |oclc=1562148}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Denny\n | first = Walter B.\n | year = 2005\n | title = Iznik: The Artistry of Ottoman Ceramics\n| publisher = Thames & Hudson\n | location = \n | isbn = 0-500-51192-6\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | last = Faroqhi\n | first = Suraiyah\n | year = 2005\n | title = Subjects of the Sultan: Culture and Daily Life in the Ottoman Empire \n| publisher = I B Tauris\n | location = \n | isbn = 1-85043-760-2\n}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-off}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire]]|before=[[Had\u0131m S\u00fcleyman Pasha]]|after=[[Kara Ahmed Pasha]]|years=28 November 1544 \u2013 6 October 1553}}\n{{succession box|title=[[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire]]|before=[[Kara Ahmed Pasha]]|after=[[Semiz Ali Pasha]]|years=29 September 1555 \u2013 10 July 1561}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{Organisation of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Grand Viziers of Ottoman Empire}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rustem}}\n[[Category:1500 births]]\n[[Category:1561 deaths]]\n[[Category:Government of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Pashas]]\n[[Category:Military personnel of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:16th-century Grand Viziers of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:Dev\u015firme]]\n[[Category:Suleiman the Magnificent]]\n[[Category:Grand Viziers of Suleiman the Magnificent]]\n[[Category:Converts to Islam from Roman Catholicism]]\n[[Category:Damats]]\n", "name_user": "178.157.251.238", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BCstem_Pasha"}

The abundance of sugar during the pre-Spanish era is evident in a wide area of kabyaw including the area going to the foot of Mount Arayat. The kabyawan became familiar to the neighboring places due to the concentration of kabyawan in the place where it was located and was identified as Kabyawan and later shortened to \"Kabyaw\" and eventually altered the spelling due to the influence of the foreign alphabet letters. The used of kabyawan then is prevalent among the natives constituting mainly the ancient tribes of tagalogs that hails from Bulacan and capampangan of which they came in waves of migration from mainland Malay origin as evident from their language similarity.\nThe Kabyawan tools might have been brought by the exploring Malays and later improved by the natives settling in the island of Luzon however there are findings that most of the antiquated wooden kabyawan tools at present can be found in Ilocos where the early Sumatran and Melanesian explorers had embarked earlier than the Malays. Similarly, during that period, the natives of the mountain province whose origin is from mainland China might have been the one responsible in introducing the said crushing tools which we know now as the KABYAWAN. The settlement that has been known as Sinipit, Palasinan, Pantalan, Pinaglamoan, Kandumpa, Kambabalo, Longalong, Mayayade, Tinalan, Makabaklay, Saklang and Palanas were words and terms taken from Malay and the tribal dialect in existence during that period.\nCabiao as termed today was a just balangay of the once prosperous of empire of the campampangan settlement named Candaba, as it was discovered by the exploring Spanish conquistadores in 1590. The visita of Cabiao was perhaps established somewhere between 1765 and 1767 by the Jesuit Missionary before they were sent back to Spain under the order of King Charles III of Spain to recall all the Society of Jesus religious order to return to Spain thereby banishing them from all the Spanish dominions. Cabiao gain its full township of Pampanga in 1797 under the term of Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar y Ponce de Leon* with the recommendation of the returning order of the Augustinian in the Province of Pampanga and elevates the Visita of St. John Nepomucene that was established by the Jesuits into a regular Parish Church. It was established as one of the municipality of Nueva Ecija on February 9, 1848 upon the order issued by Governor General Narciso Claveria Y Zaldua and upon the recommendation made by the Governor General Marcelino Oraa. \nThe growth of Cabiao during that time maybe attributed to its vast marsh and inland water that serves as inland fishery of the area. The Poblacion comprising the three pillars of Spanish governance of the Spaniard namely the Casa Municipal, Casa dela Iglesia and Casa Judicial were erected in 1838 under the term of Don Josef Kabigting as the Gobernadorcillo (the present location of the church, the central school and the intervening residential area between the central school and the church).\n\nThe desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in the uprising on September 2, 1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nu\u00f1ez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. This event was marked as the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. It did not take too long that the Spanish Colonial Government, succumbed to cede the Archipelago of Philippines to the United States on December 10, 1898 that brought about the Treaty of Paris, and once again the Philippines was under colonial rule this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on January 23, 1899.\nDuring the Philippine\u2013American War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo\u2019s Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton.\n\nIn 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in the early part of 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. Some rural folks used to study individually in the Spanish methods of learning on arithmetic and reading in their native tongue Tagalog.\n\nFrom 1907-1909, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila.\n\nAfter almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines, and the people of Cabiao once again play an important role in the liberation of our country, HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People\u2019s Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on March 29, 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao.  He was the chief executive of the town in 1945.  Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months.  In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-1947. The town of Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada.  It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. The people of Cabiao were governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule that is being manifested by the force labor construction of the Cabiao High School which is the monumental relic of his tenure. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year.\n\nIt was also the time when the height of the Huk uprising began when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, where the 50,000 armed group was inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo only to be captured en masse by the then late General Ismael Lapus through the order of Secretary Magsaysay and the clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel had begun purposely to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels. The health center were constructed through the financial support of Defense Secretary Castelo Justice Secretary Hermogenes Concepcion and Do\u00f1a Maria Romero Buencamino (who was at that time the richest family and the most influential).\n\nYear 1950, when the 1st tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the towns public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures.\n \nIt was the 1st tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, when the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit -San Roque Road was made. Mayor Paterno Santiano reassumed his post as a mayor after a very much contested election results.\n\nIn 1960, Crespo reassumed his post as Mayor of Cabiao, and Pedro T. Wycoco was appointed as the Chief of Police. The Gapan- Arayat Road, Cabiao Section were constructed by Golangco Construction and Development Corp. in 1963.\n\nIn 1979 the town's Public Market was rehabilitated through the help of the member of the Parliament Angel Concepcion for which main building was constructed contiguously from the previous two small one. The town of Cabiao was governed by Mayor Crespo for almost three decades bringing together town folks of Cabiao to be one living in peace and serves as the legacy for which Mayor Crespo was known.\n\nThe EDSA Revolution of 1986, was the year when Mayor Crespo was dislodged by the appointment of Atty. Antonio Ll. Lapuz as Officer in Charge of Cabiao. During his tenure, the inception of the municipal development planning were made, and listing of priority projects were categorized, however fundings for these infrastructure were no longer made in his tenure because it had lasted only for two and half years.\n\nAtty. Lapuz was succeeded by Eng\u2019r. Ireneo Manahan, who bested in the three-way election fight during that time, followed the pattern and plans which Atty. Lapuz had laid before he left office. He continued in building roads, barangay health, and brgy. hall including the renovation of the municipal town hall. It was also during that time, that the Santa Isabel- Bagong Sikat Bridge has been initially built however due to the insufficiency of funds the said bridge has not been finished during his tenure. He had also built a community under his name which later name as Manahan Village.\n\nIn his last term of office, mayor Manahan endorsed councilor Gloria Baby Crespo Congco as his successor, the eldest daughter of former Mayor Gregorio Crespo and was elected mayor of the municipality in 1998.  She is the youngest and the first woman to be elected chief executive of the town.  She was also re-elected in the elections of 2001 and 2004.\n\nThe incumbent mayor is Ramil B. Rivera who defeated Gloria Crespo Congco during the 2016 election.\n\nDuring their term, economic performance of Cabiao become robust and rapidly growth. He received Certipicate of Most Outstanding Mayors of the Philippines 2017 and 2018. Golden Globe awards for Cosmopolitan Filipino Achiever of Civil Service 2018. Certipicate of Good Local Governance 2017 and 2018.\n\n==Economy==\nCabiao's economy is one of the fastest growing in the province of [[Nueva Ecija]] and lead as one of the most competitive municipalities in entire [[Central Luzon]] region according to the [[National Competitiveness Council (Philippines)]]Cities/Municipalities Competitiveness Index 2018.

The abundance of sugar during the pre-Spanish era is evident in a wide area of kabyaw including the area going to the foot of Mount Arayat. The kabyawan became familiar to the neighboring places due to the concentration of kabyawan in the place where it was located and was identified as Kabyawan and later shortened to \"Kabyaw\" and eventually altered the spelling due to the influence of the foreign alphabet letters. The used of kabyawan then is prevalent among the natives constituting mainly the ancient tribes of tagalogs that hails from Bulacan and capampangan of which they came in waves of migration from mainland Malay origin as evident from their language similarity.\nThe Kabyawan tools might have been brought by the exploring Malays and later improved by the natives settling in the island of Luzon however there are findings that most of the antiquated wooden kabyawan tools at present can be found in Ilocos where the early Sumatran and Melanesian explorers had embarked earlier than the Malays. Similarly, during that period, the natives of the mountain province whose origin is from mainland China might have been the one responsible in introducing the said crushing tools which we know now as the KABYAWAN. The settlement that has been known as Sinipit, Palasinan, Pantalan, Pinaglamoan, Kandumpa, Kambabalo, Longalong, Mayayade, Tinalan, Makabaklay, Saklang and Palanas were words and terms taken from Malay and the tribal dialect in existence during that period.\nCabiao as termed today was a just balangay of the once prosperous of empire of the campampangan settlement named Candaba, as it was discovered by the exploring Spanish conquistadores in 1590. The visita of Cabiao was perhaps established somewhere between 1765 and 1767 by the Jesuit Missionary before they were sent back to Spain under the order of King Charles III of Spain to recall all the Society of Jesus religious order to return to Spain thereby banishing them from all the Spanish dominions. Cabiao gain its full township of Pampanga in 1797 under the term of Governor General Rafael Maria de Aguilar y Ponce de Leon* with the recommendation of the returning order of the Augustinian in the Province of Pampanga and elevates the Visita of St. John Nepomucene that was established by the Jesuits into a regular Parish Church. It was established as one of the municipality of Nueva Ecija on February 9, 1848 upon the order issued by Governor General Narciso Claveria Y Zaldua and upon the recommendation made by the Governor General Marcelino Oraa. \nThe growth of Cabiao during that time maybe attributed to its vast marsh and inland water that serves as inland fishery of the area. The Poblacion comprising the three pillars of Spanish governance of the Spaniard namely the Casa Municipal, Casa dela Iglesia and Casa Judicial were erected in 1838 under the term of Don Josef Kabigting as the Gobernadorcillo (the present location of the church, the central school and the intervening residential area between the central school and the church).\n\nThe desire of the populace of Cabiao to be free from Spanish domination and tyranny resulted in the uprising on September 2, 1896. Numbering around 700 men (461 listed in the Tablet of Heroes in the Municipal Compound), the townsfolk of Cabiao and the Cabiao Brass Band under the leadership of their Capitan Municipal Mariano Nu\u00f1ez Llanera together with the people of the neighboring towns of Arayat, Deliquente (San Antonio) & Jaen led the siege against the colonizing Spaniards stationed at the Factoria of San Isidro. This event was marked as the First Cry of Nueva Ecija. It did not take too long that the Spanish Colonial Government, succumbed to cede the Archipelago of Philippines to the United States on December 10, 1898 that brought about the Treaty of Paris, and once again the Philippines was under colonial rule this time by the American. In the last days of the Spanish occupation, the Cabiao heroes participated in the declaration of Philippine Republic in Malolos on January 23, 1899.\nDuring the Philippine\u2013American War, Cabiao was one of the fiercely battled terrains of the American forces in pursuit of General Aguinaldo\u2019s Forces however most of the populated areas of Cabiao have been saved from the encounter. General Pio del Pilar hold out in the marshes of San Vicente and Santa Rita to delay the intruding Forces of General Elwell Stephen Otis under the command of General Henry Ware Lawton.\n\nIn 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as a medium of instructions. Pedro Oreta was elected as the first chief executive of the town under American civil regime followed by the then Mun. President Jose Crespo who established and organized the Presidencia (township hierarchy and organizational plan) constituting the different executive department of the municipality. American occupation in Cabiao has not been as cruel as their Spanish predecessor, however, the people of Cabiao were already afraid to trust the new colonizer. Thomasites missionaries arrived in Cabiao in the early part of 1902 as a part of educating the people of Cabiao and in 1903, the Americans established schools in Cabiao and used the English language as the medium of instruction. Some rural folks used to study individually in the Spanish methods of learning on arithmetic and reading in their native tongue Tagalog.\n\nFrom 1907-1909, Cabiao was placed under jurisdiction of San Isidro and the executive power was then held by the Municipal President of San Isidro. It was in the term of Office of Municipal President Gonzalo Del Leon that the seat of Municipal Town Hall was erected on the land donated by the Romero family. It was during the term of Jose Lapuz that Judge Bonifacio Ysip was elected as delegate to the constitutional convention held in Manila.\n\nAfter almost three decades of peace, Japan invaded the Philippines, and the people of Cabiao once again play an important role in the liberation of our country, HUKBALAHAP (Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon) or People\u2019s Anti-Japanese Army, was then established in Sitio Bawit, San Julian, Cabiao on March 29, 1942. When the Allies between the combined U.S. and Filipino troops finally liberated the Philippines and as soon as the Central Government was established in Manila, Mariano Guevarra was appointed Mayor of Cabiao.  He was the chief executive of the town in 1945.  Prudencio Ortiz Luis succeeded Guevarra who occupies the position for only a few months.  In later part of 1945 after the liberation, most of the people of Cabiao were still in the far flung areas of Cambabalu, Saclang Capampangan, Saclang Tagalog and Dumanas and it was during this time that the mayor of this town has been appointed by then President Manuel Roxas by the name of Ambrosio Aligada. He was appointed as the Chief Executive of the town from 1945-1947. The town of Cabiao was placed under the military government under Pablo Aligada.  It was also during the time of Aligada that the Sitio of Palasinan (presently San Gregorio) comprising the property owned by Don Ramon Fernandez were repopulated by the people coming from said the places whereas the area of Bagong Silang were repopulate by the people coming from Buliran, Guyong-guyong, Luyos of which most of them are Tagalogs. The people of Cabiao were governed by Aligada through coercive and dictatorial rule that is being manifested by the force labor construction of the Cabiao High School which is the monumental relic of his tenure. Isaias Manalastas seated as the progressive mayor through the support HUKBALAHAPs that during that time is at its height from which they fielded their party named Prente Popular however it did not last long due to the suspicion of the military of an imminent grabbing of power where these party is the political front of the Huks. Nieves Pablo, a woman, was the fourth appointed mayor in that same year.\n\nIt was also the time when the height of the Huk uprising began when the entire town was the seat of the rebellion, where the 50,000 armed group was inducted in Bawit and in Pasong Diablo only to be captured en masse by the then late General Ismael Lapus through the order of Secretary Magsaysay and the clearing of the entire forested area of Bagong Sikat and Santa Isabel had begun purposely to eliminate the lair of the Huk rebels. The health center were constructed through the financial support of Defense Secretary Castelo Justice Secretary Hermogenes Concepcion and Do\u00f1a Maria Romero Buencamino (who was at that time the richest family and the most influential).\n\nYear 1950, when the 1st tenure of then Paterno Santiano began, the towns public market was constructed through the support of the national government since the towns income cannot at that time support such huge amount of expenditures.\n \nIt was the 1st tenure of Gregorio T. Crespo, when the old town hall was renovated and the original Cabiao Central School Building has been restored. The gravelling of Sinipit -San Roque Road was made. Mayor Paterno Santiano reassumed his post as a mayor after a very much contested election results.\n\nIn 1960, Crespo reassumed his post as Mayor of Cabiao, and Pedro T. Wycoco was appointed as the Chief of Police. The Gapan- Arayat Road, Cabiao Section were constructed by Golangco Construction and Development Corp. in 1963.\n\nIn 1979 the town's Public Market was rehabilitated through the help of the member of the Parliament Angel Concepcion for which main building was constructed contiguously from the previous two small one. The town of Cabiao was governed by Mayor Crespo for almost three decades bringing together town folks of Cabiao to be one living in peace and serves as the legacy for which Mayor Crespo was known.\n\nThe EDSA Revolution of 1986, was the year when Mayor Crespo was dislodged by the appointment of Atty. Antonio Ll. Lapuz as Officer in Charge of Cabiao. During his tenure, the inception of the municipal development planning were made, and listing of priority projects were categorized, however fundings for these infrastructure were no longer made in his tenure because it had lasted only for two and half years.\n\nAtty. Lapuz was succeeded by Eng\u2019r. Ireneo Manahan, who bested in the three-way election fight during that time, followed the pattern and plans which Atty. Lapuz had laid before he left office. He continued in building roads, barangay health, and brgy. hall including the renovation of the municipal town hall. It was also during that time, that the Santa Isabel- Bagong Sikat Bridge has been initially built however due to the insufficiency of funds the said bridge has not been finished during his tenure. He had also built a community under his name which later name as Manahan Village.\n\nIn his last term of office, mayor Manahan endorsed councilor Gloria Baby Crespo Congco as his successor, the eldest daughter of former Mayor Gregorio Crespo and was elected mayor of the municipality in 1998.  She is the youngest and the first woman to be elected chief executive of the town.  She was also re-elected in the elections of 2001 and 2004.\n\nThe incumbent mayor is Ramil B. Rivera who defeated Gloria Crespo Congco during the 2016 election.\n\nDuring their term, economic performance of Cabiao become robust and rapidly growth. He received Certipicate of Most Outstanding Mayors of the Philippines 2017 and 2018. Golden Globe awards for Cosmopolitan Filipino Achiever of Civil Service 2018. Certipicate of Good Local Governance 2017 and 2018.\n\n==Economy==\nCabiao's economy is one of the fastest growing in the province of [[Nueva Ecija]] and lead as one of the most competitive municipalities in entire [[Central Luzon]] region according to the [[National Competitiveness Council (Philippines)]]Cities/Municipalities Competitiveness Index 2018.

{"title_page": "Jack Driscoll", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=August 2017}}\n'''Jack Driscoll''' (credited as John Driscoll in the 1933 film)  is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[King Kong]]'' franchise. In the [[King Kong (1933 film)|original 1933 film]] he was the first mate of the ship named the ''Venture'', while in its  [[King Kong (2005 film)|2005 remake]] he was a playwright (the less faithful [[King Kong (1976 film)|1976 remake]] had an analogous character named Jack Prescott, played by [[Jeff Bridges]]).  He was played by [[Bruce Cabot]] in the original and by [[Adrien Brody]] in the remake.  In both versions he is one of the main heroes of the story, a man who is on a ship heading for the mysterious [[Skull Island]] where [[Carl Denham]] intends to make a film.  On the way, Driscoll falls in love with the actress, Ann Darrow, and when she is kidnapped by a giant ape on the island named [[King Kong|Kong]], Driscoll rescues her after helping to lead a search.  Beyond these facts, even his characterization is quite different in the two films.\n\nDriscoll is a supporting character in ''Kong: King of Skull Island'', an \"authorized\" illustrated-novel that continues the Kong story in 1957.\n\nDriscoll is also a playable character in the [[video game]] ''[[Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie]]'', along with Kong himself.\n\n==1933 film==\nIn the 1933 film, Driscoll is a rugged sailor, the ''Venture''{{'}}s first mate, who disdains having women on ships, considering even their mere presence to be a \"nuisance\".  He says as much to Ann Darrow, but despite this early encounter, and while still on the ship, Driscoll eventually develops an infatuation with her, telling her, \"Say... I guess I love you.\"  As Denham remarked, \"Some big hard-boiled egg gets a look at a pretty face and bang - he cracks up and goes sappy.\"  Ann is at first surprised by Driscoll's interest, but the two embrace.  Upon reaching the island, Ann is kidnapped by the natives and sacrificed to Kong, but Driscoll, Denham and several other crew members charge into Skull Island to rescue her.  It is eventually Driscoll who saves Ann from Kong's clutches, but the ape gives chase until Denham's team captures it and sends it to [[New York City]].\n\nHaving returned to New York, Driscoll and Ann continue to work for Denham as Kong is chained to a stage and shown to live audiences. During the show, Denham gives Driscoll credit for coming to Ann's rescue, and it is revealed that Ann and Driscoll are to be married.  Kong breaks free, however, and despite Driscoll's attempts to keep Ann secure by taking her to a room and trying to fight Kong after the beast reaches through the window, Ann is once again kidnapped. They are reunited after Kong dies at the end of the film.\n\nIt is believed that the choice of actor Bruce Cabot to play Driscoll was in part due to his strong resemblance to popular heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey, who at the time embodied the rugged, heroic male \"ideal\". The choice of the similar name \"Jack Driscoll\" is further indication that this was in fact the case.\n\n==2005 film==\nThe original Driscoll is divided into two separate characters in the 2005 film. His duties as first mate are transferred to second mate Ben Hayes, while the character name and the function of Ann Darrow's romantic interest are given to a [[playwright]] who tries to write a [[screenplay]] for Denham, as a friend, played by [[Adrien Brody]].<!-- according to [[King Kong (2005 film)]] --> This Jack Driscoll does not intend to join the expedition at all, but delivers the script to the ship before it departs.  With limited time, however, Driscoll did not write nearly enough, and Denham, desperate for more, tricks him into staying on the ship as it leaves for Skull Island.  Driscoll complains that he prefers the stage, but Denham retorts that \"if you ''really'' loved it, you would have jumped.\"\n\nAs it turns out, Denham's struggling actress, Ann Darrow, had been very familiar with Driscoll's work beforehand, and admired Driscoll greatly.  She is very excited to meet him, but at first the relationship is awkward (owing in part to a case of mistaken identity on Darrow's part. When writing the next part of the script with Denham, Driscoll decides to kill off the first mate. When Denham questions it, Driscoll replies, \"That's assuming she knows who the first mate is.\" This is a reference to the 1933 film, in which Jack Driscoll was the first mate of the ''Venture''.) The two eventually grow closer, however, and Driscoll also reveals that he has begun writing a comedic play dedicated to Ann, as a sign that he has fallen in love with her (the dynamic from the original, in which Ann is told that women should not be on ships, is not actually said by Driscoll, but does appear in Denham's film, although as it turns out Driscoll's script had been altered by the actor, [[King Kong (2005 film)|Bruce Baxter]]).\n\nWhile writing the screenplay, Driscoll is the first to learn that Denham is taking the crew to an undiscovered island.  When they reach the island, Ann is kidnapped by the native inhabitants as a sacrifice for Kong, and Driscoll sets out in search for her along with the rest of the crew.  He shows both great amounts of courage and a single-minded determination to find and rescue Ann. Of the original party, he is the only member who survived the journey through the island (including attacks by dinosaurs, a giant fish, and giant insects) and did not return to the settlement without rescuing Ann, managing to retrieve her by himself.\n\nUnlike the original, Driscoll did not continue with Denham or Ann after Kong was brought to New York, but rather continued with the comedy he had dedicated to Ann. Nor does Denham give Driscoll credit as being the hero of the adventure at Skull Island.  Driscoll does, however, come to fear that he has let Ann slip away from him.\n\nDriscoll realizes before anyone else that Denham's opening is heading for disaster, but cannot do anything to prevent it.  Discovering that Kong actually recognizes him on sight\u2014and is hellbent on killing him for taking Ann\u2014Driscoll attempts to use that to draw Kong away from [[Times Square]] and away from crowds of bystanders.  Driscoll is nearly killed for his heroic effort, but Ann approaches and stops Kong's rampage, saving Jack's life this time around.\n\nJack regains consciousness and sees Kong holding Ann, climbing up the [[Empire State Building]] and manages to get through the army and get to the top. When Ann is alone on the Empire State Building after Kong has fallen, Driscoll is reunited with her and the two embrace.\n\n==Real-world history==\nWith the 2005 film, the casting of Adrien Brody drew some criticism, reported by [[film critic]] [[Roger Ebert]], because he was \"not precisely hero material\".  Ebert defended that casting decision, saying Driscoll was just a writer who did not need \"big muscles\".<ref>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]], \"King Kong,\" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' December 13, 2005.</ref>\n\nOn the making of documentary, Adrien Brody commented that of all the films he had ever made, ''King Kong'' was the one for which he was most anticipating seeing the finished product.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{KingKong}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Driscoll, Jack}}\n[[Category:King Kong characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional writers]]\n[[Category:Fictional sailors]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Male horror film characters]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1933]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}\n'''Jack Driscoll''' (credited as John Driscoll in the 1933 film)  is a [[fictional character]] in the ''[[King Kong]]'' franchise.

When Ann is alone on the Empire State Building after Kong has fallen, Driscoll is reunited with her and the two embrace.\n\n==Real-world history==\nWith the 2005 film, the casting of Adrien Brody drew some criticism, reported by [[film critic]] [[Roger Ebert]], because he was \"not precisely hero material\".  Ebert defended that casting decision, saying Driscoll was just a writer who did not need \"big muscles\".<ref>[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]], \"King Kong,\" ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]],'' December 13, 2005.</ref>\n\nOn the making of documentary, Adrien Brody commented that of all the films he had ever made, ''King Kong'' was the one for which he was most anticipating seeing the finished product.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{KingKong}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Driscoll, Jack}}\n[[Category:King Kong characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional writers]]\n[[Category:Fictional sailors]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Male horror film characters]]\n[[Category:Film characters introduced in 1933]]\n", "name_user": "Joeykai", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Driscoll"}
