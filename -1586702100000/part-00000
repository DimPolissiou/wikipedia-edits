In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}\n\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of \"[[China's peaceful development]]\". Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border. Although the great majority of them are now resolved,{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} China's territorial disputes have led to several localized wars in the last 50 years, including the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] in 1969 and the [[Sino-Vietnam War]] in 1979. In 2001, China and Russia signed the [[2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship|Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation]],<ref>[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm Treaty of Good-Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826175727/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-03/21/content_548330.htm |date=26 August 2006 }} (March 21, 2006).

In periods of relative [[liberalization]], the influence of people and groups outside the formal party structure has tended to increase, particularly in the economic realm. Under the [[command economy]], every [[state-owned enterprise]] was required to have a party committee. The introduction of the [[market economy]] means that economic institutions now exist in which the party has limited or lots of power.\n\nNevertheless, in all governmental institutions in the PRC, the party committees at all levels maintain a powerful and pivotal role in the administration. Central party control is tightest in central government offices and in urban economic, industrial, and cultural settings; it is considerably looser over the government and party establishments in rural areas, where the majority of [[Mainland China|Mainland Chinese]] people live. The CPC's most important responsibility comes in the selection and promotion of personnel. They also see that party and state policy guidance is followed and that non-party members do not create autonomous organizations that could challenge party rule. Particularly important are the [[leading small group]]s which coordinate activities of different agencies. There is no convention that government committees contain at least one non-party member, party membership is a definite aid in the promotion and in being included in crucial policy-setting meetings.\n\nConstitutionally, the party's highest body is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|Party Congress]], which is supposed to meet at least once every 5 years. Meetings were irregular before the [[Cultural Revolution]] but have been periodic since then. The party elects the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] and the primary organs of power are formally parts of the central committee.\n\nThe primary organs of power in the Communist Party include:\n\n*The [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]], which is the highest-ranking official within the Party and usually the Chinese [[Paramount leader]].\n*The [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]], consisting of 22 full members (including the members of the Politburo Standing Committee);\n*The [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], the most powerful decision-making body in China, which currently consists of seven members;\n*The  [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China|Secretariat]], the principal administrative mechanism of the CPC, headed by the General Secretary;\n*The [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]];\n*The [[Central Discipline Inspection Commission]], which is charged with rooting out [[Political corruption|corruption]] and malfeasance among party cadres.\n\n==Government==\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe primary organs of state power are the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC), the [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]], and the [[State Council of China|State Council]]. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councillors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized locus of power.\n\nAt the same time, there has been a convention that party and state offices be separated at levels other than the central government, and it is unheard of for a sub-national executive to also be party secretary. The conflict has been often known to develop between the chief executive and the party secretary, and this conflict is widely seen as intentional to prevent either from becoming too dominant. Some special cases are the [[Special Administrative Region]]s of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] where the Communist Party does not function at all as part of the governmental system, and the [[autonomous region]]s where, following Soviet practice, the chief executive is typically a member of the local ethnic group while the party general secretary is non-local and usually [[Han Chinese]].\n\nUnder the [[Constitution of China]], the NPC is the highest organ of state power in China. It meets annually for about 2 weeks to review and approve major new policy directions, laws, the budget, and major personnel changes. Most national legislation in China is adopted by the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress| Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)]]. Most initiatives are presented to the NPCSC for consideration by the State Council after previous endorsement by the Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee. Although the NPC generally approves State Council policy and personnel recommendations, the NPC and its standing committee has increasingly asserted its role as the national legislature and has been able to force revisions in some laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|title=PDF China Monitor Nummer 37 en - Mercator Institute for China Studies|website=www.merics.org|language=de|access-date=2017-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325202356/https://www.merics.org/en/redirect/pdf-china-monitor-nummer-37-en/|archive-date=25 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For example, the State Council and the Party have been unable to secure passage of a fuel tax to finance the construction of [[freeway]]s.\n\n==Local government==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nCurrently, local government in China is structured in a hierarchy on four different levels. With the ''village'' being the grassroots (usually a hundred or so families), and not considered part of the hierarchy, local government advances through the ''township'', ''county'', ''prefecture'' or ''municipality'', and the ''province'' as the geographical area of jurisdiction increases. Each level in the hierarchy is responsible for overseeing the work carried out by lower levels on the administrative strata. At each level are two important officials. A figure that represents the Communist Party of China, colloquially termed the ''[[CPC party chief|Party chief]]'' or the ''Party Secretary'', acts as the policy maker. This figure is appointed by their superiors. The head of the local [[Central People's Government|People's Government]], is, in theory, elected by the people. Usually called a ''[[governor]]'', ''[[mayor]]'', or ''[[magistrate]]'', depending on the level, this figure acts to carry out the policies and most ceremonial duties. The distinction has evolved into a system where the Party Secretary is always in precedence above the leader of the People's Government.\n\nAfter [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978 greater autonomy has been given to provinces in terms of economic policy implementation as well as other areas of policy such as education and transportation. As a result, some provincial authorities have evolved tendencies of operating on a ''de facto'' [[Federal republic|federal]] system with Beijing. Prominent examples of greater autonomy are seen in the provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]], where local leaders do little to adhere to the strict standards issued by the Central Government, especially economic policy. In addition, conflicts have arisen in the relations of the central Party leaders with the few provincial-level Municipalities, most notably the [[Politics of Shanghai|municipal government of Shanghai]] and the rivalry between former Beijing mayor [[Chen Xitong]] and [[Jiang Zemin]]. The removal of Shanghai Municipality Party Secretary [[Chen Liangyu]] in September 2006 is the latest example.\n\nChina's system of [[autonomous region]]s and autonomous prefectures within provinces are formally intended to provide for greater autonomy by the ethnic group majority that inhabits the region. In practice, however, power rests with the Party secretary. Beijing will often appoint loyal party cadres to oversee the local work as Party secretary, while the local ''Chairman'' of the region's government is regarded as its nominal head. Power rests with the Party secretary. To avoid the solidification of local loyalties during a cadre's term in office, the central government freely and frequently transfers party cadres around different regions of the country, so a high ranking cadre's career might include service as governor or party secretary of several different provinces.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{See also|Administrative divisions of China}}\n{{PRC provinces imagemap}}\n\n== National armed forces ==\n{{main|People's Liberation Army|People's Armed Police|Militia (China)}}\n\nThe Communist Party of China created and leads the People\u2019s Liberation Army. After the PRC was established in 1949, the PLA also became a state military. The state military system inherited and upholds the principle of the Communist Party\u2019s absolute leadership over the people\u2019s armed forces.  The Party and the State jointly established the Central Military Commission that carries out the task of supreme military leadership over the armed forces.\n\nThe 1954 [[PRC Constitution]] provides that the State Chairman (President) directs the armed forces and made the State Chairman the chair of the Defense Commission (the Defense Commission is an advisory body, it does not lead the armed forces).  On September 28, 1954, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party re-established the Central Military Commission as the leader of the PLA and the people\u2019s armed forces. From that time onwards, the system of joint Party and state military leadership was established. The Central Committee of the Communist Party leads in all military affairs. The State Chairman directs the state military forces and the development of the military forces managed by the State Council.<ref name=Xingzu>Pu Xingzu, Chapter 11, The State Military System in \"The Political System of the People's Republic of China\",(Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo Zhengzhi Zhidu) Chief Editor Pu Xingzu, Shanghai, 2005,  Shanghai People\u2019s Publishing House. {{ISBN|7-208-05566-1}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2004, the fifth [[National People\u2019s Congress]] revised the State Constitution to provide that the State [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] leads all the armed forces of the state.  The chair of the State CMC is chosen and removed by the full NPC while the other members are chosen by the NPC Standing Committee.  However, the CMC of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] remained the Party organization that directly leads the military and all the other armed forces. In actual practice, the Party CMC, after consultation with the democratic parties, proposes the names of the State CMC members of the NPC so that these people after going through the legal processes can be elected by the NPC to the State Central Military Commission. That is to say, that the CMC of the Central Committee and the CMC of the State are one group and one organization. However, looking at it organizationally, these two CMCs are subordinate to two different systems \u2013 the Party system and the State system. Therefore, the armed forces are under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party and are also the armed forces of the state.  This is a unique Chinese system that ensures the joint leadership of the Communist Party and the state over the armed forces.<ref name=Xingzu/>\n\n{{See also|List of wars involving the People's Republic of China}}\n\n==State leaders==\n{{see also|Paramount leader|List of national leaders of the People's Republic of China|Political position ranking of PRC|Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Generations of Chinese leadership}}\n\n===Politburo Standing Committee===\n{{CPC Politburo Standing Committee}}\n\n===Full Politburo members===\n{{CPC Politburo}}\n\n==Elections==\n{{main|Elections in the People's Republic of China}}\nNo substantial legal political opposition groups exist, and the country is mainly run by the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), but there are other political parties in the PRC, called \"democratic parties\", which participate in the [[People's Political Consultative Conference]] but mostly serve to endorse CPC policies.

These parties all formally accept the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) and their activities are directed by the [[United Front Work Department]] of the CPC. Their original function was to create the impression that the PRC was being ruled by a diverse national front, not a one-party dictatorship. The major role of these parties is to attract and subsequently muzzle niches in society that have political tendencies, such as academia. Although these parties are tightly controlled and do not challenge the Communist Party, members of the parties often individually are found in policy-making national institutions, and there is a convention that state institutions generally have at least one sinecure from a minor political party.\n\nThe minor parties include the [[Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Guomindang]], founded in 1948 by dissident members of the mainstream [[Kuomintang]] then under control of Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]; [[China Democratic League]], created in 1941 by intellectuals in education and the arts; [[China Democratic National Construction Association]], formed in 1945 by educators and national [[capitalism|capitalist]]s (industrialists and business people); [[China Association for Promoting Democracy]], started in 1945 by intellectuals in cultural, education (primary and secondary schools), and publishing circles; [[Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party]], originated in 1930 by intellectuals in medicine, the arts, and education; [[China Party for Public Interest]] (China Zhi Gong Dang), founded in 1925 to attract the support of overseas Chinese; [[Jiusan Society]], founded in 1945 by a group of college professors and scientists to commemorate the victory of the \"[[World War II|international war against fascism]]\" on September 3; and [[Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League]], created in 1947 by \"patriotic supporters of democracy who originated in Taiwan and now reside on the mainland.\"\n\nCoordination between the eight registered minor parties and the Communist Party of China is done through the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] which meets annually in Beijing in March at about the same time that the National People's Congress meets. In addition, there are a few minor parties which either lack official recognition or are actively suppressed by the government, such as the [[Maoist Communist Party of China]], [[China Democracy Party]] and [[China New Democracy Party]], which have their headquarters outside of the [[Mainland China]].<ref>https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013030611/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ch.html |date=13 October 2016 }} CIA - The World Factbook -- China, retrieved December 12, 2007.</ref>\n\n\n==Legal system==\n{{main|Law of the People's Republic of China}}{{More citations needed section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Chinese legal code is a complex amalgam of custom and statute, largely focused on criminal law, though a rudimentary civil code has been in effect since January 1, 1987, and new legal codes have been in effect since January 1, 1980. Continuing efforts are being made to improve civil, administrative, criminal, and commercial law.\n\nAlthough the current law of China cannot be categorised by arbitrary rule, it is over-simplifying to describe it as a system of rule of law. While personal freedom and right to private property is nominally guaranteed by law, officials maintain the right to trespass citizens before proving or suspecting them breaking the law through the use of [[Administrative law|Droit administration.]] In other words, the concept of [[Habeas corpus]] does not apply in China. Also, Party members are subjected to different sets of law, namely the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China]], which authorises itself to use state apparatus to regulate behaviours of party members, sometimes overriding [[Law of the land]]. One of the most distinctive characteristics of Chinese law is the lack of a mechanism to verify the constitutionality of statute laws. This in effect allows the enactment of any administrative laws as long as circumstances justify.\n\nThe government's efforts to promote rule by law (not the same as [[rule of law]]) are significant and ongoing. After the [[Cultural Revolution]], the PRC's leaders aimed to develop a legal system to restrain abuses of official authority and revolutionary excesses. In 1982, the National People's Congress adopted a new state constitution that emphasized the concept of rule by law by which party and state organizations are all subject to the law. (The importance of the rule by law was further elevated by a 1999 Constitutional amendment.) Many commentators{{Who|date=December 2011}} have pointed out that the emphasis on rule by law increases rather than decreases the power of the [[Communist Party of China]] because the party, in its position of power, is in a better position to change the law to suit its own needs.\n\nSince 1979, when the drive to establish a functioning legal system began, more than 301 laws and regulations, most of them in the economic area, have been promulgated. (After [[China and the World Trade Organization|China's entry into the WTO]], many new economically related laws have been put in place, while others have been amended.) The use of mediation committees - informed groups of citizens who resolve about 90% of the PRC's civil disputes and some minor criminal cases at no cost to the parties - is one innovative device. There are more than 800,000 such committees in both rural and urban areas.\n\nLegal reform became a government priority in the 1990s. Legislation designed to modernize and professionalize the nation's lawyers, judges, and prisons was enacted. The 1994 Administrative Procedure Law allows citizens to sue officials for abuse of authority or malfeasance. In addition, the criminal law and the criminal procedures laws were amended to introduce significant reforms. The criminal law amendments abolished the crime of \"counter-revolutionary\" activity (and references to \"counter-revolutionaries\" disappeared with the passing of the 1999 Constitutional amendment), while criminal procedures reforms encouraged the establishment of a more transparent, adversarial trial process. The PRC Constitution and laws provide for fundamental human rights, including due process, although those laws also provide for limitations of those rights.\n\nAlthough the human rights situation in [[mainland China]] has improved markedly since the 1960s (the 2004 Constitutional amendments specifically stressed that the State protects human rights), the government remains determined to prevent any organized opposition to its rule. [[Amnesty International]] estimates that the PRC holds several thousand political prisoners. Although illegal, there have been reports of [[torture]] by civil authorities.\n\n==Nationality and ethnicity==\n{{See also|Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China|Regional ethnic autonomy system of China}}\n\nNationality is granted at birth to children with at least one Chinese-national parent, with some exceptions. In general, [[naturalization]] or the obtainment of the People's Republic of China nationality is difficult. The Nationality Law prescribes only three conditions for the obtainment of PRC nationality (marriage to a PRC national is one, permanent residence is another). If a PRC citizen voluntarily obtains a foreign nationality, he or she loses Chinese nationality automatically (yet this regulation does not apply to party members or government officials{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}). If the citizen then wishes to resume PRC nationality, foreign nationality is no longer recognized. \n\nThe PRC is officially a multi-ethnic state providing ethnic autonomy in the form of [[autonomous entities of China|autonomous administrative entities]].<ref>Section 6 of Chapter 3 (Articles 112-122) of the [[Constitution of China]], further specified under the [[Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnical Regional Autonomy System]]</ref> By law, ethnic minorities receive advantages in areas such as population control, school admissions, government employment, and military recruitment. The PRC recognises 56 nationalities in China and simultaneously categorises them as one hegemonic [[Chinese nation]]. However, [[Separatism|separatist]] sentiment has occasionally flared in [[Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. As such, independence groups and foreign human rights groups are critical of the PRC's policies in ethnic areas and have bemoaned the presence of [[Han Chinese]] (the main ethnic group of China) in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n==Foreign relations==\n[[Image:Bushhujintao.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hu Jintao]] and US president [[George W.

The government actively opposes foreign government meetings with the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in a political capacity, as the spokesperson of a separatist movement in Tibet.\n\nThe PRC has been playing a leading role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. In 2004, the PRC proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues that pointedly excluded the United States.<ref>Dillon, Dana and John Tkacik Jr, [http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html \"China\u2019s Quest for Asia\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html |date=10 February 2006 }}, ''Policy Review'', December 2005 and January 2006, Issue No. 134.

China is also a founder and member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), alongside [[Russia]] and the [[Central Asia]]n republics.\n\nMuch of the current foreign policy is based on the concept of \"[[China's peaceful development]]\". Nonetheless, crises in relations with foreign countries have occurred at various times in its recent history, particularly with the [[United States]]; e.g., the U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in [[Belgrade]] during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001. China's foreign relations with many Western nations suffered for a time following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. A much troubled foreign relationship is that between [[Sino-Japanese relations|China and Japan]], which has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its wartime past to the satisfaction of the PRC, such as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionistic]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials, and insufficient details given to the [[Nanking Massacre|Nanjing Massacre]] and other [[Japanese war crimes|atrocities]] committed during [[World War II]] in [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]]. Another point of conflict between the two countries is the frequent visits by Japanese government officials to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which honours not only Japanese World War II dead but also many convicted World War II war criminals, including 14 Class A convictions.\n\n==International disputes==\nThe PRC is in a number of [[Foreign relations of China#International territorial disputes|international territorial disputes]], several of which involved the Sino-Russian border.

That core company had become publicly traded in 1979. Hoffman-La Roche acquired it for US$163.5 million in 1982 and then merged it with all of its laboratories, and incorporated the merged company that year as Roche Biomedical Laboratories, Inc. in Burlington.

In addition to having previously played for the Penguins, he has also played in the NHL with the [[Vancouver Canucks]], [[Washington Capitals]] and [[Minnesota Wild]]. Cooke was born in [[Belleville, Ontario]], but grew up in [[Stirling-Rawdon|Stirling, Ontario]].\n\nCooke's playing style has earned him the reputation as one of the NHL's \"[[Pest (ice hockey)|pests]]\".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Graff|first1=Chad|title=Minnesota Wild: Matt Cooke has changed his game, but he's still a pest|url=https://www.twincities.com/2013/12/20/minnesota-wild-matt-cooke-has-changed-his-game-but-hes-still-a-pest/|accessdate=March 9, 2018|newspaper=St. Paul Pioneer Press|date=November 7, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Colligan|first1=Mike|title=Matt Cooke Suspended 14-17 Games; the End of the 'NHL Pest'?|url=https://thehockeywriters.com/matt-cooke-suspended-x-games-the-end-of-the-nhl-pest/|website=thehockeywriters.com|accessdate=March 9, 2018|date=March 21, 2011}}</ref> During his NHL career, Cooke has been criticized and often suspended for hits, some involving head-shots, or knee-on-knee collisions that have injured opposing players. Most notable was a hit to the head of [[Marc Savard]], which was an important factor influencing NHL rule changes intended to deter such conduct. Years later, during a lawsuit against the league, an email produced during the litigation from the then disciplinarian Colin Campbell revealed that he\u2014an NHL executive\u2014blamed Savard for keeping his head down. However, other commentators disagree and condemn the hit. Of note, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] host and former head coach [[Don Cherry]] has been consistently and effectively critical of Cooke, personally, and has faulted the NHL for not responding appropriately to Cooke's intents to render opposing players unable to play over the years.<ref name=\"boston.cbslocal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/03/30/colin-campbell-critical-of-marc-savard-after-matt-cooke-hit-in-2010/|title=Colin Campbell Critical Of Marc Savard After Matt Cooke Hit In 2010|publisher=|date=March 30, 2016}}</ref> After his longest suspension in 2011, Cooke has pledged to change his style of play, though had another lengthy suspension in the 2014 playoffs for a knee-on-knee hit delivered to [[Tyson Barrie]] of the [[Colorado Avalanche]].

Years later, during a lawsuit against the league, an email produced during the litigation from the then disciplinarian Colin Campbell revealed that he\u2014an NHL executive\u2014blamed Savard for keeping his head down. However, other commentators disagree and condemn the hit.

Logan''''', also known as the '''General John A. Logan Monument''' and '''Logan Circle Monument''', is an [[equestrian statue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] that honors politician and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general [[John A. Logan]].  The monument is sited in the center of [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]], a traffic circle and public park in the Logan Circle neighborhood.  The statue was sculpted by artist [[Franklin Simmons]], whose other prominent works include the [[Peace Monument]] and statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]].  The architect of the statue base was [[Richard Morris Hunt]], designer of prominent buildings including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island.  Prominent attendees at the dedication ceremony in 1901 included President [[William McKinley]], members of his cabinet, Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Senator [[Shelby Moore Cullom]], and General [[Grenville M. Dodge]].\n\nThe sculpture is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|eighteen Civil War monuments]] in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The bronze sculpture rests on a bronze and granite base adorned with two reliefs depicting historically inaccurate moments in Logan's life.  The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[John A. Logan]] (1826\u20131886) was a native of [[Illinois]] who served as a second lieutenant in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] before studying at the [[University of Louisville]] to become a lawyer.  Originally a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was elected state senator and later a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].  During the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Logan denounced what he considered extremists on both sides, but eventually volunteered to fight with the [[Union Army]] during the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].  He then resigned from Congress and was made colonel after he organized the [[31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].  Logan was wounded twice while serving in the war and considered an outstanding field commander.  He was promoted to brigadier general following the victory at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]].  Logan played a significant role in the Union success at [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and served as that district's military governor.  Following the death of General [[James B. McPherson]], Logan was given command of the [[Army of the Tennessee]], but was soon relieved by General [[Oliver O. Howard]] after Logan became too involved with the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]].  He left the army in 1865 and resumed his career in politics.<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=Baltimore | pages=81\u201384 | isbn=9780801858611 }}</ref><ref name=goode>{{cite book | title=The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C. | publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press | author=Goode, James M. | year=1974 | location=Washington, D.C. | pages=278 | isbn=0-87474-149-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:John Alexander Logan crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John A. Logan]]]]\nLogan was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the U.S. House of Representatives and later to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].  In the [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential election]], Logan unsuccessfully ran with Senator [[James G. Blaine]] as his vice presidential candidate, narrowly losing the race.  During his time in office, Logan was considered one of the most vocal advocates for military veterans.  He helped organize two veteran fraternal organizations, the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) and the Society of the Army of the Tennessee (SAT), and was instrumental in the federal government recognizing [[Memorial Day]] (originally called Decoration Day) as an official holiday, first celebrated in 1868.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=goode/>\n\nSoon after Logan's death in 1886, the SAT began work on erecting a monument to the military hero.  The organization worked closely with the GAR and Logan's widow, Mary, to raise funds and lobby Congress for a monument.  It would be the second equestrian monument in Washington, D.C. commissioned by the SAT, the first being the ''[[Major General James B. McPherson (statue)|Major General James B. McPherson]]'' statue.<ref name=jacob/>  Erection of the monument was approved by an act of Congress on March 2, 1889.<ref name=nomination>{{cite web | url={{NRHP url|id=78000257}} | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory\u2014Nomination Form \u2013 Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=National Park Service | date=September 19, 1977 | accessdate=February 28, 2015 | author=Scott, Gary }}</ref>  A memorial commission was created to select a sculptor and site for the statue.  Members of the commission asked sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] who he would recommend.  He suggested [[Franklin Simmons]] (1839\u20131913), an American artist working in Rome.  Simmons had previously sculpted several Civil War monuments, including the [[Peace Monument]] in Washington, D.C.  His other works in the city include several statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] and the [[United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection]].<ref name=jacob/>\n\nThe commission considered models by several sculptors before selecting Simmons in December 1892, whose model was the \"most agreeable to Mrs. Logan.\"  She admired not only the posture of Simmon's model, but his idea to have the statue rest on a bronze base, unlike other monuments in the city that featured granite bases.  Mary also liked that Simmons and members of the commission would follow her recommendations for the [[reliefs]] to be found on the statue base.  Simmons was paid $65,000 for his work; around $13,000 from the SAT and the remainder from the federal government.  Sculpting the piece proved more difficult than Simmons had expected since the Logan statue was his first and only equestrian work.  He was forced to ask for several extensions beginning in 1896.<ref name=jacob/>  Simmons paid [[Foundry|founder]] Fonderia Nelli extra money to work around the clock on the base, designed by prominent architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], whose other works include the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] Rhode Island.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=williams/>\n[[File:Northwest corner of Logan Circle.jpg|thumb|Row houses on the northwest corner of [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]]]]\nIt only took Nelli three-and-a-half months to complete the process instead of the planned year.  The Cranford Paving Company was contracted to prepare the site and lay the granite foundation.  Simmons was not pleased with the company's work and new stone was ordered in September 1897.  Following the new stone's placement, the base was installed on April 18, 1898.  It wasn't until 1900 that Simmons completed the sculpture and it was cast in Rome.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=smithsonian/>  Upon its completion, a ceremony attended by [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I]] of Italy and his wife, [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]], was held at the foundry where Simmons was honored with knighthood.<ref name=jacob/>  The sculpture was shipped to the United States and arrived in [[Brooklyn]] in December 1900.  Because the sculpture was too large to be transported by train, it was placed onto a two-masted [[schooner]] and arrived in Washington, D.C. on January 16, 1901.  It was installed on top of the base one week later.<ref name=smithsonian/>\n\nThe site chosen for the monument was the center of Iowa Circle, a park in an upscale neighborhood in the city's [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest]] [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|quadrant]].<ref name=williams>{{cite book | title=The Neighborhoods of Logan, Scott, and Thomas Circles | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=William, Paul K. | year=2001 | location=Charleston | pages=9 | isbn=9780738514048 }}</ref>  The park was completely redesigned in 1891 to make room for the monument.<ref name=survey/>  By the time it was dedicated in 1901, nearby [[Dupont Circle]] was lined with mansions and had become more popular with the city's wealthy residents while Iowa Circle, surrounded by stately row houses, had become a middle-class neighborhood.<ref name=williams/>\n\n===Dedication===\nThe monument was formally dedicated on April 9, 1901.<ref name=smithsonian/>  Temporary platforms for invited and distinguished guests were built near the base.  Guests included President [[William McKinley]], members of [[William McKinley#Administration and cabinet|his cabinet]], Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Senator [[Shelby Moore Cullom]], General [[Grenville M. Dodge]], Mary Logan and several members of the Logan family, representatives from the GAR and SAT, and Simmons.  Prior to the ceremony, there was a large military parade led by Colonel Francis L. Guenther.  The parade consisted of soldiers, marines, seamen from the nearby [[Washington Navy Yard|Navy Yard]], the District of Columbia militia, and GAR and SAT veterans.  Dodge, who was president of the SAT and the only living general depicted on one of the relief panels, presided over the ceremonies.  George Tucker, a grandson of Logan, pulled a cord, parting the flags that had draped over the statue.  This was followed by cheers and applause from the crowd while the Fourth Artillery fired a national salute.<ref name=dedication>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/04/10/118463786.pdf | title=John A.

Logan''''', also known as the '''General John A. Logan Monument''' and '''Logan Circle Monument''', is an [[equestrian statue]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] that honors politician and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general [[John A. Logan]].  The monument is sited in the center of [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]], a traffic circle and public park in the Logan Circle neighborhood.  The statue was sculpted by artist [[Franklin Simmons]], whose other prominent works include the [[Peace Monument]] and statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]].  The architect of the statue base was [[Richard Morris Hunt]], designer of prominent buildings including the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], Rhode Island.  Prominent attendees at the dedication ceremony in 1901 included President [[William McKinley]], members of his cabinet, Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Senator [[Shelby Moore Cullom]], and General [[Grenville M. Dodge]].\n\nThe sculpture is one of [[Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C.|eighteen Civil War monuments]] in Washington, D.C., which were collectively listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1978.  The bronze sculpture rests on a bronze and granite base adorned with two reliefs depicting historically inaccurate moments in Logan's life.  The monument and surrounding park are owned and maintained by the [[National Park Service]], a federal agency of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior Department]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[John A. Logan]] (1826\u20131886) was a native of [[Illinois]] who served as a second lieutenant in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] before studying at the [[University of Louisville]] to become a lawyer.  Originally a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was elected state senator and later a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].  During the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Logan denounced what he considered extremists on both sides, but eventually volunteered to fight with the [[Union Army]] during the [[First Battle of Bull Run]].  He then resigned from Congress and was made colonel after he organized the [[31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].  Logan was wounded twice while serving in the war and considered an outstanding field commander.  He was promoted to brigadier general following the victory at [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Fort Donelson]].  Logan played a significant role in the Union success at [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and served as that district's military governor.  Following the death of General [[James B. McPherson]], Logan was given command of the [[Army of the Tennessee]], but was soon relieved by General [[Oliver O. Howard]] after Logan became too involved with the [[1864 United States presidential election|1864 presidential election]].  He left the army in 1865 and resumed his career in politics.<ref name=jacob>{{cite book | title=Testament to Union: Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=JHU Press | author=Jacob, Kathryn Allamong | year=1998 | location=Baltimore | pages=81\u201384 | isbn=9780801858611 }}</ref><ref name=goode>{{cite book | title=The Outdoor Sculpture of Washington, D.C. | publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press | author=Goode, James M. | year=1974 | location=Washington, D.C. | pages=278 | isbn=0-87474-149-1 }}</ref>\n[[File:John Alexander Logan crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John A. Logan]]]]\nLogan was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the U.S. House of Representatives and later to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].  In the [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential election]], Logan unsuccessfully ran with Senator [[James G. Blaine]] as his vice presidential candidate, narrowly losing the race.  During his time in office, Logan was considered one of the most vocal advocates for military veterans.  He helped organize two veteran fraternal organizations, the [[Grand Army of the Republic]] (GAR) and the Society of the Army of the Tennessee (SAT), and was instrumental in the federal government recognizing [[Memorial Day]] (originally called Decoration Day) as an official holiday, first celebrated in 1868.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=goode/>\n\nSoon after Logan's death in 1886, the SAT began work on erecting a monument to the military hero.  The organization worked closely with the GAR and Logan's widow, Mary, to raise funds and lobby Congress for a monument.  It would be the second equestrian monument in Washington, D.C. commissioned by the SAT, the first being the ''[[Major General James B. McPherson (statue)|Major General James B. McPherson]]'' statue.<ref name=jacob/>  Erection of the monument was approved by an act of Congress on March 2, 1889.<ref name=nomination>{{cite web | url={{NRHP url|id=78000257}} | title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory\u2014Nomination Form \u2013 Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. | publisher=National Park Service | date=September 19, 1977 | accessdate=February 28, 2015 | author=Scott, Gary }}</ref>  A memorial commission was created to select a sculptor and site for the statue.  Members of the commission asked sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] who he would recommend.  He suggested [[Franklin Simmons]] (1839\u20131913), an American artist working in Rome.  Simmons had previously sculpted several Civil War monuments, including the [[Peace Monument]] in Washington, D.C.  His other works in the city include several statues in the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]] and the [[United States Senate Vice Presidential Bust Collection]].<ref name=jacob/>\n\nThe commission considered models by several sculptors before selecting Simmons in December 1892, whose model was the \"most agreeable to Mrs. Logan.\"  She admired not only the posture of Simmon's model, but his idea to have the statue rest on a bronze base, unlike other monuments in the city that featured granite bases.  Mary also liked that Simmons and members of the commission would follow her recommendations for the [[reliefs]] to be found on the statue base.  Simmons was paid $65,000 for his work; around $13,000 from the SAT and the remainder from the federal government.  Sculpting the piece proved more difficult than Simmons had expected since the Logan statue was his first and only equestrian work.  He was forced to ask for several extensions beginning in 1896.<ref name=jacob/>  Simmons paid [[Foundry|founder]] Fonderia Nelli extra money to work around the clock on the base, designed by prominent architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], whose other works include the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City and [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] Rhode Island.<ref name=smithsonian/><ref name=williams/>\n[[File:Northwest corner of Logan Circle.jpg|thumb|Row houses on the northwest corner of [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]]]]\nIt only took Nelli three-and-a-half months to complete the process instead of the planned year.  The Cranford Paving Company was contracted to prepare the site and lay the granite foundation.  Simmons was not pleased with the company's work and new stone was ordered in September 1897.  Following the new stone's placement, the base was installed on April 18, 1898.  It wasn't until 1900 that Simmons completed the sculpture and it was cast in Rome.<ref name=jacob/><ref name=smithsonian/>  Upon its completion, a ceremony attended by [[Umberto I of Italy|King Umberto I]] of Italy and his wife, [[Margherita of Savoy|Queen Margherita]], was held at the foundry where Simmons was honored with knighthood.<ref name=jacob/>  The sculpture was shipped to the United States and arrived in [[Brooklyn]] in December 1900.  Because the sculpture was too large to be transported by train, it was placed onto a two-masted [[schooner]] and arrived in Washington, D.C. on January 16, 1901.  It was installed on top of the base one week later.<ref name=smithsonian/>\n\nThe site chosen for the monument was the center of Iowa Circle, a park in an upscale neighborhood in the city's [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.|northwest]] [[Quadrants of Washington, D.C.|quadrant]].<ref name=williams>{{cite book | title=The Neighborhoods of Logan, Scott, and Thomas Circles | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=William, Paul K. | year=2001 | location=Charleston | pages=9 | isbn=9780738514048 }}</ref>  The park was completely redesigned in 1891 to make room for the monument.<ref name=survey/>  By the time it was dedicated in 1901, nearby [[Dupont Circle]] was lined with mansions and had become more popular with the city's wealthy residents while Iowa Circle, surrounded by stately row houses, had become a middle-class neighborhood.<ref name=williams/>\n\n===Dedication===\nThe monument was formally dedicated on April 9, 1901.<ref name=smithsonian/>  Temporary platforms for invited and distinguished guests were built near the base.  Guests included President [[William McKinley]], members of [[William McKinley#Administration and cabinet|his cabinet]], Senator [[Chauncey Depew]], Senator [[Shelby Moore Cullom]], General [[Grenville M. Dodge]], Mary Logan and several members of the Logan family, representatives from the GAR and SAT, and Simmons.  Prior to the ceremony, there was a large military parade led by Colonel Francis L. Guenther.  The parade consisted of soldiers, marines, seamen from the nearby [[Washington Navy Yard|Navy Yard]], the District of Columbia militia, and GAR and SAT veterans.  Dodge, who was president of the SAT and the only living general depicted on one of the relief panels, presided over the ceremonies.  George Tucker, a grandson of Logan, pulled a cord, parting the flags that had draped over the statue.  This was followed by cheers and applause from the crowd while the Fourth Artillery fired a national salute.<ref name=dedication>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/04/10/118463786.pdf | title=John A.

The statue unveiled today proclaims our country's appreciation of one of her heroic sons whose name is dear to the American people, the ideal volunteer soldier of two wars, the eminent senator and commoner, General John A.

It is on a low but very prominent hill to the east of [[St. Mungo's Cathedral, Glasgow|Glasgow Cathedral]] (St. Mungo's Cathedral). Fifty thousand individuals have been buried here. Typical for the period, only a small percentage are named on monuments and not every grave has a stone. Approximately 3500 monuments exist here.\n\n==Background==\n\nFollowing the creation of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris a wave of pressure began for cemeteries in Britain. This required a change in the law to allow burial for profit. Previously the parish church held responsibility for burying the dead but there was a growing need for an alternative. Glasgow was one of the first to join this campaign, having a growing population, with fewer and fewer attending church. The planning of the cemetery began formally by the Merchants' House of Glasgow in 1831, in anticipation of a change in the law. The Cemeteries Act was passed in 1832 and the floodgates opened. Glasgow Necropolis officially opened in April 1833.<ref>Glasgow Necropolis Heritage Trail, Glasgow City Council</ref> Just prior to this, in September 1832, a Jewish burial ground had been established in the north-west section of the land. This small area was declared \"full\" in 1851.\n\n==History==\n\nPredating the cemetery, the statue of [[John Knox]] sitting on a column at the top of the hill, dates from 1825.\n\n[[Alexander Thomson]] designed a number of its tombs, and John Bryce and [[David Hamilton (architect)|David Hamilton]] designed other architecture for the grounds.\n\nThe main entrance is approached by a bridge over what was then the [[Molendinar Burn]]. The bridge, which was designed by David Hamilton was completed in 1836. It became known as the \"Bridge of Sighs\" because it was part of the route of [[funeral procession]]s (the name is an allusion to the [[Bridge of Sighs]] in [[Venice]]). The ornate gates (by both David and James Hamilton) were erected in 1838, restricting access onto the bridge.\n\nThree modern memorials lie between the gates and the bridge: a memorial to still-born children; a memorial to the [[Korean War]]; and a memorial to Glaswegian recipients of the [[Victoria Cross]].\n\nAcross the bridge the original scheme was to enter the area via a tunnel but this proved unviable. The ornate entrance of 1836 remains.\n\nThe cemetery, as most early Victorian cemeteries, is laid out as an informal park, lacking the formal grid layouts of later cemeteries. This layout is further enhanced by the complex topography.

It is on a low but very prominent hill to the east of [[St. Mungo's Cathedral, Glasgow|Glasgow Cathedral]] (St. Mungo's Cathedral). Fifty thousand individuals have been buried here. Typical for the period, only a small percentage are named on monuments and not every grave has a stone. Approximately 3500 monuments exist here.\n\n==Background==\n\nFollowing the creation of [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris a wave of pressure began for cemeteries in Britain. This required a change in the law to allow burial for profit. Previously the parish church held responsibility for burying the dead but there was a growing need to give an alternative solution. Glasgow was one of the first to join this campaign, having a growing population, with fewer and fewer attending church. The planning of the cemetery began formally by the Merchants' House of Glasgow in 1831, in anticipation of a change in the law. The Cemeteries Act was passed in 1832 and the floodgates opened. Glasgow Necropolis officially opened in April 1833.<ref>Glasgow Necropolis Heritage Trail, Glasgow City Council</ref> Just prior to this, in September 1832 a Jewish burial ground had been established in the north-west section of the land. This small area was declared \"full\" in 1851.\n\n==History==\n\nPredating the cemetery, the statue of [[John Knox]] sitting on a column at the top of the hill, dates from 1825.\n\n[[Alexander Thomson]] designed a number of its tombs, and John Bryce and [[David Hamilton (architect)|David Hamilton]] designed other architecture for the grounds.\n\nThe main entrance is approached by a bridge over what was then the [[Molendinar Burn]]. The bridge, which was designed by David Hamilton was completed in 1836. It became known as the \"Bridge of Sighs\" because it was part of the route of [[funeral procession]]s (the name is an allusion to the [[Bridge of Sighs]] in [[Venice]]). The ornate gates (by both David and James Hamilton) were erected in 1838, restricting access onto the bridge.\n\nThree modern memorials lie between the gates and the bridge: a memorial to still-born children; a memorial to the [[Korean War]]; and a memorial to Glaswegian recipients of the [[Victoria Cross]].\n\nAcross the bridge the original scheme was to enter the area via a tunnel but this proved unviable. The ornate entrance of 1836 remains.\n\nThe cemetery, as most early Victorian cemeteries, is laid out as an informal park, lacking the formal grid layouts of later cemeteries. This layout is further enhanced by the complex topography. The cemetery's paths meander uphill towards the summit, where many of the larger monuments stand, clustered around the [[John Knox]] Monument. \n\nThe Glasgow Necropolis was described by [[James Stevens Curl]] as \"literally a city of the dead\".

By 1598, the year of his MA, he had already been appointed [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Nantwich]] in [[Cheshire]].<ref name=odnb/> [[James Hall (historian)|James Hall]], a distinguished Victorian historian of the town, implies Paget first appeared in the town as a preacher under the previous incumbent, William Holford.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownpar00hall#page/294/mode/2up Hall, p. 294.]</ref> In 1601 he had his first book published in London: ''A Primer of Christian Religion, or a forme of Catechising, drawne from the beholding of Gods works''.<ref name=hall295/> In 1602 he married [[Briget Paget|Briget]] or Bridget the daughter of Richard Masterson and widow of George or John Thrushe.\n\nPaget's Puritan principles must have been well-established by this time. The Puritan perspective was put forward to [[James I of England|James I]] soon after his succession in the [[Millenary Petition]], which prompted him to set up the [[Hampton Court Conference]] of 1604. The response of [[Richard Bancroft]], the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was a book of canons, later rejected by Parliament, which demanded conformity to the disciplines, not just the teachings, of the [[Church of England]]. Twelve Cheshire clergy refused to subscribe to the canons and some were  imprisoned or fled to the [[Dutch Republic]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/n23/mode/2up Urwick, p. viii.]</ref> Paget's nonconformity forced him to leave Nantwich.<ref name=hall295/> In 1605 he went to the Netherlands.\n\n===Military chaplain===\nPaget's migration from England took him into a war zone, as the Dutch were in the midst of the [[Eighty Years' War]] to secure their independence from Spain. It also took him into Dutch employment, although initially under English direction. For two years Paget was chaplain to the English troops fighting under Sir John Ogle and [[Horace Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury|Sir Horace Vere]].<ref name=odnb/> Ogle commanded one of four units<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028310294#page/n413/mode/2up Markham, p.364]</ref> and was second-in-command of the whole force, while Vere commanded another and had overall leadership of the English contingents, which since 1598 had been paid by the Dutch and formed part of the Dutch army.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=20611|title=Ogle, Sir John|first=D.

There was the bonanza of a 75% dividend for the year 1629\u201330, following the capture of the Mexican silver fleet. This must have been a boon to the Pagets, as it was in 1631<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ahistoryancient05bookgoog#page/n88/mode/2up Booker, p.67.]</ref> that they faced the arrival of Thomas Paget, former incumbent of [[Blackley]] Chapel, and his family as refugees from England. However, it was more or less the end of profitability and the fortunes of the Company were dogged by internal divisions between different religious and regional factions during the 1630s.<ref name=\"Boxer, p. 54\"/>\n\n===Controversies and conflicts===\nPaget was very careful to keep his congregation distinct from other English-speaking congregations, both in Amsterdam and in the Netherlands more generally.<ref name=odnb/> Within a year of his taking up his post, possibly earlier, there was an English [[Baptist]] group, centred on [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]], in Amsterdam alongside his own and Johnson's congregations.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/earlyenglishdiss01burr_0#page/32/mode/2up Burrage, volume 1, p. 32.]</ref> Paget's aloofness can only have been reinforced by the internal divisions and the later confusions as the remnants of this group fused with the Dutch [[Mennonite]]s known as Waterlanders after Smyth's death.<ref>These problems are documented in [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n203/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p. 177-259.]</ref> He resolutely opposed what he regarded as [[schism]]atics of every kind. This included the more radical Calvinists. Key issues included formal prayer and an ordained ministry, which were rejected by [[Henry Ainsworth]], Thomas Baker and other Brownist-influenced leaders, as Paget noted in his 1618 riposte, ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', the occasion for which he claimed was:\n\n<blockquote>a certaine mayde who pretendeth that she is troubled to ioyne with our Church because of the use of the [[Lord's Prayer|Lords prayer]] among us; because of my calling unto this Church, whereof I am a Minister, which calling he (Baker) tells her is unlawfull; & because there is no difference betwixt us and the Church of England...<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n1/mode/2up ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', p. 1b.] Note that this part of the publication has numbered leaves, not pages: this is on the second page of the first leaf.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPaget dealt with issue of formal prayer, specifically the Lord's Prayer, in Chapter 2 of the ''Arrow'', rebutting what he regarded as Ainsworth's misconceptions about practice in the Presbyterian church. However, his key argument was that such an issue was [[Adiaphora|adiaphorous]], or at least no grounds for separation and withdrawal of communion:\n\n<blockquote>that the saying of this prayer by rote even in the worst sense without feeling and understanding could be no warrant for the people to separate from us, though it should be our sin so to use it.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n37/mode/2up ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', p. 67.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nAinsworth and Baker were proponents of a [[Congregationalist polity]] that Paget firmly rejected in favour of the [[Presbyterian polity]] existing in the Netherlands and Scotland. They had broken with Johnson over Ainsworth's contention that authority rested in the whole congregation, not just the elders,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n302/mode/2up Steven, p. 270.]</ref> as well as separating themselves from Paget's congregation and from the Church of England. Paget was vituperative in his assault on separatism, taking Ainsworth to task for his allegedly patchy record.\n\n<blockquote>Let it be well observed that you are thus noted to have turned your coate & changed your religion five severall times, namely, first being of our religion and a member of the church of England you forsook that Church and separated: Secondly that being separated, you did againe in London being in the h\u00e3ds of authoritie yeeld to joyne with the worship and ministery of the Church of England: Thirdly, that after this you did againe slide back vnto the separation and renounce the Church of England: Fourthly, that after this when you were in Ireland and in some danger of punishment for your scandal, you did againe returne vnto the communion renounced by you, whether fainedly or vnfainedly, I leave vnto your self to consider: Fiftly, after this you change your profession againe and fall back vnto separation, and stick now presently in this Schisme: and thus whiles by this often revolting you dishonour and disable your self and your ministery...<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n49/mode/2up ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', p. 91-2.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1621 [[John Forbes (died 1634)|John Forbes]], the Scottish pastor at [[Delft]], obtained permission from the Dutch authorities to set up an English classis or presbytery for the Netherlands.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n301/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p. 270.]</ref> Paget opposed the establishment of the classis and refused to have anything to do with it. He obtained the backing of the Amsterdam Dutch Reformed classis and of the [[North Holland]] synod for his stance \u2013 support which the Dutch institutions maintained despite direct personal approaches from Forbes and his circle. The first reason Paget gave for keeping his distance related to theological and ecclesiological differences:\n\n<blockquote>the Ministers of England which come over hither are of severall & inconsistent opinions differing from one another & from all reformed churches, as expressely that some are Brownists, some Brownistically affected in particular opinions, as 1. in allowing private men to preach, 2. In denying formes of praier, 3. In admitting Brownists to their Congregations...</blockquote>\n\nHis other major reason was practical: he considered the geographical dispersion of the English congregations made the operation of a separate classis unworkable, as the regular meetings required for effective supervision would be impossible. This was a problem, he maintained, that had already vitiated the operation of a French or [[Walloons|Walloon]] classis.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n301/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p. 271.]</ref>\nThe 1630s saw a considerable shift in the political situation and the nature of the theological opposition to Paget. In 1631 members of his own congregation tried to bring in [[Thomas Hooker]] as an assistant pastor, and in 1634 the preferred candidate was [[John Davenport (minister)|John Davenport]].<ref name=odnb/> These were proponents of a Congregationalist tendency, associated with the teachings of [[William Ames]] and [[Henry Jacob]], that was not separatist, although Paget regarded it as semi-separatist.\n[[File:Reverend John Davenport by the Davenport Limner 1670.jpeg|thumb|Portrait of John Davenport in old age, 1670. [[Yale University Art Gallery]]]]\n\nSir [[William Boswell]] arrived as English ambassador to the Netherlands in 1632<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyoft00raymrich#page/68/mode/2up Davies, p. 69-70.]</ref> both complicating the situation and reinforcing the resistance to separatism. Initially he intervened to warn the Dutch authorities against prohibiting the use of the Prayer Book by [[Stephen Goffe]], now chaplain to Vere's regiment, and engineered the removal of Forbes from his post at Delft,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n326/mode/2up Steven, p. 294.]</ref> replacing him with a [[Laudian]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyoft00raymrich#page/70/mode/2up Davies, p. 71.]</ref> However, Goffe fed Boswell information about the activities of Davenport and he was in turn strongly influenced by Paget, who wanted good relations with Boswell, in his estimate of the situation. The issues and alliances were set out in a letter from Goffe at Leiden, probably dated 28 February 1634.\n\n<blockquote>I hope you have receaved a lettre from Amsterdam on Sunday w<sup>ch</sup> did acquaint you with the comming of m<sup>r</sup> vnto you, & the cause of it. And by this time m<sup>r</sup> Damport appearing to you hath shewed the truth of it. Since that m<sup>r</sup> Pagett hath given me another relacion w<sup>ch</sup> with his most humble service he desired me to make knowne vnto yowr selfe: vnto whom he desires to approve himselfe, and give account of his actions. After that in many discourses with m<sup>r</sup> Damport He had found his difference from him in the poynt of Baptisme, w<sup>ch</sup> is not only a matter of judgement but practice both ministers joyning in baptizing every child according to the Dutch custome ((1) one reading the forme, & explicacion of it. and the other sprinkling the water with those words In the name &c.) He told him that it was necessary for him to admitt all the infants w<sup>ch</sup> were brought, as he & the Dutch alwaies vse to do, or els they could not be fitt colleges in that pastorall charge. Herevpon Damport & his frends made the first cry, complained to the Dutch ministers, obtained of two of them, to come vnto m<sup>r</sup> Pagett, to reprehend him for his difficulty in admitting so reverend a College &c.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n309/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.278-9.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 9 March Goffe wrote to update Boswell on proceedings in the Amsterdam classis, relying on information from John Paget's kinsman,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n311/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.281.]</ref> perhaps Robert Paget. Paget was willing to recognise Davenport as his assistant only on his own terms, which presumably included continuing [[infant baptism]]. Davenport himself wrote to Boswell, asserting his personal loyalty to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his entirely peaceable intentions.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n313/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.282-4.]</ref> Goffe was soon writing of the outrage caused by the radical Calvinists' refusal of [[Eucharist|communion]] to men otherwise considered in good standing with their churches.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n315/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.284-5.]</ref>  Davenport denounced Paget as an \"unjust doer,\" tyrannical in government and corrupt in doctrine.<ref name = DNB/> However, [[Griffin Higgs]], the chaplain to Charles I's sister, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia]], commented: \"M<sup>r</sup>. Damport is still a Non-Conformist to the Dutch Church as well, as to the English.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n315/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.285.]</ref> The Dutch ecclesiastical authorities generally took, or were induced to take, Paget's side and he saw off all challengers. In 1635 he concluded hostilities with ''An Answer to the Unjust Complaints'', a broadside against Davenport and [[William Best (Puritan)|William Best]], who in reality was a cipher for [[John Canne]], a separatist who had migrated to Amsterdam some years earlier.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/earlyenglishdiss01burr_0#page/178/mode/2up Burrage, volume 1, p. 178]</ref>\n\n===Contacts and alliances===\n[[Image:Gerard van Honthorst 007.jpeg|thumb|left|Elizabeth of Bohemia, painted in 1642 by [[Gerard van Honthorst]]]]\nAlthough a combative and sometimes bitter controversialist, Paget had a wide range of contacts, political and scholarly. Despite his nonconformist status in England, he cultivated relations with the English and Scottish authorities where Protestant solidarity in the [[Thirty Years War]] was concerned. His contact with Boswell seems to have been cordial. He enjoyed the friendship of Elizabeth of Bohemia,<ref name=DNB/> an important figurehead in the wider European conflict and Briget Paget seems to have been especially close to Elizabeth.<ref name=odnb-briget/> One of Boswell's most important tasks was to promote Elizabeth's interests<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyoft00raymrich#page/70/mode/2up Davies, p. 70.]</ref> and Paget's relations with him seem to have been sustained. To reassure Boswell of his essential orthodoxy, he lent him a copy of his own service book, partly translated from the Dutch liturgy, signing off with the words: \"The God of heaven be with you & cover you with the shadow of his winges.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n317/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.286.]</ref>\n\n[[John Dury]], an [[Irenicism|eirenic]] Scottish Protestant minister, who had close contacts with the Jewish community, was another important contact. Evidently he was a guest preacher at the English Reformed Church, as Paget and his congregation wrote to him on  5 November 1634 to congratulate him on a recent sermon and to invite him again to Amsterdam.<ref>[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/hartlib/view?file=main/5D_52 Hartlib Papers, Ref: 5/52/1A-2B: 1B, 2A BLANK.]</ref> The invitation found its way into the papers of [[Samuel Hartlib]], a German scientist and polymath who had taken refuge in England from the [[Thirty Years War]]: an indication of the width of the intellectual circle in which Paget moved.\n\nAmsterdam had a substantial and growing Jewish community, the Sephardim alone numbering about 800 in 1626 and 1200 in 1655.<ref>Boxer, p. 144.</ref> Although they did not enjoy full civil rights until the following century, they were respected by leading Dutch Calvinist intellectuals like [[Hugo Grotius]], who consulted with Jewish scholars on the text of the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref>Boxer, p. 145.</ref> The English and Scottish exiles followed suit. Paget was described by Robert, his nephew and adopted son, as having\n\n<blockquote>rare skill in the languages that conduce unto the understanding of the originall text of the Scriptures; for he could to good purpose and with much ease make use of the [[Aramaic language|Chaldean]], [[Syriac language|Syriack]], [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinicall]], [[Talmud|Thalmudicall]], Arabick, and Persian versions and commentaries.<ref>Preface to ''Meditations of death'' (1639), quoted in [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownpar00hall#page/294/mode/2up Hall, p. 295.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe was part of a learned circle that included the much-maligned Ainsworth, [[Hugh Broughton]] and [[Matthew Slade]]. However, Paget was more cautious and conservative in adopting readings and interpretations from Jewish scholars than [[Philo-Semitic|philo-semitic]] interpreters like Ainsworth and Dury. His reservations were set out in ''An Admonition touching Talmudique allegations'', which was appended to ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes''. Here he made clear that one of his motivations in using Jewish sources was to employ them controversially against Judaism.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n173/mode/2up ''An Admonition'', p. 339.]</ref> The interest in Judaism, its Scripture and its intellectual traditions was spreading within Dutch Calvinist culture and Leiden University was at its centre. [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] had pioneered [[Semitic studies]] there and in 1625 the university press acquired an oriental section, with fonts for a range of [[Afroasiatic languages]], on the initiative of the [[House of Elzevir]].<ref>Boxer, p. 178.</ref> It was also the university most closely associated with overseas trade and expansion.<ref>Boxer, p. 176.</ref> Two of John Paget's nephews were sent to Leiden for their education: Robert in 1628 and Nathan in 1638.<ref name=peacock75/> In the quarter century 1626\u201350 Leiden drew 52% of its students from abroad.<ref>Boxer, p. 177.</ref>\n\nPaget continued to cultivate contacts in his native country and was often visited by English travellers. One of the most notable was [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet]], the future [[Roundhead]] commander, who visited the United Provinces in 1634 and reported:\n\n<blockquote>June 12.\u2014 After we had dined with Mr. Pageatt, where we had a neat dinner and strawberries, longest that I have seen, we went to a house called Dole-hoof, where we saw the pictures made in wax most liveyly...<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/travelsinhollan00hawkgoog#page/n72/mode/2up Brereton, p. 57.] ''Doolhoven'' or [[Labyrinth]]s were the centres of popular culture and entertainment in 17th century Amsterdam: cf.

Samuel Hartlib heard in July 1638 that Paget was recovering from an illness.<ref>[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/hartlib/view?file=main/11C_01_117 Hartlib Papers, Ref: 11/1/117A-B]</ref> However he died only about a month later, on 18 August 1638,<ref name=odnb/> probably in the vicinity of Amsterdam.<ref name=DNB/> [[Thomas Paget (c.1587\u20131660)|Thomas Paget]] (d. 1660), his brother, then served the English Church at Amsterdam, alongside [[Julines Herring]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n310/mode/2up Steven, p. 279.]</ref> until he returned to England in 1646 to become incumbent of [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]].\n\n==Marriage, family and legacy==\n{{chart top|text-align=left|John Paget and his relatives}}\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | |Rik|v|Liz| | | | |un| | | | |nic|v|dot|Rik=Richard Maisterson (died 1617) of [[Nantwich]]|Liz=Elizabeth Grosvenor (died 1627) of [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire]]|un=Parents unknown, probably of [[Rothley]], [[Leicestershire]]|nic=Nicholas Goldsmith (died 1616), [[Mercery|mercer]] of Nantwich|dot=Dorothy}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{familytree|John1|-|brig|v|John| |un|v|tom|v|marg| |ellen|v|rik|John1=John Thrushe|brig=[[Briget Paget|Briget Masterson]]|John='''John Paget''' (died 1638), Puritan clergyman and theologian||boxstyle_John= background-color: #cdc; |un=(2) Unknown|tom=[[Thomas Paget (c.1587\u20131660)|Thomas Paget]] (c.1587\u20131660), Puritan clergyman and controversialist|marg=(1) Margery Goldsmith (1588\u20131628)|ellen=Ellen Goldsmith (1583\u20131624)|rik=Richard Minshull (1575\u20131658)}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | |)|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | |bob| | | | | |tom1| | |!| | |ann|v|ran| |tom2|bob=Robert Paget, nephew and adopted son, Presbyterian minister and editor|tom1=Thomas Paget (born c.1638), clergyman and theologian.|ann=Anne Boote|ran=Randle Minshull (1605\u20131660)|tom2=Thomas Minshull (born 1613), apothecary of Manchester}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |!}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |liz2|-|nat| | | |liz4|-|mil|liz2=Elizabeth Cromwell (1614\u201365), cousin of [[Oliver Cromwell]]|nat=[[Nathan Paget]] (1615\u201379), physician|dot=Dorothy Paget|liz3=Elizabeth Paget|liz4=Elizabeth Minshull|mil=[[John Milton]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\nJohn Paget married [[Briget Paget|Briget Thrush]], n\u00e9e Masterson or Maisterson, on 8 February 1602 in St Mary's Church, Nantwich.<ref name=hall295/> The Mastersons were the oldest-established of Nantwich's wealthy merchant families.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownpar00hall#page/416/mode/2up Hall, p. 416.]</ref> The marriage was childless but they adopted as their heir Robert Paget, nephew of John and Thomas,<ref name=odnb/> who was minister at [[Dordrecht]] 1638-85.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n332/mode/2up Steven, p. 300.]</ref> After John Paget's death, Briget acted as his literary executor and moved to live with Robert at Dordrecht.<ref name=odnb-briget/> Together with Thomas and Nathan Paget, they transmitted John's intellectual legacy to later generations of Puritans and nonconformists.\n[[File:Defence Of Church-Government 01.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''A Defence Of Church-Government''.]]\n[[File:Synode te Dordtrecht.jpg|thumb|Synod of Dort, 1618. The [[Canons of Dort]] became a key definition of Calvinist orthodoxy.]]\nBriget and Robert first issued John's ''Meditations of Death'' in 1639, with a preface over Robert's name. Briget wrote the dedication, which was to Elizabeth of Bohemia. Next, in 1641, came John's ''Defence of Church-government'', a detailed exposition and defence of the Presbyterian polity as he had practised and experienced it in Amsterdam. The preface, again credited to Robert Paget, situated the work within John Paget's controversies with the Amsterdam separatists.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n29/mode/2up ''The Publisher to the Christian Reader''.]</ref> Robert's concluding peroration began with the words: \"Farewell from Dort: Where a most pregnant & effectuall testimonie hath been given, for the needfull authority of Synods.\" This reference to the [[Synod of Dort]] placed Paget's work within the mainstream Calvinist tradition by harking back to the past. By this time Charles I's attempts to impose the Prayer Book on an unwilling Scotland had led to the [[Bishops' Wars]] and the bankrupting of his attempt at [[absolute monarchy]], forcing him to fall back on Parliament. Thomas Paget, closely following developments in England, re-purposed his brother's book as a political intervention. A Puritan petition from Cheshire to the [[Long Parliament]] had proposed the abolition of bishops, [[canon law]], the Prayer Book, and the Thirty-Nine Articles,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/n29/mode/2up Urwick, p. xiv.]</ref> provoking a concerted response from royalists headed by [[Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet]]. Their petition supported [[episcopacy]] and denounced all Puritans as \"Schismatiques and Separatists.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/n29/mode/2up Urwick, p. xv-xvi.]</ref> Aston published alongside it a collection of documents under the title ''A Remonstrance Against Presbytery''. Thomas Paget decided to present his brother's book to Parliament, adding by way of dedication a \"Humble Advertisment\" [sic], which explained the history of nonconformity in the [[Diocese of Chester]] and highlighted his own sufferings for the cause,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n9/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''Humble Advertisment'' p. 4ff.]</ref> as well as distinguishing Presbyterianism from more radical Puritan tendencies. Drawing on their Dutch experience, he pointed out that \"The United Netherlands doe finde by experience that Presbytery is no way to conducible to Anarchie.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n23/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''Humble Advertisment'' p. 18.]</ref>\n\nThomas was later to return to England to serve as a minister under the [[Commonwealth of England]] and [[the Protectorate]]. [[Nathan Paget]], his son and John's nephew, had already returned to pursue his career as a physician and lived in London throughout the [[English Civil War]]. He sustained the contacts with [[polyglot]] and [[polymath]] circles and the interest in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] he had acquired from his uncle. He married Elizabeth Cromwell, cousin of [[Oliver Cromwell]], and became a close friend of [[John Milton]], sharing his interest in radical political and religious ideas.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=21117|title=Paget, Nathan|first=Peter|last=Elmer}}</ref> A distinguished member of the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], his career was affected little if at all by the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]].\n\n==Works==\nJohn Paget's works comprise:\n\n*{{Citation  | last =Paget  | first =John  | year = 1601 | title =A Primary of the Christian Religion  | place =London  | publisher =  | series =  | volume =  | origyear =   | edition =  | chapter =  | chapterurl = | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url =  | archiveurl =  | archivedate =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =}}\n* {{Citation  | last =Paget  | first =John   | year =1618 | title =An arrovv against the separation of the Brownists.

He was a steadfast defender of [[Presbyterianism]] and orthodox [[Calvinism]] in numerous controversies with English exiles in the [[Dutch Republic]].\n\n==Origins==\nJohn Paget seems to have been descended from the Paget family of [[Rothley]], which is on the edge of [[Charnwood Forest]] in [[Leicestershire]].<ref name=hall295>[https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownpar00hall#page/294/mode/2up Hall, p. 295.]</ref><ref name=odnb>{{cite ODNB|id=21114|title=Paget, John|first=Keith L.|last=Sprunger}}</ref> He and [[Thomas Paget (c.1587\u20131660)|Thomas Paget]], his younger brother and fellow Puritan minister, were possibly born there or elsewhere in the county. His nephew and adopted son, Robert Paget, described himself as, ''Licestrensis'', \"a Leicestershire man\",<ref name=peacock75>[https://archive.org/stream/indextoenglishs00peacgoog#page/n84/mode/2up Peacock, p. 75.]</ref> on registration at [[Leiden University]] in 1628, suggesting that John and Thomas Paget had at least one brother who continued to live in the county. The [[vicar]] of Rothley in 1564 was Harold Paget<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ahistoryancient05bookgoog#page/n88/mode/2up Booker, p.66.]</ref> and the family's connection with the village was long-lasting: a memorial window to family members was dedicated in the [[parish church]] in 1897.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leicestershirevillages.com/rothley/the-paget-memorial-window.html |title=The Paget Memorial Window|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website= Leicestershire Villages |publisher= |access-date=22 September 2015 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nJohn Paget entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] as a [[sizar]], a scholar receiving some support, probably in 1592,<ref>{{acad|id=PGT592J|name=Paget, John}}</ref><ref>{{VennAC |name=Paget, Thomas |part=1 |volume=3 |page=295}}</ref> suggesting a birth date around 1574. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1595, and proceeded [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] in 1598.\n\n==Early career==\n===Rector of Nantwich===\n[[File:St Marys, Nantwich.jpg|thumb|left|[[St Mary's Church, Nantwich]], where Paget was incumbent at the beginning of his career. The church building was restored in the 19th century.]]\n[[File:Nantwich parish church - Ormerod.jpg|thumb|Print of St Mary's Church, Nantwich, before the 19th century restoration.]]\n[[File:Sir Horace Vere - Horatius Veer (1565-1635).jpg|thumb|Sir Horace Vere by [[Michiel Jansz. van Mierevelt]]]]\n\nPaget related in a ''An Answer to the Unjust Complaints'', a polemical work, that his \"ardent affection\" or inner compulsion to preach manifested itself at an early age. By 1598, the year of his MA, he had already been appointed [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Nantwich]] in [[Cheshire]].<ref name=odnb/> [[James Hall (historian)|James Hall]], a distinguished Victorian historian of the town, implies Paget first appeared in the town as a preacher under the previous incumbent, William Holford.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownpar00hall#page/294/mode/2up Hall, p. 294.]</ref> In 1601 he had his first book published in London: ''A Primer of Christian Religion, or a forme of Catechising, drawne from the beholding of Gods works''.<ref name=hall295/> In 1602 he married [[Briget Paget|Briget]] or Bridget the daughter of Richard Masterson and widow of George or John Thrushe.\n\nPaget's Puritan principles must have been well-established by this time. The Puritan perspective was put forward to [[James I of England|James I]] soon after his succession in the [[Millenary Petition]], which prompted him to set up the [[Hampton Court Conference]] of 1604. The response of [[Richard Bancroft]], the new [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was a book of canons, later rejected by Parliament, which demanded conformity to the disciplines, not just the teachings, of the [[Church of England]]. Twelve Cheshire clergy refused to subscribe to the canons and some were  imprisoned or fled to the [[Dutch Republic]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/n23/mode/2up Urwick, p. viii.]</ref> Paget's nonconformity forced him to leave Nantwich.<ref name=hall295/> In 1605 he went to the Netherlands.\n\n===Military chaplain===\nPaget's migration from England took him into a war zone, as the Dutch were in the midst of the [[Eighty Years' War]] to secure their independence from Spain. It also took him into Dutch employment, although initially under English direction. For two years Paget was chaplain to the English troops fighting under Sir John Ogle and [[Horace Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury|Sir Horace Vere]].<ref name=odnb/> Ogle commanded one of four units<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028310294#page/n413/mode/2up Markham, p.364]</ref> and was second-in-command of the whole force, while Vere commanded another and had overall leadership of the English contingents, which since 1598 had been paid by the Dutch and formed part of the Dutch army.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=20611|title=Ogle, Sir John|first=D.

In the later [[King James Version]] it runs: \"Create in me a clean heart, O God,\" words that were later inscribed on the wall of the sanctuary.<ref name=odnb/> On 29 April he was formally admitted to office. The ceremony was performed by John Douglas, chaplain to the Scottish force stationed at [[Utrecht]],<ref name=steven273>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n304/mode/2up Steven, p. 273.]</ref> which had fought alongside the English contingents at M\u00fclheim.\n\nPaget's church was entirely separate from the fissile and quarrelsome English [[Calvinist]] community that had existed in Amsterdam for some years, which was [[Henry Barrowe|Barrowist]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/earlyenglishdiss01burr_0#page/154/mode/2up Burrage, volume 1, p. 155-61.]</ref> or [[Brownist]]<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n300/mode/2up Steven, p. 269-70.]</ref> in orientation: committed to separation from the [[Church of England]]. From about 1600 its pastor was [[Francis Johnson (Brownist)|Francis Johnson]], whose assistant was [[Henry Ainsworth]]. Paget was from the outset concerned to distinguish his congregation from these as the \"English Orthodoxicall church.\"<ref name=odnb/> On the other hand, he rejected any use of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] and [[Anglican]] ritual. He was committed to the Amsterdam [[Classis (ecclesiastical)|classis]] and the [[Presbyterian polity]] for which it stood. The church was English in language rather than ethnicity: an English-language branch of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], with affinities to the [[Church of Scotland]], although it was not formally affiliated to it until the following century.<ref name=ercadam/>\n\n===Prosperity===\n[[File:Emanuel de Witte - De binnenplaats van de beurs te Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Courtyard of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] by [[Emanuel de Witte]], 1653.]]\nPaget seems to have prospered in his new post. His stipend from the Dutch church was a substantial 150 florins.<ref name=DNB/> His wife Briget certainly joined him in Amsterdam, if she had not before, and they owned at least two houses: this is known because Briget's sale of them was recorded in 1647, almost a decade after Paget's death.<ref name=odnb-briget>{{cite ODNB|id=68076|title=Paget, Briget|first=Kate|last=Aughterson}}</ref>\n\nThe Pagets built up sufficient wealth to buy shares in the [[Dutch West India Company]].<ref name=odnb/> This was launched with the authorization of the [[States General of the Netherlands]] in 1621, in response to the ending of the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] (1609\u201321) between the Dutch Republic and Spain. The new turn in foreign policy was the work of a coalition of powerful Amsterdam merchants, the [[Counter-remonstrant]]s or extreme [[Calvinists]] and [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]] which had overthrown the architect of the truce, [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]].<ref>Boxer, p. 27-8.</ref> The Pagets' investment represented a political and religious as well as financial commitment. The West India Company was intended from the outset to strike at the economic power of Catholic Spain and Portugal.<ref name=\"Boxer, p. 54\">Boxer, p. 54.</ref> However, its military commitments made it less profitable than its revenues from plantation slavery and sugar seemed to promise. There was the bonanza of a 75% dividend for the year 1629\u201330, following the capture of the Mexican silver fleet. This must have been a boon to the Pagets, as it was in 1631<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/ahistoryancient05bookgoog#page/n88/mode/2up Booker, p.67.]</ref> that they faced the arrival of Thomas Paget, former incumbent of [[Blackley]] Chapel, and his family as refugees from England. However, it was more or less the end of profitability and the fortunes of the Company were dogged by internal divisions between different religious and regional factions during the 1630s.<ref name=\"Boxer, p. 54\"/>\n\n===Controversies and conflicts===\nPaget was very careful to keep his congregation distinct from other English-speaking congregations, both in Amsterdam and in the Netherlands more generally.<ref name=odnb/> Within a year of his taking up his post, possibly earlier, there was an English [[Baptist]] group, centred on [[John Smyth (Baptist minister)|John Smyth]], in Amsterdam alongside his own and Johnson's congregations.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/earlyenglishdiss01burr_0#page/32/mode/2up Burrage, volume 1, p. 32.]</ref> Paget's aloofness can only have been reinforced by the internal divisions and the later confusions as the remnants of this group fused with the Dutch [[Mennonite]]s known as Waterlanders after Smyth's death.<ref>These problems are documented in [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n203/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p. 177-259.]</ref> He resolutely opposed what he regarded as [[schism]]atics of every kind. This included the more radical Calvinists. Key issues included formal prayer and an ordained ministry, which were rejected by [[Henry Ainsworth]], Thomas Baker and other Brownist-influenced leaders, as Paget noted in his 1618 riposte, ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', the occasion for which he claimed was:\n\n<blockquote>a certaine mayde who pretendeth that she is troubled to ioyne with our Church because of the use of the [[Lord's Prayer|Lords prayer]] among us; because of my calling unto this Church, whereof I am a Minister, which calling he (Baker) tells her is unlawfull; & because there is no difference betwixt us and the Church of England...<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n1/mode/2up ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', p. 1b.] Note that this part of the publication has numbered leaves, not pages: this is on the second page of the first leaf.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPaget dealt with issue of formal prayer, specifically the Lord's Prayer, in Chapter 2 of the ''Arrow'', rebutting what he regarded as Ainsworth's misconceptions about practice in the Presbyterian church. However, his key argument was that such an issue was [[Adiaphora|adiaphorous]], or at least no grounds for separation and withdrawal of communion:\n\n<blockquote>that the saying of this prayer by rote even in the worst sense without feeling and understanding could be no warrant for the people to separate from us, though it should be our sin so to use it.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n37/mode/2up ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', p. 67.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nAinsworth and Baker were proponents of a [[Congregationalist polity]] that Paget firmly rejected in favour of the [[Presbyterian polity]] existing in the Netherlands and Scotland. They had broken with Johnson over Ainsworth's contention that authority rested in the whole congregation, not just the elders,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n302/mode/2up Steven, p. 270.]</ref> as well as separating themselves from Paget's congregation and from the Church of England. Paget was vituperative in his assault on separatism, taking Ainsworth to task for his allegedly patchy record.\n\n<blockquote>Let it be well observed that you are thus noted to have turned your coate & changed your religion five severall times, namely, first being of our religion and a member of the church of England you forsook that Church and separated: Secondly that being separated, you did againe in London being in the h\u00e3ds of authoritie yeeld to joyne with the worship and ministery of the Church of England: Thirdly, that after this you did againe slide back vnto the separation and renounce the Church of England: Fourthly, that after this when you were in Ireland and in some danger of punishment for your scandal, you did againe returne vnto the communion renounced by you, whether fainedly or vnfainedly, I leave vnto your self to consider: Fiftly, after this you change your profession againe and fall back vnto separation, and stick now presently in this Schisme: and thus whiles by this often revolting you dishonour and disable your self and your ministery...<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n49/mode/2up ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes'', p. 91-2.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1621 [[John Forbes (died 1634)|John Forbes]], the Scottish pastor at [[Delft]], obtained permission from the Dutch authorities to set up an English classis or presbytery for the Netherlands.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n301/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p. 270.]</ref> Paget opposed the establishment of the classis and refused to have anything to do with it. He obtained the backing of the Amsterdam Dutch Reformed classis and of the [[North Holland]] synod for his stance \u2013 support which the Dutch institutions maintained despite direct personal approaches from Forbes and his circle. The first reason Paget gave for keeping his distance related to theological and ecclesiological differences:\n\n<blockquote>the Ministers of England which come over hither are of severall & inconsistent opinions differing from one another & from all reformed churches, as expressely that some are Brownists, some Brownistically affected in particular opinions, as 1. in allowing private men to preach, 2. In denying formes of praier, 3. In admitting Brownists to their Congregations...</blockquote>\n\nHis other major reason was practical: he considered the geographical dispersion of the English congregations made the operation of a separate classis unworkable, as the regular meetings required for effective supervision would be impossible. This was a problem, he maintained, had already vitiated the operation of a French or [[Walloons|Walloon]] classis.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n301/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p. 271.]</ref>\nThe 1630s saw a considerable shift in the political situation and the nature of the theological opposition to Paget. In 1631 members of his own congregation tried to bring in [[Thomas Hooker]] as an assistant pastor, and in 1634 the preferred candidate was [[John Davenport (minister)|John Davenport]].<ref name=odnb/> These were proponents of a Congregationalist tendency, associated with the teachings of [[William Ames]] and [[Henry Jacob]], that was not separatist, although Paget regarded it as semi-separatist.\n[[File:Reverend John Davenport by the Davenport Limner 1670.jpeg|thumb|Portrait of John Davenport in old age, 1670. [[Yale University Art Gallery]]]]\n\nSir [[William Boswell]] arrived as English ambassador to the Netherlands in 1632<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyoft00raymrich#page/68/mode/2up Davies, p. 69-70.]</ref> both complicating the situation and reinforcing the resistance to separatism. Initially he intervened to warn the Dutch authorities against prohibiting the use of the Prayer Book by [[Stephen Goffe]], now chaplain to Vere's regiment, and engineered the removal of Forbes from his post at Delft,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n326/mode/2up Steven, p. 294.]</ref> replacing him with a [[Laudian]].<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyoft00raymrich#page/70/mode/2up Davies, p. 71.]</ref> However, Goffe fed Boswell information about the activities of Davenport and he was in turn strongly influenced by Paget, who wanted good relations with Boswell, in his estimate of the situation. The issues and alliances were set out in a letter from Goffe at Leiden, probably dated 28 February 1634.\n\n<blockquote>I hope you have receaved a lettre from Amsterdam on Sunday w<sup>ch</sup> did acquaint you with the comming of m<sup>r</sup> vnto you, & the cause of it. And by this time m<sup>r</sup> Damport appearing to you hath shewed the truth of it. Since that m<sup>r</sup> Pagett hath given me another relacion w<sup>ch</sup> with his most humble service he desired me to make knowne vnto yowr selfe: vnto whom he desires to approve himselfe, and give account of his actions.

He told him that it was necessary for him to admitt all the infants w<sup>ch</sup> were brought, as he & the Dutch alwaies vse to do, or els they could not be fitt colleges in that pastorall charge. Herevpon Damport & his frends made the first cry, complained to the Dutch ministers, obtained of two of them, to come vnto m<sup>r</sup> Pagett, to reprehend him for his difficulty in admitting so reverend a College &c.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n309/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.278-9.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 9 March Goffe wrote to update Boswell on proceedings in the Amsterdam classis, relying on information from John Paget's kinsman,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n311/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.281.]</ref> perhaps Robert Paget. Paget was willing to recognise Davenport as his assistant only on his own terms, which presumably included continuing [[infant baptism]]. Davenport himself wrote to Boswell, asserting his personal loyalty to [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his entirely peaceable intentions.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n313/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.282-4.]</ref> Goffe was soon writing of the outrage caused by the radical Calvinists' refusal of [[Eucharist|communion]] to men otherwise considered in good standing with their churches.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n315/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.284-5.]</ref>  Davenport denounced Paget as an \"unjust doer,\" tyrannical in government and corrupt in doctrine.<ref name = DNB/> However, [[Griffin Higgs]], the chaplain to Charles I's sister, [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia]], commented: \"M<sup>r</sup>. Damport is still a Non-Conformist to the Dutch Church as well, as to the English.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n315/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.285.]</ref> The Dutch ecclesiastical authorities generally took, or were induced to take, Paget's side and he saw off all challengers. In 1635 he concluded hostilities with ''An Answer to the Unjust Complaints'', a broadside against Davenport and [[William Best (Puritan)|William Best]], who in reality was a cipher for [[John Canne]], a separatist who had migrated to Amsterdam some years earlier.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/earlyenglishdiss01burr_0#page/178/mode/2up Burrage, volume 1, p. 178]</ref>\n\n===Contacts and alliances===\n[[Image:Gerard van Honthorst 007.jpeg|thumb|left|Elizabeth of Bohemia, painted in 1642 by [[Gerard van Honthorst]]]]\nAlthough a combative and sometimes bitter controversialist, Paget had a wide range of contacts, political and scholarly. Despite his nonconformist status in England, he cultivated relations with the English and Scottish authorities where Protestant solidarity in the [[Thirty Years War]] was concerned. His contact with Boswell seems to have been cordial. He enjoyed the friendship of Elizabeth of Bohemia,<ref name=DNB/> an important figurehead in the wider European conflict and Briget Paget seems to have been especially close to Elizabeth.<ref name=odnb-briget/> One of Boswell's most important tasks was to promote Elizabeth's interests<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographyoft00raymrich#page/70/mode/2up Davies, p. 70.]</ref> and Paget's relations with him seem to have been sustained. To reassure Boswell of his essential orthodoxy, he lent him a copy of his own service book, partly translated from the Dutch liturgy, signing off with the words: \"The God of heaven be with you & cover you with the shadow of his winges.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924092457500#page/n317/mode/2up Burrage, volume 2, p.286.]</ref>\n\n[[John Dury]], an [[Irenicism|eirenic]] Scottish Protestant minister, who had close contacts with the Jewish community, was another important contact. Evidently he was a guest preacher at the English Reformed Church, as Paget and his congregation wrote to him on  5 November 1634 to congratulate him on a recent sermon and to invite him again to Amsterdam.<ref>[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/hartlib/view?file=main/5D_52 Hartlib Papers, Ref: 5/52/1A-2B: 1B, 2A BLANK.]</ref> The invitation found its way into the papers of [[Samuel Hartlib]], a German scientist and polymath who had taken refuge in England from the [[Thirty Years War]]: an indication of the width of the intellectual circle in which Paget moved.\n\nAmsterdam had a substantial and growing Jewish community, the Sephardim alone numbering about 800 in 1626 and 1200 in 1655.<ref>Boxer, p. 144.</ref> Although they did not enjoy full civil rights until the following century, they were respected by leading Dutch Calvinist intellectuals like [[Hugo Grotius]], who consulted with Jewish scholars on the text of the [[Hebrew Bible]].<ref>Boxer, p. 145.</ref> The English and Scottish exiles followed suit. Paget was described by Robert, his nephew and adopted son, as having\n\n<blockquote>rare skill in the languages that conduce unto the understanding of the originall text of the Scriptures; for he could to good purpose and with much ease make use of the [[Aramaic language|Chaldean]], [[Syriac language|Syriack]], [[Rabbinic literature|Rabbinicall]], [[Talmud|Thalmudicall]], Arabick, and Persian versions and commentaries.<ref>Preface to ''Meditations of death'' (1639), quoted in [https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownpar00hall#page/294/mode/2up Hall, p. 295.]</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe was part of a learned circle that included the much-maligned Ainsworth, [[Hugh Broughton]] and [[Matthew Slade]]. However, Paget was more cautious and conservative in adopting readings and interpretations from Jewish scholars than [[Philo-Semitic|philo-semitic]] interpreters like Ainsworth and Dury. His reservations were set out in ''An Admonition touching Talmudique allegations'', which was appended to ''An Arrow Against the Separation of the Brownistes''. Here he made clear that one of his motivations in using Jewish sources was to employ them controversially against Judaism.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/arrovvagainstsep00page#page/n173/mode/2up ''An Admonition'', p. 339.]</ref> The interest in Judaism, its Scripture and its intellectual traditions was spreading within Dutch Calvinist culture and Leiden University was at its centre. [[Joseph Justus Scaliger]] had pioneered [[Semitic studies]] there and in 1625 the university press acquired an oriental section, with fonts for a range of [[Afroasiatic languages]], on the initiative of the [[House of Elzevir]].<ref>Boxer, p. 178.</ref> It was also the university most closely associated with overseas trade and expansion.<ref>Boxer, p. 176.</ref> Two of John Paget's nephews were sent to Leiden for their education: Robert in 1628 and Nathan in 1638.<ref name=peacock75/> In the quarter century 1626\u201350 Leiden drew 52% of its students from abroad.<ref>Boxer, p. 177.</ref>\n\nPaget continued to cultivate contacts in his native country and was often visited by English travellers. One of the most notable was [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet]], the future [[Roundhead]] commander, who visited the United Provinces in 1634 and reported:\n\n<blockquote>June 12.\u2014 After we had dined with Mr. Pageatt, where we had a neat dinner and strawberries, longest that I have seen, we went to a house called Dole-hoof, where we saw the pictures made in wax most liveyly...<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/travelsinhollan00hawkgoog#page/n72/mode/2up Brereton, p. 57.] ''Doolhoven'' or [[Labyrinth]]s were the centres of popular culture and entertainment in 17th century Amsterdam: cf.

Samuel Hartlib heard in July 1638 that Paget was recovering from an illness.<ref>[http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/hartlib/view?file=main/11C_01_117 Hartlib Papers, Ref: 11/1/117A-B]</ref> However he died only about a month later, on 18 August 1638,<ref name=odnb/> probably in the vicinity of Amsterdam.<ref name=DNB/> [[Thomas Paget (c.1587\u20131660)|Thomas Paget]] (d. 1660), his brother, then served the English Church at Amsterdam, alongside [[Julines Herring]],<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n310/mode/2up Steven, p. 279.]</ref> until he returned to England in 1646 to become incumbent of [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]].\n\n==Marriage, family and legacy==\n{{chart top|text-align=left|John Paget and his relatives}}\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | |Rik|v|Liz| | | | |un| | | | |nic|v|dot|Rik=Richard Maisterson (died 1617) of [[Nantwich]]|Liz=Elizabeth Grosvenor (died 1627) of [[Eaton Hall, Cheshire]]|un=Parents unknown, probably of [[Rothley]], [[Leicestershire]]|nic=Nicholas Goldsmith (died 1616), [[Mercery|mercer]] of Nantwich|dot=Dorothy}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{familytree|John1|-|brig|v|John| |un|v|tom|v|marg| |ellen|v|rik|John1=John Thrushe|brig=[[Briget Paget|Briget Masterson]]|John='''John Paget''' (died 1638), Puritan clergyman and theologian||boxstyle_John= background-color: #cdc; |un=(2) Unknown|tom=[[Thomas Paget (c.1587\u20131660)|Thomas Paget]] (c.1587\u20131660), Puritan clergyman and controversialist|marg=(1) Margery Goldsmith (1588\u20131628)|ellen=Ellen Goldsmith (1583\u20131624)|rik=Richard Minshull (1575\u20131658)}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | |)|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | |bob| | | | | |tom1| | |!| | |ann|v|ran| |tom2|bob=Robert Paget, nephew and adopted son, Presbyterian minister and editor|tom1=Thomas Paget (born c.1638), clergyman and theologian.|ann=Anne Boote|ran=Randle Minshull (1605\u20131660)|tom2=Thomas Minshull (born 1613), apothecary of Manchester}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |!}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |liz2|-|nat| | | |liz4|-|mil|liz2=Elizabeth Cromwell (1614\u201365), cousin of [[Oliver Cromwell]]|nat=[[Nathan Paget]] (1615\u201379), physician|dot=Dorothy Paget|liz3=Elizabeth Paget|liz4=Elizabeth Minshull|mil=[[John Milton]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\nJohn Paget married [[Briget Paget|Briget Thrush]], n\u00e9e Masterson or Maisterson, on 8 February 1602 in St Mary's Church, Nantwich.<ref name=hall295/> The Mastersons were the oldest-established of Nantwich's wealthy merchant families.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyoftownpar00hall#page/416/mode/2up Hall, p. 416.]</ref> The marriage was childless but they adopted as their heir Robert Paget, nephew of John and Thomas,<ref name=odnb/> who was minister at [[Dordrecht]] 1638-85.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyscottish00stevgoog#page/n332/mode/2up Steven, p. 300.]</ref> After John Paget's death, Briget acted as his literary executor and moved to live with Robert at Dordrecht.<ref name=odnb-briget/> Together with Thomas and Nathan Paget, they transmitted John's intellectual legacy to later generations of Puritans and nonconformists.\n[[File:Defence Of Church-Government 01.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of ''A Defence Of Church-Government''.]]\n[[File:Synode te Dordtrecht.jpg|thumb|Synod of Dort, 1618. The [[Canons of Dort]] became a key definition of Calvinist orthodoxy.]]\nBriget and Robert first issued John's ''Meditations of Death'' in 1639, with a preface over Robert's name. Briget wrote the dedication, which was to Elizabeth of Bohemia. Next, in 1641, came John's ''Defence of Church-government'', a detailed exposition and defence of the Presbyterian polity as he had practised and experienced it in Amsterdam. The preface, again credited to Robert Paget, situated the work within John Paget's controversies with the Amsterdam separatists.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n29/mode/2up ''The Publisher to the Christian Reader''.]</ref> Robert's concluding peroration began with the words: \"Farewell from Dort: Where a most pregnant & effectuall testimonie hath been given, for the needfull authority of Synods.\" This reference to the [[Synod of Dort]] placed Paget's work within the mainstream Calvinist tradition by harking back to the past. By this time Charles I's attempts to impose the Prayer Book on an unwilling Scotland had led to the [[Bishops' Wars]] and the bankrupting of his attempt at [[absolute monarchy]], forcing him to fall back on Parliament. Thomas Paget, closely following developments in England, re-purposed his brother's book as a political intervention. A Puritan petition from Cheshire to the [[Long Parliament]] had proposed the abolition of bishops, [[canon law]], the Prayer Book, and the Thirty-Nine Articles,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/n29/mode/2up Urwick, p. xiv.]</ref> provoking a concerted response from royalists headed by [[Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet]]. Their petition supported [[episcopacy]] and denounced all Puritans as \"Schismatiques and Separatists.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historicalsketch00urwi#page/n29/mode/2up Urwick, p. xv-xvi.]</ref> Aston published alongside it a collection of documents under the title ''A Remonstrance Against Presbytery''. Thomas Paget decided to present his brother's book to Parliament, adding by way of dedication a \"Humble Advertisment\" [sic], which explained the history of nonconformity in the [[Diocese of Chester]] and highlighted his own sufferings for the cause,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n9/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''Humble Advertisment'' p. 4ff.]</ref> as well as distinguishing Presbyterianism from more radical Puritan tendencies. Drawing on their Dutch experience, he pointed out that \"The United Netherlands doe finde by experience that Presbytery is no way to conducible to Anarchie.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/defenceofchurchg00page#page/n23/mode/2up Thomas Paget, ''Humble Advertisment'' p. 18.]</ref>\n\nThomas was later to return to England to serve as a minister under the [[Commonwealth of England]] and [[the Protectorate]]. [[Nathan Paget]], his son and John's nephew, had already returned to pursue his career as a physician and lived in London throughout the [[English Civil War]]. He sustained the contacts with [[polyglot]] and [[polymath]] circles and the interest in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] he had acquired from his uncle. He married Elizabeth Cromwell, cousin of [[Oliver Cromwell]], and became a close friend of [[John Milton]], sharing his interest in radical political and religious ideas.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=21117|title=Paget, Nathan|first=Peter|last=Elmer}}</ref> A distinguished member of the [[Royal College of Physicians|College of Physicians]], his career was affected little if at all by the [[Restoration (1660)|Restoration]].\n\n==Works==\nJohn Paget's works comprise:\n\n*{{Citation  | last =Paget  | first =John  | year = 1601 | title =A Primary of the Christian Religion  | place =London  | publisher =  | series =  | volume =  | origyear =   | edition =  | chapter =  | chapterurl = | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url =  | archiveurl =  | archivedate =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =}}\n* {{Citation  | last =Paget  | first =John   | year =1618 | title =An arrovv against the separation of the Brownists.

The war broke out in April 1992.\n\nMuslim countries came to support the Bosnian Muslims and an independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. Support came from Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other Muslim countries. There were also Islamist organizations and Muslim non-profit organizations and charitable trusts that supported the Bosnian Muslims.

On 13 August 1993, the Bosnian government officially organized foreign volunteers into the detachment known as ''El Mud\u017eahid'' in order to impose control and order. Initially, the foreign mujahideen gave food and other basic necessities to the local Muslim population, who were deprived of such by the Serb forces. Once hostilities broke out between the Bosnian government and the Croat forces (HVO), the mujahideen also participated in battles against the HVO alongside ARBiH units.<ref name=\"icty judgement\">ICTY: Summary of the judgement for Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and [[Amir Kubura]] - {{cite web|url=http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/hadzihasanovic_kubura/cis/en/cis_hadzihasanovic_kubura_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728142657/http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/hadzihasanovic_kubura/cis/en/cis_hadzihasanovic_kubura_en.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe foreign mujahideen recruited local young men, offering them military training, uniforms and weapons.

The foreign volunteers even became unpopular with many of the Bosniak population, because the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian army]] had thousands of troops and had no need for more soldiers, but rather for arms. Many Bosnian Army officers and intellectuals were suspicious of the foreign volunteers arrival in the central part of the country, because they came from [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zagreb]] in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] without problems, unlike Bosnian Army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. {{citation needed|reason=cit needed for para|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe first mujahideen training camp was located in Poljanice next to the village of [[Mehurici]], in the [[Bila River (Romania)|Bila]] valley, [[Travnik]] municipality.

The mujahideen from Poljanice camp were also established in the towns of [[Zenica]] and Travnik and, from the second half of 1993 onwards, in the village of [[Ora\u0161ac, Croatia|Orasac]], also located in the Bila valley.<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/><ref>[http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=6540 Spero News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061123230849/http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=6540 |date=2006-11-23 }}, Bosnia: Muslims upset by Wahhabi leaders, Adrian Morgan, 13 November 2006</ref>\n\nThe military effectiveness of the mujahideen is disputed. However, former U.S. Balkans peace negotiator [[Richard Holbrooke]] said in an interview that he thought \"the Muslims wouldn't have survived without this\" help, as at the time a U.N. arms embargo diminished the Bosnian government's fighting capabilities.

According to a UN communiqu\u00e9 of 1995, the El Mud\u017eahid battalion was \"directly dependent on Bosnian staff for supplies\" and for \"directions\" during combat with the Serb forces.<ref>[http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_07_16/feature.html The American Conservative], The Bosnian Connection, by Brendan O\u2019Neill, 16 July 2007</ref> The issue has formed part of two ICTY war crimes trials against two former senior officials in the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of superior criminal responsibility. In its Trial Chamber judgement in the case of ICTY v. [[Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107]], commander of the [[3rd Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ARBiH 3rd Corps]] (who was later made part of the joint command of the ARBiH and was the Chief of the Supreme Command Staff), and [[Amir Kubura]], commander of the 7th Muslim Brigade of the 3rd Corps of the ARBiH, the Trial Chamber found that\n\n<blockquote>the foreign Mujahedin established at Poljanice camp were not officially part of the 3rd Corps or the 7th Brigade of the ARBiH. Accordingly, the Prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the foreign Mujahedin officially joined the ARBiH and that they were ''de iure'' subordinated to the Accused Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and [[Amir Kubura]].<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/></blockquote>\n\nIt also found that\n\n<blockquote>there are significant indicia of a subordinate relationship between the Mujahedin and the Accused ''prior'' to August 13, 1993. Testimony heard by the Trial Chamber and, in the main, documents tendered into evidence demonstrate that the ARBiH maintained a close relationship with the foreign Mujahedin as soon as these arrived in central Bosnia in 1992. Joint combat operations are one illustration of that. In Karaula and Visoko in 1992, at Mount Zmajevac around mid-April 1993 and in the Bila valley in June 1993, the Mujahedin fought alongside ARBiH units against Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat forces.\"<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the ICTY Appeals Chamber in April 2008 concluded that the relationship between the 3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army headed by Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and the El Mud\u017eahid detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack them as if they were a distinct enemy force.<ref name=\"un.org\" />\n\n==Propaganda==\nAlthough Serb and Croat media created much controversy about alleged war crimes committed by the squad, no indictment was issued by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] against any of these foreign volunteers. According to the ICTY verdicts, Serb propaganda was very active, constantly propagating false information about the foreign fighters in order to inflame [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] hatred among Serbs. After the takeover of [[Prijedor]] by Serb forces in 1992, Radio Prijedor propagated Serb nationalistic ideas characterising prominent non-Serbs as criminals and extremists who should be punished. One example of such propaganda was the derogatory language used for referring to non-Serbs such as \"Mujahedin\", \"''[[Usta\u0161e]]''\" or \"[[Zelene beretke|Green Berets]]\", although at the time there were no foreign volunteers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ICTY concluded in the [[Milomir Staki\u0107]] verdict that, Mile Muti\u0107, the director of the local paper ''Kozarski Vjesnik'' and the journalist Rade Muti\u0107 regularly attended meetings of Serb politicians (local authorities) in order to be informed about the next steps for spreading propaganda.<ref name=\"ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/stakic/trialc/judgement/sta-tj030731e.htm#ID2di|title=ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media}}</ref><ref name=\"ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/tadic/trialc2/judgement/tad-tj970507e.htm#_Toc387417236|title=ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of propaganda about \"Islamic holy warriors\" is presented in the ICTY Kordi\u0107 and \u010cerkez verdict for war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] leadership on Bosniak civilians. [[Gornji Vakuf]] was attacked by [[Croatian Defence Council]] (HVO) in January 1993 followed by heavy shelling of the town by Croat artillery.

After the village of Maline was taken, a military police unit of the 306th Brigade of Bosnian Army arrived in Maline. These policemen were to evacuate and protect the civilians in the villages taken by the Bosnian Army. The wounded were left on-site and around 200 people, including civilians and Croat soldiers, were taken by the police officers towards Mehurici. The commander of the 306th Brigade authorised the wounded be put onto a truck and transported to Mehurici. A number of mujahideen stormed the village of Maline, and even though the commander of the Bosnian Army 306th Brigade forbade them to approach, they did not obey.

On 13 August 1993, the Bosnian government officially organized foreign volunteers into the detachment known as ''El Mud\u017eahid'' in order to impose control and order. Initially, the foreign mujahideen gave food and other basic necessities to the local Muslim population, who were deprived of such by the Serb forces. Once hostilities broke out between the Bosnian government and the Croat forces (HVO), the mujahideen also participated in battles against the HVO alongside ARBiH units.<ref name=\"icty judgement\">ICTY: Summary of the judgement for Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and [[Amir Kubura]] - {{cite web|url=http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/hadzihasanovic_kubura/cis/en/cis_hadzihasanovic_kubura_en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728142657/http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/hadzihasanovic_kubura/cis/en/cis_hadzihasanovic_kubura_en.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-28 }}</ref>\n\nThe foreign mujahideen recruited local young men, offering them military training, uniforms and weapons.

The foreign volunteers even became unpopular with many of the Bosniak population, because the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian army]] had thousands of troops and had no need for more soldiers, but rather for arms. Many Bosnian Army officers and intellectuals were suspicious of the foreign volunteers arrival in the central part of the country, because they came from [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[Zagreb]] in Croatia, and were passed through the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] without problems, unlike Bosnian Army soldiers who were regularly arrested by Croat forces. {{citation needed|reason=cit needed for para|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe first mujahideen training camp was located in Poljanice next to the village of [[Mehurici]], in the [[Bila River (Romania)|Bila]] valley, [[Travnik]] municipality.

According to a UN communiqu\u00e9 of 1995, the El Mud\u017eahid battalion was \"directly dependent on Bosnian staff for supplies\" and for \"directions\" during combat with the Serb forces.<ref>[http://www.amconmag.com/2007/2007_07_16/feature.html The American Conservative], The Bosnian Connection, by Brendan O\u2019Neill, 16 July 2007</ref> The issue has formed part of two ICTY war crimes trials against two former senior officials in the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of superior criminal responsibility. In its Trial Chamber judgement in the case of ICTY v. [[Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107]], commander of the [[3rd Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|ARBiH 3rd Corps]] (who was later made part of the joint command of the ARBiH and was the Chief of the Supreme Command Staff), and [[Amir Kubura]], commander of the 7th Muslim Brigade of the 3rd Corps of the ARBiH, the Trial Chamber found that\n\n<blockquote>the foreign Mujahedin established at Poljanice camp were not officially part of the 3rd Corps or the 7th Brigade of the ARBiH. Accordingly, the Prosecution failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the foreign Mujahedin officially joined the ARBiH and that they were ''de iure'' subordinated to the Accused Enver Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and [[Amir Kubura]].<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/></blockquote>\n\nIt also found that\n\n<blockquote>there are significant indicia of a subordinate relationship between the Mujahedin and the Accused ''prior'' to August 13, 1993. Testimony heard by the Trial Chamber and, in the main, documents tendered into evidence demonstrate that the ARBiH maintained a close relationship with the foreign Mujahedin as soon as these arrived in central Bosnia in 1992. Joint combat operations are one illustration of that. In Karaula and Visoko in 1992, at Mount Zmajevac around mid-April 1993 and in the Bila valley in June 1993, the Mujahedin fought alongside ARBiH units against Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat forces.\"<ref name=\"icty judgement\"/></blockquote>\n\nHowever, the ICTY Appeals Chamber in April 2008 concluded that the relationship between the 3rd Corps of the Bosnian Army headed by Had\u017eihasanovi\u0107 and the El Mud\u017eahid detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack them as if they were a distinct enemy force.<ref name=\"un.org\" />\n\n==Propaganda==\nAlthough Serb and Croat media created much controversy about alleged war crimes committed by the squad, no indictment was issued by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] against any of these foreign volunteers. According to the ICTY verdicts, Serb propaganda was very active, constantly propagating false information about the foreign fighters in order to inflame [[Islamophobia|anti-Muslim]] hatred among Serbs. After the takeover of [[Prijedor]] by Serb forces in 1992, Radio Prijedor propagated Serb nationalistic ideas characterising prominent non-Serbs as criminals and extremists who should be punished. One example of such propaganda was the derogatory language used for referring to non-Serbs such as \"Mujahedin\", \"''[[Usta\u0161e]]''\" or \"[[Zelene beretke|Green Berets]]\", although at the time there were no foreign volunteers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ICTY concluded in the [[Milomir Staki\u0107]] verdict that, Mile Muti\u0107, the director of the local paper ''Kozarski Vjesnik'' and the journalist Rade Muti\u0107 regularly attended meetings of Serb politicians (local authorities) in order to be informed about the next steps for spreading propaganda.<ref name=\"ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/stakic/trialc/judgement/sta-tj030731e.htm#ID2di|title=ICTY: Milomir Staki\u0107 judgement - The media}}</ref><ref name=\"ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia\">{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/icty/tadic/trialc2/judgement/tad-tj970507e.htm#_Toc387417236|title=ICTY: Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 judgement - Greater Serbia}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of propaganda about \"Islamic holy warriors\" is presented in the ICTY Kordi\u0107 and \u010cerkez verdict for war crimes and [[crimes against humanity]] committed by [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] leadership on Bosniak civilians.
