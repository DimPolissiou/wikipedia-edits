Intrigued by the project's patriotic and educational vision, Sundaram answered Malaviya\u2019s call to Benares in January 1926 and became his personal secretary.<ref name=\"Kotgarh\">Sharma&nbsp;1999, p.&nbsp;247.</ref>\n\nMalaviya's first assignment was to send him to Kotgarh<ref>today ''Thanedhar'', near [[Shimla]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]; about [http://www.kotgarh.in/ Kotgarh], kotgarh.in</ref> in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] mountains, where [[Satyananda Stokes|Samuel Evans Stokes]], an American friend of Malaviya's had set up a school and was in need of a qualified English teacher.<ref name=\"Kotgarh\" /> Sundaram, accompanied by his newly married wife Savitri, joined Stokes for one season in 1926, a time during which he was in close contact with Gandhi, sending him every week a letter containing \"noble thoughts\" (which Gandhi would carefully retain and, years later, would present to Sundaram as a complete collection).<ref>Coll. Works, Vol. 35, Doc. 523, 579; Coll. Works, Vol. 36, Doc. 80, 121 et al.; it was 3 years later, in Kalakankar in [[Uttar Pradesh|U.P.]] that Gandhi, upon meeting Sundaram, produced from a cotton bag the collection of his letters saying \"I have not lost them\" (from: Sundaram's memoirs)</ref>\n\nBack in Benares, Sundaram's primary focus of work as Malaviya's assistant became the task of raising funds for the emerging university. He developed a particular aptitude for approaching and engaging high-profile donors, such as the [[Maharaja|Maharadjas]] or 'Ruling Princes' of different parts of India. As Secretary of the BHU Collection Committee he gained some fame for raising funds in the range of [[lakh]]s.<ref>Gandhi referred to Sundaram as the \"University Collector\" (Coll. Works, Vol. 80, Doc. 660) \"who can command lacs\" (Coll. Works, Vol. 85, Doc.143); [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S.

A. Sundaram for Benares Hindu University 1939.jpg|(3 examples)]] he collected in his function as Secretary of the BHU Collection Committee</ref>\n\nThis work involved extensive travelling through India, some of which Sundaram did together with Malaviya. Both were affectionately connected through a firm belief in God and the conviction to be serving a righteous, noble mission.<ref>V.&nbsp;A.

Sundaram named it 'Krishnakutir' and here welcomed many prominent guests from India and abroad, politicians like C.&nbsp;Rajagopalachari (as [[Governor-General of India]] in 1948), Sir [[Akbar Hydari]] and [[Mirza Ismail]], writers like [[W. Somerset Maugham|Somerset Maugham]] and [[Paul Brunton]], the scientists [[C.&nbsp;V. Raman]] and [[Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan|K.&nbsp;S.

The stone today ([[:File:Gandhi Memorial Stone at Sundaram's house Benares Hindu University.jpg|photo]])</ref>\n\nDuring his 30 years of service for the BHU, Sundaram published a range of books on the university and on its founder Malaviya. Many other private publications testify to Sundaram's lifelong passion for language and poetry as well as to his spiritual dedication.\n\n==Personal life and legacy==\nA guiding theme through Sundaram's life and work was the concept of harmony and unity spreading beyond religious borders. From his youth he had taken a keen interest in Christian culture and philosophy, later his house in Benares hosted many Christian as well as Muslim guests, and he exchanged thoughts and letters on interreligious ideas with Gandhi, [[Sadhu Sundar Singh]] and [[Sivananda|Swami Sivananda]] (a tie connecting him to the latter was also the common ancestor Appayya Dikshita).\n\nThough at one point he fought virulently against the English, he always remained a passionate admirer of English culture and literature, and made great efforts in sending all his children to England for higher education.\n\nIn his last chapter of life, after retiring from the BHU in 1956, Sundaram and his wife Savitri moved to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and spent their final years together with their eldest son. Sundaram died in Bombay on 11 March 1967.\n\nAt Benares, his former house 'Krishnakutir', is today (in 2013) planned to become part of a 'Heritage Complex' on the BHU grounds, its title 'Gandhi Memorial' being derived from the memorial stone Sundaram set up in remembrance of his most prominent guest and lifelong personal mentor.<ref>The planned [http://www.bhu.ac.in/malviyaheritage/index.html Heritage Complex], BHU website</ref><ref>Gandhi regularly exchanged letters \u2013&nbsp;and visits&nbsp;\u2013 with Sundaram over a time of 30 years, from 1916 to 1946 (Coll.

Intrigued by the project's patriotic and educational vision, Sundaram answered Malaviya\u2019s call to Benares in January 1926 and became his personal secretary.<ref name=\"Kotgarh\">Sharma&nbsp;1999, p.&nbsp;247.</ref>\n\nMalaviya's first assignment was to send him to Kotgarh<ref>today ''Thanedhar'', near [[Shimla]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]]; about [http://www.kotgarh.in/ Kotgarh], kotgarh.in</ref> in the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] mountains, where [[Satyananda Stokes|Samuel Evans Stokes]], an American friend of Malaviya's had set up a school and was in need of a qualified English teacher.<ref name=\"Kotgarh\" /> Sundaram, accompanied by his newly married wife Savitri, joined Stokes for one season in 1926, a time during which he was in close contact with Gandhi, sending him every week a letter containing \"noble thoughts\" (which Gandhi would carefully retain and, years later, would present to Sundaram as a complete collection).<ref>Coll. Works, Vol. 35, Doc. 523, 579; Coll. Works, Vol. 36, Doc. 80, 121 et al.; it was 3 years later, in Kalakankar in [[Uttar Pradesh|U.P.]] that Gandhi, upon meeting Sundaram, produced from a cotton bag the collection of his letters saying \"I have not lost them\" (from: Sundaram's memoirs)</ref>\n\nBack in Benares, Sundaram's primary focus of work as Malaviya's assistant became the task of raising funds for the emerging university. He developed a particular aptitude for approaching and engaging high-profile donors, such as the [[Maharaja|Maharadjas]] or 'Ruling Princes' of different parts of India. As Secretary of the BHU Collection Committee he gained some fame for raising funds in the range of [[lakh]]s.<ref>Gandhi referred to Sundaram as the \"University Collector\" (Coll.

Sundaram for Benares Hindu University 1939.jpg|(3 examples)]] he collected in his function as Secretary of the BHU Collection Committee</ref>\n\nThis work involved extensive travelling through India, some of which Sundaram did together with Malaviya.

Sundaram named it 'Krishnakutir' and here welcomed many prominent guests from India and abroad, politicians like C.&nbsp;Rajagopalachari (as [[Governor-General of India]] in 1948), Sir [[Akbar Hydari]] and [[Mirza Ismail]], writers like [[W.

The stone today ([[:File:Gandhi Memorial Stone at Sundaram's house Benares Hindu University.jpg|photo]])</ref>\n\nDuring his 30 years of service for the BHU, Sundaram published a range of books on the university and on its founder Malaviya. Many other private publications testify to Sundaram's lifelong passion for language and poetry as well as to his spiritual dedication.\n\n==Personal life and legacy==\nA guiding theme through Sundaram's life and work was the concept of harmony and unity spreading beyond religious borders. From his youth he had taken a keen interest in Christian culture and philosophy, later his house in Benares hosted many Christian as well as Muslim guests, and he exchanged thoughts and letters on interreligious ideas with Gandhi, [[Sadhu Sundar Singh]] and [[Sivananda|Swami Sivananda]] (a tie connecting him to the latter was also the common ancestor Appayya Dikshita).\n\nThough at one point he fought virulently against the English, he always remained a passionate admirer of English culture and literature, and made great efforts in sending all his children to England for higher education.\n\nIn his last chapter of life, after retiring from the BHU in 1956, Sundaram and his wife Savitri moved to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] and spent their final years together with their eldest son. Sundaram died in Bombay on 11 March 1967.\n\nAt Benares, his former house 'Krishnakutir', is today (in 2013) planned to become part of a 'Heritage Complex' on the BHU grounds, its title 'Gandhi Memorial' being derived from the memorial stone Sundaram set up in remembrance of his most prominent guest and lifelong personal mentor.<ref>The planned [http://www.bhu.ac.in/malviyaheritage/index.html Heritage Complex], BHU website</ref><ref>Gandhi regularly exchanged letters \u2013&nbsp;and visits&nbsp;\u2013 with Sundaram over a time of 30 years, from 1916 to 1946 (Coll.

Yoors fled to London after the war where he lived with his wife Annebert and her best friend Marianne. It is at this point that Yoors began to design tapestries and set up a tapestry studio with his wife Annebert and Marianne. In 1950 he moved to New York, traveling there under the guise of a journalist. The following year, Annebert and Marianne joined and the three set up the Jan Yoors Studio. In New York, Yoors befriended numerous figures in the art and design worlds. He received commissions from corporations such as Bank of America, and J.P. Morgan, and private collectors.

She has sixty one staterooms in the main cabin, twenty four extra rooms in the [[Texas (steamboat)|texas]] for passengers, a nursery for servants and children, and a cabin adjoining the nursery in which are staterooms for fifty passengers. \u2026 The main cabin carpet is a single piece 17 \u00bd feet wide and upwards of {{convert|225|ft|m}} in length, a royal Winton [[velvet]] purchased of A. T. Stewart of New York and made to order. The furniture also made to order, all of modern style and costly materials in fact solid [[rosewood]], the chairs, sofas, sociables, etc., most artistically and elaborately carved. The cushions of all seats are heavy crimson [[satin]], and the style of the furniture is of new and original design, all made in this city at the manufactory of John Sim. She has 20 extension dining tables in the main cabin, each to accommodate twelve guests; thus seating 240 for dinner with plenty of room for extra side tables. \u2026 The machinery of the ROB'T. E. LEE consists of feet stroke, the largest high pressure engines on the river. \u2026 The [[Boiler feedwater pump|doctor]] is considered a triumph of the medical art, it being a new style of with the parallel motion applied. It supplies the boiler with water and can throw an immense volume. The boat is also furnished with three separate pumping fire engines with an abundance of hose to use in case of fire. \u2026 She has wrought iron shafts weighing 18,750 pounds, the shafts being each {{convert|23|ft|m}} in length, with the journals {{convert|18|in|mm}} in diameter. Each of the cranks, which are also of wrought iron, weigh 6,000 pounds. These were all made east of the [[Allegheny Mountains|Alleghenies]] and are the largest ever constructed for a western steamer. The [[Texas (steamboat)|texas]] is {{convert|140|ft|m}} in length, with 24 passengers rooms in addition to the accommodations for officers. She also has two immense baggage rooms, all under guard. \u2026 to obviate the necessary of carrying baggage in the cabins or on guard. \u2026 The cabin with its rich garniture and splendid furniture, dazzling chandeliers, arched and fretted ceilings, etched with gold, stained glass skylights, immense mirrors, the velvet carpet, the pure [[zinc]] white of sides, the rosewood state room doors, and the imitation [[Egypt]]ian marble stills, all combined to make it bear an appearance of Oriental luxury and splendor seldom conceived an never before seen floating the wild waters of this so-called semi-barbarian western world. \u2026<ref>New Albany Ledger October 6, 1866</ref></blockquote>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Steamboat replica Robert E.

Cannon, the captain of ''Robert E. Lee'', ensured victory by removing excess weight, carrying only a few passengers, and using prearranged barges to increase the speed of refueling.  ''Natchez'' finished the race several hours later, but had been delayed by fog for six hours, and had numerous passengers to weigh it down. She received a silver bowl trophy containing the name of the Robert E. On December 22, 1870 she collided with the Potomac opposite Natchez, Mississippi.

He cites Johnny Farrell, second engineer of ''Natchez'': \"This old idea about the two boats preparing for days for the race, tearing down bulkheads, putting up wind sheaves, and a lot of other stuff, is not true. When I went aboard ''Robert E. Lee'', all they had done was to move the coal bunkers a little forward... On our boat there was absolutely no preparation whatever.

This would accidentally lead to the birth of the [[Chicory|Belgian Endive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|title=Food Museum, Belgium Endive|date=29 July 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050729081033/http://www.foodmuseum.com/endive.html|archive-date=29 July 2005|url-status=dead|access-date=4 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter decades of financial uncertainty, the Belgian state bought the garden in 1870 and commissioned various fountains, electrical lighting, and the addition of numerous sculptures, in order to both beautify the park and stimulate public art and artists in the country. All through the 19th century, the garden was a popular recreational area for the [[bourgeoisie]]. [[Victor Hugo]], during his first stay in Brussels in 1852, wrote:\n{{quote|''Brussels has two unique wonders in the world: the Grand Place and the panorama of the Botanical Garden.''<ref name=\":1\" />}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the works of the [[North\u2013South connection|North-South junction]] did not spare the Botanical Garden. It was decided to entirely move the botany institution to a larger site. In 1938, most of the botanical resources were relocated to the new [[National Botanic Garden of Belgium]] in [[Meise]], on the outskirts of today's Brussels-Capital Region. The old garden was reduced in size and made into a park after part of its western premises were used to facilitate a north-south road-viaduct.\n\n===Contemporary (1938\u2013present)===\nThe whole site has been designated since 15 April 1964.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://visit.brussels/en/sites/heritage/place/Le-Botanique-and-its-gardens|title=Le Botanique and its gardens - heritage|website=visit.brussels|language=en|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref> Since its reallocation in 1984, the original botanical building now stands as a cultural centre for the [[French Community of Belgium]] called [[Le Botanique]],<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://botanique.be/en/history-en|title=History|publisher=botanique.be|accessdate=2015-06-28}}</ref> while its historical statues, and its remarkable collection of species of large trees, remains intact.\n\n==Building==\n[[File:Botanique 04.JPG|right|200px|thumb|The rotunda, with sculptures in the foreground]]\nThe main [[orangery]] building ({{lang|fr|Le Botanique}}) is one-story high and its south-facing [[Neoclassical architecture in Belgium|neoclassical]] facade is preceded by two terraces. The building consists of a central [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] with a dome, and is flanked by two wings lined with windows, each ending in a slightly offset pavilion with [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns.\n\nThough it has been transformed to meet its new function as a cultural centre (including concert halls and showrooms), the interior of the building retains most of its original appearance. The former [[herbarium]] room in the west wing was transformed into a cafeteria, and the two pavilions into the entrance hall and a multipurpose room.\n\n==Sculptures==\nFifty-two sculptures were executed between 1894 and 1898, a project overseen by two well-known sculptors; [[Constantin Meunier]] and [[Charles van der Stappen]]. The sculptures portray [[Allegorical sculpture|allegorical]] figures of plants, animals, and seasons.
