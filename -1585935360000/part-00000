The war was part of the [[Great Game]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian empire]]s.\n\nThe war was split into two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the [[British Raj|British]] invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly victorious and forced the [[Amir]] - [[Sher Ali Khan]] to flee. Ali's successor [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]] immediately sued for peace and the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir [[Louis Cavagnari]] to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] which led to the [[abdication]] of Yaqub.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Yakub Khan |volume=28 |page=898}}</ref>\n\nThe second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British [[Battle of Kandahar|decisively defeated]] Ayub Khan outside [[Kandahar]]. A new Amir - [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] selected by the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the [[British Raj]] and the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Barfield145\">Barfield p. 145</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. [[Sher Ali Khan]], the [[Amir of Afghanistan]], tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.<ref name=Barthorp66_67>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]], but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the [[viceroy of India]], ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the [[Khyber Pass]], triggering the Second Anglo\u2013Afghan War.<ref name=Barthorp66_67/>\n\n==War==\n===First phase===\nThe first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the [[Battle of Ali Masjid]] and the [[Battle of Peiwar Kotal]] meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.<ref>[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/campafghan1878.htm Afghanistan 1878-1880 The Build-Up to Conflict] at britishempire.co.uk</ref>\n\nAn alarmed [[Sher Ali Khan|Sher Ali]] attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British.<ref>Sinhai, Damodar Prasad. \"India and Afghanistan, 1876\", p. 183.</ref> He returned to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], where he died on 21 February 1879.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=Henry Bathurst|title=The Second Afghan War, 1878-79-80: Its Causes, Its Conduct and Its Consequences|publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|year=1904|volume=2|pages=150\u2013155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzQoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Treaty===\nWith British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]], signed the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Michni Pass|Michni]] passes, and Afghanistan ceded various [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]] [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)|areas]] and [[Quetta]] to Britain.

Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] as emir instead.<ref name=Wilkinson16_17>{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=Robert |origyear=1977 |year=1998|title=North-West Frontier 1837\u20131947 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-85045-275-9 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n[[File:Coin minted in Kandahar during its occupation during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.jpg|thumb|A rare coin minted during the occupation of Kandahar.

The war was part of the [[Great Game]] between the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Russian empire]]s.\n\nThe war was split into two campaigns - the first began in November 1878 with the [[British Raj|British]] invasion of Afghanistan. The British were quickly victorious and forced the [[Amir]] - [[Sher Ali Khan]] to flee. Ali's successor [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]] immediately sued for peace and the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] was then signed on 26 May 1879. The British sent an envoy and mission led by Sir [[Louis Cavagnari]] to Kabul but on 3 September this mission was massacred and the conflict was reignited by [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] which led to the [[abdication]] of Yaqub.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Yakub Khan |volume=28 |page=898}}</ref>\n\nThe second campaign ended in September 1880 when the British [[Battle of Kandahar|decisively defeated]] Ayub Khan outside [[Kandahar]]. A new Amir - [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] selected by the British, ratified and confirmed the Gandamak treaty once more. When the British and Indian soldiers had withdrawn, the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives, as well as create a buffer between the [[British Raj]] and the Russian Empire.<ref name=\"Barfield145\">Barfield p. 145</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAfter tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. [[Sher Ali Khan]], the [[Amir of Afghanistan]], tried unsuccessfully to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878, and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too.<ref name=Barthorp66_67>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n\nThe Amir not only refused to receive a British mission under [[Neville Bowles Chamberlain]], but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the [[viceroy of India]], ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the [[Khyber Pass]], triggering the Second Anglo\u2013Afghan War.<ref name=Barthorp66_67/>\n\n==War==\n===First phase===\nThe first campaign began in November 1878 when a British force of about 50,000 fighting men, mostly Indians, was distributed into three military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. The British victories at the [[Battle of Ali Masjid]] and the [[Battle of Peiwar Kotal]] meant that the approach to Kabul was left virtually undefended by Afghan troops.<ref>[http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/indiancampaigns/campafghan1878.htm Afghanistan 1878-1880 The Build-Up to Conflict] at britishempire.co.uk</ref>\n\nAn alarmed [[Sher Ali Khan|Sher Ali]] attempted to appeal in person to the Russian Tsar for assistance, but their insistence was that he should seek terms of surrender from the British.<ref>Sinhai, Damodar Prasad. \"India and Afghanistan, 1876\", p. 183.</ref> He returned to [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], where he died on 21 February 1879.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanna|first=Henry Bathurst|title=The Second Afghan War, 1878-79-80: Its Causes, Its Conduct and Its Consequences|publisher=Archibald Constable & Co|year=1904|volume=2|pages=150\u2013155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GzQoAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n===Treaty===\nWith British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali's son and successor, [[Mohammad Yaqub Khan]], signed the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to Britain. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the [[Khyber Pass|Khyber]] and [[Michni Pass|Michni]] passes, and Afghanistan ceded various [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North-West Frontier Province]] [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA)|areas]] and [[Quetta]] to Britain.

Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub's brother [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]] on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] as emir instead.<ref name=Wilkinson16_17>{{cite book |last=Wilkinson-Latham |first=Robert |origyear=1977 |year=1998|title=North-West Frontier 1837\u20131947 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |location=London |isbn=0-85045-275-9 |pages=16\u201317}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Barthorp |first=Michael |title=Afghan Wars and the North-West Frontier 1839\u20131947|origyear=1982 |year=2002 |publisher=Cassell |location=London |isbn=0-304-36294-8 |pages=81\u201385}}</ref>\n[[File:Coin minted in Kandahar during its occupation during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.jpg|thumb|A rare coin minted during the occupation of Kandahar.

Their state was the most powerful Arab amirate in [[Armenia]] after the collapse of the [[Emirate of Armenia|''ostikan''ate of Arminiya]] in the late 9th century.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThe Kaysites were members of the [[Banu Sulaym]] tribe, which had settled in the [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] after the Muslim conquest. By the reign of the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]] (786\u2013809) the Sulaym had probably advanced into the region around [[Lake Van]]. Manzikert and the surrounding regions, however, weren't in Arab hands until the rebellion of the Armenians against the Arab ''ostikan'' (governor) in 850. This rebellion prompted the caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] (842\u2013861) to send the [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] [[Bugha al-Kabir]] into Armenia with an army.\n\nBugha defeated the leading princes of Armenia and took several prisoner, before departing the country in 855. His defeat of the Armenian princes had enabled the Sulaym Arabs to surge into the area of Apahunik', which included the city of Manzikert. By 860 the region had fallen under the control of the first Kaysite amir, Abu'l-Ward.\n\n==Suzerains==\n\nFor most their existence of the Kaysite state, the amirs recognized their stronger neighbors as suzerains, though often these declarations were only nominal and in effect the Kaysites were independent.\n\nWhen Abu'l-Ward took control of Apahunik', the ''ostikan''ate of Arminiya was still extant. As a result, Abu'l-Ward, as with all the other Arab and Armenian rulers in Armenia, were subject to the caliph's ''ostikans''. The ''ostikans'' served as protectors of the Kaysites, and relations between them were overall friendly. When a pan-Arab coalition led by the ''ostikans'' against the increasingly powerful Christian princes of Armenia in the late 870s was formed, Abu'l-Ward was one of its most powerful members.\n\nThe ultimate failure of the coalition against the Christian Armenians foreshadowed the end of the Arminiyan ''ostikan''ate in the next decade. In place of the ''ostikans'', in 885 the caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] (870\u2013892) sent a crown to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratid]] prince [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot I]], thereby restoring the [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia|Kingdom of Armenia]]. This move made the Kaysites subject to Ashot,<ref>[[Aram Ter-Ghevondyan|Ter-Ghewondyan]], p. 54</ref> who Abu'l-Ward was on bad terms with. By the late 890s the reigns of both Ashot and Abu'l-Ward were at an end; Ashot was succeeded by his son [[Smbat I]] (890\u2013912) while Abu'l-Ward's three grandsons eventually assumed power. When Smbat I fell into difficulties early in his reign Abu'l-Ward's grandsons revolted against his authority but were defeated in battle. They were forced to resume paying tribute to the king and to send hostages.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 65-6</ref>\n\nSmbat I was murdered by the [[Sajids|Sajid]] amir of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] in 912 and was eventually succeeded by his son [[Ashot II]] (914\u2013928). During the civil war following Smbat's death the Kaysites ceased to recognize the suzerainty of the Bagratids.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 74</ref> At the same time, however, the [[Byzantine Empire]] became active in Armenian affairs. The proximity of the Byzantines compelled the three grandsons of Abu'l-Ward to begin forwarding tribute to the Empire.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81\">Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81</ref> Other than the tribute, Byzantine authority over the Kaysites was restricted, although periodic raids by them into Kaysite territory are recorded.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 82</ref>\n\nIn 940 the [[Hamdanid]] amir [[Sayf al-Daula]] came to [[Ahlat]], where the Kaysite amirs pledged allegiance to him.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 85-6</ref> From this point on the Kaysites were Hamdanid vassals, and remained so until the end of their rule in 964.\n\n==Kaysite rulers==\n[[File:Caucasus, 884-962.gif|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Christian and Muslim Armenian principalities in the mid-10th century]]\nThe first Kaysite amir, Abu'l-Ward, ruled from c. 860 until probably the 890s. He was a very active statesman and under him the Kaysites became very influential in Armenia, being rivaled only by the Bagratids, the [[Artsruni dynasty|Artsrunis]] of [[Vaspurakan]] and the princes of [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]].<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 53</ref> He took Ahlat from the prince of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]]<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 55</ref> and, as mentioned above, was one of the leaders of the Arab coalition formed against the Christian princes of Armenia. Even after the coalition was defeated Abu'l-Ward remained active in Armenian affairs; he convinced the Artsruni prince of Vaspurakan to seize and imprison Ashot, the prince of Taron. At the same time, Ashot I (who had not yet been crowned king) invaded Kaysite territory and besieged Manzikert but, when he heard about Ashot of Taron's fate, lifted the siege and headed to Vaspurakan to save him.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 59</ref>\n\nAbu'l-Ward was succeeded by his son 'Abd al-Hamid, who ruled for only a short time.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 65</ref> He was succeeded by his three sons. The eldest, Abu Sawada, received the chief city of Manzikert, as well as Koroy Jor and Hark'. The second brother, Abu'l-Aswad gained Arces, Ahlat and Arcke, while the third, Abu Salim, received territory in the northwest portion of the Kaysite lands.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 80</ref> Relations between the brothers was amicable and, despite this division, the Kaysite state continued to function as one unified unit.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81\"/> It was these three brothers who unsuccessfully rebelled against Smbat I in the late 890s. During this period of joint rule the Kaysite domains were expanded, with the conquest of [[Berkri]] from the Arab [[Uthmanids]] in the early 10th century.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81\"/>\n\nSome time in the early 10th century the eldest brother, Abu Sawada, died and was succeeded by his son 'Abd al-Rahim. Upon 'Abd al-Rahim's death, his brother Abu'l-Mu'izz was too young to rule so Manzikert and the other lands fell into the hands of Abu'l-Aswad, ruler of Ahlat. When Abu'l-Aswad himself died, his territories were split; the lands he had inherited from 'Abd al-Rahim (including Manzikert) were taken by his remaining brother, Abu Salim, while his original possessions (centered on Ahlat) fell to his adopted son Ahmad. The Kaysite lands were now in the hands of two rulers instead of three. It was around this time that the Kaysites became Hamdanid vassals.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 89\">Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 89</ref>\n\nWhen Abu Salim died, his son Abu'l-Ward [II] inherited his territories. Abu'l-Ward killed Ahmad and took over his possessions, thereby unifying the Kaysite lands. This took place before 952, since this was when the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] completed his work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' which covers many of these events.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 89\"/>\n\nAbu'l-Ward remained the sole ruler of the Kaysite amirate until his death. In 964 he was probably murdered by a ''ghulam'' of Sayf al-Daula named Nadja who had risen in revolt. Nadja and his two brothers ruled the Kaysite lands until Sayf al-Daula had Nadja murdered. The Hamdanid amir then led an army into Armenia, captured Nadja's brothers and secured his rule over the former territories of the Kaysites. This done, he departed from Armenia in the beginning of 966. The Kaysite lands thereby came under the rule of Sayf al-Daula.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 89-90</ref>\n\n==Aspects of the Kaysite amirates==\n\nThe Arabs of southwest Armenia never constituted a majority of the regional population. Most of the Muslims, who were probably (like the Kaysites) Sulaym Arabs<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 133</ref> resided in the cities. Consequentially, the Kaysite amirs rule was strongest in the cities that were under their control. Their power was much weaker in the surrounding rural areas, which generally remained under the control of local (Christian) leaders.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 81-2</ref>\n\nGiven that the Muslims formed a minority within the Kaysite amirate, the Armenian Christians were given a degree of autonomy when it came to dealing with their own private affairs. Although the [[sharia]] prevailed in the governance of Muslims, when resolving issues amongst themselves most Armenians living under the Kaysites followed the canons of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]].<ref>Since the Bagratid kingdom had no civil code, Armenians living in Christian territory were similarly governed by the rules of the Church. Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 145</ref>\n\nIn the early years of the Kaysite amirate, the [[Tondrakians|T'ondrakian]] religious sect was active in the provinces of Apahunik' and Hark'. The T'ondrakians were opposed to both the Armenian Church and the Muslim amirs of Armenia. Abu'l-Ward [I], considering them a threat to his rule, slaughtered a large number of them and executed their leader Smbat Zarehawanc'i. Despite this, the T'ondrakian movement survived into the 11th century and caused trouble for both Armenian ecclesiastical and Byzantine authorities.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 135-7</ref>\n\nSeveral Kaysite cities lay on the southern of two commercial routes that traversed Armenia from east to west.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 139</ref> The traders that passed through Armenia therefore benefited the Kaysite lands. Despite this, the cities of the Kaysites never became major urban centers. Even Manzikert, the capital, was never considered to be a very prosperous city.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 132</ref>\n\nMilitarily, the Kaysites benefited from a regular influx of [[Ghazi (warrior)|''ghazi'' warriors]] on their way to fight the [[jihad|holy war]] against the Byzantine Empire. These warriors would travel through Apahunik', which was controlled by the Kaysites, then make their way to [[Erzerum|Karin]], a chief Muslim outpost against the Byzantines. The Kaysites often utilized these ''ghazi'' volunteers to reinforce their own army against their enemies. For example, during the revolt of Abu Sawada, Abu'l-Aswad and Abu Salim against Smbat I, the Kaysite army was supported by \"Persian raiders who were making attacks on the Greeks [Byzantines].\"<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 66</ref>\n\n==Aftermath of Kaysite rule==\n\nHamdanid rule over the former Kaysite territories did not last long. After Sayf al-Daula's death in 967 the fate of the Kaysite lands is unknown for a time, although they were probably in the hands of local rulers.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 105</ref> In 969 a Byzantine army raided Apahunik', besieged Manzikert and razed its walls, but the Byzantines made no attempt to maintain a presence in the city. The Bagratid kings eventually gained control of the northern portion of the Kaysite realm. The Artsruni king of Vaspurakan attempted to take the remaining Kaysite lands, including Berkri, Manzikert and Ahlat, though without much success.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 106</ref>\n\nAround this time Ahlat and Manzikert were conquered by a [[Kurds|Kurdish]] family, that of the [[Marwanids]]. Its leader, Badh ibn Dustak, took advantage of a civil war within the Byzantine Empire and the weakness of the Hamdanids and created a powerful principality stretching from Manzikert to [[Mosul]]. Badh's successes proved to be temporary, however, and when he was killed in 990 while attempting to retake Mosul the Marwanid amirate quickly shrank. Most of the former Kaysite lands in their possession were taken by the [[Georgians|Georgian]] [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] King [[David III of Tao|David III]], [[Kouropalates|Curopalates]] of [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Tao]].<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 112</ref> Only Ahlat remained in the hands of the Marwanids.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 115</ref>\n\nDavid held Apahunik' until his death in 1000. As per agreement with the Byzantines, his domain was incorporated into the Empire. Manzikert henceforth remained in Byzantine hands until the coming of the [[Seljuks]] in the mid-11th century.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{The Arab Emirates in Bagratid Armenia}}\n\n[[Category:Arab dynasties]]\n[[Category:Medieval Armenia]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n[[Category:960s disestablishments]]\n[[Category:Banu Sulaym]]\n[[Category:10th century in Armenia]]\n[[Category:Former emirates]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Kassites}}\n{{One source|date=October 2010}}\n\n{{Infobox country\n|conventional_long_name = Kaysite dynasty \n|capital = [[Manzikert]]\n|government_type = [[principality|Emirate]]\n|year_start = c.860\n|year_end = 964\n|p1 = Arminiya\n|s1 = Bagratid Armenia\n|common_languages = [[Classical Arabic]]\n|religion         = [[Sunni Islam]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n}}\n{{History of the Arab States}}\n\nThe '''Kaysite dynasty''' was a [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] dynasty that ruled an emirate centered in [[Manzikert]] from c. 860 until 964.

Manzikert and the surrounding regions, however, weren't in Arab hands until the rebellion of the Armenians against the Arab ''ostikan'' (governor) in 850. This rebellion prompted the caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] (842\u2013861) to send the [[Turkic peoples|Turk]] [[Bugha al-Kabir]] into Armenia with an army.\n\nBugha defeated the leading princes of Armenia and took several prisoner, before departing the country in 855. His defeat of the Armenian princes had enabled the Sulaym Arabs to surge into the area of Apahunik', which included the city of Manzikert. By 860 the region had fallen under the control of the first Kaysite amir, Abu'l-Ward.\n\n==Suzerains==\n\nFor most their existence of the Kaysite state, the amirs recognized their stronger neighbors as suzerains, though often these declarations were only nominal and in effect the Kaysites were independent.\n\nWhen Abu'l-Ward took control of Apahunik', the ''ostikan''ate of Arminiya was still extant. As a result, Abu'l-Ward, as with all the other Arab and Armenian rulers in Armenia, were subject to the caliph's ''ostikans''. The ''ostikans'' served as protectors of the Kaysites, and relations between them were overall friendly. When a pan-Arab coalition led by the ''ostikans'' against the increasingly powerful Christian princes of Armenia in the late 870s was formed, Abu'l-Ward was one of its most powerful members.\n\nThe ultimate failure of the coalition against the Christian Armenians foreshadowed the end of the Arminiyan ''ostikan''ate in the next decade. In place of the ''ostikans'', in 885 the caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] (870\u2013892) sent a crown to the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratid]] prince [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot I]], thereby restoring the [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia|Kingdom of Armenia]]. This move made the Kaysites subject to Ashot,<ref>[[Aram Ter-Ghevondyan|Ter-Ghewondyan]], p. 54</ref> who Abu'l-Ward was on bad terms with. By the late 890s the reigns of both Ashot and Abu'l-Ward were at an end; Ashot was succeeded by his son [[Smbat I]] (890\u2013912) while Abu'l-Ward's three grandsons eventually assumed power. When Smbat I fell into difficulties early in his reign Abu'l-Ward's grandsons revolted against his authority but were defeated in battle. They were forced to resume paying tribute to the king and to send hostages.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 65-6</ref>\n\nSmbat I was murdered by the [[Sajids|Sajid]] amir of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]] in 912 and was eventually succeeded by his son [[Ashot II]] (914\u2013928). During the civil war following Smbat's death the Kaysites ceased to recognize the suzerainty of the Bagratids.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 74</ref> At the same time, however, the [[Byzantine Empire]] became active in Armenian affairs. The proximity of the Byzantines compelled the three grandsons of Abu'l-Ward to begin forwarding tribute to the Empire.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81\">Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81</ref> Other than the tribute, Byzantine authority over the Kaysites was restricted, although periodic raids by them into Kaysite territory are recorded.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 82</ref>\n\nIn 940 the [[Hamdanid]] amir [[Sayf al-Daula]] came to [[Ahlat]], where the Kaysite amirs pledged allegiance to him.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 85-6</ref> From this point on the Kaysites were Hamdanid vassals, and remained so until the end of their rule in 964.\n\n==Kaysite rulers==\n[[File:EarlyBagratid884-962.gif|thumb|right|300px|Map of the Christian and Muslim Armenian principalities in the mid-10th century]]\nThe first Kaysite amir, Abu'l-Ward, ruled from c. 860 until probably the 890s. He was a very active statesman and under him the Kaysites became very influential in Armenia, being rivaled only by the Bagratids, the [[Artsruni dynasty|Artsrunis]] of [[Vaspurakan]] and the princes of [[Syunik (historic province)|Syunik]].<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 53</ref> He took Ahlat from the prince of [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]]<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 55</ref> and, as mentioned above, was one of the leaders of the Arab coalition formed against the Christian princes of Armenia. Even after the coalition was defeated Abu'l-Ward remained active in Armenian affairs; he convinced the Artsruni prince of Vaspurakan to seize and imprison Ashot, the prince of Taron. At the same time, Ashot I (who had not yet been crowned king) invaded Kaysite territory and besieged Manzikert but, when he heard about Ashot of Taron's fate, lifted the siege and headed to Vaspurakan to save him.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 59</ref>\n\nAbu'l-Ward was succeeded by his son 'Abd al-Hamid, who ruled for only a short time.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 65</ref> He was succeeded by his three sons. The eldest, Abu Sawada, received the chief city of Manzikert, as well as Koroy Jor and Hark'. The second brother, Abu'l-Aswad gained Arces, Ahlat and Arcke, while the third, Abu Salim, received territory in the northwest portion of the Kaysite lands.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 80</ref> Relations between the brothers was amicable and, despite this division, the Kaysite state continued to function as one unified unit.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81\"/> It was these three brothers who unsuccessfully rebelled against Smbat I in the late 890s. During this period of joint rule the Kaysite domains were expanded, with the conquest of [[Berkri]] from the Arab [[Uthmanids]] in the early 10th century.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 81\"/>\n\nSome time in the early 10th century the eldest brother, Abu Sawada, died and was succeeded by his son 'Abd al-Rahim. Upon 'Abd al-Rahim's death, his brother Abu'l-Mu'izz was too young to rule so Manzikert and the other lands fell into the hands of Abu'l-Aswad, ruler of Ahlat. When Abu'l-Aswad himself died, his territories were split; the lands he had inherited from 'Abd al-Rahim (including Manzikert) were taken by his remaining brother, Abu Salim, while his original possessions (centered on Ahlat) fell to his adopted son Ahmad. The Kaysite lands were now in the hands of two rulers instead of three. It was around this time that the Kaysites became Hamdanid vassals.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 89\">Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 89</ref>\n\nWhen Abu Salim died, his son Abu'l-Ward [II] inherited his territories. Abu'l-Ward killed Ahmad and took over his possessions, thereby unifying the Kaysite lands. This took place before 952, since this was when the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] completed his work ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' which covers many of these events.<ref name=\"Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 89\"/>\n\nAbu'l-Ward remained the sole ruler of the Kaysite amirate until his death. In 964 he was probably murdered by a ''ghulam'' of Sayf al-Daula named Nadja who had risen in revolt. Nadja and his two brothers ruled the Kaysite lands until Sayf al-Daula had Nadja murdered. The Hamdanid amir then led an army into Armenia, captured Nadja's brothers and secured his rule over the former territories of the Kaysites. This done, he departed from Armenia in the beginning of 966. The Kaysite lands thereby came under the rule of Sayf al-Daula.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 89-90</ref>\n\n==Aspects of the Kaysite amirates==\n\nThe Arabs of southwest Armenia never constituted a majority of the regional population. Most of the Muslims, who were probably (like the Kaysites) Sulaym Arabs<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 133</ref> resided in the cities. Consequentially, the Kaysite amirs rule was strongest in the cities that were under their control. Their power was much weaker in the surrounding rural areas, which generally remained under the control of local (Christian) leaders.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 81-2</ref>\n\nGiven that the Muslims formed a minority within the Kaysite amirate, the Armenian Christians were given a degree of autonomy when it came to dealing with their own private affairs. Although the [[sharia]] prevailed in the governance of Muslims, when resolving issues amongst themselves most Armenians living under the Kaysites followed the canons of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Church]].<ref>Since the Bagratid kingdom had no civil code, Armenians living in Christian territory were similarly governed by the rules of the Church. Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 145</ref>\n\nIn the early years of the Kaysite amirate, the [[Tondrakians|T'ondrakian]] religious sect was active in the provinces of Apahunik' and Hark'. The T'ondrakians were opposed to both the Armenian Church and the Muslim amirs of Armenia. Abu'l-Ward [I], considering them a threat to his rule, slaughtered a large number of them and executed their leader Smbat Zarehawanc'i. Despite this, the T'ondrakian movement survived into the 11th century and caused trouble for both Armenian ecclesiastical and Byzantine authorities.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, pp. 135-7</ref>\n\nSeveral Kaysite cities lay on the southern of two commercial routes that traversed Armenia from east to west.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 139</ref> The traders that passed through Armenia therefore benefited the Kaysite lands. Despite this, the cities of the Kaysites never became major urban centers. Even Manzikert, the capital, was never considered to be a very prosperous city.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 132</ref>\n\nMilitarily, the Kaysites benefited from a regular influx of [[Ghazi (warrior)|''ghazi'' warriors]] on their way to fight the [[jihad|holy war]] against the Byzantine Empire. These warriors would travel through Apahunik', which was controlled by the Kaysites, then make their way to [[Erzerum|Karin]], a chief Muslim outpost against the Byzantines. The Kaysites often utilized these ''ghazi'' volunteers to reinforce their own army against their enemies. For example, during the revolt of Abu Sawada, Abu'l-Aswad and Abu Salim against Smbat I, the Kaysite army was supported by \"Persian raiders who were making attacks on the Greeks [Byzantines].\"<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 66</ref>\n\n==Aftermath of Kaysite rule==\n\nHamdanid rule over the former Kaysite territories did not last long. After Sayf al-Daula's death in 967 the fate of the Kaysite lands is unknown for a time, although they were probably in the hands of local rulers.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 105</ref> In 969 a Byzantine army raided Apahunik', besieged Manzikert and razed its walls, but the Byzantines made no attempt to maintain a presence in the city. The Bagratid kings eventually gained control of the northern portion of the Kaysite realm. The Artsruni king of Vaspurakan attempted to take the remaining Kaysite lands, including Berkri, Manzikert and Ahlat, though without much success.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 106</ref>\n\nAround this time Ahlat and Manzikert were conquered by a [[Kurds|Kurdish]] family, that of the [[Marwanids]]. Its leader, Badh ibn Dustak, took advantage of a civil war within the Byzantine Empire and the weakness of the Hamdanids and created a powerful principality stretching from Manzikert to [[Mosul]]. Badh's successes proved to be temporary, however, and when he was killed in 990 while attempting to retake Mosul the Marwanid amirate quickly shrank. Most of the former Kaysite lands in their possession were taken by the [[Georgians|Georgian]] [[Bagrationi dynasty|Bagrationi]] King [[David III of Tao|David III]], [[Kouropalates|Curopalates]] of [[Principality of Tao-Klarjeti|Tao]].<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 112</ref> Only Ahlat remained in the hands of the Marwanids.<ref>Ter-Ghewondyan, p. 115</ref>\n\nDavid held Apahunik' until his death in 1000. As per agreement with the Byzantines, his domain was incorporated into the Empire. Manzikert henceforth remained in Byzantine hands until the coming of the [[Seljuks]] in the mid-11th century.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{The Arab Emirates in Bagratid Armenia}}\n\n[[Category:Arab dynasties]]\n[[Category:Medieval Armenia]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n[[Category:960s disestablishments]]\n[[Category:Banu Sulaym]]\n[[Category:10th century in Armenia]]\n[[Category:Former emirates]]\n", "name_user": "Fridolin freudenfett", "label": "safe", "comment": "(GR)File renamed:File:EarlyBagratid884-962.gif\u2192File:Caucasus, 884-962.gifCriterion 1(original uploader\u2019s request) \u00b7 better describes the view", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaysites"}

Taking advantage of the overthrow of the Umayyads by the '[[Abbasids]], a second rebellion was conceived although it too was met with failure partly because of the frictional relationship between the Bagratuni and Mamikonian families. The rebellion's failure also resulted in the near disintegration of the Mamikonian house which lost most of the land it controlled (members of the Artstruni house were able to escape and settle in [[Vaspurakan]]).\n\nA third and final rebellion, stemming from similar grievances as the second, was launched in 774 under the leadership of Mushegh Mamikonian and with the support of other ''nakharars''. The Abbasid Arabs, however, marched into Armenia with an army of 30,000 men and decisively crushed the rebellion and its instigators at the battle of Bagrevand on April 24, 775, leaving a void for the sole largely intact family, the Bagratunis, to fill.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 45.</ref>\n\n===Rise of the Bagratids===\n{{Main|Bagratuni Dynasty}}\nThe Bagratuni family had done its best to improve its relations with the Abbasid caliphs ever since they took power in 750. The Abbasids always treated the family's overtures with suspicion but by the early 770s, the Bagratunis had won them over and the relationship between the two drastically improved: the Bagratuni family members were soon viewed as leaders of the Armenians in the region.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', p. 74.</ref> Following the end of the third rebellion, which the Bagratunis had wisely chosen not to participate in, and the dispersal of several of the princely houses, the family was left without any formidable rivals. Nevertheless, any immediate opportunities to take full control of the region was complicated by Arab immigration to Armenia and the caliph's appointment of ''[[emir]]s'' to rule in newly created administrative districts (''[[emirate]]s''). But the number of Arabs residing in Armenia never grew in number to form a majority nor were the emirates fully subordinate to the Caliph.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', pp. 74-75.</ref> As historian [[George Bournoutian]] observes, \"this fragmentation of Arab authority provided the opportunity for the resurgence\" of the Bagratuni family headed by Ashot Msaker (the \"Meat-Eater\").<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', p. 75.</ref>\n\nAshot began to annex the lands that formerly belonged to the Mamikonians and actively campaigned against the emirs as a sign of his allegiance to the Caliphate, who in 804 bestowed upon him the title of ''ishkhan''.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 68-69.</ref> Upon his death in 826, Ashot bequeathed his land to two of his sons: the eldest, [[Bagrat II Bagratuni]] received Taron and [[Sasun]] and inherited the prestigious title of ''ishkhanats ishkhan'', or prince of princes, whereas his brother, [[Smbat the Confessor]], became the ''[[sparapet]]'' of [[Sper (Armenia)|Sper]] and [[Tayk]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Grigoryan|first = Gnel|title = \u054f\u0561\u0580\u0578\u0576\u056b \u0532\u0561\u0563\u0580\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0556\u0565\u0578\u0564\u0561\u056c\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u053b\u0577\u056d\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0568 IX - X \u0534\u0561\u0580\u0565\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 (The Feudal Bagratuni Principality of Taron from the 9th to 10th Centuries)|publisher = Armenian Academy of Sciences|location= Yerevan, Armenian SSR|year = 1983|page= 56|isbn = |language=hy}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers, however, were unable to resolve their differences with one another nor able to form a unified front against the Muslims. A new Armenian rebellion against Arab rule broke out in 850 led by Bagrat and Ashot Artsruni of Vaspurakan but like previous rebellions, it failed: an Arab army led by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] general [[Bugha al-Kabir]] captured Bagrat, Smbat, and other Armenian princes and brutally put down the rebellion.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan.

In 857, Smbat had been succeeded by his son [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot I]], who took a measured approach to gradually retake territories formerly held by the Arabs. He assumed the title prince of princes in 862 and appointed his brother Abas sparapet, as they began to push the Arabs out from their base in Tayk.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/> His initial efforts to expel the ostikan of Arminiya failed, although this did not dissuade him in taking advantage of the Byzantine-Arab rivalry.<ref name=\"SAE3\">{{in lang|hy}} Arakelyan, Babken N.

Smbat continued his father's policy of maintaining cordial relations with Byzantium but he remained mindful of the Arabs' fears of the Armeno-Byzantine alliance. Speaking with the Arab ostikan [[Muhammad Ibn Abi'l-Saj]] (Afshin), Smbat convinced him that the alliance would not only be for the dual benefit of Byzantium and Armenia but would also work to the economic favor of the Arabs.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 242.</ref> Smbat also achieved a major victory when on April 21, 892, he recaptured the historic city of Dvin from the Arabs.\n\nSmbat's successes shortly came to a halt when Afshin decided that he could not countenance a powerful Armenia so close to his domains. He retook Dvin and managed to take Smbat's wife as a hostage until she was released in exchange for Smbat's son and nephew. The wars against Armenia continued even after Afshin's death in 901, when his brother [[Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj]] became ostikan of Arminiya. While Yusuf's reign was not immediately hostile, Smbat committed a series of blunders which led to several of his allies to turn their backs on him: having sought to placate his eastern ally, Smbat of Syunik, by ceding to him Nakhichevan city, Smbat inadvertently drove Gagik Artsruni of Vaspurakan into Yusuf's arms since the city was a part of Gagik's domains.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 123.</ref> Yusuf took advantage of this feud by awarding Gagik a crown in 908, thus making him King Gagik I of Vaspurakan and creating an Armenian state opposed to the one led by Smbat.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/>\n\nAs Yusuf began a new campaign against Smbat in conjunction with Gagik in 909, neither the Byzantines nor the Caliph sent aid to Smbat; several Armenian princes also chose to withhold their support. Those who did ally with Smbat were dealt brutally by Yusuf's powerful army: Smbat's son Mushegh, his nephew Smbat Bagratuni, and Grigor II of Western Syunik were all poisoned.<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", p. 157.</ref> Yusuf's army ravaged the rest of Armenia as it advanced towards Blue Fortress, where Smbat had taken refuge, and besieged it for some time. Smbat finally decided to surrender himself to Yusuf in 914 in hopes of ending the Arab onslaught; Yusuf, however, showed no compassion towards his prisoner as he tortured the Armenian king to death and put his headless body on display on a cross in Dvin.<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", pp. 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\n===Resurgence under Ashot Yerkat===\nYusuf's invasion of Armenia had left the kingdom in ruins and this fact resonated among the Armenian princes who were left aghast in witnessing the Arab ostikan's brutality. Gagik I was especially shaken and he soon disavowed his loyalty to Yusuf and began to campaign against him. With Yusuf distracted by the resistance put up by his former ally, Smbat's son [[Ashot II]] felt it appropriate to assume his father's throne. Ashot at once began to drive the Muslims out of his domains. Support for Ashot also arrived from the west: the Byzantine empress [[Zoe Karbonopsina|Zoe]] had watched the Arab invasion of Armenia unfold with consternation and so she ordered the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Nicholas Mystikos]] to write an official letter to the Armenian [[Catholicos]] to form a new alliance with Armenia.<ref>{{cite book| last = Runciman| first = Steven| authorlink= Steven Runciman| title =The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium| year = 1988| location = New York| page = 130| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn =  978-0-521-35722-7}}</ref> The Catholicos responded amicably and in 914, Ashot accepted an invitation by Zoe to visit Constantinople. There, Ashot was well received, and a Byzantine force was created to assist Armenia in defeating the Arabs. The force, accompanying Ashot and led by the [[Domestic of the Schools]] [[Leo Phokas the Elder|Leo Phokas]], moved out the next year and marched along Upper [[Euphrates]], entering Taron with scant opposition from the Arabs.<ref>Runciman. ''Romanus Lecapenus'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Yusuf's efforts to crush Gagik had failed miserably; instead, Yusuf turned his attention to Ashot and attempted to weaken his position by crowning Ashot's cousin, Ashot Shapuhyan, king of Armenia. Ashot Shapuhyan's and Yusuf's armies, though, were unable to stop the Byzantine advance, which stopped short of capturing Dvin due to the onset of winter. Nevertheless, the force had returned Ashot to a powerful position in Armenia and managed to inflict heavy casualties against the Arabs.<ref>Treadgold. ''Byzantine State and Society'', p. 474.</ref> This still left Ashot, the anti-king, in control in Dvin and civil war raged on from 918 to 920, when the pretender finally conceded defeat. Numerous other rebellions in Armenia also took place but Ashot was able to defeat each one of them. In 919, Yusuf had instigated a failed rebellion against the Caliph and was replaced by a far more well-disposed ostikan, [[Subuk]]. Subuk recognized Ashot as the legitimate ruler of Armenia and awarded him with the title of ''[[Shahanshah]]'', or \"king of kings.\"<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 136\u2013137.

In 928, Kourkouas reached Dvin in an unsuccessful attempt to capture a city that was defended by both the Arabs and Ashot. In 923, the Caliph, facing troubles at home, released Yusuf, who traveled back to Armenia to unleash his fury against Armenia and especially Gagik I.<ref>Runciman. ''Romanus Lecapenus'', p. 134.</ref> He began demanding tribute from the Armenians rulers rule but faced considerable resistance by Ashot II. Time and again, Ashot was able to defeat and rout the Arab armies sent against him for several years. Finally, in 929, Yusuf died and an immense power struggle ensued between rival [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] families in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], thus reducing the Arab threat to Armenia.

In the same year that he became king, Abas traveled to Dvin, where he was able to convince the Arab governor there to release several Armenian hostages and turn over control of the pontifical palace back to Armenia. Conflict between the Arabs were minimal too, with the exception of a military defeat Abas suffered near the city of Vagharshapat. He was far less conciliatory towards the Byzantines, who had repeatedly demonstrated their unreliability as allies by attacking and annexing Armenian territories. Romanus of Byzantium was also more focused on fighting the Arab [[Hamdanid]]s, leaving Abas virtually free to conduct his policies without foreign hindrance.<ref>Runciman. ''Romanus Lecapenus'', pp. 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nAnother foreign threat that Abas steadfastly confronted was an invasion by king Ber of [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]] in 943: a new church had been completed in Kars under Abas' orders and prior to its consecration, Ber had appeared with an army along the river of the [[Araxes]], demanding that the new church be consecrated under [[Chalcedonian]] rite.<ref>Chamchyants. ''History of Armenia'', pp. 82\u201383.</ref> Abas refused to make any concessions and ambushed Ber's forces in a dawn assault. Several more [[skirmish]]es took place, wherein Ber was finally captured by Abas' men. Abas took the king to his new church and told him that he would never see it again, [[wikt:blinding|blinding]] him and sending him back to Abkhazia. Abas died in 953, leaving his kingdom to his two sons, Ashot III and Mushegh.\n\n===Armenia's Golden Age===\n[[File:Gagik I Bagratuni.JPG|thumb|220px|A statue of King [[Gagik I of Armenia|Gagik I]] that originally had him holding a model of the Church of St. Gregory.]]\n[[Ashot III]]'s official [[investiture]] as king of Armenia took place in 961, following the relocation of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]] from Vaspurakan to Argina, near the city of [[Ani]].

''History of the Armenian People''. vol. iii. Yerevan, Armenian SSR: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1976, p. 53.</ref> In that same year, Ashot had also relocated the capital from Kars to Ani. The Bagratuni kings had never chosen a city to settle in, alternating from [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]] to [[Shirakavan (ancient city)|Shirakavan]] to Kars; Kars never did reach a status where it could become a capital and Dvin was disregarded altogether, given its proximity to the hostile emirates. Ani's natural defenses were well suited Ashot's desire to secure an area which could withstand siege and fell on a trade route that passed from Dvin to Trebizond.<ref>Arakelyan. \"Bagratuni Kingdom\", pp. 52-58.</ref>\n\nOwing to this trade route, the city quickly began to grow and became Bagratuni Armenia's chief political, cultural and economic center. Shops, markets, workshops, inns were established by the city's merchants and populace while the nakharar elite went on to sponsor the building of magnificent mansions and palaces. The construction was also complemented by the King Ashot's own philanthropy, including the building of the famed \"Ashotashen\" walls that were erected around Ani, monasteries, hospitals, schools, and almshouses (his wife Khosrovanuysh also founded the monastery complexes at [[Sanahin]] in 966 and [[Haghpat]] in 976). Ashot's sponsorship of the construction of all these edifices earned him the nickname of \"Voghormats\", or \"the Merciful.\"<ref>{{in lang|hy}} [[Stepanos Asoghik|Stepanos Taronetsi (Asoghik)]].

When a Byzantine army led by the Byzantine emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]] entered Taron in 973, purportedly to avenge the death of his Domestic killed at the hands of the Arabs in [[Mosul]], Ashot mobilized an 80,000 man army to meet and force its withdrawal.<ref>Grigoryan. ''Principality of Taron'', pp. 153\u2013155. According to [[Sempad the Constable]], the actual intent of the Byzantine army was to invade the Bagratuni kingdom itself; other historians have explained that the Byzantines also wanted to consolidate their hold over Taron, which had become a military theme when it was annexed in 966. See Grigoryan. ''Principality of Taron'', pp. 153\u2013154, note 165.</ref> In the following year, he concluded an alliance with Tzimiskes and sent 10,000 Armenian troops to campaign with the emperor against the Muslim emirates in [[Aleppo]] and Mosul. Ashot also had unsuccessfully attempted to capture Dvin from the [[Shaddadid]] emir in 953; he had laid siege to it for quite some time but was forced to lift it after finding the city too well defended.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 168\u2013171.</ref>\n\n===Sub-kingdoms===\nA new phenomenon that began under Ashot III's reign, and continued under his successors, was the establishment of sub-kingdoms throughout Bagratuni Armenia. Ashot III had sent his brother Mushegh I to rule in Kars (Vanand) and had allowed him to use the title of king. The administrative district of Dzoraget near Lake Sevan was given to Ashot's son [[Kiurike I|Gurgen]], the progenitor of the Kyurikid line, in 966, who would later assume the title of king. The proliferation of so many kingdoms worked to the benefit of Armenia so long as the king in Ani remained strong and maintained his hegemony over other kings. Otherwise, the kings, as well their respective bishops who would claim the position of catholicos and formulate their own doctrines, would begin to test the limits of their autonomy.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Progress under Smbat and Gagik===\nThis prosperous age which Armenia lived through continued unabated under the reign of Ashot's son and successor, [[Smbat II]]. Ani had grown so large by the time of Smbat's accession in 977, that a second set of walls, known as the Smbatashen walls, were ordered built by the new king.<ref name=\"SAE2\"/>\n\n[[File:Bagratid Armenia, 962-1064.gif|thumb|270px|left|Bagratid Armenia and neighboring Armenian states of Vaspurakan, Taron, [[Kingdom of Syunik|Syunik-Baghk]], [[Khachen]], etc.]]\n\n===Decline and Byzantine encroachment===\nThe Byzantines had slowly been creeping eastward towards Armenia in the final decade of the 10th century. Emperor [[Basil II]]'s numerous victories against the Arabs and internal Arab struggles helped clear a path towards the Caucasus. Constantinople's official policy was that no Christian ruler is equal to or independent of the Byzantine emperor, and even if it was at time masked with diplomatic compromises, the empire's ultimate goal was the complete annexation of the Armenian realms.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\">{{cite book | last = Hovannisian | first = Richard G. | title = The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2004 | location = New York | pages = 187\u2013193 | isbn=1-4039-6421-1}}</ref> By the middle of the 10th century, the Byzantine Empire lay along the full length of the western border of Armenia. Taron was the first Armenian region annexed by the Byzantine Empire. In a certain sense, the Byzantines considered the Bagratuni princes of Taron as their vassals, for they had consistently accepted titles, such as that of ''strategos'', and stipends from Constantinople. With the death of Ashot Bagratuni of Taron in 967 (not to be confused with [[Ashot III]]), his sons [[Gregory Taronites|Gregory]] and Bagrat were not able to withstand the pressure from the empire, which annexed their principality outright and converted it to a theme.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\nThe [[Ardzruni]] kingdom of Vaspurakan was later annexed as well. In 1003, the last ruler of the kingdom [[Senekerim-Hovhannes]], son-in-law of King Gagik I of Ani, had brushed aside his nephews to become the sole king of Vaspurakan. His rule became even more precarious in the second decade of the 11th century with the plundering raids of various [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] groups. In 1016, Senekerim-Hovhannes thus offered Basil II the lands of Vaspurakan, including 72 fortresses and 3000-4000 villages, in exchange for a vast domain farther west on the Byzantine territory centered on the city of [[Sivas|Sebastia]] to which he moved in 1021 together with his family and 14,000 retainers.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/> Basil II had meanwhile already sent an army from the Balkans to Vaspurakan (which they also called Vasprakania, Asprakania, or Media) even before Senekerim-Hovhannes' offer and reduced it to another Byzantine theme with Van as regional capital. With the fall of the Ardzruni kingdom, Byzantine power was firmly established on the Armenian highlands, with only the Bagratuni and [[Kingdom of Artsakh|Eastern Syunik and Baghk]] kingdoms remaining independent.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\n[[File:105ByzantExpan3-966-1064.png|thumb|270px|right|Bagratid Armenia, annexed by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Syunik|Syunik]].]]\n\n===Internal Quarrels and Fall===\nAfter the death of King Gagik I (in 1017 or 1020), the kingdom was split between his two sons, [[Hovhannes-Smbat]] who received the territory of Ani, and [[Ashot IV the Brave]] who kept a territory that should have included Dvin, but which he could not occupy because of its capture by the [[Shaddadid]] [[Abu'l-Aswar Shavur ibn Fadl]] from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Gandzak]].<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/> The two brothers fought throughout their lives. In these tumultuous days, embroiled in territorial quarrels, the childless Hovhannes-Smbat sent the ''catholicos'' [[Petros Getadarts]] to Byzantium in order to negotiate a partial respite by leaving his kingdom to the empire after his death. Immediate results of this action were unknown, but after the death of the two brothers in 1040\u201341, the new Byzantine emperor and successor to Basil II claimed the kingdom of Bagratid Armenia. The son of Ashot, young Gagik II with the support of ''sparapet'' Vahram Pahlavouni and his followers, reigned only for a period of two years. Despite internal dissention led by pro-Byzantine overseer or stuard [[Sargis Haykazn]], the Armenian king was able to repel a Turkmen attack.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/> However, possibly with the persuasion of Sargis, he accepted the invitation of emperor [[Constantine IX]] to Constantinople, where he was obliged to cede his domain to the empire in exchange for a domain in [[Cappadocia]]. In 1044, the Byzantines twice invaded Ani but failed to conquer it. In view of this dire situation, catholicos Petros Getadarts, who governed Ani in the king's absence, surrendered Ani to the Byzantines in 1045. Ani was then annexed to the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Iberia (theme)|Iberia]] which was renamed \"Iberia and Ani\" or \"Iberia and Armenia\".<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\nThe Bagratid king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, still kept his throne even after 1064 when Ani fell to the [[Seljuk Turks]], but even he was constrained to cede his lands to the Byzantines and retreat to Anatolia, only to see Kars captured by the Turks in 1065. In Baghk and Eastern Syunik, only a few Armenian fortresses remained.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\n==Culture and society==\n\n===Government===\nThe king of Bagratuni Armenia held unlimited powers and was the ultimate authority when it came to resolving questions on foreign and domestic affairs. The princes and nakharars were directly subordinate to the king and received and kept their lands only through his permission. Should certain nobles have disobeyed the king's orders, he would have the right to confiscate their lands and distribute them to other nobles.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/> The concept of [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]], however, did not exist and insubordination by the nakharar elite could only be matched by the steadfastness of the king himself.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Armenian Apostolic Church|Tondrakians}}\n[[File:AniCathedral.JPG|thumb|240px|The [[Cathedral of Ani]], completed in 1001 by [[Trdat the Architect]].]]\n\nMost Armenians belonged to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] but there were elements in Armenian society who also adhered to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. Byzantium repeatedly demanded for communion with the Armenian Church as prerequisite for sending aid to the Bagratunis but most attempts failed to bear any fruit.\n\nIn the mid-10th century, a new internal challenge to the authority of the Armenian Church and the kingdom arose when the [[Tondrakians]] experienced a revival. An anti-feudal and heretical Christian sect that had been crushed by the Arabs with the Armenian Church's support in the 9th century, the Tondrakian movement attracted many followers during this period.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 234-236.</ref> Ashot III had realized the danger the Tondrakians posed against the kingdom and this was of his reasons why he directly subjected the Church to him, gave it lands, and sponsored the construction of new monasteries and churches.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 236.</ref> The message of the Tondrakians, however, continued to spread and successive Armenian kings would work to suppress its expansion.\n\n===Economy===\nThe Bagratuni kingdom was based on essentially two economies: one which was centered around [[agriculture]] based on [[feudalism]] and the other which was concentrated on [[mercantilism]] in towns and cities. Peasants (known as ''ramiks'') formed the lowest class in the economic stratum and largely busied themselves with raising [[livestock]] and [[farming]]. Many of them did not own land, and lived as tenants and worked as hired hands or even slaves on the lands owned by wealthy feudal magnates. Peasants were forced to pay heavy taxes to the government and the Armenian Apostolic Church in addition to their feudal lords.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/> Most peasants remained poor and the massive tax burden they shouldered sometimes culminated in peasant uprisings which the state was forced to put down.<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Hewsen|first = Robert H|authorlink =Robert Hewsen|title = Armenia: A Historical Atlas|publisher = University Of Chicago Press|location= Chicago|year = 2000|page= 112|isbn =978-0-226-33228-4}}</ref>\n\nThe Bagratuni kingdom did not mint any of its own coins, and used the currency found in Byzantium and the Arab Caliphate. The expanded trade between Byzantium and the Caliphate established several trades routes which ran across Armenia. The most important route began from [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], in Byzantium, and from there it connected to the cities of Ani, Kars, and Artsn. The city of Kars allowed trade to move north, to ports on the [[Black Sea]] and to [[Abkhazia]]; other routes were connected to cities in [[Anatolia]] and [[Iran]]; and the main route leading from the Caliphate to [[Kievan Rus]] was known as the \"Great Armenian Highway.\"<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", p. 178.</ref> Ani did not lie along any previously important trade routes, but because of its size, power, and wealth it became an important trading hub. From Ani, Armenia exported [[textiles]], [[metalwork]], [[armor]], [[jewelry]], horses, cattle, salt, wine, honey, [[timber]], leather, and [[furs]].<ref name=\"Hewsen. Armenia, p. 112\">Hewsen. ''Armenia'', p. 112.</ref> Its primary trading partners were the Byzantine Empire, the Arabs but also traded with Kievan Rus and [[Central Asia]].<ref name=\"SAE2\"/> Armenian-populated Dvin remained an important city on par with Ani, as evidenced in a vivid description by the Arab historian and geographer al-Mukadasi:\n\n{{quotation|Dabil [Dvin] is an important city, in it are an inaccessible citadel and great riches. Its name is ancient, its cloth is famous, its river is abundant, it is surrounded by gardens. The city has suburbs, its fortress is reliable, its squares are cross-shaped, its fields are wonderful. The main mosque is on a hill and next to the mosque is the church....By the city is a citadel. The buildings of the inhabitants are made of clay or stone. The city has main gates such as Bab ['Gate']-Keydar, Bab-Tiflis and Bab-Ani.<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", p. 179.</ref>}}\n\nDvin became famous throughout the Arab world for its wool and silk production and the export of pillows, rugs, curtains and covers. A village named Artashat near Dvin was so prominent a center for the production of [[Armenian cochineal]] that it received the name ''vordan karmiri gyugh'' (\"red-worm village\") for the distinctive red dye that was derived from insects. Cochineal and other Armenian goods were extensively found throughout the caliphate and for their eminence were referred to by Arabs as \"asfin al-Armani\" (\"Armenian products\").<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 239-240.</ref>\n[[File:Grigor Narekatsi 1.jpg|thumb|A portrait of [[Grigor Narekatsi]] from an 1173 illuminated manuscript]]\n\n===Demographics===\n[[File:Echmiadzin tempietto.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from the [[Echmiadzin Gospels]] completed in 989]]\nDuring the Bagratuni period, the great majority of the population of Armenia remained Armenian. 10th-century  Arab sources attest that the cities of the Araxes valley remained predominantly Armenian and Christian despite Arab Muslim rule. In fact, the 10th-century  Arab geographer [[Ibn Hawqal]] specified that Armenian was used in [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] and [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]].<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times 2\">Hovannisian. ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I'', pp. 176\u2013177.</ref> Regardless, there was a notable Muslim presence in certain regions of Armenia. For instance, the southern region of [[Aghdznik]] was heavily Arabized since earlier periods of Muslim dominance. On the north shore of Lake Van in the ninth and tenth centuries, there was also a considerable Muslim population that consisted of ethnic Arabs, and later [[Dailamites]] from Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times 2\"/>\n\n===Art and literature===\n{{Main|Armenian architecture|Armenian literature}}\nThe Arab raids and invasion of Armenia as well as the devastation wrought upon the land during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|Byzantine-Arab wars]] had largely stifled any expression of Armenian culture in fields such as [[historiography]], [[literature]] and [[architecture]]. These restrictions disappeared when the Bagratuni kingdom was established, ushering in a new golden age of Armenian culture.\n\nThe lack of a strong Arab presence saw a rise in the number of [[historian]]s, who wrote and documented the relations between Armenia and other countries and described many events that took place from the seventh to eleventh centuries. Thanks to the patronage of the kings and nobles, monasteries became centers for the study and writing of literature throughout the kingdom.<ref name=\"Hewsen. Armenia, p. 112\"/> The monasteries of [[Haghpat]] and Sanahin were well-known centers for higher learning. Notable figures in Armenian literature and philosophy during this period included the mystic [[Grigor Narekatsi]] and [[Grigor Magistros]].\n\nThe art of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] illustrations were also revived during this era. The relative period of peace between Byzantium and Armenia during the second half of the 10th century led to a great deal of interaction between Armenian artists and their Greek counterparts. Armenian manuscript authors tended either to stress the natural look of the human body in illustrations or to forgo it and instead concentrate on the aspect of decoration.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nArmenian architecture during the Bagratuni era was especially prominent and \"most of the surviving churches in present-day Armenia are from this period.\"<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', p. 90.</ref> The city of Ani, situated on the important trade intersection between the Byzantines, Arabs, and merchants of other countries, grew throughout the 9th century both commercially and culturally, earning renown for its \"40 gates and 1,001 churches.\"<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> The churches of this period expanded on 7th century designs; they were often steeper in elevation, introduced donor portraits in the round and incorporated ideas from Byzantine and Islamic architecture.<ref>Taylor, Alice. \"Armenian Art and Architecture\" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]''.

In 661, Armenian leaders agreed to submit under Muslim rule while the latter conceded to recognize Grigor Mamikonian from the powerful [[Mamikonian]] ''[[nakharar]]'' family as ''ishkhan'' (or prince) of Armenia.<ref>{{cite book|last = Ter-Ghevondyan|first = Aram N.|authorlink = Aram Ter-Ghevondyan|title = \u0531\u0580\u0561\u0562\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u0531\u0574\u056b\u0580\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0576\u0565\u0580\u0568 \u0532\u0561\u0563\u0580\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0575\u0561\u0581 \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0561\u057d\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0574 (The Arab Emirates in Bagratuni Armenia)|publisher = Armenian Academy of Sciences\n|location= Yerevan, Armenian SSRyear = 1965|pages= 42\u201343|isbn = |language=hy}}</ref> Known as \"al-Arminiya\" with its capital at [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], the province was headed by an ''[[ostikan]]'', or governor.\n\nHowever, Umayyad rule in Armenia grew in cruelty in the early 8th century. Revolts against the Arabs spread throughout Armenia until 705, when under the pretext of meeting for negotiations, the Arab ostikan of [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]] massacred almost all of the Armenian [[nobility]].<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 44.</ref> The Arabs attempted to conciliate with the Armenians but the levying of higher taxes, impoverishment of the country due to a lack of regional trade, and the Umayyads' preference of the [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni family]] over the Mamikonians (other notable families included the [[Artsruni]], [[Kamsarakan]], and [[Rshtuni]]) made this difficult to accomplish. Taking advantage of the overthrow of the Umayyads by the '[[Abbasids]], a second rebellion was conceived although it too was met with failure partly because of the frictional relationship between the Bagratuni and Mamikonian families. The rebellion's failure also resulted in the near disintegration of the Mamikonian house which lost most of the land it controlled (members of the Artstruni house were able to escape and settle in [[Vaspurakan]]).\n\nA third and final rebellion, stemming from similar grievances as the second, was launched in 774 under the leadership of Mushegh Mamikonian and with the support of other ''nakharars''. The Abbasid Arabs, however, marched into Armenia with an army of 30,000 men and decisively crushed the rebellion and its instigators at the battle of Bagrevand on April 24, 775, leaving a void for the sole largely intact family, the Bagratunis, to fill.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 45.</ref>\n\n===Rise of the Bagratids===\n{{Main|Bagratuni Dynasty}}\nThe Bagratuni family had done its best to improve its relations with the Abbasid caliphs ever since they took power in 750. The Abbasids always treated the family's overtures with suspicion but by the early 770s, the Bagratunis had won them over and the relationship between the two drastically improved: the Bagratuni family members were soon viewed as leaders of the Armenians in the region.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', p. 74.</ref> Following the end of the third rebellion, which the Bagratunis had wisely chosen not to participate in, and the dispersal of several of the princely houses, the family was left without any formidable rivals. Nevertheless, any immediate opportunities to take full control of the region was complicated by Arab immigration to Armenia and the caliph's appointment of ''[[emir]]s'' to rule in newly created administrative districts (''[[emirate]]s''). But the number of Arabs residing in Armenia never grew in number to form a majority nor were the emirates fully subordinate to the Caliph.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', pp. 74-75.</ref> As historian [[George Bournoutian]] observes, \"this fragmentation of Arab authority provided the opportunity for the resurgence\" of the Bagratuni family headed by Ashot Msaker (the \"Meat-Eater\").<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', p. 75.</ref>\n\nAshot began to annex the lands that formerly belonged to the Mamikonians and actively campaigned against the emirs as a sign of his allegiance to the Caliphate, who in 804 bestowed upon him the title of ''ishkhan''.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 68-69.</ref> Upon his death in 826, Ashot bequeathed his land to two of his sons: the eldest, [[Bagrat II Bagratuni]] received Taron and [[Sasun]] and inherited the prestigious title of ''ishkhanats ishkhan'', or prince of princes, whereas his brother, [[Smbat the Confessor]], became the ''[[sparapet]]'' of [[Sper (Armenia)|Sper]] and [[Tayk]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Grigoryan|first = Gnel|title = \u054f\u0561\u0580\u0578\u0576\u056b \u0532\u0561\u0563\u0580\u0561\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0576\u056b\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0556\u0565\u0578\u0564\u0561\u056c\u0561\u056f\u0561\u0576 \u053b\u0577\u056d\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0578\u0582\u0576\u0568 IX - X \u0534\u0561\u0580\u0565\u0580\u0578\u0582\u0574 (The Feudal Bagratuni Principality of Taron from the 9th to 10th Centuries)|publisher = Armenian Academy of Sciences|location= Yerevan, Armenian SSR|year = 1983|page= 56|isbn = |language=hy}}</ref>\n\nThe brothers, however, were unable to resolve their differences with one another nor able to form a unified front against the Muslims. A new Armenian rebellion against Arab rule broke out in 850 led by Bagrat and Ashot Artsruni of Vaspurakan but like previous rebellions, it failed: an Arab army led by the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] general [[Bugha al-Kabir]] captured Bagrat, Smbat, and other Armenian princes and brutally put down the rebellion.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan.

In 857, Smbat had been succeeded by his son [[Ashot I of Armenia|Ashot I]], who took a measured approach to gradually retake territories formerly held by the Arabs. He assumed the title prince of princes in 862 and appointed his brother Abas sparapet, as they began to push the Arabs out from their base in Tayk.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/> His initial efforts to expel the ostikan of Arminiya failed, although this did not dissuade him in taking advantage of the Byzantine-Arab rivalry.<ref name=\"SAE3\">{{in lang|hy}} Arakelyan, Babken N.

Smbat continued his father's policy of maintaining cordial relations with Byzantium but he remained mindful of the Arabs' fears of the Armeno-Byzantine alliance. Speaking with the Arab ostikan [[Muhammad Ibn Abi'l-Saj]] (Afshin), Smbat convinced him that the alliance would not only be for the dual benefit of Byzantium and Armenia but would also work to the economic favor of the Arabs.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 242.</ref> Smbat also achieved a major victory when on April 21, 892, he recaptured the historic city of Dvin from the Arabs.\n\nSmbat's successes shortly came to a halt when Afshin decided that he could not countenance a powerful Armenia so close to his domains. He retook Dvin and managed to take Smbat's wife as a hostage until she was released in exchange for Smbat's son and nephew. The wars against Armenia continued even after Afshin's death in 901, when his brother [[Yusuf Ibn Abi'l-Saj]] became ostikan of Arminiya. While Yusuf's reign was not immediately hostile, Smbat committed a series of blunders which led to several of his allies to turn their backs on him: having sought to placate his eastern ally, Smbat of Syunik, by ceding to him Nakhichevan city, Smbat inadvertently drove Gagik Artsruni of Vaspurakan into Yusuf's arms since the city was a part of Gagik's domains.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 123.</ref> Yusuf took advantage of this feud by awarding Gagik a crown in 908, thus making him King Gagik I of Vaspurakan and creating an Armenian state opposed to the one led by Smbat.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/>\n\nAs Yusuf began a new campaign against Smbat in conjunction with Gagik in 909, neither the Byzantines nor the Caliph sent aid to Smbat; several Armenian princes also chose to withhold their support. Those who did ally with Smbat were dealt brutally by Yusuf's powerful army: Smbat's son Mushegh, his nephew Smbat Bagratuni, and Grigor II of Western Syunik were all poisoned.<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", p. 157.</ref> Yusuf's army ravaged the rest of Armenia as it advanced towards Blue Fortress, where Smbat had taken refuge, and besieged it for some time. Smbat finally decided to surrender himself to Yusuf in 914 in hopes of ending the Arab onslaught; Yusuf, however, showed no compassion towards his prisoner as he tortured the Armenian king to death and put his headless body on display on a cross in Dvin.<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", pp. 157\u2013158.</ref>\n\n===Resurgence under Ashot Yerkat===\nYusuf's invasion of Armenia had left the kingdom in ruins and this fact resonated among the Armenian princes who were left aghast in witnessing the Arab ostikan's brutality. Gagik I was especially shaken and he soon disavowed his loyalty to Yusuf and began to campaign against him. With Yusuf distracted by the resistance put up by his former ally, Smbat's son [[Ashot II]] felt it appropriate to assume his father's throne. Ashot at once began to drive the Muslims out of his domains. Support for Ashot also arrived from the west: the Byzantine empress [[Zoe Karbonopsina|Zoe]] had watched the Arab invasion of Armenia unfold with consternation and so she ordered the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Nicholas Mystikos]] to write an official letter to the Armenian [[Catholicos]] to form a new alliance with Armenia.<ref>{{cite book| last = Runciman| first = Steven| authorlink= Steven Runciman| title =The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and his Reign: A Study of Tenth-Century Byzantium| year = 1988| location = New York| page = 130| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn =  978-0-521-35722-7}}</ref> The Catholicos responded amicably and in 914, Ashot accepted an invitation by Zoe to visit Constantinople. There, Ashot was well received, and a Byzantine force was created to assist Armenia in defeating the Arabs. The force, accompanying Ashot and led by the [[Domestic of the Schools]] [[Leo Phokas the Elder|Leo Phokas]], moved out the next year and marched along Upper [[Euphrates]], entering Taron with scant opposition from the Arabs.<ref>Runciman. ''Romanus Lecapenus'', p. 131.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Yusuf's efforts to crush Gagik had failed miserably; instead, Yusuf turned his attention to Ashot and attempted to weaken his position by crowning Ashot's cousin, Ashot Shapuhyan, king of Armenia. Ashot Shapuhyan's and Yusuf's armies, though, were unable to stop the Byzantine advance, which stopped short of capturing Dvin due to the onset of winter. Nevertheless, the force had returned Ashot to a powerful position in Armenia and managed to inflict heavy casualties against the Arabs.<ref>Treadgold. ''Byzantine State and Society'', p. 474.</ref> This still left Ashot, the anti-king, in control in Dvin and civil war raged on from 918 to 920, when the pretender finally conceded defeat. Numerous other rebellions in Armenia also took place but Ashot was able to defeat each one of them. In 919, Yusuf had instigated a failed rebellion against the Caliph and was replaced by a far more well-disposed ostikan, [[Subuk]]. Subuk recognized Ashot as the legitimate ruler of Armenia and awarded him with the title of ''[[Shahanshah]]'', or \"king of kings.\"<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 136\u2013137.

In 928, Kourkouas reached Dvin in an unsuccessful attempt to capture a city that was defended by both the Arabs and Ashot. In 923, the Caliph, facing troubles at home, released Yusuf, who traveled back to Armenia to unleash his fury against Armenia and especially Gagik I.<ref>Runciman. ''Romanus Lecapenus'', p. 134.</ref> He began demanding tribute from the Armenians rulers rule but faced considerable resistance by Ashot II. Time and again, Ashot was able to defeat and rout the Arab armies sent against him for several years. Finally, in 929, Yusuf died and an immense power struggle ensued between rival [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] families in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]], thus reducing the Arab threat to Armenia. Byzantine emperor [[Romanos I|Romanos Lekapenos]] also turned his attention from the east to fight the Arabs in [[Syria]].

In the same year that he became king, Abas traveled to Dvin, where he was able to convince the Arab governor there to release several Armenian hostages and turn over control of the pontifical palace back to Armenia. Conflict between the Arabs were minimal too, with the exception of a military defeat Abas suffered near the city of Vagharshapat. He was far less conciliatory towards the Byzantines, who had repeatedly demonstrated their unreliability as allies by attacking and annexing Armenian territories. Romanus of Byzantium was also more focused on fighting the Arab [[Hamdanid]]s, leaving Abas virtually free to conduct his policies without foreign hindrance.<ref>Runciman. ''Romanus Lecapenus'', pp. 156\u2013157.</ref>\n\nAnother foreign threat that Abas steadfastly confronted was an invasion by king Ber of [[Kingdom of Abkhazia|Abkhazia]] in 943: a new church had been completed in Kars under Abas' orders and prior to its consecration, Ber had appeared with an army along the river of the [[Araxes]], demanding that the new church be consecrated under [[Chalcedonian]] rite.<ref>Chamchyants. ''History of Armenia'', pp. 82\u201383.</ref> Abas refused to make any concessions and ambushed Ber's forces in a dawn assault. Several more [[skirmish]]es took place, wherein Ber was finally captured by Abas' men. Abas took the king to his new church and told him that he would never see it again, [[wikt:blinding|blinding]] him and sending him back to Abkhazia. Abas died in 953, leaving his kingdom to his two sons, Ashot III and Mushegh.\n\n===Armenia's Golden Age===\n[[File:Gagik I Bagratuni.JPG|thumb|220px|A statue of King [[Gagik I of Armenia|Gagik I]] that originally had him holding a model of the Church of St. Gregory.]]\n[[Ashot III]]'s official [[investiture]] as king of Armenia took place in 961, following the relocation of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]] from Vaspurakan to Argina, near the city of [[Ani]].

The Bagratuni kings had never chosen a city to settle in, alternating from [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]] to [[Shirakavan (ancient city)|Shirakavan]] to Kars; Kars never did reach a status where it could become a capital and Dvin was disregarded altogether, given its proximity to the hostile emirates. Ani's natural defenses were well suited Ashot's desire to secure an area which could withstand siege and fell on a trade route that passed from Dvin to Trebizond.<ref>Arakelyan. \"Bagratuni Kingdom\", pp. 52-58.</ref>\n\nOwing to this trade route, the city quickly began to grow and became Bagratuni Armenia's chief political, cultural and economic center. Shops, markets, workshops, inns were established by the city's merchants and populace while the nakharar elite went on to sponsor the building of magnificent mansions and palaces. The construction was also complemented by the King Ashot's own philanthropy, including the building of the famed \"Ashotashen\" walls that were erected around Ani, monasteries, hospitals, schools, and almshouses (his wife Khosrovanuysh also founded the monastery complexes at [[Sanahin]] in 966 and [[Haghpat]] in 976).

When a Byzantine army led by the Byzantine emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]] entered Taron in 973, purportedly to avenge the death of his Domestic killed at the hands of the Arabs in [[Mosul]], Ashot mobilized an 80,000 man army to meet and force its withdrawal.<ref>Grigoryan. ''Principality of Taron'', pp. 153\u2013155. According to [[Sempad the Constable]], the actual intent of the Byzantine army was to invade the Bagratuni kingdom itself; other historians have explained that the Byzantines also wanted to consolidate their hold over Taron, which had become a military theme when it was annexed in 966. See Grigoryan. ''Principality of Taron'', pp. 153\u2013154, note 165.</ref> In the following year, he concluded an alliance with Tzimiskes and sent 10,000 Armenian troops to campaign with the emperor against the Muslim emirates in [[Aleppo]] and Mosul. Ashot also had unsuccessfully attempted to capture Dvin from the [[Shaddadid]] emir in 953; he had laid siege to it for quite some time but was forced to lift it after finding the city too well defended.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 168\u2013171.</ref>\n\n===Sub-kingdoms===\nA new phenomenon that began under Ashot III's reign, and continued under his successors, was the establishment of sub-kingdoms throughout Bagratuni Armenia. Ashot III had sent his brother Mushegh I to rule in Kars (Vanand) and had allowed him to use the title of king. The administrative district of Dzoraget near Lake Sevan was given to Ashot's son [[Kiurike I|Gurgen]], the progenitor of the Kyurikid line, in 966, who would later assume the title of king. The proliferation of so many kingdoms worked to the benefit of Armenia so long as the king in Ani remained strong and maintained his hegemony over other kings. Otherwise, the kings, as well their respective bishops who would claim the position of catholicos and formulate their own doctrines, would begin to test the limits of their autonomy.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\n===Progress under Smbat and Gagik===\nThis prosperous age which Armenia lived through continued unabated under the reign of Ashot's son and successor, [[Smbat II]]. Ani had grown so large by the time of Smbat's accession in 977, that a second set of walls, known as the Smbatashen walls, were ordered built by the new king.<ref name=\"SAE2\"/>\n\n[[File:Bagratid Armenia, 962-1064.gif|thumb|270px|left|Bagratid Armenia and neighboring Armenian states of Vaspurakan, Taron, [[Kingdom of Syunik|Syunik-Baghk]], [[Khachen]], etc.]]\n\n===Decline and Byzantine encroachment===\nThe Byzantines had slowly been creeping eastward towards Armenia in the final decade of the 10th century. Emperor [[Basil II]]'s numerous victories against the Arabs and internal Arab struggles helped clear a path towards the Caucasus. Constantinople's official policy was that no Christian ruler is equal to or independent of the Byzantine emperor, and even if it was at time masked with diplomatic compromises, the empire's ultimate goal was the complete annexation of the Armenian realms.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\">{{cite book | last = Hovannisian | first = Richard G. | title = The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I: The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2004 | location = New York | pages = 187\u2013193 | isbn=1-4039-6421-1}}</ref> By the middle of the 10th century, the Byzantine Empire lay along the full length of the western border of Armenia. Taron was the first Armenian region annexed by the Byzantine Empire. In a certain sense, the Byzantines considered the Bagratuni princes of Taron as their vassals, for they had consistently accepted titles, such as that of ''strategos'', and stipends from Constantinople. With the death of Ashot Bagratuni of Taron in 967 (not to be confused with [[Ashot III]]), his sons [[Gregory Taronites|Gregory]] and Bagrat were not able to withstand the pressure from the empire, which annexed their principality outright and converted it to a theme.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\nThe [[Ardzruni]] kingdom of Vaspurakan was later annexed as well. In 1003, the last ruler of the kingdom [[Senekerim-Hovhannes]], son-in-law of King Gagik I of Ani, had brushed aside his nephews to become the sole king of Vaspurakan. His rule became even more precarious in the second decade of the 11th century with the plundering raids of various [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] groups. In 1016, Senekerim-Hovhannes thus offered Basil II the lands of Vaspurakan, including 72 fortresses and 3000-4000 villages, in exchange for a vast domain farther west on the Byzantine territory centered on the city of [[Sivas|Sebastia]] to which he moved in 1021 together with his family and 14,000 retainers.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/> Basil II had meanwhile already sent an army from the Balkans to Vaspurakan (which they also called Vasprakania, Asprakania, or Media) even before Senekerim-Hovhannes' offer and reduced it to another Byzantine theme with Van as regional capital. With the fall of the Ardzruni kingdom, Byzantine power was firmly established on the Armenian highlands, with only the Bagratuni and [[Kingdom of Artsakh|Eastern Syunik and Baghk]] kingdoms remaining independent.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\n[[File:105ByzantExpan3-966-1064.png|thumb|270px|right|Bagratid Armenia, annexed by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Syunik|Syunik]].]]\n\n===Internal Quarrels and Fall===\nAfter the death of King Gagik I (in 1017 or 1020), the kingdom was split between his two sons, [[Hovhannes-Smbat]] who received the territory of Ani, and [[Ashot IV the Brave]] who kept a territory that should have included Dvin, but which he could not occupy because of its capture by the [[Shaddadid]] [[Abu'l-Aswar Shavur ibn Fadl]] from [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Gandzak]].<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/> The two brothers fought throughout their lives. In these tumultuous days, embroiled in territorial quarrels, the childless Hovhannes-Smbat sent the ''catholicos'' [[Petros Getadarts]] to Byzantium in order to negotiate a partial respite by leaving his kingdom to the empire after his death. Immediate results of this action were unknown, but after the death of the two brothers in 1040\u201341, the new Byzantine emperor and successor to Basil II claimed the kingdom of Bagratid Armenia. The son of Ashot, young Gagik II with the support of ''sparapet'' Vahram Pahlavouni and his followers, reigned only for a period of two years. Despite internal dissention led by pro-Byzantine overseer or stuard [[Sargis Haykazn]], the Armenian king was able to repel a Turkmen attack.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/> However, possibly with the persuasion of Sargis, he accepted the invitation of emperor [[Constantine IX]] to Constantinople, where he was obliged to cede his domain to the empire in exchange for a domain in [[Cappadocia]]. In 1044, the Byzantines twice invaded Ani but failed to conquer it. In view of this dire situation, catholicos Petros Getadarts, who governed Ani in the king's absence, surrendered Ani to the Byzantines in 1045. Ani was then annexed to the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of [[Iberia (theme)|Iberia]] which was renamed \"Iberia and Ani\" or \"Iberia and Armenia\".<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\nThe Bagratid king of Kars, Gagik-Abas, still kept his throne even after 1064 when Ani fell to the [[Seljuk Turks]], but even he was constrained to cede his lands to the Byzantines and retreat to Anatolia, only to see Kars captured by the Turks in 1065. In Baghk and Eastern Syunik, only a few Armenian fortresses remained.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times\"/>\n\n==Culture and society==\n\n===Government===\nThe king of Bagratuni Armenia held unlimited powers and was the ultimate authority when it came to resolving questions on foreign and domestic affairs. The princes and nakharars were directly subordinate to the king and received and kept their lands only through his permission. Should certain nobles have disobeyed the king's orders, he would have the right to confiscate their lands and distribute them to other nobles.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/> The concept of [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]], however, did not exist and insubordination by the nakharar elite could only be matched by the steadfastness of the king himself.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Armenian Apostolic Church|Tondrakians}}\n[[File:AniCathedral.JPG|thumb|240px|The [[Cathedral of Ani]], completed in 1001 by [[Trdat the Architect]].]]\n\nMost Armenians belonged to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] but there were elements in Armenian society who also adhered to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the official religion of the Byzantine Empire. Byzantium repeatedly demanded for communion with the Armenian Church as prerequisite for sending aid to the Bagratunis but most attempts failed to bear any fruit.\n\nIn the mid-10th century, a new internal challenge to the authority of the Armenian Church and the kingdom arose when the [[Tondrakians]] experienced a revival. An anti-feudal and heretical Christian sect that had been crushed by the Arabs with the Armenian Church's support in the 9th century, the Tondrakian movement attracted many followers during this period.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 234-236.</ref> Ashot III had realized the danger the Tondrakians posed against the kingdom and this was of his reasons why he directly subjected the Church to him, gave it lands, and sponsored the construction of new monasteries and churches.<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', p. 236.</ref> The message of the Tondrakians, however, continued to spread and successive Armenian kings would work to suppress its expansion.\n\n===Economy===\nThe Bagratuni kingdom was based on essentially two economies: one which was centered around [[agriculture]] based on [[feudalism]] and the other which was concentrated on [[mercantilism]] in towns and cities. Peasants (known as ''ramiks'') formed the lowest class in the economic stratum and largely busied themselves with raising [[livestock]] and [[farming]]. Many of them did not own land, and lived as tenants and worked as hired hands or even slaves on the lands owned by wealthy feudal magnates. Peasants were forced to pay heavy taxes to the government and the Armenian Apostolic Church in addition to their feudal lords.<ref name=\"SAE1\"/> Most peasants remained poor and the massive tax burden they shouldered sometimes culminated in peasant uprisings which the state was forced to put down.<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Hewsen|first = Robert H|authorlink =Robert Hewsen|title = Armenia: A Historical Atlas|publisher = University Of Chicago Press|location= Chicago|year = 2000|page= 112|isbn =978-0-226-33228-4}}</ref>\n\nThe Bagratuni kingdom did not mint any of its own coins, and used the currency found in Byzantium and the Arab Caliphate. The expanded trade between Byzantium and the Caliphate established several trades routes which ran across Armenia. The most important route began from [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], in Byzantium, and from there it connected to the cities of Ani, Kars, and Artsn. The city of Kars allowed trade to move north, to ports on the [[Black Sea]] and to [[Abkhazia]]; other routes were connected to cities in [[Anatolia]] and [[Iran]]; and the main route leading from the Caliphate to [[Kievan Rus]] was known as the \"Great Armenian Highway.\"<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", p. 178.</ref> Ani did not lie along any previously important trade routes, but because of its size, power, and wealth it became an important trading hub. From Ani, Armenia exported [[textiles]], [[metalwork]], [[armor]], [[jewelry]], horses, cattle, salt, wine, honey, [[timber]], leather, and [[furs]].<ref name=\"Hewsen. Armenia, p. 112\">Hewsen. ''Armenia'', p. 112.</ref> Its primary trading partners were the Byzantine Empire, the Arabs but also traded with Kievan Rus and [[Central Asia]].<ref name=\"SAE2\"/> Armenian-populated Dvin remained an important city on par with Ani, as evidenced in a vivid description by the Arab historian and geographer al-Mukadasi:\n\n{{quotation|Dabil [Dvin] is an important city, in it are an inaccessible citadel and great riches. Its name is ancient, its cloth is famous, its river is abundant, it is surrounded by gardens. The city has suburbs, its fortress is reliable, its squares are cross-shaped, its fields are wonderful. The main mosque is on a hill and next to the mosque is the church....By the city is a citadel. The buildings of the inhabitants are made of clay or stone. The city has main gates such as Bab ['Gate']-Keydar, Bab-Tiflis and Bab-Ani.<ref>Garsoian. \"Independent Kingdoms\", p. 179.</ref>}}\n\nDvin became famous throughout the Arab world for its wool and silk production and the export of pillows, rugs, curtains and covers. A village named Artashat near Dvin was so prominent a center for the production of [[Armenian cochineal]] that it received the name ''vordan karmiri gyugh'' (\"red-worm village\") for the distinctive red dye that was derived from insects. Cochineal and other Armenian goods were extensively found throughout the caliphate and for their eminence were referred to by Arabs as \"asfin al-Armani\" (\"Armenian products\").<ref>Ter-Ghevondyan. ''Arab Emirates'', pp. 239-240.</ref>\n[[File:Grigor Narekatsi 1.jpg|thumb|A portrait of [[Grigor Narekatsi]] from an 1173 illuminated manuscript]]\n\n===Demographics===\n[[File:Echmiadzin tempietto.jpg|thumb|An illuminated manuscript from the [[Echmiadzin Gospels]] completed in 989]]\nDuring the Bagratuni period, the great majority of the population of Armenia remained Armenian. 10th-century  Arab sources attest that the cities of the Araxes valley remained predominantly Armenian and Christian despite Arab Muslim rule. In fact, the 10th-century  Arab geographer [[Ibn Hawqal]] specified that Armenian was used in [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] and [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhichevan]].<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times 2\">Hovannisian. ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I'', pp. 176\u2013177.</ref> Regardless, there was a notable Muslim presence in certain regions of Armenia. For instance, the southern region of [[Aghdznik]] was heavily Arabized since earlier periods of Muslim dominance. On the north shore of Lake Van in the ninth and tenth centuries, there was also a considerable Muslim population that consisted of ethnic Arabs, and later [[Dailamites]] from Azerbaijan.<ref name=\"The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times 2\"/>\n\n===Art and literature===\n{{Main|Armenian architecture|Armenian literature}}\nThe Arab raids and invasion of Armenia as well as the devastation wrought upon the land during the [[Byzantine-Arab Wars|Byzantine-Arab wars]] had largely stifled any expression of Armenian culture in fields such as [[historiography]], [[literature]] and [[architecture]]. These restrictions disappeared when the Bagratuni kingdom was established, ushering in a new golden age of Armenian culture.\n\nThe lack of a strong Arab presence saw a rise in the number of [[historian]]s, who wrote and documented the relations between Armenia and other countries and described many events that took place from the seventh to eleventh centuries. Thanks to the patronage of the kings and nobles, monasteries became centers for the study and writing of literature throughout the kingdom.<ref name=\"Hewsen. Armenia, p. 112\"/> The monasteries of [[Haghpat]] and Sanahin were well-known centers for higher learning. Notable figures in Armenian literature and philosophy during this period included the mystic [[Grigor Narekatsi]] and [[Grigor Magistros]].\n\nThe art of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] illustrations were also revived during this era. The relative period of peace between Byzantium and Armenia during the second half of the 10th century led to a great deal of interaction between Armenian artists and their Greek counterparts. Armenian manuscript authors tended either to stress the natural look of the human body in illustrations or to forgo it and instead concentrate on the aspect of decoration.<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nArmenian architecture during the Bagratuni era was especially prominent and \"most of the surviving churches in present-day Armenia are from this period.\"<ref>Bournoutian. ''Concise History'', p. 90.</ref> The city of Ani, situated on the important trade intersection between the Byzantines, Arabs, and merchants of other countries, grew throughout the 9th century both commercially and culturally, earning renown for its \"40 gates and 1,001 churches.\"<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> The churches of this period expanded on 7th century designs; they were often steeper in elevation, introduced donor portraits in the round and incorporated ideas from Byzantine and Islamic architecture.<ref>Taylor, Alice. \"Armenian Art and Architecture\" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]]''. [[Alexander Kazhdan|Alexander P. Kazhdan]] (ed.) New York: Oxford University Press, 1991, p. 178.</ref> Armenian churches were invariably built out of stone  and had vaulted ceilings which supported a spherical dome.<ref>Kouymjian, Dickran.
