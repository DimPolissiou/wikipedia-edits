The laws of [[Kashrut]], on the other hand, set out additional regulations which are binding upon Jews only. Thus, [[Kosher]] laws further determine what is and is not fit for consumption by Jews, and under what circumstances even otherwise kosher foods become unfit for consumption for Jews (including how an animal must be killed by [[Shechita|Jewish ritual slaughter]] before it is consumed by Jews). Thus, eating of a live animal is forbidden under Noahide Law and specifically for Jews under Kosher law.\n\nAny non-Jew who adheres to the Noahide laws is regarded as a ''[[ger toshav|righteous gentile]]'', and is assured of a place in the [[world to come]] ({{lang-he|\u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05d4\u05d1\u05d0}} ''[[Olam Haba]]''), the final reward of the righteous.<ref>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 8:14</ref><ref>Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', end of article); note the variant reading of Maimonides and the references in the footnote</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Eating live seafood]]\n* ''[[Odorigui]]'', Japanese term for consumption of live seafood while it is still moving\n* [[Pain in animals]]\n* [[Pain in invertebrates]]\n* [[Goldfish Swallowing]], a school fad in 1930s American high schools and colleges\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Carnivory]]\n[[Category:Dishes involving the consumption of live animals]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Korean.cuisine-Sannakji.hoe-01.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Sannakji]] is live octopus that has been cut into small pieces and served with its arms still squirming.\n----\n[[File:Nuvola apps kaboodle.svg|16px]] [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJajVnJJTsY Youtube video of the preparation and eating of sannakji] ]]\n\n'''Eating live animals''' is the practice of humans eating animals that are still alive.

However, following the conclusion of the [[1996 NBL season|1996 season]], the Tigers parted ways with Simmons as they wanted change with an import who could provide more offence than what they felt Simmons could give the team.

Various Cistercian congregations existed for many years, and by 1664 the [[Abbot]] of La Trappe felt that the Cistercians were becoming too liberal. He introduced strict new rules in the abbey and the Strict Observance was born. Since this time, many of the rules have been relaxed. However, a fundamental tenet that monasteries should be self-supporting is still maintained by these groups.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nMonastery brewhouses, from different religious orders, have existed across Europe since the [[Middle Ages]]. From the very beginning, beer was brewed in French Cistercian monasteries following the Strict Observance. For example, the monastery of La Trappe in Soligny already had its own brewery in 1685. Breweries were later introduced in monasteries of other countries as the Trappist order spread from France into the rest of Europe. The Trappists, like many other religious orders, originally brewed beer to feed the community, in a perspective of self-sufficiency. Nowadays, Trappist breweries also brew beer to fund their works and charitable causes. Many of the Trappist monasteries and breweries were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[World War]]s. In the last 300 years, there were at least nine Trappist breweries in France, six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Austria, one in Bosnia and possibly other countries.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1997, eight Trappist abbeys{{spaced ndash}}six from Belgium ([[Orval Brewery|Orval]], [[Chimay Brewery|Chimay]], [[Westvleteren Brewery|Westvleteren]], [[Rochefort Brewery|Rochefort]], [[Westmalle Brewery|Westmalle]] and [[Achel Brewery|Achel]]), one from the Netherlands ([[Brouwerij De Koningshoeven|Koningshoeven]]) and one from Germany ([[Mariawald]]){{spaced ndash}}founded the International Trappist Association (ITA) to prevent non-Trappist commercial companies from abusing the Trappist name. This private association created a [[logo]] that is assigned to goods (cheese, beer, wine, etc.) that respect precise production criteria. For the beers, these criteria were the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers|title=Trappist beers|publisher=The International Trappist Association|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref>\n* The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.\n* The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life.\n* The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.\n\nThe German Trappist [[Mariawald|abbey of Mariawald]] has not produced beer since 1953, however it is a founding member of the Trappist Association and uses the same ''Authentic Trappist Product'' logo for its other products.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn the twentieth century, the growing popularity of Trappist beers led some brewers with no connection to the order to label their beers \"Trappist\". After unsuccessful negotiations, monks sued one such brewer in 1962 in [[Ghent]], Belgium.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Dutch brewery ''De Koningshoeven'' produces Trappist beers{{spaced ndash}}branded ''La Trappe''{{spaced ndash}}that are able to carry the \"Authentic Trappist Product\" logo. Their use of the International Trappist Association logo was withdrawn in 1999, but was restored in October 2005 (see [[Brouwerij de Koningshoeven]] for details). A second Dutch Trappist beer, branded ''Zundert'' and produced by [[Abdij Maria Toevlucht]], made its debut in December 2013, and has also been granted permission to use the International Trappist Association logo.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nAn expansion of ITA recognized breweries took place for the first time in 2012 when the trappist brewery of the abbey of Engelszell, Trappistenbrauerei Engelszell in Engelhartszell, Austria started brewing beer at the monastery (the former production had stopped in 1929) and in the same year obtained the ''Authentic Trappist Product'' logo for their beer.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.trappist.be/nieuwsbrief/briefitem.cfm?BriefID=15&ArtID=32&taal=en|title=The ATP logo for \"Gregorius\" and \"Benno\"!|date=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, Maria Toevlucht's abbey (Zundert, the Netherlands) and St. Joseph's Abbey (Spencer, Massachusetts, United States) were both granted the ATP recognition for their Trappist beers, followed in 2015 by [[Tre Fontane Abbey]] brewery in [[Rome]].{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn June 2018, the monks of [[Mount Saint Bernard Abbey]] in Leicestershire became the first in the UK to brew a Trappist ale.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/monks-given-permission-build-uks-670890|title=Brewery set to be built in county \u2013 and ran by Trappist monks|last=Owen|first=Dave|date=2017-10-25|work=leicestermercury|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC-44581210\">{{cite web |title=Monks brew UK's first Trappist beer |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-44581210 |website=BBC News |accessdate=29 June 2018 |date=25 June 2018}}</ref> Called \"[[Tynt Meadow]]\" (7.4% ABV), after the location of the abbey, it is available to visitors and sold through public outlets.<ref name=\"BBC-44581210\" />\n\n[[File:Orval Trappist-Beer.JPG|thumb|Orval trappist beer]]\n\n==International Trappist Association recognised breweries==\n{{anchor|International Trappist Association}}\n\nAs of January 2019, fourteen Trappist breweries are active and members of ITA \u2014 six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, and one each in Austria, Italy, England, France, Spain and the United States.<ref name=\"BrewList\">{{cite web|url=https://www.trappist.be/en/products/beers/|title=International Trappist Association - Beers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Trappist.be |accessdate=2019-01-27}}</ref>\n\nThis association has a legal standing, and its logo gives the consumer some information and guarantees about the product.

After the introduction of an official Trappist beer designation by the International Trappist Association in 1997, it came to mean products similar in style or presentation to monastic beers.<ref name=Best>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHh-4M_QxEsC&pg=PA38&dq=Abbey+beers&hl=en&ei=HnkvTaK5Hse7hAeq7ZzpCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abbey%20beers&f=false|title=World's Best Beers: One Thousand Craft Brews from Cask to Glass|first=Ben|last=McFarland|page=38|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc|year=2009|isbn=1-4027-6694-7|accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref> In other words, an Abbey beer may be:\n* Produced by a non-Trappist monastery{{mdash}}e.g. Cistercian, Benedictine; or\n* produced by a commercial brewery under an arrangement with an extant monastery; or\n* branded with the name of a defunct or fictitious abbey by a commercial brewer; or\n* given a vaguely monastic branding, without specifically mentioning monastery, by a commercial brewer.\n\n==Types of beer==\nTrappist beers are mostly [[Brewing#Fermentation methods|top-fermented]], including La Trappe [[Bock]]bier, and mainly [[bottle conditioned]]. Trappist breweries use various systems of nomenclature for the different beers produced which relate to their relative strength.<ref name=\"Lierde\">Geert van Lierde et al., ''In het Spoor van de Trappisten'' {{ISBN|90-261-0704-8}}, page 25</ref>\n\nThe best known is the system where different beers are called ''Enkel/Single'', ''[[Dubbel|Dubbel/Double]],'' ''[[Tripel|Tripel/Triple]] and Quadrupel/Quadruple''. These terms roughly describe both the amount of malt and the [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|original gravity]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Garrett|last=Oliver|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|isbn=978-0195367133}}</ref> They may refer to the number of crosses or other marks chalked on the casks - two for a Dubbel and three for a Tripel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000791.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Down on your knees to bless monks' top ale|publisher=www.beerhunter.com|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>\n\nColours can be used to indicate the different types, dating back to the days when bottles were unlabelled and had to be identified by the ''capsule'' or bottle-top alone. Chimay beer labels are based on the colour system (in increasing order of strength red, white and blue). Westvleteren beers are still unlabelled.\n\nThere is also a number system (6, 8 and 10, as used by Rochefort), which gives an indication of strength, but is not necessarily an exact [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). [[Achel]] combine a strength and a colour (of the beer itself{{mdash}}blond or brown) designation.\n\n===Enkel===\n'''Enkel''', meaning \"single\", is a term used by the Trappist breweries to describe the basic recipe of their beers.<ref name=\"Lierde\"/> The name fell out of fashion with no breweries (Trappist or 'Abbey') using the term until recent years. Instead, \"Blond(e)\" (La Trappe, Westvleteren), \"5\" (Achel) or \"6\" (Rochefort) have been used to describe the brewery's lightest beer. Chimay introduced an Enkel (called ''Dor\u00e9e'' or Gold) commercially in bottles in 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/chimay-doree-speciale-du-potaupre/14228/|title=Chimay Dor\u00e9e / Sp\u00e9ciale du Potaupr\u00e9|website=RateBeer|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> Westmalle made their Enkel (called ''Extra'') available commercially through some outlets in 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://belgiuminabox.com/blog/2010/04/westmalle-extra-trappist-beer-now-available-www-belgiuminabox-com/#.Wp20AOjFLcc|title=New Product : Shop Westmalle-Extra Trappist Beer @ www.belgiuminabox.com {{!}} Belgiuminabox|website=belgiuminabox.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>. The term is often used interchangeably with 'Patersbier' (meaning Father's beer), as Enkels are a weak beer brewed originally to be consumed by the monks themselves.\n\n===Dubbel===\n{{Main|Dubbel}}\nDubbel is a Trappist breweries' naming convention.<ref name=Lierde /> The origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the Trappist Abbey of [[Westmalle Abbey|Westmalle]] in 1856. Westmalle Dubbel was imitated by other breweries, Trappist and commercial, Belgian and worldwide, leading to the emergence of a style. Dubbels are understood to be a fairly strong (6\u20138% ABV) [[brown ale]], with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character.\nExamples are: Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red/Premiere, Koningshoeven/La Trappe Dubbel, Achel 8 Bruin and Rochefort 6.\n\n===Tripel===\n{{Main|Tripel}}\n[[File:Westmalle Tripel in a glass.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Westmalle [[Tripel]]]]\n\nTripel is a naming convention traditionally used by Belgian Trappist breweries to describe the strongest beer in their range. Westmalle Tripel is considered to be the foundation of this beer style, and was developed in the 1930s. Achel 8 Blond, Westmalle Tripel, La Trappe Tripel, and Chimay White/Cinq Cents are all examples of Trappist tripels. The style has proven popular among secular breweries like St. Feuillien, Bosteels and St. Bernardus. Tripels as a style are generally beers with an alcohol content ranging from 8% to 10% ABV.\n\n===Quadrupel===\n{{Main|Quadrupel}}\nQuadrupel is the name Koningshoeven gave to a La Trappe ale they brew which is stronger and darker than their tripel. Rochefort 10 is also an example of a quadrupel.\n\n==Ranges==\nThe official Trappist breweries produce the following beers for consumption:\n\n'''Achel''':\n1. Blond (Belgian strong ale, 8% ABV)\n2.

Carde\u00f1a (Abbey tripel, 7,0% ABV).\n\n==Glassware==\nBelgian breweries have a tradition of providing custom [[beer glass]]es: with Trappist breweries, these often take the form of \"[[chalice]]\" or \"[[goblet]]\" style glasses. The distinction between goblet and chalice is typically in the glass thickness. Goblets tend to be more delicate and thin, while the chalice is heavy and thick walled. Some chalices are etched on the bottom to [[nucleate]] a stream of bubbles for maintaining a nice head.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Chimays.jpg|Chimay beers and glass\nFile:Beerglass orval.jpg|[[Orval beer]]'s \"chalice\" glass\nFile:Beerglass trappiste rochefort.jpg|[[Rochefort beer]]'s \"goblet\" glass\nFile:Eleven_trappist_beer_and_glasses.jpg|Eleven Trappist beers and glasses\n</gallery>\n\n==Beer tourism==\nThe idea of visiting Trappist monasteries to sample their beers has become more popular in recent years, partly due to promotion by enthusiasts such as the 'beer hunter' [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]]. Some brewing monasteries maintain a visitors' center where their beers can be tasted and bought (sometimes with other monastic products such as bread and cheese).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chimay.com/en/espace-chimay.html?IDC=756|title=Espace Chimay|accessdate=2014-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orval.be/en/27/Discovery|title=Visit Orval|accessdate=2014-09-26}}</ref> Visits to the monastery itself are usually not available to the general public, although visitors can overnight in some of the monasteries (like Achel) if their purpose is non-touristic.

Various Cistercian congregations existed for many years, and by 1664 the [[Abbot]] of La Trappe felt that the Cistercians were becoming too liberal. He introduced strict new rules in the abbey and the Strict Observance was born. Since this time, many of the rules have been relaxed. However, a fundamental tenet that monasteries should be self-supporting is still maintained by these groups.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nMonastery brewhouses, from different religious orders, have existed across Europe since the [[Middle Ages]]. From the very beginning, beer was brewed in French Cistercian monasteries following the Strict Observance. For example, the monastery of La Trappe in Soligny already had its own brewery in 1685. Breweries were later introduced in monasteries of other countries as the Trappist order spread from France into the rest of Europe. The Trappists, like many other religious orders, originally brewed beer to feed the community, in a perspective of self-sufficiency. Nowadays, Trappist breweries also brew beer to fund their works and charitable causes. Many of the Trappist monasteries and breweries were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]] and the [[World War]]s. In the last 300 years, there were at least nine Trappist breweries in France, six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Austria, one in Bosnia and possibly other countries.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 1997, eight Trappist abbeys{{spaced ndash}}six from Belgium ([[Orval Brewery|Orval]], [[Chimay Brewery|Chimay]], [[Westvleteren Brewery|Westvleteren]], [[Rochefort Brewery|Rochefort]], [[Westmalle Brewery|Westmalle]] and [[Achel Brewery|Achel]]), one from the Netherlands ([[Brouwerij De Koningshoeven|Koningshoeven]]) and one from Germany ([[Mariawald]]){{spaced ndash}}founded the International Trappist Association (ITA) to prevent non-Trappist commercial companies from abusing the Trappist name. This private association created a [[logo]] that is assigned to goods (cheese, beer, wine, etc.) that respect precise production criteria. For the beers, these criteria were the following:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trappist.be/en/pages/trappist-beers|title=Trappist beers|publisher=The International Trappist Association|access-date=16 May 2016}}</ref>\n* The beer must be brewed within the walls of a Trappist monastery, either by the monks themselves or under their supervision.\n* The brewery must be of secondary importance within the monastery and it should witness to the business practices proper to a monastic way of life.\n* The brewery is not intended to be a profit-making venture. The income covers the living expenses of the monks and the maintenance of the buildings and grounds.  Whatever remains is donated to charity for social work and to help persons in need.\n\nThe German Trappist [[Mariawald|abbey of Mariawald]] has not produced beer since 1953, however it is a founding member of the Trappist Association and uses the same ''Authentic Trappist Product'' logo for its other products.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn the twentieth century, the growing popularity of Trappist beers led some brewers with no connection to the order to label their beers \"Trappist\". After unsuccessful negotiations, monks sued one such brewer in 1962 in [[Ghent]], Belgium.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe Dutch brewery ''De Koningshoeven'' produces Trappist beers{{spaced ndash}}branded ''La Trappe''{{spaced ndash}}that are able to carry the \"Authentic Trappist Product\" logo. Their use of the International Trappist Association logo was withdrawn in 1999, but was restored in October 2005 (see [[Brouwerij de Koningshoeven]] for details). A second Dutch Trappist beer, branded ''Zundert'' and produced by [[Abdij Maria Toevlucht]], made its debut in December 2013, and has also been granted permission to use the International Trappist Association logo.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nAn expansion of ITA recognized breweries took place for the first time in 2012 when the trappist brewery of the abbey of Engelszell, Trappistenbrauerei Engelszell in Engelhartszell, Austria started brewing beer at the monastery (the former production had stopped in 1929) and in the same year obtained the ''Authentic Trappist Product'' logo for their beer.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.trappist.be/nieuwsbrief/briefitem.cfm?BriefID=15&ArtID=32&taal=en|title=The ATP logo for \"Gregorius\" and \"Benno\"!|date=21 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2013, Maria Toevlucht's abbey (Zundert, the Netherlands) and St. Joseph's Abbey (Spencer, Massachusetts, United States) were both granted the ATP recognition for their Trappist beers, followed in 2015 by [[Tre Fontane Abbey]] brewery in [[Rome]].{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn June 2018, the monks of [[Mount Saint Bernard Abbey]] in Leicestershire became the first in the UK to brew a Trappist ale.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/monks-given-permission-build-uks-670890|title=Brewery set to be built in county \u2013 and ran by Trappist monks|last=Owen|first=Dave|date=2017-10-25|work=leicestermercury|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC-44581210\">{{cite web |title=Monks brew UK's first Trappist beer |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-44581210 |website=BBC News |accessdate=29 June 2018 |date=25 June 2018}}</ref> Called \"[[Tynt Meadow]]\" (7.4% ABV), after the location of the abbey, it is available to visitors and sold through public outlets.<ref name=\"BBC-44581210\" />\n\n[[File:Orval Trappist-Beer.JPG|thumb|Orval trappist beer]]\n\n==International Trappist Association recognised breweries==\n{{anchor|International Trappist Association}}\n\nAs of January 2019, fourteen Trappist breweries are active and members of ITA \u2014 six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, and one each in Austria, Italy, England, France, Spain and the United States.<ref name=\"BrewList\">{{cite web|url=https://www.trappist.be/en/products/beers/|title=International Trappist Association - Beers|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Trappist.be |accessdate=2019-01-27}}</ref>\n\nThis association has a legal standing, and its logo gives the consumer some information and guarantees about the product.

French Trappist abbey of Sainte Marie du Mont des Cats has been selling beer since June 16, 2011. This abbey has no brewery at the monastery and does not plan to build one in the near future, for reasons of cost and brewing skills. They have not excluded rebuilding one brewery in the future.<ref>{{Cite video|title=Press conference at the abbey |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbZqQcpmDS8|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=2012-05-02}}</ref> The beer sold by Mont des Cats is produced by the Chimay brewery.

It does not bear the Authentic Trappist Product logo since it is not crafted within the walls of the monastery.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Abbey beer==\n{{main|Abbey beer}}\n\nThe designation \"abbey beers\" (''Bi\u00e8res d'Abbaye'' or ''Abdijbier'') was originally used for any monastic or monastic-style beer. After the introduction of an official Trappist beer designation by the International Trappist Association in 1997, it came to mean products similar in style or presentation to monastic beers.<ref name=Best>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHh-4M_QxEsC&pg=PA38&dq=Abbey+beers&hl=en&ei=HnkvTaK5Hse7hAeq7ZzpCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Abbey%20beers&f=false|title=World's Best Beers: One Thousand Craft Brews from Cask to Glass|first=Ben|last=McFarland|page=38|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc|year=2009|isbn=1-4027-6694-7|accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref> In other words, an Abbey beer may be:\n* Produced by a non-Trappist monastery{{mdash}}e.g. Cistercian, Benedictine; or\n* produced by a commercial brewery under an arrangement with an extant monastery; or\n* branded with the name of a defunct or fictitious abbey by a commercial brewer; or\n* given a vaguely monastic branding, without specifically mentioning monastery, by a commercial brewer.\n\n==Types of beer==\nTrappist beers are mostly [[Brewing#Fermentation methods|top-fermented]], including La Trappe [[Bock]]bier, and mainly [[bottle conditioned]]. Trappist breweries use various systems of nomenclature for the different beers produced which relate to their relative strength.<ref name=\"Lierde\">Geert van Lierde et al., ''In het Spoor van de Trappisten'' {{ISBN|90-261-0704-8}}, page 25</ref>\n\nThe best known is the system where different beers are called ''Enkel/Single'', ''[[Dubbel|Dubbel/Double]],'' ''[[Tripel|Tripel/Triple]] and Quadrupel/Quadruple''. These terms roughly describe both the amount of malt and the [[Gravity (alcoholic beverage)|original gravity]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Garrett|last=Oliver|title=The Oxford Companion to Beer|isbn=978-0195367133}}</ref> They may refer to the number of crosses or other marks chalked on the casks - two for a Dubbel and three for a Tripel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000791.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter - Down on your knees to bless monks' top ale|publisher=www.beerhunter.com|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>\n\nColours can be used to indicate the different types, dating back to the days when bottles were unlabelled and had to be identified by the ''capsule'' or bottle-top alone. Chimay beer labels are based on the colour system (in increasing order of strength red, white and blue). Westvleteren beers are still unlabelled.\n\nThere is also a number system (6, 8 and 10, as used by Rochefort), which gives an indication of strength, but is not necessarily an exact [[alcohol by volume]] (ABV). [[Achel]] combine a strength and a colour (of the beer itself{{mdash}}blond or brown) designation.\n\n===Enkel===\n'''Enkel''', meaning \"single\", is a term used by the Trappist breweries to describe the basic recipe of their beers.<ref name=\"Lierde\"/> The name fell out of fashion with no breweries (Trappist or 'Abbey') using the term until recent years. Instead, \"Blond(e)\" (La Trappe, Westvleteren), \"5\" (Achel) or \"6\" (Rochefort) have been used to describe the brewery's lightest beer. Chimay introduced an Enkel (called ''Dor\u00e9e'' or Gold) commercially in bottles in 2015,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/chimay-doree-speciale-du-potaupre/14228/|title=Chimay Dor\u00e9e / Sp\u00e9ciale du Potaupr\u00e9|website=RateBeer|language=en|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref> Westmalle made their Enkel (called ''Extra'') available commercially through some outlets in 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://belgiuminabox.com/blog/2010/04/westmalle-extra-trappist-beer-now-available-www-belgiuminabox-com/#.Wp20AOjFLcc|title=New Product : Shop Westmalle-Extra Trappist Beer @ www.belgiuminabox.com {{!}} Belgiuminabox|website=belgiuminabox.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>. The term is often used interchangeably with 'Patersbier' (meaning Father's beer), as Enkels are a weak beer brewed originally to be consumed by the monks themselves.\n\n===Dubbel===\n{{Main|Dubbel}}\nDubbel is a Trappist breweries' naming convention.<ref name=Lierde /> The origin of the dubbel was a beer brewed in the Trappist Abbey of [[Westmalle Abbey|Westmalle]] in 1856. Westmalle Dubbel was imitated by other breweries, Trappist and commercial, Belgian and worldwide, leading to the emergence of a style. Dubbels are understood to be a fairly strong (6\u20138% ABV) [[brown ale]], with understated bitterness, fairly heavy body, and a pronounced fruitiness and cereal character.\nExamples are: Westmalle Dubbel, Chimay Red/Premiere, Koningshoeven/La Trappe Dubbel, Achel 8 Bruin and Rochefort 6.\n\n===Tripel===\n{{Main|Tripel}}\n[[File:Westmalle Tripel in a glass.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Westmalle [[Tripel]]]]\n\nTripel is a naming convention traditionally used by Belgian Trappist breweries to describe the strongest beer in their range. Westmalle Tripel is considered to be the foundation of this beer style, and was developed in the 1930s. Achel 8 Blond, Westmalle Tripel, La Trappe Tripel, and Chimay White/Cinq Cents are all examples of Trappist tripels. The style has proven popular among secular breweries like St. Feuillien, Bosteels and St. Bernardus. Tripels as a style are generally beers with an alcohol content ranging from 8% to 10% ABV.\n\n===Quadrupel===\n{{Main|Quadrupel}}\nQuadrupel is the name Koningshoeven gave to a La Trappe ale they brew which is stronger and darker than their tripel. Rochefort 10 is also an example of a quadrupel.\n\n==Ranges==\nThe official Trappist breweries produce the following beers for consumption:\n\n'''Achel''':\n1. Blond (Belgian strong ale, 8% ABV)\n2.

Carde\u00f1a (Abbey tripel, 7,0% ABV).\n\n==Glassware==\nBelgian breweries have a tradition of providing custom [[beer glass]]es: with Trappist breweries, this often takes the form of providing \"[[chalice]]\" or \"[[goblet]]\" style glasses. The distinction between goblet and chalice is typically in the glass thickness. Goblets tend to be more delicate and thin, while the chalice is heavy and thick walled. Some chalices are etched on the bottom to [[nucleate]] a stream of bubbles for maintaining a nice head.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Chimays.jpg|Chimay beers and glass\nFile:Beerglass orval.jpg|[[Orval beer]]'s \"chalice\" glass\nFile:Beerglass trappiste rochefort.jpg|[[Rochefort beer]]'s \"goblet\" glass\nFile:Eleven_trappist_beer_and_glasses.jpg|Eleven Trappist beers and glasses\n</gallery>\n\n==Beer tourism==\nThe idea of visiting Trappist monasteries to sample their beers has become more popular in recent years, partly due to promotion by enthusiasts such as the 'beer hunter' [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]]. Some brewing monasteries maintain a visitors' center where their beers can be tasted and bought (sometimes with other monastic products such as bread and cheese).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chimay.com/en/espace-chimay.html?IDC=756|title=Espace Chimay|accessdate=2014-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orval.be/en/27/Discovery|title=Visit Orval|accessdate=2014-09-26}}</ref> Visits to the monastery itself are usually not available to the general public, although visitors can overnight in some of the monasteries (like Achel) if their purpose is non-touristic. Currently, [[Brouwerij De Koningshoeven|Koningshoeven]] (which brews La Trappe) in Netherlands offers regular tours around their bottling plant, old brewery and parts of their site, along with a beer tasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latrappetrappist.com/en/visit-us/|title=Visit us|website=www.latrappetrappist.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-05}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Beer}}\n* [[Beer in Belgium]]\n* [[Beer in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Barrel-aged beer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.trappist.be/en/ Official site of the International Trappist Association]\n* [http://www.ocso.org/ Official website of the Trappist Order]\n\n{{Trappist beer}}\n{{Beer styles}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trappist Beer}}\n[[Category:Beer in Belgium]]\n[[Category:Beer in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Trappist beer| ]]\n", "name_user": "Archolman", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGlassware:Copyedit (minor)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trappist_beer"}
