Steven made his return on 27 May 2016.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/eastenders/news/a795763/eastenders-steven-beale-aaron-sidwell-explains-return/ | title=EastEnders: Find out why Steven Beale is back| date=2016-05-27}}</ref> On 9 August 2017, it was announced that Sidwell would leave the show again. Steven made his final exit on 8 September 2017 when the character was killed off during a high-profile stunt week.\n\nIn the 1990s, Steven's storylines mostly concerned his paternity and the ongoing [[custody battle]] between his mother, [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]), and his stepfather, [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]). In the early 2000s, a darker side to adolescent Steven emerged as he began writing [[poison pen]] letters to neighbours, before moving to New Zealand to be with his father. In the late 2000s, Steven's storyline focused on his hostile relationship with Ian, and involved stalking Ian, taking Ian hostage, multiple [[suicide]] attempts, and accidentally shooting Ian's new wife, [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]). Steven also dates [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) but struggles with his sexuality and an attraction to Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), and he attempts to murder his grandmother, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Since his 2016 return, Steven becomes deceitful with his girlfriend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) by having an affair with her sister [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) - which sparks the events of the character being responsible for Abi's pregnancy; fabricating a lie about having a brain tumour; and nearly killing Jane again after Lauren and Abi's father, [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]), blackmails him in setting fire to the restaurant in his plan to kill her as revenge for her contribution to getting him wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of half-sister [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who was previously killed by their stepbrother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). Ultimately, Steve contemplates on rescuing Jane and ends up getting injured in the fire by Max - which consequently triggers the character suffering a fatal cardiac arrest in hospital; Steve dies and his lies are soon discovered at his funeral a week later.\n\n==Storylines==\n=== 1989\u20132002 ===\nSteven is born in December 1989; his mother is [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and his father is [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) - even though Cindy is married to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); she goes as far as to convince Ian that he is Steven's father. Simon becomes Steven's godfather, despite knowing that he is his biological father. Cindy tells Ian the truth when she and Simon reconcile. They leave Walford with Steven in December 1990; however, Ian and Cindy reconcile in 1992, and Ian raises Steven as his son. In December 1993, Steven becomes a half-brother when his sister [[Lucy Beale]] and brother [[Peter Beale]] are born to Ian and Cindy. Unhappy in her marriage, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian in 1996, and when this fails, she snatches Steven and Peter and flees to [[Italy]]. In 1997, Ian tracks her, Steven and Peter down and kidnaps them back. Cindy fights for custody and wins, but on the day she reclaims Steven, Lucy and Peter, she is arrested when the hitman confesses to the attempted murder of Ian and Ian gains custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter. She dies in childbirth in prison in November 1998. Steven alone attends her funeral.\n\nSteven then grows up with various different stepmothers, and though he grows close to them all, he feels abandoned when they leave. When Ian prepares to marry [[Laura Dunn]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]), Steven is anxious that they too will end up splitting; his fears are realised when he catches Ian kissing  [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) in 2002. From being a quiet, sensitive boy, Steven starts rebelling and skipping school. When Laura finds out, she confronts Steven, who reveals that Ian had kissed Janine. The subsequent rows have a negative effect on Steven; he becomes angry with the world and starts writing poison pen letters to people. Ian eventually finds out and confronts Steven. Following an argument, Steven goes to his room and overhears Ian calling him \"Cindy's little brat!\"; Ian is forced to tell Steven that he is not his natural father. Distressed and angry, Steven decides to leave Walford to meet Simon, who lives in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008 ===\nIn September 2007, Steven returns and begins stalking Ian, pretending to be Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father had not been a happy experience, and he had ended up feeling rejected and in the way.\n\nSteven then tries to commit suicide with a gun that Lucy gives him to dispose of. Ian, Jane and Lucy try to stop him, a struggle ensues, and Jane is accidentally shot in the stomach; as a result, she is unable to have children. Ian admits Steven to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going as far as to break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries to commit suicide by dousing himself in petrol; however, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is waiting for him to mess up so he will be gone from her life for good.\n\nSteven and Stacey grow closer in early 2008, as he supports her through the breakdown of her marriage. Steven is attracted to Stacey. She initially rejects his advances, but eventually agrees to date him. Their relationship progresses, until Steven decides that he is ready to lose his virginity, but their attempt at consummation ends in disaster when Steven can not perform sexually. Embarrassed, Steven pretends that he had lost his virginity; however, Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) realises he is lying and publicly announces it, leaving Steven humiliated. Steven confronts Christian and, after releasing his pent-up anger and frustration, he spontaneously kisses Christian. Realising Steven is gay, Christian tries to make Steven face up to his sexuality. Steven maintains that he is heterosexual, and successfully has sex with Stacey, but their relationship soon ends when Christian tells Stacey that Steven had kissed him.\n\nDistraught, Steven propositions Christian, but is rejected. In revenge, Steven tells Ian that Christian had tried to seduce him. Ian is furious until Jane discovers the truth, leading Steven to confess that he is gay. Steven is grateful when Ian proves supportive, as his biological father had not been. Ian is full of praise for Steven; however, he does not realise that Steven has been hiding his runaway daughter, Lucy. Steven does not want to share Ian's attention, so he makes plans for Lucy to flee to France; however, Pat discovers his plan and is hit by a car as she is trying to apprehend him. Pat is hospitalised, and in order to stop her from telling Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to smother her with a pillow. Pat wakes up, but Steven continues in his murder attempt until Ian interrupts him. When Pat tells Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to deny it, but Ian sees through his lies. He traces Steven to [[St Pancras railway station]], and discovers him with Lucy. Steven has booked her a ticket on the [[Eurostar]], but Ian persuades her not to go and Steven flees. Later, back in Walford, Ian spots Steven spying on Lucy. Ian confronts him, admitting that he is glad that Steven is not his biological son; he tells him that if he ever returns to Albert Square, he will kill him. Devastated, Steven heads to the tube station and leaves Walford. In 2014, Peter reveals that Steven was living in New Zealand with his father, Simon. Peter (now [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) and fianc\u00e9e [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) leave Walford for New Zealand to join Steven in February 2015.\n\n=== 2016\u20132017 ===\nIn May 2016, Steven returns with Lauren and [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]] after they learn that Jane is in hospital after being attacked by [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington), who also confessed to killing Lucy. Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he made in the past. Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren do not tell anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. [[Kyle Slater]] ([[Riley Carter Millington]]), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.\n\nSteven worries when Jane asks to look at the restaurant's accounts as he has stolen money. He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, \"mama\", and gets him to say \"dada\", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not know the whole truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.\n\nLauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]), a man who works in her father [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) office, and they are attracted to each other. Josh encourages Lauren to apply for a job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her to spend more time with him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his head against the wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], claiming that he has [[cancer]] and he is dying.\n\nAlthough Abi discovers the truth, she decides not to tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to set fire to the flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is trying to get rid of him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after berating her about framing Max for Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the flames. Believing Lauren trapped inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently shoves him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [[cardiac arrest]] and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him. Abi then has Steven cremated and hides his ashes away from Lauren when they visit their mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) in Exeter. However, Lauren eventually discovers the truth after finding Abi in her wedding dress. Horrified by what she has learned, Lauren tries to flush Steven's ashes down the toilet, but Abi stops her, eventually telling her the truth about her pregnancy with his baby. In December 2017, Abi and Lauren learn about their father's scheme before discovering his knowledge over the former's pregnancy with Steven's baby. They eventually find out on Christmas that year the truth about Steven's death when their mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] reveals that Max killed him \u2013 causing them to disown their father, who subsequently gets into a fight with Ian when he and his mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] learn the truth as well; the latter then explains this to Phil, who then confronts and attacks Max. Shortly afterwards, Abi and Lauren fall from the Queen Vic roof; both survive and are taken to hospital, where an ultrasound shows Abi and Steven's baby is alive. Fearing that Abi may go into cardiac arrest following her devastating diagnosis of brain stem death, the doctors decide to deliver the baby via cesarean section. Soon after, the doctors switch off Abi's life support when it becomes clear that the chances of reviving her are impossible.\n\nA year later, many people blamed Bobby for Max's revenge including the deaths of Steven and his own daughter Abi.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Early storylines===\nThe character's conception was a part of one of the most notable storylines in ''EastEnders'' during 1989, a love triangle between [[Cindy Beale|Cindy Williams]] (played by [[Michelle Collins]]), [[Simon Wicks]] (played by [[Nick Berry]]) and [[Ian Beale]] (played by [[Adam Woodyatt]]).<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Steven was the result of a [[one-night stand]] (in the bar of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven's true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon's mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy's claim initially. Simon's rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend that the child was Ian's.\n\nThe character's birth occurred in an episode that aired on 28 December 1989, although in the on-screen events, he was born on [[Boxing Day]]. In the storyline, Steven was born two months prematurely, and was therefore supposed to be small; however, the baby who originally played Steven, Edward Farrell, was actually large for his age, and was nicknamed \"Chunky\" by actor Adam Woodyatt.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to former ''EastEnders'' writer, [[David Yallop]], it had been agreed in September 1989, that Steven Beale would be killed off in the serial. This was part of producer [[Mike Gibbon]]'s plan to increase the ratings by culling a large number of the soap's long-running cast. Yallop said, \"We had to reach a decision with the illegitimate child who was in the process of being born as a result of an earlier storyline. We wanted to know what to do with it. Either the child would be allowed to live or it would die. They decided to make the child 'seriously ill', but the reprieve was temporary. In episode 606 I resolved the problem.\" He claimed that on his draft of the storyline he wrote the words \"Baby die\". The plot never came to fruition, as Gibbon was abruptly replaced as the soap's boss and Yallop's plots were scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/soap-operas-producers-aimed-axe-at-poor-acting-1556027.html|title=Soap opera's producers 'aimed axe at poor acting' |newspaper=The Independent| date = 8 October 1992|accessdate=19 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Handbook]]'' by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for roles in ''EastEnders'' is usually done locally, so that children and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> This occurred with Steven's original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: \"Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [viewers] still spotted it\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven's christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, \"When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn\u2019t recover and I kissed him for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nBefore his first screen birthday, Steven was central to storylines surrounding his parents and stepfather Ian, including a special week of off-set episodes filmed in Devon, where Ian discovered that his best friend Simon was Steven's real father and that he had reunited with Cindy. The love triangle between Simon, Cindy and Ian, and the events surrounding Steven's paternity dominated the soap during 1990; it has been described by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the year's \"big story\".<ref name=\"10years\"/> Steven was written out of the serial after actors Nick Berry and Michelle Collins decided to leave the show. His exit aired on 27 December 1990, though in the on-screen events it was Boxing Day, Steven's first birthday. In 1992, Michelle Collins reprised her role of Cindy, and Steven was also reintroduced, played by a different actor, Stuart Stevens. On-screen, Simon abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian traced them to a bedsit and brought them back to Walford, where Steven was brought up as Ian's real son. Steven was written out once again in 1996, when Collins quit for a second time. In the on-screen events, Cindy absconded with Steven and his brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]] following Cindy's failed attempt to have Ian assassinated. Upon his return in 1997 \u2013 where Ian once again regained custody \u2013 Steven's role was recast to another actor, [[Edward Savage (footballer)|Edward Savage]]. As the character aged, his actor was given a more substantial role in the serial, Steven remaining with Ian following the death of his mother, who died in prison during child birth. Savage remained in the role until 2002, when he opted to leave. On-screen, Steven discovered that Ian had been lying about his paternity. He began rebelling, and was found to be the author of several mysterious poison pen letters. When he was caught, he demanded to travel to New Zealand, so he could meet his real father, Simon Wicks. A BBC source commented to the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', \"Regular viewers will know Steven is a deeply troubled boy. But his unmasking as the poison pen author is going to shock everyone on the Square. The lad is almost inviting punishment. It's as if he wants Ian and [his stepmother] [[Laura Beale|Laura]] to wash their hands of him. Could Steven be a new [[Nick Cotton]] in the making?\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a9530/writer-of-eastenders-poison-pen-letters-revealed.html|title= Writer of 'EastEnders' poison pen letters revealed|website=[[Digital Spy]] | author=Neil Wilkes| date = 6 November 2002| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reintroduction (2007); stalking, kidnapping and mental illness===\nIn 2005, the British media claimed that the character of Steven was due to return to ''EastEnders'', three years after he had last appeared. The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' speculated that ''EastEnders'' bosses were hoping to cast an Australian actor to play Steven, to signify that he had been in New Zealand.

After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured to the top of a deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/22/comment.tvandradioarts1|title= For whom the Beale tolls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author= Anne Pickard | date = 22 September 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy.<ref name=\"ds\"/> [[Aaron Sidwell]] was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him.

Steven is..a messed up kid and when I first got the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people to be thinking about him [all the time]...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>\n\nThe storyline eventually reached its climax in October 2007. Steven's games were uncovered, and during the confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having \"a whiff of [[Bront\u00eb]] about it\", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, \"It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love \u2013 Ian Beale \u2013 as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then tune in to find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/08/mondaymediasection12|title= The art of storytelling|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author=  Stephen Armstrong| date = 8 October 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nMentally ill, Steven was admitted to a psychiatric hospital by Ian. Sidwell has commented on Steven's mental instability: \"He's so unpredictable...you never know what he's going to do next...He'll be normal one minute and he'll be crazy the next. He's kind of the [[Donnie Darko (character)|Donnie Darko]] of ''EastEnders''...that's the kind of person I styled him after...[he is] a similar character...He is always going to be a bit unstable and there will always be danger.

Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with [[Stacey Slater]] (played by [[Lacey Turner]]), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven \u2013 infuriated by Ian's rejection \u2013 soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Departure (2008); sexuality and Lucy's disappearance===\nIn February 2008, the BBC announced that Steven was being written out of ''EastEnders'' once again.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20080222_n2.shtml|title= Steven's farewell|publisher=BBC | date = 22 February 2008| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman revealed: \"[Sidwell]'s contract has run out \u2013 he only came for that length of contract.

The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; in an interview with the ''Daily Star'' he explained, \"[Lacey Turner's] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it!

John Partridge, has commented, \"Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man \u2013 and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt.

The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales' lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out, and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot was described as \"controversial\", and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: \"A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well.\"<ref name=\"chris\" />\n\nA final twist in Steven's story was his involvement in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy ([[Melissa Suffield]]). In episodes that aired in May 2008, it was revealed that Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. \n\nExplaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, \"It's all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian's love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She's the one who gets most of Ian's time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He's been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn\u2019t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian\u2019s life for good [...] He craves Ian\u2019s full attention and is willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.

In the late 2000s, Steven's storyline focused on his hostile relationship with Ian, and involved stalking Ian, taking Ian hostage, multiple [[suicide]] attempts, and accidentally shooting Ian's new wife, [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]). Steven also dates [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) but struggles with his sexuality and an attraction to Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), and he attempts to murder his grandmother, [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Since his 2016 return, Steven becomes deceitful with his girlfriend [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) by having an affair with her sister [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) - which sparks the events of the character being responsible for Abi's pregnancy; fabricating a lie about having a brain tumour; and nearly killing Jane again after Lauren and Abi's father, [[Max Branning|Max]] ([[Jake Wood]]), blackmails him in setting fire to the restaurant in his plan to kill her as revenge for her contribution to getting him wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of half-sister [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Hetti Bywater]]), who was previously killed by their stepbrother [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby]] (Eliot Carrington). Ultimately, Steve contemplates on rescuing Jane and ends up getting injured in the fire by Max - which consequently triggers the character suffering a fatal cardiac arrest in hospital; Steve dies and his lies are soon discovered at his funeral a week later.\n\n==Storylines==\n=== 1989\u20132002 ===\nSteven is born in December 1989; his mother is [[Cindy Beale]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and his father is [[Simon Wicks]] ([[Nick Berry]]) - even though Cindy is married to [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]); she goes as far as to convince Ian that he is Steven's father. Simon becomes Steven's godfather, despite knowing that he is his biological father. Cindy tells Ian the truth when she and Simon reconcile. They leave Walford with Steven in December 1990; however, Ian and Cindy reconcile in 1992, and Ian raises Steven as his son. In December 1993, Steven becomes a half-brother when his sister [[Lucy Beale]] and brother [[Peter Beale]] are born to Ian and Cindy. Unhappy in her marriage, Cindy hires a hitman to kill Ian in 1996, and when this fails, she snatches Steven and Peter and flees to [[Italy]]. In 1997, Ian tracks her, Steven and Peter down and kidnaps them back. Cindy fights for custody and wins, but on the day she reclaims Steven, Lucy and Peter, she is arrested when the hitman confesses to the attempted murder of Ian and Ian gains custody of Steven, Lucy and Peter. She dies in childbirth in prison in November 1998. Steven alone attends her funeral.\n\nSteven then grows up with various different stepmothers, and though he grows close to them all, he feels abandoned when they leave. When Ian prepares to marry [[Laura Dunn]] ([[Hannah Waterman]]), Steven is anxious that they too will end up splitting; his fears are realised when he catches Ian kissing  [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) in 2002. From being a quiet, sensitive boy, Steven starts rebelling and skipping school. When Laura finds out, she confronts Steven, who reveals that Ian had kissed Janine. The subsequent rows have a negative effect on Steven; he becomes angry with the world and starts writing poison pen letters to people. Ian eventually finds out and confronts Steven. Following an argument, Steven goes to his room and overhears Ian calling him \"Cindy's little brat!\"; Ian is forced to tell Steven that he is not his natural father. Distressed and angry, Steven decides to leave Walford to meet Simon, who lives in [[Auckland]], New Zealand.\n\n=== 2007\u20132008 ===\nIn September 2007, Steven returns and begins stalking Ian, pretending to be Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father had not been a happy experience, and he had ended up feeling rejected and in the way.\n\nSteven then tries to commit suicide with a gun that Lucy gives him to dispose of. Ian, Jane and Lucy try to stop him, a struggle ensues, and Jane is accidentally shot in the stomach; as a result, she is unable to have children. Ian admits Steven to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When released, Steven goes off his medication. He tries to apologise to Jane and Ian, but finds them hostile. Hoping he will leave Walford, Ian humiliates and rejects Steven several times, going as far as to break a snow globe he had given to Steven when he was young right in front of him. Once again depressed, Steven tries to commit suicide by dousing himself in petrol; however, [[Stacey Slater]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) stops him from setting fire to himself. When Ian discovers what Steven has been planning to do, he reconciles with him. Displeased, Jane fights against Steven being part of her family, but eventually relents and in January 2008, she agrees to let Steven move into the Beales' home; however, she makes it clear that she is waiting for him to mess up so he will be gone from her life for good.\n\nSteven and Stacey grow closer in early 2008, as he supports her through the breakdown of her marriage. Steven is attracted to Stacey. She initially rejects his advances, but eventually agrees to date him. Their relationship progresses, until Steven decides that he is ready to lose his virginity, but their attempt at consummation ends in disaster when Steven can not perform sexually. Embarrassed, Steven pretends that he had lost his virginity; however, Jane's brother [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]) realises he is lying and publicly announces it, leaving Steven humiliated. Steven confronts Christian and, after releasing his pent-up anger and frustration, he spontaneously kisses Christian. Realising Steven is gay, Christian tries to make Steven face up to his sexuality. Steven maintains that he is heterosexual, and successfully has sex with Stacey, but their relationship soon ends when Christian tells Stacey that Steven had kissed him.\n\nDistraught, Steven propositions Christian, but is rejected. In revenge, Steven tells Ian that Christian had tried to seduce him. Ian is furious until Jane discovers the truth, leading Steven to confess that he is gay. Steven is grateful when Ian proves supportive, as his biological father had not been. Ian is full of praise for Steven; however, he does not realise that Steven has been hiding his runaway daughter, Lucy. Steven does not want to share Ian's attention, so he makes plans for Lucy to flee to France; however, Pat discovers his plan and is hit by a car as she is trying to apprehend him. Pat is hospitalised, and in order to stop her from telling Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to smother her with a pillow. Pat wakes up, but Steven continues in his murder attempt until Ian interrupts him. When Pat tells Ian about Lucy, Steven tries to deny it, but Ian sees through his lies. He traces Steven to [[St Pancras railway station]], and discovers him with Lucy. Steven has booked her a ticket on the [[Eurostar]], but Ian persuades her not to go and Steven flees. Later, back in Walford, Ian spots Steven spying on Lucy. Ian confronts him, admitting that he is glad that Steven is not his biological son; he tells him that if he ever returns to Albert Square, he will kill him. Devastated, Steven heads to the tube station and leaves Walford. In 2014, Peter reveals that Steven was living in New Zealand with his father, Simon. Peter (now [[Ben Hardy (actor)|Ben Hardy]]) and fianc\u00e9e [[Lauren Branning]] ([[Jacqueline Jossa]]) leave Walford for New Zealand to join Steven in February 2015.\n\n=== 2016\u20132017 ===\nIn May 2016, Steven returns with Lauren and [[List of EastEnders characters (2015)#Louie|Louie]] after they learn that Jane is in hospital after being attacked by [[Bobby Beale (EastEnders)|Bobby Beale]] (Eliot Carrington), who also confessed to killing Lucy. Ian initially rejects Steven, but Steven says he is back to help and repair any damage he made in the past. Ian accepts Steven's offer of driving him to the hospital. Steven and Lauren do not tell anyone that they are together but when Ian finds out, he throws them out. Ian eventually accepts Steven back into the family but Jane is wary of him. Steven helps Ian at his restaurant and impresses him with his sales skills. Sadly, Jane soon finds an unfinished credit card application in Lucy's name and accuses Steven. Steven admits being responsible because he realised Ian is struggling financially. Ian promotes Steven to restaurant manager. When the restaurant is burgled, it is revealed that Steven arranged it and sold the kitchen equipment to pay debts. [[Kyle Slater]] ([[Riley Carter Millington]]), an employee at the restaurant, realises Steven arranged the burglary, so Steven sends him on a training course, and he admits to Lauren what he did. Later, Kyle asks Steven for a pay rise, saying he has kept quiet about the burglary, but Steven refuses.\n\nSteven worries when Jane asks to look at the restaurant's accounts as he has stolen money. He makes excuses not to let her use the restaurant's laptop and tells Lauren he will fake some invoices. Steven is overjoyed when Louie says his first word, \"mama\", and gets him to say \"dada\", filming it to show Lauren. However, she sends the video to Peter, upsetting Steven as he tells Lauren that he sees himself as Louie's father but Lauren says Peter will always be Louie's father. Steven also worries that Lauren never says she loves him when he says it to her. When Jane looks at the restaurant's accounts and realizes payments are being made to a fake company, she knows it can only be Ian or Steven but worries about confronting the wrong person. She soon discovers that Steven set up the fake company and confronts him; he explains he borrowed the money to help Peter, who was drinking heavily and getting into fights and Lauren does not know the whole truth, so Jane tells him to be honest with her. She is angry that Steven was not honest and considers visiting Peter; Steven says he wanted to protect her and Louie, and going to New Zealand out of guilt or pity will be a mistake.\n\nLauren meets [[Josh Hemmings]] ([[Eddie Eyre]]), a man who works in her father [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) office, and they are attracted to each other. Josh encourages Lauren to apply for a job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her to spend more time with him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes his head against the wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a [[Brain tumor|brain tumour]], claiming that he has [[cancer]] and he is dying.\n\nAlthough Abi discovers the truth, she decides not to tell Lauren after Steven tells her he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. However, Steven tells Lauren he wants to adopt Louie and stuns Abi by proposing marriage to Lauren in The Queen Vic. When Lauren leaves Walford to visit Tanya, conflicted on her relationship with Steven, Max tells him he knows he lied about the brain tumour and gives him an ultimatum: help him move some clients from his property or he will tell Lauren the truth. Max tells Steven to set fire to the flat while making sure the clients safely exit the premises. Steven refuses and tells Max that he will tell Lauren the truth when she returns and tells Abi that their affair was a mistake. However, when Lauren texts to say that she will be staying with Tanya for longer, Steven agrees to Max's plan. However, the plan appears to backfire when the residents hear sirens of fire engines, police cars and ambulances. Max finds Steven in The Vic alleyway and Steven tells him he does not know if the clients exited the flat. Max tells Steven that he is on his own as he drove Ian's car to the flat, while dismissing Steven's claim that if he goes to prison, Max will go down too. Max tells him to find an alibi, so Steven asks Abi. Steven tells Max that he has an alibi and mentions that the clients did exit the flat. Jane later discovers Max's revenge plan and Steven's brain tumour lie and Max convinces Steven that Jane is trying to get rid of him. Steven confronts Jane and blames her for Max's behaviour, but Jane tries to reason with Steven and reveals Abi is pregnant. However, Steven refuses to believe her, and after berating her about framing Max for Lucy's murder, sets fire to the restaurant, and leaves Jane to perish in the flames. Believing Lauren trapped inside, Steven and Max run back into the inferno and Steven saves Abi, who became trapped upon finding, and attempting to save Jane. Max tried to get Steven to kill Jane but he refuses and tries to save her. Max violently shoves him into a countertop, causing Steven to be rushed to hospital where he tells Abi that he loves her and will try to make their relationship work. He then suffers a [[cardiac arrest]] and dies from his injuries. When Steven's lies are revealed, it is also revealed that Steven died of injuries to the liver (likely from when Max pushed him) and so only Abi attends his funeral and reads a eulogy dedicated to him. Abi then has Steven cremated and hides his ashes away from Lauren when they visit their mother [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) in Exeter. However, Lauren eventually discovers the truth after finding Abi in her wedding dress. Horrified by what she has learned, Lauren tries to flush Steven's ashes down the toilet, but Abi stops her, eventually telling her the truth about her pregnancy with his baby. In December 2017, Abi and Lauren learn about their father's scheme before discovering his knowledge over the former's pregnancy with Steven's baby. They eventually find out on Christmas that year the truth about Steven's death when their mother [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] reveals that Max killed him \u2013 causing them to disown their father, who subsequently gets into a fight with Ian when he and his mother [[Kathy Beale|Kathy]] learn the truth as well; the latter then explains this to Phil, who then confronts and attacks Max. Shortly afterwards, Abi and Lauren fall from the Queen Vic roof; both survive and are taken to hospital, where an ultrasound shows Abi and Steven's baby is alive. Fearing that Abi may go into cardiac arrest following her devastating diagnosis of brain stem death, the doctors decide to deliver the baby via cesarean section. Soon after, the doctors switch off Abi's life support when it becomes clear that the chances of reviving her are impossible.\n\nA year later, many people blamed Bobby for Max's revenge including the deaths of Steven and his own daughter Abi.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Early storylines===\nThe character's conception was a part of one of the most notable storylines in ''EastEnders'' during 1989, a love triangle between [[Cindy Beale|Cindy Williams]] (played by [[Michelle Collins]]), [[Simon Wicks]] (played by [[Nick Berry]]) and [[Ian Beale]] (played by [[Adam Woodyatt]]).<ref name=\"10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Steven was the result of a [[one-night stand]] (in the bar of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]) between Cindy and Simon, occurring while Cindy was engaged to Ian Beale in May 1989. Viewers knew that Cindy was carrying Simon's child; however, between characters in the serial, Steven's true paternity was kept secret, with only Cindy, Simon, and later Simon's mother [[Pat Butcher]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]) knowing the truth, though neither Simon or Pat would believe Cindy's claim initially. Simon's rejection of Cindy and her unborn child facilitated a plot twist that saw Cindy pretend that the child was Ian's.\n\nThe character's birth occurred in an episode that aired on 28 December 1989, although in the on-screen events, he was born on [[Boxing Day]]. In the storyline, Steven was born two months prematurely, and was therefore supposed to be small; however, the baby who originally played Steven, Edward Farrell, was actually large for his age, and was nicknamed \"Chunky\" by actor Adam Woodyatt.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=9780563362920|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> According to former ''EastEnders'' writer, [[David Yallop]], it had been agreed in September 1989, that Steven Beale would be killed off in the serial. This was part of producer [[Mike Gibbon]]'s plan to increase the ratings by culling a large number of the soap's long-running cast. Yallop said, \"We had to reach a decision with the illegitimate child who was in the process of being born as a result of an earlier storyline. We wanted to know what to do with it. Either the child would be allowed to live or it would die. They decided to make the child 'seriously ill', but the reprieve was temporary. In episode 606 I resolved the problem.\" He claimed that on his draft of the storyline he wrote the words \"Baby die\". The plot never came to fruition, as Gibbon was abruptly replaced as the soap's boss and Yallop's plots were scrapped.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/soap-operas-producers-aimed-axe-at-poor-acting-1556027.html|title=Soap opera's producers 'aimed axe at poor acting' |newspaper=The Independent| date = 8 October 1992|accessdate=19 July 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Handbook]]'' by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for roles in ''EastEnders'' is usually done locally, so that children and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> This occurred with Steven's original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: \"Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing her hair back under her hat but lots of [viewers] still spotted it\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven's christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, \"When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn\u2019t recover and I kissed him for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nBefore his first screen birthday, Steven was central to storylines surrounding his parents and stepfather Ian, including a special week of off-set episodes filmed in Devon, where Ian discovered that his best friend Simon was Steven's real father and that he had reunited with Cindy. The love triangle between Simon, Cindy and Ian, and the events surrounding Steven's paternity dominated the soap during 1990; it has been described by writer [[Colin Brake]] as the year's \"big story\".<ref name=\"10years\"/> Steven was written out of the serial after actors Nick Berry and Michelle Collins decided to leave the show. His exit aired on 27 December 1990, though in the on-screen events it was Boxing Day, Steven's first birthday. In 1992, Michelle Collins reprised her role of Cindy, and Steven was also reintroduced, played by a different actor, Stuart Stevens. On-screen, Simon abandoned Cindy and Steven. Ian traced them to a bedsit and brought them back to Walford, where Steven was brought up as Ian's real son. Steven was written out once again in 1996, when Collins quit for a second time. In the on-screen events, Cindy absconded with Steven and his brother [[Peter Beale|Peter]] following Cindy's failed attempt to have Ian assassinated. Upon his return in 1997 \u2013 where Ian once again regained custody \u2013 Steven's role was recast to another actor, [[Edward Savage (footballer)|Edward Savage]]. As the character aged, his actor was given a more substantial role in the serial, Steven remaining with Ian following the death of his mother, who died in prison during child birth. Savage remained in the role until 2002, when he opted to leave. On-screen, Steven discovered that Ian had been lying about his paternity. He began rebelling, and was found to be the author of several mysterious poison pen letters. When he was caught, he demanded to travel to New Zealand, so he could meet his real father, Simon Wicks. A BBC source commented to the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', \"Regular viewers will know Steven is a deeply troubled boy. But his unmasking as the poison pen author is going to shock everyone on the Square. The lad is almost inviting punishment. It's as if he wants Ian and [his stepmother] [[Laura Beale|Laura]] to wash their hands of him. Could Steven be a new [[Nick Cotton]] in the making?\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a9530/writer-of-eastenders-poison-pen-letters-revealed.html|title= Writer of 'EastEnders' poison pen letters revealed|website=[[Digital Spy]] | author=Neil Wilkes| date = 6 November 2002| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reintroduction (2007); stalking, kidnapping and mental illness===\nIn 2005, the British media claimed that the character of Steven was due to return to ''EastEnders'', three years after he had last appeared. The ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' speculated that ''EastEnders'' bosses were hoping to cast an Australian actor to play Steven, to signify that he had been in New Zealand. It was claimed that actors from Australia's long-running soaps, ''[[Neighbours]]'' or ''[[Home and Away]]'', were being considered.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a19045/eastenders-return-for-kathy-beale.html|title= 'EastEnders' return for Kathy Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Daniel Kilkelly| date = 6 February 2005| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> The rumours turned out to be false, and a subsequent rumour in January 2007 predicting that ''[[Footballers' Wives]]''' actor [[Craig Gallivan]] was to play the role, was also quashed.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a42116/footie-wives-actor-tipped-as-new-steven-beale.html|title= Footie Wives actor tipped as new Steven Beale?|publisher=DS | author= Kris Green| date = 25 January 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref>\n[[File:Stevenbeale 2007.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Steven Beale as he appeared in 2007]]\nThe character was eventually to make his return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] as part of a storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured to the top of a deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/sep/22/comment.tvandradioarts1|title= For whom the Beale tolls|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author= Anne Pickard | date = 22 September 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref> For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy.<ref name=\"ds\"/> [[Aaron Sidwell]] was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him.

Steven's games were uncovered, and during the confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife [[Jane Beale|Jane]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having \"a whiff of [[Bront\u00eb]] about it\", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, \"It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love \u2013 Ian Beale \u2013 as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then tune in to find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting.\"<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/08/mondaymediasection12|title= The art of storytelling|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | author=  Stephen Armstrong| date = 8 October 2007| accessdate=4 March 2008 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nMentally ill, Steven was admitted to a psychiatric hospital by Ian. Sidwell has commented on Steven's mental instability: \"He's so unpredictable...you never know what he's going to do next...He'll be normal one minute and he'll be crazy the next. He's kind of the [[Donnie Darko (character)|Donnie Darko]] of ''EastEnders''...that's the kind of person I styled him after...[he is] a similar character...He is always going to be a bit unstable and there will always be danger.

Subsequent plots saw him unsuccessfully attempting to make amends with Ian and Jane for his past wrongdoing. The character also formed a friendship with [[Stacey Slater]] (played by [[Lacey Turner]]), who stopped him from committing suicide in December 2007. In the on-screen events, Steven \u2013 infuriated by Ian's rejection \u2013 soaked himself with petrol and threatened to light himself on fire. In the end, Stacey managed to persuade him not to go through with suicide by showing him that friends can be just as important as family. Despite hostilities from Jane, Steven gradually regained Ian's trust, and in episodes that aired over the Christmas period of 2007, Ian welcomed Steven back into his home as part of the Beale family.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Departure (2008); sexuality and Lucy's disappearance===\nIn February 2008, the BBC announced that Steven was being written out of ''EastEnders'' once again.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/news/news_20080222_n2.shtml|title= Steven's farewell|publisher=BBC | date = 22 February 2008| accessdate=4 March 2008}}</ref> An ''EastEnders'' spokeswoman revealed: \"[Sidwell]'s contract has run out \u2013 he only came for that length of contract.

He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality...\"<ref name=\"virginity\" /> On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; in an interview with the ''Daily Star'' he explained, \"[Lacey Turner's] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [John Partridge] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality.

John Partridge, has commented, \"Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man \u2013 and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it.

The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales' lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out, and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot was described as \"controversial\", and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: \"A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well.\"<ref name=\"chris\" />\n\nA final twist in Steven's story was his involvement in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy ([[Melissa Suffield]]). In episodes that aired in May 2008, it was revealed that Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. \n\nExplaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, \"It's all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian's love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She's the one who gets most of Ian's time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He's been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn\u2019t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian\u2019s life for good [...] He craves Ian\u2019s full attention and is willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.

An ''EastEnders'' source told ''Digital Spy'': \"Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian.

He is willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants  including murder.\" \n\nThe murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the [[Eurostar]] to [[Paris]]) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, \"Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him.

The problem is ''EastEnders'' is a realistic show, so with Steven being a larger-than-life character it was always going to be hard having him doing the same crazy things day in, day out. I wasn't expecting to stay on the Square forever. It was my first big job out of drama college and I couldn't have asked for a better start in the industry.

[[Front side bus]] (FSB) frequency (external clock) has been increased from 133&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]] to 148&nbsp;MHz, and the CPU [[clock multiplier]] factor has been changed from 13.5 to 16.5. This corresponds to an overclocking of the FSB by 11.3% and of the CPU by 36%.]]\n\nIn [[computing]], '''overclocking''' is the practice of increasing the [[clock rate]] of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer. Commonly operating voltage is also increased to maintain a component's operational stability at accelerated speeds. [[Semiconductor device]]s operated at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/02/19/why-has-cpu-frequency-ceased-to-grow|author= Victoria Zhislina|date=2014-02-19|title=Why has CPU frequency ceased to grow?|publisher=Intel}}</ref> An overclocked device may be unreliable or fail completely if the additional heat load is not removed or power delivery components cannot meet increased power demands. Many device warranties state that overclocking and/or over-specification voids any warranty, however there are an increasing number of manufacturers that will allow overclocking as long as performed [relatively] safely.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component. Normally, on modern systems, the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem, such as the main processor or graphics controller, but other components, such as system memory ([[Random-access memory|RAM]]) or [[Bus (computing)|system buses]] (generally on the [[motherboard]]), are commonly involved. The trade-offs are an increase in power consumption (heat), fan noise (cooling), and shortened lifespan for the targeted components. Most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer's control; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage. Overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin, with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user. Examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling, as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds. Also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals, as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds.\n\nWhile most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking, all devices have finite limits. Generally for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum \"stable\" speed where they still operate correctly. Past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results, which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it. While in a PC context the usual result is a system crash, more subtle errors can go undetected, which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as [[data corruption]] (incorrectly calculated results, or worse ''writing to storage'' incorrectly) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks (general usage such as internet browsing and [[word processing]] appear fine, but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system).\n\nAt this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed, but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output, as well as shorten the lifespan further. At some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power, the user's ability to cool the part, and the device's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves [[Failure of electronic components|destructive failure]]. Overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device's performance to the point of failure, or in extreme cases outright [[Thermal runaway|destroy it]].\n\nThe speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system, and what components are being overclocked by the user; [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s for different purposes are published.\n\n===Underclocking===\n{{Main|Underclocking}}\nConversely, the primary goal of [[underclocking]] is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device, with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance. Reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow [[Quiet PC|quieter operation]], and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge. Some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life, or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency accordingly.\n\nUnderclocking is almost always involved in the latter stages of [[Undervolting]], which seeks to find the highest clock speed that a processor will stably operate at a given voltage. That is, while overclocking seeks to maximize clock speed with temperature and power as constraints, underclocking seeks to find the highest clock speed that a device can reliably operate at a fixed, arbitrary power limit. A given device may operate correctly at its stock speed even when undervolted, in which case underclocking would only be employed after further reductions in voltage finally destabilizes the part. At that point the user would need to determine if the last working voltage and speed have satisfactorily lowered power consumption for their needs \u2013 if not then performance must be sacrificed, a lower clock is chosen (the underclock) and testing at progressively lower voltages would continue from that point. A lower bound is where the device itself fails to function and/or the supporting circuitry cannot reliably communicate with the part.\n\nUnderclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently (such as for a home entertainment center) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings. This would use a \"standard-voltage\" part and attempt to run with lower voltages (while attempting to keep the desktop speeds) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build. This was also attractive as using a \"standard voltage\" processor in a \"low voltage\" application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version. However again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success, and the builder's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered. The usefulness of underclocking (again like overclocking) is determined by what processor offerings, prices, and availability are at the specific time of the build. Underclocking is also sometimes used when [[troubleshooting]].\n\n===Enthusiast culture===\n\nOverclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines. However, the practice is embraced more by [[enthusiast computing|enthusiasts]] than professional users, as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability, accuracy and damage to data and equipment. Additionally, most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use. While overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity, and thus workflow productivity for professional users, the importance of stability testing components thoroughly ''before'' employing them into a production environment cannot be overstated.\n\nOverclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts. Overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer, or at speeds only officially offered on specialized, higher-priced versions of the product. A general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first, then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market. If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering. This can give insight on how over-the-horizon technologies will perform before they are officially available on the mainstream market, which can be especially helpful for other users considering if they should plan ahead to purchase or upgrade to the new feature when it is officially released.\n\nSome hobbyists enjoy building, tuning, and \"Hot-Rodding\" their systems in competitive benchmarking competitions, competing with other like-minded users for high scores in standardized computer benchmark suites. Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model's stock performance. Another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing [[system requirements]] and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons. Another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier, little is lost as it is already [[Depreciation|depreciated]], and would have needed to be replaced in any case.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 1\u20132] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 }}</ref>\n\n===Components===\n\nTechnically any component that uses a timer (or clock) to synchronize its internal operations can be overclocked. Most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components, such as, [[Central processing unit|processors]] (a.k.a. CPU), [[video card]]s, [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, and [[random-access memory|RAM]]. Most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock (processor bus speed) by an internal multiplier within the processor (the [[CPU multiplier]]) to attain their final speed.\n\nComputer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the [[CPU multiplier]] if that option is available, but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the [[front-side bus|bus clock]]. Some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks (such as a [[Clock rate|system clock]]) that influence the bus clock speed that, again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed.\n\nMost [[OEM systems|OEM]] systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the BIOS of the OEM's motherboard, which precludes overclocking (for warranty and support reasons). The same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them.\n\nAny given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed. Components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable, but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning, even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values. The maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability, then accepting the last stable slower setting. Components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential. The end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available CPU multipliers, bus dividers, [[voltage]]s; the user's ability to manage thermal loads, cooling techniques; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances, interaction with other components and the rest of the system.\n\n==Considerations==\nThere are several things to be considered when overclocking. First is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new [[clock rate]]. Supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive [[voltage]] can permanently damage a component.\n\nIn a professional production environment, overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required, the possibly reduced reliability, the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties, and the higher power consumption. If faster speed is required it is often cheaper when all costs are considered to buy faster hardware.\n\n=== Cooling ===\n{{Main|Computer cooling}}\n[[Image:Copper heat sink with pipes.jpg|thumb|High quality [[heat sink]]s are often made of [[copper]].]]\n\nAll [[Electrical network|electronic circuits]] produce heat generated by the movement of electric current. As clock frequencies in [[digital circuit]]s and voltage applied increase, the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases. The relationship between clock frequencies and [[thermal design power]] (TDP) are linear. However, there is a limit to the maximum frequency which is called a \"wall\". To overcome this issue, overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential. Voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly (proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit, for example); this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating. In addition, some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in [[MOSFET]] device characteristics. Conversely, the overclocker may decide to ''decrease'' the chip voltage while overclocking (a process known as undervolting), to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal.\n\nStock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use; overclocked circuits can require more cooling, such as by powerful [[fan (mechanical)|fans]], larger [[heat sink]]s, [[heat pipe]]s and [[water cooling]]. Mass, shape, and material all influence the ability of a heatsink to dissipate heat. Efficient heatsinks are often made entirely of [[copper]], which has high [[thermal conductivity]], but is expensive.<ref name=Wainner38>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 38] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 }}</ref> [[Aluminium]] is more widely used; it has good thermal characteristics, though not as good as copper, and is significantly cheaper. Cheaper materials such as steel do not have good thermal characteristics. [[Heat pipe]]s can be used to improve conductivity. Many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost.<ref name=Wainner38/>\n\n[[File:DIY PC watercooling T-Line.JPG|Interior of a water-cooled computer, showing CPU [[water block]], tubing, and pump|left|thumb]]\n\nWater cooling carries [[waste heat]] to a [[radiator]]. [[Thermoelectric cooling]] devices which actually refrigerate using the [[Peltier effect]] can help with high [[thermal design power]] (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. Thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an [[electric current]] through the plates.

Chemwiki.ucdavis.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-17.</ref>  However, this practice is discouraged since acetone is extremely flammable and volatile.\n\n=== Stability and functional correctness ===\n\n{{See also| Stress testing#Hardware }}\n\nAs an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer's recommended operating conditions, it may function incorrectly, leading to system instability. Another risk is [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|silent data corruption]] by undetected errors.  Such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications, [[device drivers]], or the operating system. Overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave (even under normal operating conditions) without becoming totally unusable.\n\nA large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer PCs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase (depending on CPU manufacturer) in system crashes due to CPU failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/144888/eurosys84-nightingale.pdf|title=Cycles, cells and platters: an empirical analysis of hardware failures on a million consumer PCs. Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems (EuroSys '11). pp 343-356|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nIn general, overclockers claim that testing can ensure that an overclocked system is stable and functioning correctly. Although software tools are available for testing hardware stability, it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor.<ref>{{cite web | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.9086 | title = Coverage Metrics for Functional Validation of Hardware Designs | publisher = IEEE Design & Test of Computers | year = 2001 | first = Charles M. | last = Kurt Keutzer }}</ref> Achieving good [[fault coverage]] requires immense engineering effort; even with all of the resources dedicated to validation by manufacturers, faulty components and even design faults are not always detected.\n\nA particular \"stress test\" can verify only the functionality of the specific instruction sequence used in combination with the data and may not detect faults in those operations. For example, an arithmetic operation may produce the correct result but incorrect [[status register|flags]]; if the flags are not checked, the error will go undetected.\n\nTo further complicate matters, in process technologies such as [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI), devices display [[hysteresis]]&mdash;a circuit's performance is affected by the events of the past, so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same.  Often, an overclocked system which passes stress tests experiences instabilities in other programs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/12/407562.aspx | first = Raymond | last = Chen | title = The Old New Thing: There's an awful lot of overclocking out there | date = April 12, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-03-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn overclocking circles, \"stress tests\" or \"torture tests\" are used to check for correct operation of a component.  These workloads are selected as they put a very high load on the component of interest (e.g. a graphically intensive application for testing video cards, or different math-intensive applications for testing general CPUs).  Popular stress tests include [[Prime95]], [[Lavalys|Everest]], [[Superpi]], OCCT, AIDA64, [[Linpack]] (via the LinX and IntelBurnTest [[GUI]]s), [[Sisoft Sandra|SiSoftware Sandra]], [[BOINC]], Intel Thermal Analysis Tool and [[Memtest86]].  The hope is that any functional-correctness issues with the overclocked component will show up during these tests, and if no errors are detected during the test, the component is then deemed \"stable\". Since fault coverage is important in [[Software testing|stability testing]], the tests are often run for long periods of time, hours or even days. An overclocked computer is sometimes described using the number of hours and the stability program used, such as \"prime 12 hours stable\".\n\n===Factors allowing overclocking===\nOverclockability arises in part due to the economics of the manufacturing processes of CPUs and other components. In many cases components are manufactured by the same process, and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings. Components are then marked with a rating chosen by the market needs of the semiconductor manufacturer.  If [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|manufacturing yield]] is high, more higher-rated components than required may be produced, and the manufacturer may mark and sell higher-performing components as lower-rated for marketing reasons.  In some cases, the true maximum rating of the component may exceed even the highest rated component sold.  Many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones, while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical.\n\nNotably, higher clocks must always mean greater waste heat generation, as semiconductors set to high must dump to ground more often.  In some cases, this means that the chief drawback of the overclocked part is far more heat dissipated than the maximums published by the manufacturer.  Pentium architect [[Bob Colwell]] calls overclocking an \"uncontrolled experiment in better-than-worst-case system operation\".<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Bob|last1=Colwell|title=The Zen of Overclocking|journal=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer]]|volume=37|issue=3|date=March 2004|pages=9\u201312|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|doi=10.1109/MC.2004.1273994}}</ref>\n\n=== Measuring effects of overclocking ===\n\n[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] are used to evaluate performance, and they can become a kind of \"sport\" in which users compete for the highest scores.  As discussed above, stability and functional correctness may be compromised when overclocking, and meaningful benchmark results depend on the correct execution of the benchmark.  Because of this, benchmark scores may be qualified with stability and correctness notes (e.g. an overclocker may report a score, noting that the benchmark only runs to completion 1 in 5 times, or that signs of incorrect execution such as display corruption are visible while running the benchmark). A widely used test of stability is Prime95, which has built-in error checking that fails if the computer is unstable.\n\nUsing only the benchmark scores, it may be difficult to judge the difference overclocking makes to the overall performance of a computer. For example, some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system, such as memory [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], without taking into consideration how higher [[clock rate]]s in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole. Apart from demanding applications such as video encoding, high-demand [[database]]s and [[scientific computing]], [[memory bandwidth]] is typically not a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]], so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used. Other benchmarks, such as [[3D Mark|3DMark]], attempt to replicate game conditions.\n\n== Manufacturer and vendor overclocking ==\n\nCommercial system builders or component resellers sometimes overclock to sell items at higher profit margins. The seller makes more money by overclocking lower-priced components which are found to operate correctly and selling equipment at prices appropriate for higher-rated components. While the equipment will normally operate correctly, this practice may be considered [[fraud]]ulent if the buyer is unaware of it.\n\nOverclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers, in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors, memory, video cards, and other hardware products. Several video card manufactures now offer factory-overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators, complete with a warranty, usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance.\n\nIt is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as [[CPU locking|CPU multiplier locking]] to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them. These measures are sometimes marketed as a [[consumer protection]] benefit, but are often criticized by buyers.\n\nMany motherboards are sold, and advertised, with extensive facilities for overclocking implemented in hardware and controlled by [[BIOS]] settings.<ref>[http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM3Plus/M5A78LUSB3/ Web page for a typical motherboard claiming overclocking support]</ref>\n\n== CPU multiplier locking ==\n\n'''CPU multiplier locking''' is the process of permanently setting a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]'s [[clock multiplier]].  [[AMD]] CPUs are unlocked in early editions of a model and locked in later editions, but nearly all [[Intel]] CPUs are locked and recent models are very resistant to unlocking to prevent overclocking by users. AMD ships unlocked CPUs with their Opteron, FX, Ryzen and Black Series line-up, while Intel uses the monikers of \"Extreme Edition\" and \"K-Series.\" Intel usually has one or two Extreme Edition CPUs on the market as well as X series and K series CPUs analogous to AMD's Black Edition. AMD has the majority of their desktop range in a Black Edition.\n\nUsers usually unlock CPUs to allow overclocking, but sometimes to allow for [[underclocking]] in order to maintain the [[front side bus]] speed (on older CPUs) compatibility with certain motherboards. Unlocking generally invalidates the manufacturer's warranty, and mistakes can cripple or destroy a CPU. Locking a chip's clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking, as the speed of the front-side bus or PCI multiplier (on newer CPUs) may still be changed to provide a performance increase. AMD Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs are generally unlocked by connecting bridges ([[jumper (computing)|jumper]]-like points) on the top of the CPU with [[electrical conduction|conductive]] paint or [[Graphite|pencil lead]].  Other CPU models may require different procedures.\n\nIncreasing front-side bus and/or northbridge/PCI clocks can overclock locked CPUs, but this throws many system frequencies out of sync, since the RAM and PCI frequencies are modified as well.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to unlock older AMD Athlon XP CPUs was called the ''pin mod'' method, because it was possible to unlock the CPU without permanently modifying bridges. A user could simply put one wire (or some more for a new multiplier/Vcore) into the socket to unlock the CPU. More recently however, notably with Intel's Skylake architecture, Intel had a bug with the Skylake (6th gen Core) processors where the base clock could be increased past 102.7 MHz, however functionality of certain features would not work. Intel intended to block base clock (BCLK) overclocking of locked processors when designing the Skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights (since the CPU's BCLK was no longer tied to the PCI buses), however for LGA1151, the 6th generation \"Skylake\" processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 MHz (which was the intended limit by Intel, and was later mandated through later BIOS updates). All other unlocked processors from LGA1151 and v2 (including 7th, 8th, and 9th generation) and BGA1440 allow for BCLK overclocking (as long as the OEM allows it), while all other locked processors from 7th, 8th, and 9th gen were not able to go past 102.7 MHz on the BCLK.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}\n* Higher '''performance''' in games, en-/decoding, video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense, but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output.\n* System '''optimization''': Some systems have \"[[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]]\", where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many [[motherboard]]s with [[Athlon 64|AMD Athlon 64]] processors limit the clock rate of four units of RAM to 333 [[Hertz|MHz]]. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor clock rate (which is a base number times a [[CPU multiplier]], for instance 1.8&nbsp;GHz is most likely 9\u00d7200&nbsp;MHz) by a fixed [[integer]] such that, at a stock clock rate, the RAM would run at a clock rate near 333&nbsp;MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set (usually adjusting the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 5-10%, and gain a small increase in RAM clock rate and/or reduction in RAM latency timings.\n* It can be '''cheaper''' to purchase a lower performance component and overclock it to the clock rate of a more expensive component.\n* Extending life on older equipment (through underclocking/undervolting).\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\n=== General ===\n\n{{Original       research|section|date=December 2011}}\n* Higher [[clock rate]]s and voltages increase '''power consumption''', also increasing '''electricity cost''' and '''heat production'''. The additional heat increases the ambient air temperature within the system case, which may affect other components. The hot air blown out of the case heats the room it's in.\n* Fan '''noise''': High-performance fans running at maximum speed used for the required degree of cooling of an overclocked machine can be noisy, some producing 50&nbsp;[[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]] or more of noise. When maximum cooling is not required, in any equipment, fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum: fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15&nbsp;dB.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/top10noise.pdf UK Health and Safety Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques]</ref> Fan noise can be reduced by design improvements, e.g. with aerodynamically optimized blades for smoother airflow, reducing noise to around 20&nbsp;dB at approximately 1 metre{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} or larger fans rotating more slowly, which produce less noise than smaller, faster fans with the same airflow. Acoustical insulation inside the case e.g. acoustic foam can reduce noise. Additional cooling methods which do not use fans can be used, such as liquid and phase-change cooling.\n* An overclocked computer may become '''unreliable'''. For example: [[Microsoft Windows]] may appear to work with no problems, but when it is re-installed or upgraded, error messages may be received such as a \"file copy error\" during Windows Setup.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310064/en-us Article ID: 310064 \u2013 Last Review: May 7, 2007 \u2013 Revision: 6.2 How to troubleshoot problems during installation when you upgrade from Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition to Windows XP]</ref> Microsoft says this of errors in upgrading to Windows XP: \"Your computer [may be] over-clocked.\" Because installing Windows is very memory-intensive, decoding errors may occur when files are extracted from the Windows XP CD-ROM.\n* The '''lifespan''' of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat.\n* Warranties may be voided by overclocking.\n\n=== Risks of overclocking ===\n\n* Increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion, while an increase in voltage usually causes heat to increase exponentially. Excessive voltages or improper cooling may cause chip temperatures to rise to dangerous levels, causing the chip to be damaged or destroyed.\n* Exotic cooling methods used to facilitate overclocking such as water cooling are more likely to cause damage if they malfunction. Sub-ambient cooling methods such as [[Computer cooling#Phase-change cooling|phase-change cooling]] or [[liquid nitrogen]] will cause water [[condensation]], which will cause electrical damage unless controlled; some methods include using kneaded erasers or shop towels to catch the condensation.\n\n=== Limitations ===\n\nOverclocking components can only be of noticeable benefit if the component is on the [[Critical path method|critical path]] for a process, if it is a bottleneck. If disk access or the speed of an [[Internet]] connection limit the speed of a process, a 20% increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed, however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an SSD to be read and written to faster.. Overclocking a CPU will not noticeably benefit a game when a graphics card's performance is the \"botleneck\" of the game.\n\n== Graphics cards ==\n\n[[File:Bfg geforce 6800 gs oc.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The BFG GeForce 6800GSOC ships with higher memory and [[clock rate]]s than the standard 6800GS.]]\nGraphics cards can also be overclocked. There are [[utility software|utilities]] to achieve this, such as [[EVGA Corporation|EVGA]]'s Precision, [[RivaTuner]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] Overdrive (on [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] cards only), [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] Afterburner, Zotac Firestorm, and the [[PEG Link Mode]] on [[Asus]] [[motherboard]]s. Overclocking a GPU will often yield a marked increase in performance in synthetic benchmarks, usually reflected in game performance<ref>[http://www.altesc.net/2013/06/15/gtx-780-overclocking/ Alt+Esc | GTX 780 Overclocking Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. It is sometimes possible to see that a graphics card is being pushed beyond its limits before any permanent damage is done by observing on-screen artifacts or unexpected system crashes. It is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat, [[clock rate]], and/or voltage limits, however if seen when not overclocked, they indicate a faulty card. After a reboot, video settings are reset to standard values stored in the graphics card firmware, and the maximum [[clock rate]] of that specific card is now deducted.\n\nSome overclockers apply a [[potentiometer]] to the graphics card to manually adjust the voltage (which usually invalidates the warranty). This allows for finer adjustments, as overclocking software for graphics cards can only go so far. Excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself (practically speaking).\n\n=== Alternatives ===\n\nFlashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a [[Graphics card|video card]], without technically overclocking (but is much riskier than overclocking just through software).\n\n'''''Flashing''''' refers to using the [[firmware]] of a different card with the same (or sometimes similar) core and compatible firmware, effectively making it a higher model card; it can be difficult, and may be irreversible. Sometimes [[Computer software|standalone software]] to modify the firmware files can be found, e.g. [[NiBiTor]] (GeForce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect), without using firmware for a better model video card. For example, video cards with 3D accelerators (most, {{As of|2011|lc=on}}) have two voltage and [[clock rate]] settings, one for 2D and one for 3D, but were designed to operate with ''three'' voltage stages, the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two, serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2D to 3D operation mode. Therefore, it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to \"serious\" overclocking, specifically because of this fallback ability; the card can drop down to this [[clock rate]], reducing by a few (or sometimes a few dozen, depending on the setting) percent of its efficiency and cool down, without dropping out of 3D mode (and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings).\n\nSome cards have abilities not directly connected with overclocking. For example, Nvidia's [[GeForce|GeForce 6600GT]] (AGP flavor) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card, invisible to the user if standard firmware is used. Modifying the firmware can display a 'Temperature' tab.\n\n'''''Unlocking''''' refers to enabling extra [[Graphics pipeline|pipelines]] or [[pixel shader]]s.  The [[GeForce 6 Series|6800LE]], the [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GS]] and [[GeForce 6 Series|6800]] ([[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] models only) were some of the first cards to benefit from unlocking.  While these  models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled, they share the same 16x6 [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] core as a [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GT]] or Ultra, but  pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled; the GPU may be fully functional, or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification. GPUs found to be fully functional can be unlocked successfully, although it is not possible to be sure that there are undiscovered faults; in the worst case the card may become [[Brick (electronics)|permanently unusable]].\n\n== History ==\n\nOverclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983, when AMD sold an overclocked version of the [[Intel 8088]] CPU. In 1984, some consumers were overclocking IBM's version of the [[Intel 80286]] CPU by replacing the clock crystal.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Clock rate]]\n* [[CPU-Z]]\n* [[Double boot]]\n* [[Dynamic voltage scaling]]\n* [[POWER8 on-chip controller]] (OCC)\n* [[Serial presence detect]] (SPD)\n* [[Super PI]]\n* [[Underclocking]]\n* [[UNIVAC I#Instructions and data|UNIVAC I Overdrive, 1952 unofficial modification]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References==\n\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n;Notes\n*{{cite journal | first = Bob | last = Colwell | authorlink = Bob Colwell | title = The Zen of Overclocking | journal =  Computer | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 9\u201312 |date=March 2004 | doi = 10.1109/MC.2004.1273994}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{wikibooks|How To Build A Computer|Optimizing and Overclocking}}\n{{Commons category|Overclocking}}\n<!--PLEASE NO FORUMS, LINKS WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR COMMERCIAL SITES, THEY WILL BE REMOVED-->\n* [http://www.ocinside.de/html/workshop/amd_socketa_overclock.html OverClocked inside]\n* [http://www.wikihow.com/Overclock-a-PC How to Overclock a PC], WikiHow\n* [http://www.ethernetworks.de/imac_g4_usb2_overclocking.html Overclocking guide for the Apple iMac G4 main logic board]\n\n=== Overclocking and benchmark databases ===\n\n*[http://www.xtremesystems.org OC Database of all PC hardware for the past decade] (applications, modifications and more)\n*[http://www.hwbot.org HWBOT: Worldwide Overclocking League \u2013 Overclocking competition and data]\n*[http://www.forum-inside.de/cgi-bin/forum/ocdatabase_e.cgi Comprehensive CPU OC Database]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110624071633/http://imperiogamer.com/index.php/juegos/noticias/item/2367-segunda-convencion-nacional-de-oc-overclocking-extremo- Segunda Convencion Nacional de OC: Overclocking Extremo] by Imperio Gamer\n*[http://www.hwmaster.com/forum/tools-utili-per-loverclock-t168.html Tool for overclock]\n{{Computer processor power management technologies}}\n\n[[Category:Computer hardware tuning]]\n[[Category:Clock signal]]\n[[Category:Hobbies]]\n[[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]\n", "text_old": "''Not to be confused with [[Odometer#Clocking.2FBusting miles and legality|overclocking (mileometer/odometer)]]''\n\n[[Image:Overclock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Overclocking [[BIOS]] setup on an ABIT NF7-S [[motherboard]] with an AMD [[Athlon&nbsp;XP]] processor.

This corresponds to an overclocking of the FSB by 11.3% and of the CPU by 36%.]]\n\nIn [[computing]], '''overclocking''' is the practice of increasing the [[clock rate]] of a computer to exceed that certified by the manufacturer. Commonly operating voltage is also increased to maintain a component's operational stability at accelerated speeds. [[Semiconductor device]]s operated at higher frequencies and voltages increase power consumption and heat.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/02/19/why-has-cpu-frequency-ceased-to-grow|author= Victoria Zhislina|date=2014-02-19|title=Why has CPU frequency ceased to grow?|publisher=Intel}}</ref> An overclocked device may be unreliable or fail completely if the additional heat load is not removed or power delivery components cannot meet increased power demands. Many device warranties state that overclocking and/or over-specification voids any warranty, however there are an increasing number of manufacturers that will allow overclocking as long as performed [relatively] safely.\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe purpose of overclocking is to increase the operating speed of a given component. Normally, on modern systems, the target of overclocking is increasing the performance of a major chip or subsystem, such as the main processor or graphics controller, but other components, such as system memory ([[Random-access memory|RAM]]) or [[Bus (computing)|system buses]] (generally on the [[motherboard]]), are commonly involved. The trade-offs are an increase in power consumption (heat), fan noise (cooling), and shortened lifespan for the targeted components. Most components are designed with a margin of safety to deal with operating conditions outside of a manufacturer's control; examples are ambient temperature and fluctuations in operating voltage. Overclocking techniques in general aim to trade this safety margin by setting the device to run in the higher end of the margin, with the understanding that temperature and voltage must be more strictly monitored and controlled by the user. Examples are that operating temperature would need to be more strictly controlled with increased cooling, as the part will be less tolerant of increased temperatures at the higher speeds. Also base operating voltage may be increased to compensate for unexpected voltage drops and to strengthen signalling and timing signals, as low-voltage excursions are more likely to cause malfunctions at higher operating speeds.\n\nWhile most modern devices are fairly tolerant of overclocking, all devices have finite limits. Generally for any given voltage most parts will have a maximum \"stable\" speed where they still operate correctly. Past this speed the device starts giving incorrect results, which can cause malfunctions and sporadic behavior in any system depending on it. While in a PC context the usual result is a system crash, more subtle errors can go undetected, which over a long enough time can give unpleasant surprises such as [[data corruption]] (incorrectly calculated results, or worse ''writing to storage'' incorrectly) or the system failing only during certain specific tasks (general usage such as internet browsing and [[word processing]] appear fine, but any application wanting advanced graphics crashes the system).\n\nAt this point an increase in operating voltage of a part may allow more headroom for further increases in clock speed, but the increased voltage can also significantly increase heat output, as well as shorten the lifespan further. At some point there will be a limit imposed by the ability to supply the device with sufficient power, the user's ability to cool the part, and the device's own maximum voltage tolerance before it achieves [[Failure of electronic components|destructive failure]]. Overzealous use of voltage and/or inadequate cooling can rapidly degrade a device's performance to the point of failure, or in extreme cases outright [[Thermal runaway|destroy it]].\n\nThe speed gained by overclocking depends largely upon the applications and workloads being run on the system, and what components are being overclocked by the user; [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s for different purposes are published.\n\n===Underclocking===\n{{Main|Underclocking}}\nConversely, the primary goal of [[underclocking]] is to reduce power consumption and the resultant heat generation of a device, with the trade-offs being lower clock speeds and reductions in performance. Reducing the cooling requirements needed to keep hardware at a given operational temperature has knock-on benefits such as lowering the number and speed of fans to allow [[Quiet PC|quieter operation]], and in mobile devices increase the length of battery life per charge. Some manufacturers underclock components of battery-powered equipment to improve battery life, or implement systems that detect when a device is operating under battery power and reduce clock frequency accordingly.\n\nUnderclocking is almost always involved in the latter stages of [[Undervolting]], which seeks to find the highest clock speed that a processor will stably operate at a given voltage. That is, while overclocking seeks to maximize clock speed with temperature and power as constraints, underclocking seeks to find the highest clock speed that a device can reliably operate at a fixed, arbitrary power limit. A given device may operate correctly at its stock speed even when undervolted, in which case underclocking would only be employed after further reductions in voltage finally destabilizes the part. At that point the user would need to determine if the last working voltage and speed have satisfactorily lowered power consumption for their needs \u2013 if not then performance must be sacrificed, a lower clock is chosen (the underclock) and testing at progressively lower voltages would continue from that point. A lower bound is where the device itself fails to function and/or the supporting circuitry cannot reliably communicate with the part.\n\nUnderclocking and undervolting would be attempted on a desktop system to have it operate silently (such as for a home entertainment center) while potentially offering higher performance than currently offered by low-voltage processor offerings. This would use a \"standard-voltage\" part and attempt to run with lower voltages (while attempting to keep the desktop speeds) to meet an acceptable performance/noise target for the build. This was also attractive as using a \"standard voltage\" processor in a \"low voltage\" application avoided paying the traditional price premium for an officially certified low voltage version. However again like overclocking there is no guarantee of success, and the builder's time researching given system/processor combinations and especially the time and tedium of performing many iterations of stability testing need to be considered. The usefulness of underclocking (again like overclocking) is determined by what processor offerings, prices, and availability are at the specific time of the build. Underclocking is also sometimes used when [[troubleshooting]].\n\n===Enthusiast culture===\n\nOverclocking has become more accessible with motherboard makers offering overclocking as a marketing feature on their mainstream product lines. However, the practice is embraced more by [[enthusiast computing|enthusiasts]] than professional users, as overclocking carries a risk of reduced reliability, accuracy and damage to data and equipment. Additionally, most manufacturer warranties and service agreements do not cover overclocked components nor any incidental damages caused by their use. While overclocking can still be an option for increasing personal computing capacity, and thus workflow productivity for professional users, the importance of stability testing components thoroughly ''before'' employing them into a production environment cannot be overstated.\n\nOverclocking offers several draws for overclocking enthusiasts. Overclocking allows testing of components at speeds not currently offered by the manufacturer, or at speeds only officially offered on specialized, higher-priced versions of the product. A general trend in the computing industry is that new technologies tend to debut in the high-end market first, then later trickle down to the performance and mainstream market. If the high-end part only differs by an increased clock speed, an enthusiast can attempt to overclock a mainstream part to simulate the high-end offering. This can give insight on how over-the-horizon technologies will perform before they are officially available on the mainstream market, which can be especially helpful for other users considering if they should plan ahead to purchase or upgrade to the new feature when it is officially released.\n\nSome hobbyists enjoy building, tuning, and \"Hot-Rodding\" their systems in competitive benchmarking competitions, competing with other like-minded users for high scores in standardized computer benchmark suites. Others will purchase a low-cost model of a component in a given product line, and attempt to overclock that part to match a more expensive model's stock performance. Another approach is overclocking older components to attempt to keep pace with increasing [[system requirements]] and extend the useful service life of the older part or at least delay a purchase of new hardware solely for performance reasons. Another rationale for overclocking older equipment is even if overclocking stresses equipment to the point of failure earlier, little is lost as it is already [[Depreciation|depreciated]], and would have needed to be replaced in any case.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 1\u20132] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/1 }}</ref>\n\n===Components===\n\nTechnically any component that uses a timer (or clock) to synchronize its internal operations can be overclocked. Most efforts for computer components however focus on specific components, such as, [[Central processing unit|processors]] (a.k.a. CPU), [[video card]]s, [[motherboard]] [[chipset]]s, and [[random-access memory|RAM]]. Most modern processors derive their effective operating speeds by multiplying a base clock (processor bus speed) by an internal multiplier within the processor (the [[CPU multiplier]]) to attain their final speed.\n\nComputer processors generally are overclocked by manipulating the [[CPU multiplier]] if that option is available, but the processor and other components can also be overclocked by increasing the base speed of the [[front-side bus|bus clock]]. Some systems allow additional tuning of other clocks (such as a [[Clock rate|system clock]]) that influence the bus clock speed that, again is multiplied by the processor to allow for finer adjustments of the final processor speed.\n\nMost [[OEM systems|OEM]] systems do not expose to the user the adjustments needed to change processor clock speed or voltage in the BIOS of the OEM's motherboard, which precludes overclocking (for warranty and support reasons). The same processor installed on a different motherboard offering adjustments will allow the user to change them.\n\nAny given component will ultimately stop operating reliably past a certain clock speed. Components will generally show some sort of malfunctioning behavior or other indication of compromised stability that alerts the user that a given speed is not stable, but there is always a possibility that a component will permanently fail without warning, even if voltages are kept within some pre-determined safe values. The maximum speed is determined by overclocking to the point of first instability, then accepting the last stable slower setting. Components are only guaranteed to operate correctly up to their rated values; beyond that different samples may have different overclocking potential. The end-point of a given overclock is determined by parameters such as available CPU multipliers, bus dividers, [[voltage]]s; the user's ability to manage thermal loads, cooling techniques; and several other factors of the individual devices themselves such as semiconductor clock and thermal tolerances, interaction with other components and the rest of the system.\n\n==Considerations==\nThere are several things to be considered when overclocking. First is to ensure that the component is supplied with adequate power at a voltage sufficient to operate at the new [[clock rate]]. Supplying the power with improper settings or applying excessive [[voltage]] can permanently damage a component.\n\nIn a professional production environment, overclocking is only likely to be used where the increase in speed justifies the cost of the expert support required, the possibly reduced reliability, the consequent effect on maintenance contracts and warranties, and the higher power consumption. If faster speed is required it is often cheaper when all costs are considered to buy faster hardware.\n\n=== Cooling ===\n{{Main|Computer cooling}}\n[[Image:Copper heat sink with pipes.jpg|thumb|High quality [[heat sink]]s are often made of [[copper]].]]\n\nAll [[Electrical network|electronic circuits]] produce heat generated by the movement of electric current. As clock frequencies in [[digital circuit]]s and voltage applied increase, the heat generated by components running at the higher performance levels also increases. The relationship between clock frequencies and [[thermal design power]] (TDP) are linear. However, there is a limit to the maximum frequency which is called a \"wall\". To overcome this issue, overclockers raise the chip voltage to increase the overclocking potential. Voltage increases power consumption and consequently heat generation significantly (proportionally to the square of the voltage in a linear circuit, for example); this requires more cooling to avoid damaging the hardware by overheating. In addition, some digital circuits slow down at high temperatures due to changes in [[MOSFET]] device characteristics. Conversely, the overclocker may decide to ''decrease'' the chip voltage while overclocking (a process known as undervolting), to reduce heat emissions while performance remains optimal.\n\nStock cooling systems are designed for the amount of power produced during non-overclocked use; overclocked circuits can require more cooling, such as by powerful [[fan (mechanical)|fans]], larger [[heat sink]]s, [[heat pipe]]s and [[water cooling]]. Mass, shape, and material all influence the ability of a heatsink to dissipate heat. Efficient heatsinks are often made entirely of [[copper]], which has high [[thermal conductivity]], but is expensive.<ref name=Wainner38>{{cite book | title = The Book of Overclocking | first = Scott | last = Wainner | author2 = Robert Richmond | page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 38] | isbn = 978-1-886411-76-0 | publisher = No Starch Press | year = 2003 | url = https://archive.org/details/bookofoverclocki0000wain/page/38 }}</ref> [[Aluminium]] is more widely used; it has good thermal characteristics, though not as good as copper, and is significantly cheaper. Cheaper materials such as steel do not have good thermal characteristics. [[Heat pipe]]s can be used to improve conductivity. Many heatsinks combine two or more materials to achieve a balance between performance and cost.<ref name=Wainner38/>\n\n[[File:DIY PC watercooling T-Line.JPG|Interior of a water-cooled computer, showing CPU [[water block]], tubing, and pump|left|thumb]]\n\nWater cooling carries [[waste heat]] to a [[radiator]]. [[Thermoelectric cooling]] devices which actually refrigerate using the [[Peltier effect]] can help with high [[thermal design power]] (TDP) processors made by Intel and AMD in the early twenty-first century. Thermoelectric cooling devices create temperature differences between two plates by running an [[electric current]] through the plates. This method of cooling is highly effective, but itself generates significant heat elsewhere which must be carried away, often by a convection-based heatsink or a [[water cooling#Computer usage|water cooling]] system.\n\n[[Image:2007TaipeiITMonth IntelOCLiveTest Overclocking-6.jpg|right|thumb|[[Liquid nitrogen]] may be used for cooling an overclocked system, when an extreme measure of cooling is needed.]]\n\nOther cooling methods are [[forced convection]] and [[phase transition]] cooling which is used in [[refrigerator]]s and can be adapted for computer use.

Chemwiki.ucdavis.edu. Retrieved on 2013-06-17.</ref>  However, this practice is discouraged since acetone is extremely flammable and volatile.\n\n=== Stability and functional correctness ===\n\n{{See also| Stress testing#Hardware }}\n\nAs an overclocked component operates outside of the manufacturer's recommended operating conditions, it may function incorrectly, leading to system instability. Another risk is [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|silent data corruption]] by undetected errors.  Such failures might never be correctly diagnosed and may instead be incorrectly attributed to software bugs in applications, [[device drivers]], or the operating system. Overclocked use may permanently damage components enough to cause them to misbehave (even under normal operating conditions) without becoming totally unusable.\n\nA large-scale 2011 field study of hardware faults causing a system crash for consumer PCs and laptops showed a four to 20 times increase (depending on CPU manufacturer) in system crashes due to CPU failure for overclocked computers over an eight-month period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/144888/eurosys84-nightingale.pdf|title=Cycles, cells and platters: an empirical analysis of hardware failures on a million consumer PCs. Proceedings of the sixth conference on Computer systems (EuroSys '11). pp 343-356|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nIn general, overclockers claim that testing can ensure that an overclocked system is stable and functioning correctly. Although software tools are available for testing hardware stability, it is generally impossible for any private individual to thoroughly test the functionality of a processor.<ref>{{cite web | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.9086 | title = Coverage Metrics for Functional Validation of Hardware Designs | publisher = IEEE Design & Test of Computers | year = 2001 | first = Charles M. | last = Kurt Keutzer }}</ref> Achieving good [[fault coverage]] requires immense engineering effort; even with all of the resources dedicated to validation by manufacturers, faulty components and even design faults are not always detected.\n\nA particular \"stress test\" can verify only the functionality of the specific instruction sequence used in combination with the data and may not detect faults in those operations. For example, an arithmetic operation may produce the correct result but incorrect [[status register|flags]]; if the flags are not checked, the error will go undetected.\n\nTo further complicate matters, in process technologies such as [[silicon on insulator]] (SOI), devices display [[hysteresis]]&mdash;a circuit's performance is affected by the events of the past, so without carefully targeted tests it is possible for a particular sequence of state changes to work at overclocked rates in one situation but not another even if the voltage and temperature are the same.  Often, an overclocked system which passes stress tests experiences instabilities in other programs.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/12/407562.aspx | first = Raymond | last = Chen | title = The Old New Thing: There's an awful lot of overclocking out there | date = April 12, 2005 | accessdate = 2007-03-17 }}</ref>\n\nIn overclocking circles, \"stress tests\" or \"torture tests\" are used to check for correct operation of a component.  These workloads are selected as they put a very high load on the component of interest (e.g. a graphically intensive application for testing video cards, or different math-intensive applications for testing general CPUs).  Popular stress tests include [[Prime95]], [[Lavalys|Everest]], [[Superpi]], OCCT, AIDA64, [[Linpack]] (via the LinX and IntelBurnTest [[GUI]]s), [[Sisoft Sandra|SiSoftware Sandra]], [[BOINC]], Intel Thermal Analysis Tool and [[Memtest86]].  The hope is that any functional-correctness issues with the overclocked component will show up during these tests, and if no errors are detected during the test, the component is then deemed \"stable\". Since fault coverage is important in [[Software testing|stability testing]], the tests are often run for long periods of time, hours or even days. An overclocked computer is sometimes described using the number of hours and the stability program used, such as \"prime 12 hours stable\".\n\n===Factors allowing overclocking===\nOverclockability arises in part due to the economics of the manufacturing processes of CPUs and other components. In many cases components are manufactured by the same process, and tested after manufacture to determine their actual maximum ratings. Components are then marked with a rating chosen by the market needs of the semiconductor manufacturer.  If [[Semiconductor device fabrication#Device test|manufacturing yield]] is high, more higher-rated components than required may be produced, and the manufacturer may mark and sell higher-performing components as lower-rated for marketing reasons.  In some cases, the true maximum rating of the component may exceed even the highest rated component sold.  Many devices sold with a lower rating may behave in all ways as higher-rated ones, while in the worst case operation at the higher rating may be more problematical.\n\nNotably, higher clocks must always mean greater waste heat generation, as semiconductors set to high must dump to ground more often.  In some cases, this means that the chief drawback of the overclocked part is far more heat dissipated than the maximums published by the manufacturer.  Pentium architect [[Bob Colwell]] calls overclocking an \"uncontrolled experiment in better-than-worst-case system operation\".<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Bob|last1=Colwell|title=The Zen of Overclocking|journal=[[Computer (magazine)|Computer]]|volume=37|issue=3|date=March 2004|pages=9\u201312|publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]|doi=10.1109/MC.2004.1273994}}</ref>\n\n=== Measuring effects of overclocking ===\n\n[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmarks]] are used to evaluate performance, and they can become a kind of \"sport\" in which users compete for the highest scores.  As discussed above, stability and functional correctness may be compromised when overclocking, and meaningful benchmark results depend on the correct execution of the benchmark.  Because of this, benchmark scores may be qualified with stability and correctness notes (e.g. an overclocker may report a score, noting that the benchmark only runs to completion 1 in 5 times, or that signs of incorrect execution such as display corruption are visible while running the benchmark). A widely used test of stability is Prime95, which has built-in error checking that fails if the computer is unstable.\n\nUsing only the benchmark scores, it may be difficult to judge the difference overclocking makes to the overall performance of a computer. For example, some benchmarks test only one aspect of the system, such as memory [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], without taking into consideration how higher [[clock rate]]s in this aspect will improve the system performance as a whole. Apart from demanding applications such as video encoding, high-demand [[database]]s and [[scientific computing]], [[memory bandwidth]] is typically not a [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]], so a great increase in memory bandwidth may be unnoticeable to a user depending on the applications used. Other benchmarks, such as [[3D Mark|3DMark]], attempt to replicate game conditions.\n\n== Manufacturer and vendor overclocking ==\n\nCommercial system builders or component resellers sometimes overclock to sell items at higher profit margins. The seller makes more money by overclocking lower-priced components which are found to operate correctly and selling equipment at prices appropriate for higher-rated components. While the equipment will normally operate correctly, this practice may be considered [[fraud]]ulent if the buyer is unaware of it.\n\nOverclocking is sometimes offered as a legitimate service or feature for consumers, in which a manufacturer or retailer tests the overclocking capability of processors, memory, video cards, and other hardware products. Several video card manufactures now offer factory-overclocked versions of their graphics accelerators, complete with a warranty, usually at a price intermediate between that of the standard product and a non-overclocked product of higher performance.\n\nIt is speculated that manufacturers implement overclocking prevention mechanisms such as [[CPU locking|CPU multiplier locking]] to prevent users from buying lower-priced items and overclocking them. These measures are sometimes marketed as a [[consumer protection]] benefit, but are often criticized by buyers.\n\nMany motherboards are sold, and advertised, with extensive facilities for overclocking implemented in hardware and controlled by [[BIOS]] settings.<ref>[http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/AMD_AM3Plus/M5A78LUSB3/ Web page for a typical motherboard claiming overclocking support]</ref>\n\n== CPU multiplier locking ==\n\n'''CPU multiplier locking''' is the process of permanently setting a [[Central processing unit|CPU]]'s [[clock multiplier]].  [[AMD]] CPUs are unlocked in early editions of a model and locked in later editions, but nearly all [[Intel]] CPUs are locked and recent models are very resistant to unlocking to prevent overclocking by users. AMD ships unlocked CPUs with their Opteron, FX, Ryzen and Black Series line-up, while Intel uses the monikers of \"Extreme Edition\" and \"K-Series.\" Intel usually has one or two Extreme Edition CPUs on the market as well as X series and K series CPUs analogous to AMD's Black Edition. AMD has the majority of their desktop range in a Black Edition.\n\nUsers usually unlock CPUs to allow overclocking, but sometimes to allow for [[underclocking]] in order to maintain the [[front side bus]] speed (on older CPUs) compatibility with certain motherboards. Unlocking generally invalidates the manufacturer's warranty, and mistakes can cripple or destroy a CPU. Locking a chip's clock multiplier does not necessarily prevent users from overclocking, as the speed of the front-side bus or PCI multiplier (on newer CPUs) may still be changed to provide a performance increase. AMD Athlon and Athlon XP CPUs are generally unlocked by connecting bridges ([[jumper (computing)|jumper]]-like points) on the top of the CPU with [[electrical conduction|conductive]] paint or [[Graphite|pencil lead]].  Other CPU models may require different procedures.\n\nIncreasing front-side bus and/or northbridge/PCI clocks can overclock locked CPUs, but this throws many system frequencies out of sync, since the RAM and PCI frequencies are modified as well.\n\nOne of the easiest ways to unlock older AMD Athlon XP CPUs was called the ''pin mod'' method, because it was possible to unlock the CPU without permanently modifying bridges. A user could simply put one wire (or some more for a new multiplier/Vcore) into the socket to unlock the CPU. More recently however, notably with Intel's Skylake architecture, Intel had a bug with the Skylake (6th gen Core) processors where the base clock could be increased past 102.7 MHz, however functionality of certain features would not work. Intel intended to block base clock (BCLK) overclocking of locked processors when designing the Skylake architecture to prevent consumers from purchasing cheaper components and overclocking to previously-unseen heights (since the CPU's BCLK was no longer tied to the PCI buses), however for LGA1151, the 6th generation \"Skylake\" processors were able to be overclocked past 102.7 MHz (which was the intended limit by Intel, and was later mandated through later BIOS updates). All other unlocked processors from LGA1151 and v2 (including 7th, 8th, and 9th generation) and BGA1440 allow for BCLK overclocking (as long as the OEM allows it), while all other locked processors from 7th, 8th, and 9th gen were not able to go past 102.7 MHz on the BCLK.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\n{{Original research|section|date=December 2011}}\n* Higher '''performance''' in games, en-/decoding, video editing and system tasks at no additional direct monetary expense, but with increased electrical consumption and thermal output.\n* System '''optimization''': Some systems have \"[[Bottleneck (software)|bottlenecks]]\", where small overclocking of one component can help realize the full potential of another component to a greater percentage than when just the limiting hardware itself is overclocked. For instance: many [[motherboard]]s with [[Athlon 64|AMD Athlon 64]] processors limit the clock rate of four units of RAM to 333 [[Hertz|MHz]]. However, the memory performance is computed by dividing the processor clock rate (which is a base number times a [[CPU multiplier]], for instance 1.8&nbsp;GHz is most likely 9\u00d7200&nbsp;MHz) by a fixed [[integer]] such that, at a stock clock rate, the RAM would run at a clock rate near 333&nbsp;MHz. Manipulating elements of how the processor clock rate is set (usually adjusting the multiplier), it is often possible to overclock the processor a small amount, around 5-10%, and gain a small increase in RAM clock rate and/or reduction in RAM latency timings.\n* It can be '''cheaper''' to purchase a lower performance component and overclock it to the clock rate of a more expensive component.\n* Extending life on older equipment (through underclocking/undervolting).\n\n==Disadvantages==\n\n=== General ===\n\n{{Original       research|section|date=December 2011}}\n* Higher [[clock rate]]s and voltages increase '''power consumption''', also increasing '''electricity cost''' and '''heat production'''. The additional heat increases the ambient air temperature within the system case, which may affect other components. The hot air blown out of the case heats the room it's in.\n* Fan '''noise''': High-performance fans running at maximum speed used for the required degree of cooling of an overclocked machine can be noisy, some producing 50&nbsp;[[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]] or more of noise. When maximum cooling is not required, in any equipment, fan speeds can be reduced below the maximum: fan noise has been found to be roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15&nbsp;dB.<ref>[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/top10noise.pdf UK Health and Safety Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques]</ref> Fan noise can be reduced by design improvements, e.g. with aerodynamically optimized blades for smoother airflow, reducing noise to around 20&nbsp;dB at approximately 1 metre{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} or larger fans rotating more slowly, which produce less noise than smaller, faster fans with the same airflow. Acoustical insulation inside the case e.g. acoustic foam can reduce noise. Additional cooling methods which do not use fans can be used, such as liquid and phase-change cooling.\n* An overclocked computer may become '''unreliable'''. For example: [[Microsoft Windows]] may appear to work with no problems, but when it is re-installed or upgraded, error messages may be received such as a \"file copy error\" during Windows Setup.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310064/en-us Article ID: 310064 \u2013 Last Review: May 7, 2007 \u2013 Revision: 6.2 How to troubleshoot problems during installation when you upgrade from Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition to Windows XP]</ref> Microsoft says this of errors in upgrading to Windows XP: \"Your computer [may be] over-clocked.\" Because installing Windows is very memory-intensive, decoding errors may occur when files are extracted from the Windows XP CD-ROM.\n* The '''lifespan''' of semiconductor components may be reduced by increased voltages and heat.\n* Warranties may be voided by overclocking.\n\n=== Risks of overclocking ===\n\n* Increasing the operation frequency of a component will usually increase its thermal output in a linear fashion, while an increase in voltage usually causes heat to increase exponentially. Excessive voltages or improper cooling may cause chip temperatures to rise to dangerous levels, causing the chip to be damaged or destroyed.\n* Exotic cooling methods used to facilitate overclocking such as water cooling are more likely to cause damage if they malfunction. Sub-ambient cooling methods such as [[Computer cooling#Phase-change cooling|phase-change cooling]] or [[liquid nitrogen]] will cause water [[condensation]], which will cause electrical damage unless controlled; some methods include using kneaded erasers or shop towels to catch the condensation.\n\n=== Limitations ===\n\nOverclocking components can only be of noticeable benefit if the component is on the [[Critical path method|critical path]] for a process, if it is a bottleneck. If disk access or the speed of an [[Internet]] connection limit the speed of a process, a 20% increase in processor speed is unlikely to be noticed, however there are some scenarios where increasing the clock speed of a processor actually allows an SSD to be read and written to faster.. Overclocking a CPU will not noticeably benefit a game when a graphics card's performance is the \"botleneck\" of the game.\n\n== Graphics cards ==\n\n[[File:Bfg geforce 6800 gs oc.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The BFG GeForce 6800GSOC ships with higher memory and [[clock rate]]s than the standard 6800GS.]]\nGraphics cards can also be overclocked. There are [[utility software|utilities]] to achieve this, such as [[EVGA Corporation|EVGA]]'s Precision, [[RivaTuner]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] Overdrive (on [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] cards only), [[Micro-Star International|MSI]] Afterburner, Zotac Firestorm, and the [[PEG Link Mode]] on [[Asus]] [[motherboard]]s. Overclocking a GPU will often yield a marked increase in performance in synthetic benchmarks, usually reflected in game performance<ref>[http://www.altesc.net/2013/06/15/gtx-780-overclocking/ Alt+Esc | GTX 780 Overclocking Guide<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. It is sometimes possible to see that a graphics card is being pushed beyond its limits before any permanent damage is done by observing on-screen artifacts or unexpected system crashes. It is common to run into one of those problems when overclocking graphics cards; both symptoms at the same time usually means that the card is severely pushed beyond its heat, [[clock rate]], and/or voltage limits, however if seen when not overclocked, they indicate a faulty card. After a reboot, video settings are reset to standard values stored in the graphics card firmware, and the maximum [[clock rate]] of that specific card is now deducted.\n\nSome overclockers apply a [[potentiometer]] to the graphics card to manually adjust the voltage (which usually invalidates the warranty). This allows for finer adjustments, as overclocking software for graphics cards can only go so far. Excessive voltage increases may damage or destroy components on the graphics card or the entire graphics card itself (practically speaking).\n\n=== Alternatives ===\n\nFlashing and unlocking can be used to improve the performance of a [[Graphics card|video card]], without technically overclocking (but is much riskier than overclocking just through software).\n\n'''''Flashing''''' refers to using the [[firmware]] of a different card with the same (or sometimes similar) core and compatible firmware, effectively making it a higher model card; it can be difficult, and may be irreversible. Sometimes [[Computer software|standalone software]] to modify the firmware files can be found, e.g. [[NiBiTor]] (GeForce 6/7 series are well regarded in this aspect), without using firmware for a better model video card. For example, video cards with 3D accelerators (most, {{As of|2011|lc=on}}) have two voltage and [[clock rate]] settings, one for 2D and one for 3D, but were designed to operate with ''three'' voltage stages, the third being somewhere between the aforementioned two, serving as a fallback when the card overheats or as a middle-stage when going from 2D to 3D operation mode. Therefore, it could be wise to set this middle-stage prior to \"serious\" overclocking, specifically because of this fallback ability; the card can drop down to this [[clock rate]], reducing by a few (or sometimes a few dozen, depending on the setting) percent of its efficiency and cool down, without dropping out of 3D mode (and afterwards return to the desired high performance clock and voltage settings).\n\nSome cards have abilities not directly connected with overclocking. For example, Nvidia's [[GeForce|GeForce 6600GT]] (AGP flavor) has a temperature monitor used internally by the card, invisible to the user if standard firmware is used. Modifying the firmware can display a 'Temperature' tab.\n\n'''''Unlocking''''' refers to enabling extra [[Graphics pipeline|pipelines]] or [[pixel shader]]s.  The [[GeForce 6 Series|6800LE]], the [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GS]] and [[GeForce 6 Series|6800]] ([[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] models only) were some of the first cards to benefit from unlocking.  While these  models have either 8 or 12 pipes enabled, they share the same 16x6 [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] core as a [[GeForce 6 Series|6800GT]] or Ultra, but  pipelines and shaders beyond those specified are disabled; the GPU may be fully functional, or may have been found to have faults which do not affect operation at the lower specification. GPUs found to be fully functional can be unlocked successfully, although it is not possible to be sure that there are undiscovered faults; in the worst case the card may become [[Brick (electronics)|permanently unusable]].\n\n== History ==\n\nOverclocked processors first became commercially available in 1983, when AMD sold an overclocked version of the [[Intel 8088]] CPU. In 1984, some consumers were overclocking IBM's version of the [[Intel 80286]] CPU by replacing the clock crystal.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Clock rate]]\n* [[CPU-Z]]\n* [[Double boot]]\n* [[Dynamic voltage scaling]]\n* [[POWER8 on-chip controller]] (OCC)\n* [[Serial presence detect]] (SPD)\n* [[Super PI]]\n* [[Underclocking]]\n* [[UNIVAC I#Instructions and data|UNIVAC I Overdrive, 1952 unofficial modification]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References==\n\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n;Notes\n*{{cite journal | first = Bob | last = Colwell | authorlink = Bob Colwell | title = The Zen of Overclocking | journal =  Computer | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 9\u201312 |date=March 2004 | doi = 10.1109/MC.2004.1273994}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n{{wikibooks|How To Build A Computer|Optimizing and Overclocking}}\n{{Commons category|Overclocking}}\n<!--PLEASE NO FORUMS, LINKS WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR COMMERCIAL SITES, THEY WILL BE REMOVED-->\n* [http://www.ocinside.de/html/workshop/amd_socketa_overclock.html OverClocked inside]\n* [http://www.wikihow.com/Overclock-a-PC How to Overclock a PC], WikiHow\n* [http://www.ethernetworks.de/imac_g4_usb2_overclocking.html Overclocking guide for the Apple iMac G4 main logic board]\n\n=== Overclocking and benchmark databases ===\n\n*[http://www.xtremesystems.org OC Database of all PC hardware for the past decade] (applications, modifications and more)\n*[http://www.hwbot.org HWBOT: Worldwide Overclocking League \u2013 Overclocking competition and data]\n*[http://www.forum-inside.de/cgi-bin/forum/ocdatabase_e.cgi Comprehensive CPU OC Database]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110624071633/http://imperiogamer.com/index.php/juegos/noticias/item/2367-segunda-convencion-nacional-de-oc-overclocking-extremo- Segunda Convencion Nacional de OC: Overclocking Extremo] by Imperio Gamer\n*[http://www.hwmaster.com/forum/tools-utili-per-loverclock-t168.html Tool for overclock]\n{{Computer processor power management technologies}}\n\n[[Category:Computer hardware tuning]]\n[[Category:Clock signal]]\n[[Category:Hobbies]]\n[[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]\n", "name_user": "Terrorist96", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking"}

He was the winner of 73 races, including the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]] in Puerto Rico. Camarero is notable for setting the current world record of the most [[Winning streak (sports)|consecutive wins]] for a [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse at 56 in a series of races between April 1953 and August 1955. \n\n==Background==\nCameraro was sired by Thirteen who was a son of 1938 Travers Stakes winner Thanksgiving. His name translates to \"waiter\" in Spanish. Camarero was a small bay colt that weighed 750 pounds and stood only 14 hands high. His male line traced to [[The Finn]] and he was bred and owned by prominent [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] newspaper man Jose Coll-Vidal.<ref name= \"ny55\">New York Times. Aug 9, 1955</ref>\n\nAs per Puerto Rican racetrack regulation, [[Parimutuel betting|prohibitive]] favorites are not allowed to be wagered on, which meant that for most of Camarero's winning streak no on-track bets were taken.<ref name=\"ny55\"/> Camarero was the first winner of Puerto Rico's [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]], winning the Governor's Cup, Jose de Diego Stakes and Primavera Stakes in 1954, undefeated.<ref>[http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/weekly-feature-articles/2005/August/05/Camareros-record-of-56-consecutive-wins-turns-50.aspx Thoroughbred Times. Aug. 5, 2005]</ref><ref>Jorge Col\u00f3n Delgado. ''Camarero en punta.'' 1998.</ref> As well according to Hall of Fame Jockey Angel Cordero Jr \"he[Cameraro] means horse racing.\"\n\n== History ==\nOn July 19, 1951, Camarera foaled a black colt with four white pasterns who was named Sabrosito. Through Coll-Vidal's foal-sharing agreement with breeder Luis Rechani-Agrait, the colt was bred in Rechani-Agrait's name and foaled on his farm.\n\nA year later, Coll-Vidal and trainer Pablo Suarez first saw Sabrosito, whom Coll-Vidal said looked like a small donkey. However, Suarez insisted that Coll-Vidal take the well-bred yearling. He did and renamed the colt Camarero in honor of his dam. \n\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy had declined and many lived in poverty. By 1953, when Camarero began his career, only two tracks were operating.\n\nCamarero made his first start on April 14, 1953, at two furlongs at Quintana racetrack and won by three lengths. On May 17, he won his second race; seven days later, he won his first stakes race in front-running fashion by four lengths. On July 17, he won his fifth race when he took the six-furlong Luis Mu-oz Rivera Stakes by seven lengths. From August 23 to October 23, Camarero won eight more races, including another stakes. His jockey in his first 13 victories was Juan Diaz-Andino.\n\nColl-Vidal had come close to Kincsem's record with two other horses, Cofresi and Condado, who won 49 and 44 consecutive races, respectively. He believed that for Camarero to break the record, he would have to replace the colt's jockey with leading rider Mateo Matos.\n\nIn 1952, Matos exercised horses at Aqueduct for Horatio Luro but returned to Puerto Rico. When he was first asked to ride the undefeated Camarero, Matos declined. \"He wanted to sleep in peace,\" wrote Jorge Col-n-Delgado in his book about Camarero. Assured that Coll-Vidal would not replace him if he lost aboard Camarero, Matos agreed to ride the colt.\n\n\n\nCamarero recorded five more victories to finish his two-year-old campaign in 1953 with 18 wins. On New Year's Day in 1954, he won the 61/2-furlong Governor's Cup while carrying 120 pounds, eight more than the second-highest-weighted horse in the race. The Governor's Cup was the first leg of Puerto Rico's Triple Crown, which was established in 1951 and had not yet been won.\n\nThe next two legs were the 11/16-mile Jose de Diego Stakes and the 11/8-mile Primavera Stakes. Camarero could carry high weight, but it was unknown if he could race successfully at longer distances. On January 11, 1954, he won his 20th race by ten lengths while going 11/16 miles, eliminating any doubts of his ability.\n\nOn April 17, Camarero won the Jose de Diego Stakes for his 28th win. On May 9, carrying 15 pounds more than any other rival, he won the Primavera Stakes to become Puerto Rico's first Triple Crown winner. On his actual third birthday, Camarero won his 32nd race and set a 61/2-furlong track record. After winning another race ten days later, he earned a well-deserved rest.\n\nFans grew eager for Camarero's return, and on October 24, he easily won his next start. He finished his three-year-old campaign with his 37th victory on December 19 and was selected Horse of the Year.\n\nRacing's popularity in Puerto Rico increased with each of Camarero's victories. By the end of 1954, track attendance had jumped 25%. People who had never been interested in the sport paid attention to Camarero while he chased Kincsem's record.\n\n\"Some people would say that he was allowed to win, but that wasn't true,\" Cordero recalled. \"He used to win because he was the best. The only thing was he never raced against horses [that were not bred] in Puerto Rico. But in my opinion, he could have competed against any horse at the time. ... But since he was chasing the world record, they kept racing him against Puerto Rican-bred horses.\"\n\nAt four in 1955, Camarero won nine more races from January 6 to April 22 and was just nine wins away from the record. During the first 32 racing days of the year, total handle increased a whopping 64% compared with the previous year. Everyone in Puerto Rico was talking about Camarero and chanting \"Camarero en punta,\" or \"Camarero up front,\" a phrase used by track announcer Pito Rivera-Monge when the colt headed to victory.\n\nCamarero kept winning. On July 18, 1955, he won his 54th race to tie Kincsem's record. The entire country waited to see when he would race again, and the interest was covered in the New York Times. Finally, it was announced that Camarero would go for the world record on August 7 in the fourth race at Quintana.\n\nAt the start of the 6 1/2-furlong race, the eight horses broke alertly. Matos held Camarero back and looked for a good spot to place him. By the half-mile pole, Matos let Camarero go, and the colt responded to win by six lengths.\n\n\"With 600 meters to go, Camarero was already ahead and I could hear the people screaming,\" Matos recalled in Col-n-Delgado's book. \"Coming down the stretch, I knew I had the race. Camarero started to pull away easily. The closer that we would get to the finish line, the louder the people would get in the stands. It was incredible. When I passed the finish line, I remember telling myself, 'We did it. We finally did it.' \"\n\nFans shouted and hugged each other, while others cried.

He was the winner of 73 races, including the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]] in Puerto Rico. Camarero is notable for setting the current world record of the most [[Winning streak (sports)|consecutive wins]] for a [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse at 56 in a series of races between April 1953 and August 1955. \n\n==Background==\nCameraro was sired by Thirteen who was a son of 1938 Travers Stakes winner Thanksgiving. His name translates to \"waiter\" in Spanish. Camarero was a small bay colt that weighed 750 pounds and stood only 14 hands high. His male line traced to [[The Finn]] and he was bred and owned by prominent [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] newspaper man Jose Coll-Vidal.<ref name= \"ny55\">New York Times. Aug 9, 1955</ref>\n\nAs per Puerto Rican racetrack regulation, [[Parimutuel betting|prohibitive]] favorites are not allowed to be wagered on, which meant that for most of Camarero's winning streak no on-track bets were taken.<ref name=\"ny55\"/> Camarero was the first winner of Puerto Rico's [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing]], winning the Governor's Cup, Jose de Diego Stakes and Primavera Stakes in 1954, undefeated.<ref>[http://www.thoroughbredtimes.com/weekly-feature-articles/2005/August/05/Camareros-record-of-56-consecutive-wins-turns-50.aspx Thoroughbred Times. Aug. 5, 2005]</ref><ref>Jorge Col\u00f3n Delgado. ''Camarero en punta.'' 1998.</ref> As well according to Hall of Fame Jockey Angel Cordero Jr \"he[Cameraro] means horse racing.\"\n\n== History ==\nOn July 19, 1951, Camarera foaled a black colt with four white pasterns who was named Sabrosito. Through Coll-Vidal's foal-sharing agreement with breeder Luis Rechani-Agrait, the colt was bred in Rechani-Agrait's name and foaled on his farm.\n\nA year later, Coll-Vidal and trainer Pablo Suarez first saw Sabrosito, whom Coll-Vidal said looked like a small donkey. However, Suarez insisted that Coll-Vidal take the well-bred yearling. He did and renamed the colt Camarero in honor of his dam. \n\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, Puerto Rico's economy had declined and many lived in poverty. By 1953, when Camarero began his career, only two tracks were operating.\n\nCamarero made his first start on April 14, 1953, at two furlongs at Quintana racetrack and won by three lengths. On May 17, he won his second race; seven days later, he won his first stakes race in front-running fashion by four lengths. On July 17, he won his fifth race when he took the six-furlong Luis Mu-oz Rivera Stakes by seven lengths. From August 23 to October 23, Camarero won eight more races, including another stakes. His jockey in his first 13 victories was Juan Diaz-Andino.\n\nColl-Vidal had come close to Kincsem's record with two other horses, Cofresi and Condado, who won 49 and 44 consecutive races, respectively. He believed that for Camarero to break the record, he would have to replace the colt's jockey with leading rider Mateo Matos.\n\nIn 1952, Matos exercised horses at Aqueduct for Horatio Luro but returned to Puerto Rico. When he was first asked to ride the undefeated Camarero, Matos declined. \"He wanted to sleep in peace,\" wrote Jorge Col-n-Delgado in his book about Camarero. Assured that Coll-Vidal would not replace him if he lost aboard Camarero, Matos agreed to ride the colt.\n\n\n\nCamarero recorded five more victories to finish his two-year-old campaign in 1953 with 18 wins. On New Year's Day in 1954, he won the 61/2-furlong Governor's Cup while carrying 120 pounds, eight more than the second-highest-weighted horse in the race. The Governor's Cup was the first leg of Puerto Rico's Triple Crown, which was established in 1951 and had not yet been won.\n\nThe next two legs were the 11/16-mile Jose de Diego Stakes and the 11/8-mile Primavera Stakes. Camarero could carry high weight, but it was unknown if he could race successfully at longer distances. On January 11, 1954, he won his 20th race by ten lengths while going 11/16 miles, eliminating any doubts of his ability.\n\nOn April 17, Camarero won the Jose de Diego Stakes for his 28th win. On May 9, carrying 15 pounds more than any other rival, he won the Primavera Stakes to become Puerto Rico's first Triple Crown winner. On his actual third birthday, Camarero won his 32nd race and set a 61/2-furlong track record. After winning another race ten days later, he earned a well-deserved rest.\n\nFans grew eager for Camarero's return, and on October 24, he easily won his next start. He finished his three-year-old campaign with his 37th victory on December 19 and was selected Horse of the Year.\n\nRacing's popularity in Puerto Rico increased with each of Camarero's victories. By the end of 1954, track attendance had jumped 25%. People who had never been interested in the sport paid attention to Camarero while he chased Kincsem's record.\n\n\"Some people would say that he was allowed to win, but that wasn't true,\" Cordero recalled. \"He used to win because he was the best. The only thing was he never raced against horses [that were not bred] in Puerto Rico. But in my opinion, he could have competed against any horse at the time. ... But since he was chasing the world record, they kept racing him against Puerto Rican-bred horses.\"\n\nAt four in 1955, Camarero won nine more races from January 6 to April 22 and was just nine wins away from the record. During the first 32 racing days of the year, total handle increased a whopping 64% compared with the previous year. Everyone in Puerto Rico was talking about Camarero and chanting \"Camarero en punta,\" or \"Camarero up front,\" a phrase used by track announcer Pito Rivera-Monge when the colt headed to victory.\n\nCamarero kept winning. On July 18, 1955, he won his 54th race to tie Kincsem's record. The entire country waited to see when he would race again, and the interest was covered in the New York Times. Finally, it was announced that Camarero would go for the world record on August 7 in the fourth race at Quintana.\n\nAt the start of the 6 1/2-furlong race, the eight horses broke alertly. Matos held Camarero back and looked for a good spot to place him. By the half-mile pole, Matos let Camarero go, and the colt responded to win by six lengths.\n\n\"With 600 meters to go, Camarero was already ahead and I could hear the people screaming,\" Matos recalled in Col-n-Delgado's book. \"Coming down the stretch, I knew I had the race. Camarero started to pull away easily. The closer that we would get to the finish line, the louder the people would get in the stands. It was incredible. When I passed the finish line, I remember telling myself, 'We did it. We finally did it.' \"\n\nFans shouted and hugged each other, while others cried. Elsewhere, the thousands of people who listened to the race on the radio began to rejoice, and many went out into the streets where drivers honked their horns. All of Puerto Rico celebrated.\n\n\"When Camarero established the world record, I was at the track that day,\" Cordero said. \"I was too young to fully understand what was going on.

Over and above these finest of advantages, it has plenty of firewood and timber in the adjacent sierra which surrounds its many sheltered spots, waters, and pasturages, for raising cattle and sheep and horses.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn 1851, some settlers led by William Pace set up scattered farms in the Spanish Fork bottom lands and called the area the Upper Settlement.<ref name=\"Jenson. p. 823\">Jenson.
