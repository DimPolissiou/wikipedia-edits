''Moe'', however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. \n\n''Moe'' is related to [[neoteny]] and the feeling of \"cuteness\" a character can evoke. The word ''moe'' originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use. ''Moe'' characters have expanded through Japanese media, and the concept has been commercialised. Contests, both online and in the real world, exist for ''moe''-styled things including one run by one of the [[Ethics Organization of Computer Software|Japanese game rating boards]]. Various notable commentators such as Tamaki Sait\u014d, Hiroki Azuma, and Kazuya Tsurumaki have also given their take on ''moe'', and its meaning.\n\n==Meaning ==\n{{Anime and manga}}\nMoe used in slang refers to feelings of affection, adoration, devotion, and excitement felt towards characters that appear in [[manga]], [[anime]], video games, and other media.

Commercialization was a result of interest that followed, and ''moe'' evolved from being a non-sexual desire to being a sexually sublimated fascination with cuteness. Oppliger goes on to say that ''moe'' shifted entirely from an interchange between character and viewer, to a focused fetish of viewers. Examples used by Oppliger include the series; ''[[K-On]]'', ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'', and ''[[Moetan]]'' where he points out they are \"revolved around adorable, whimsical, clumsy, early-adolescent girl characters in order to evoke, enflame, and manipulate the interests and affections of viewers.\" Rather than evoking ''moe'' feelings, they were literally ''moe'' characters that had defining characteristics of the ''moe'' style. Oppliger referred to these girl characters as \"adorably cute, just a bit sexually appealing, and self-conscious but not yet cynical\" going on to say that they demand notice, and adoration rather than passively earning it.<ref name=\"Oppliger\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/05/28/ask-john-what-are-the-defining-moe-anime/ |title=Ask John: What Are the Defining Mo\u00e9 Anime? |publisher=AnimeNation Anime News Blog |at=Ask John |first=John |last=Oppliger |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521195124/http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/05/28/ask-john-what-are-the-defining-moe-anime/ |date=2012-05-28 |archivedate=2015-05-21 |accessdate=2017-05-28}}</ref>\n\nWith ''moe'' anthropomorphism, ''moe'' characteristics are applied to give human elements to non-human objects.

''Moe'', however, has also gained usage to refer to feelings of affection towards any subject. \n\n''Moe'' is related to [[neoteny]] and the feeling of \"cuteness\" a character can evoke. The word ''moe'' originated in the late 1980s and early 1990s in Japan and is of uncertain origin, although there are several theories on how it came into use. ''Moe'' characters have expanded through Japanese media, and the concept has been commercialised. Contests, both online and in the real world, exist for ''moe''-styled things including one run by one of the [[Ethics Organization of Computer Software|Japanese game rating boards]]. Various notable commentators such as Tamaki Sait\u014d, Hiroki Azuma, and Kazuya Tsurumaki have also given their take on ''moe'', and its meaning.\n\n==Meaning ==\n{{Anime and manga}}\nMoe used in slang refers to feelings of affection, adoration, devotion, and excitement felt towards characters that appear in [[manga]], [[anime]], video games, and other media.

Commercialization was a result of interest that followed, and ''moe'' evolved from being a non-sexual desire to being a sexually sublimated fascination with cuteness. Oppliger goes on to say that ''moe'' shifted entirely from an interchange between character and viewer, to a focused fetish of viewers. Examples used by Oppliger include the series; ''[[K-On]]'', ''[[Lucky Star (manga)|Lucky Star]]'', and ''[[Moetan]]'' where he points out they are \"revolved around adorable, whimsical, clumsy, early-adolescent girl characters in order to evoke, enflame, and manipulate the interests and affections of viewers.\" Rather than evoking ''moe'' feelings, they were literally ''moe'' characters that had defining characteristics of the ''moe'' style.

In such areas where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural [[land development|land conversion]], the natural environment is greatly modified into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud [[hut]] or a [[photovoltaic system]] in the [[desert]], the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence [[beaver dam]]s, and the works of [[mound-building termites]], are thought of as natural.\n\nPeople seldom find ''absolutely natural'' environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other.

These major disciplines use [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or ''[[Outline of Earth sciences#Earth's spheres|spheres]]'' of Earth.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Geological activity==\n{{Main|Geology}}\nThe [[Crust (geology)#Earth's crust|Earth's crust]], or [[lithosphere]], is the outermost solid surface of the planet and is chemically and mechanically different from underlying [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]. It has been generated greatly by [[igneous]] processes in which [[magma]] cools and solidifies to form solid rock. Beneath the lithosphere lies the mantle which is heated by the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of [[radioactive element]]s. The mantle though solid is in a state of [[rheid|rheic]] [[convection]]. This convection process causes the lithospheric plates to move, albeit slowly. The resulting process is known as [[plate tectonics]]. [[Volcanoes]] result primarily from the melting of [[Subduction|subducted]] crust material or of rising mantle at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s and [[mantle plume]]s.\n\n==Water on Earth==\n[[File:Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG|thumb|upright=0.55|right|<center>[[Coral reef]]s have significant marine [[biodiversity]].</center>]]\nMost water is found in one or another natural kind of [[body of water]].\n\n=== Oceans ===\n{{Main|Ocean}}\nAn [[ocean]] is a major body of [[Seawater|saline water]], and a component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's [[surface of the Earth|surface]] (an area of some 362 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a [[World Ocean|continuous body of water]] that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller [[sea]]s. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800&nbsp;ft) deep. Average oceanic [[salinity]] is around 35 [[parts per thousand]] (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.

In larger rivers there is also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by waters over-topping the channel. Flood plains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. Rivers are a part of the [[hydrological cycle]]. Water within a river is generally collected from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through [[surface runoff]], [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of water stored in [[glacier]]s and snowpacks.\n\nSmall rivers may also be termed by several other names, including [[stream]], creek and brook. Their [[Current (stream)|current]] is confined within a [[stream bed|bed]] and [[stream bank]]s.

Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Ponds ====\n{{Main|Pond}}\nA pond is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [[Flow velocity|current speed]]. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.\n\n=== Human impact on water ===\nHumans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [[dam]]s and [[Channelization (rivers)|stream channelization]]), [[urbanization]], and [[deforestation]]. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.<ref name=Goudie>{{Cite book|title=The Human Impact on the Natural Environment|last=Goudie|first=Andrew|publisher=This MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=0-262-57138-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/humanimpactonn00goud/page/203 203\u2013239]|url=https://archive.org/details/humanimpactonn00goud/page/203}}</ref> We are building dams and reservoirs and manipulating the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams are good for us, some communities need the reservoirs to survive. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stops fish migration and the moving of organisms down stream. Urbanization effects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.<ref name=Goudie/>\n\n== Atmosphere, climate and weather ==\n[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|Atmospheric gases [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter blue light more than other wavelengths]], creating a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space.]]\n[[File:Troposphere CIMG1853.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Earth's [[troposphere]] from an [[airplane]]]]\n[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|[[Lightning]] is an [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] discharge of [[electricity]] accompanied by [[thunder]], which occurs during [[thunderstorm]]s and certain other natural conditions.<ref name=\"noaa1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/stratoguide/galunfeat.html|title=Volcanic Lightning|accessdate=September 21, 2007|publisher=National Geophysical Data Center - NOAA|author=NGDC - NOAA}}</ref>]]\n\nThe atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate & Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009044345/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/Trace_Gases.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 }}</ref> among which are the [[greenhouse gas]]es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of water droplets and [[ice]] crystals seen as [[cloud]]s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]], [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[meteoroid]]s. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present, such as [[chlorine]] (elementary or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds, elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulphur]] compounds such as [[sulphur dioxide]] [SO<sub>2</sub>].\n\nThe [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.\n\n===Layers of the atmosphere===\n{{Main|Earth's atmosphere}}\n\n====Principal layers====\nEarth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:\n* [[Exosphere]]: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].\n* [[Thermosphere]]: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [[exobase]]. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about {{convert|350|-|800|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|320|and|380|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* [[Mesosphere]]: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. It is the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon entering the atmosphere.\n* [[Stratosphere]]: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about {{convert|51|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[stratopause]], which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.\n* [[Troposphere]]: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles and {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [[tropopause]] is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.\n\n; Other layers\nWithin the five principal layers determined by temperature there are several layers determined by other properties.\n* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.\n* The [[ionosphere]], the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.\n* The [[homosphere]] and [[heterosphere]]: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.\n* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]].\n\n====Effects of global warming====\n[[File:Gletscherschmelze.jpg|thumb|left|The retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [[global warming]]]]\n{{Main|Effects of global warming}}\n\nThe dangers of [[global warming]] are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isro.gov.in/update/03-jun-2016/world%E2%80%99s-space-agencies-unite-to-face-climate-challenge|title=World\u2019s Space Agencies Unite To Face The Climate Challenge - ISRO|website=www.isro.gov.in|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [[climate change]] and global warming caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], or human-made releases of [[greenhouse gas]]es, most notably [[carbon dioxide]], can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the [[greenhouse effect]], which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/climate-change-75518/home|title=Climate Change|website=sites.google.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref> This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.<ref>{{cite web|last=Forthofer|first=Ron|title=It's Time To Act On Global Warming|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|publisher=Boulder Daily Camera|accessdate=2013-10-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616203811/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|archivedate=2013-06-16}}</ref>\nEfforts have been increasingly focused on the [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [[Adaptation to global warming|developing adaptative strategies]] to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [[nation]]s in adjusting to the [[effects of global warming]].

These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [[jet stream]]. Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140&nbsp;\u00b0C (100&nbsp;\u00b0F to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate\n\nSurface [[temperature]] differences in turn cause pressure differences.

There are many different hypotheses regarding the path that might have been taken from simple [[organic molecule]]s via pre-cellular life to protocells and metabolism.\n\nAlthough there is no universal agreement on the definition of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by [[Organism|organization]], [[metabolism]], [[cell growth|growth]], [[adaptation]], response to [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] and [[reproduction]].<ref>{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |title=Definition of Life |publisher=California Academy of Sciences |accessdate=2007-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208220940/http://www.calacademy.org/exhibits/xtremelife/what_is_life.php |archivedate=2007-02-08 }}</ref> Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of [[organism]]s. In [[biology]], the science of living organisms, \"life\" is the condition which distinguishes active [[organism]]s from [[Inorganic compound|inorganic matter]], including the capacity for growth, [[Physiology|functional activity]] and the continual change preceding death.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Concise Oxford Dictionary.

More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.\n\n==Ecosystems==\n[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|left|[[Rainforest]]s often have a great deal of [[biodiversity]] with many plant and animal species. This is the [[Gambia River]] in [[Senegal]]'s [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]].]]\n{{Main|Ecosystem}}\n\nAn [[ecosystem]] (also called as environment) is a natural unit consisting of all plants, animals and micro-organisms ([[biotic component|biotic]] factors) in an area functioning together with all of the non-living physical ([[abiotic]]) factors of the environment.<ref>{{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Christopherson |year=1996 |title=Geosystems: An Introduction to Physical Geography |publisher=Prentice Hall |location= |isbn=0-13-505314-5 }}</ref>\n\nCentral to the ecosystem concept is the idea that [[living organism]]s are continually engaged in a highly interrelated set of relationships with every other element constituting the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which they exist. [[Eugene Odum]], one of the founders of the science of [[ecology]], stated: \"Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the \"community\") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Odum |first=E. P. |year=1971 |title=Fundamentals of Ecology |url=https://archive.org/details/fundamentalsofec0000odum |url-access=registration |edition=Third |publisher=Saunders |location=New York |isbn=0-7216-6941-7 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Creek and old-growth forest-Larch Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|[[Old-growth forest]] and a [[creek (tidal)|creek]] on [[Larch Mountain (Multnomah County, Oregon)|Larch Mountain]], in the U.S. state of [[Oregon]]]]\n\nThe human ecosystem concept is then grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature [[dichotomy]], and the emergent premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their [[biotope]].\n\nA greater number or variety of species or [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] of an ecosystem may contribute to greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus \"absorb\" or reduce its effects. This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.\n\nThe term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [[human ecosystem]]s and human-influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [[wilderness]] areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.\n{{br}}\n\n==Biomes==\n[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|right|Map of terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation]]\n{{Main|Biome}}\n\n[[Biomes]] are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are [[Climate|climatically]] and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the Earth, such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, animals, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]], often referred to as ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities. Biomes are often identified with particular patterns of [[ecological succession]] and [[climax vegetation]].\n\n==Biogeochemical cycles==\n[[File:Plagiomnium affine laminazellen.jpeg|thumb|[[Chloroplast]]s conduct [[photosynthesis]] and are found in [[plant cell]]s and other [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms.

(2000). ''Cycles of Life''. New York: Scientific American Library. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-5079-6}}.</ref>\n* The [[nitrogen cycle]] is the transformation of nitrogen and nitrogen-containing compounds in nature. It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.\n* The [[water cycle]], is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.\n* The [[carbon cycle]] is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.\n* The [[oxygen cycle]] is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.\n* The [[phosphorus cycle]] is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The atmosphere does not play a significant role in the movements of phosphorus, because phosphorus and phosphorus compounds are usually solids at the typical ranges of temperature and pressure found on Earth.\n\n==Wilderness==\n[[File:Swiss National Park 131.JPG|thumb|left|A [[Temperate coniferous forest|conifer forest]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] ([[Swiss National Park|National Park]])]]\n[[File:Togiak Wilderness.jpg|thumb|The [[Ahklun Mountains]] and the [[Togiak Wilderness]] within the [[Togiak National Wildlife Refuge]] in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]]]]\n{{Main|Wilderness}}\n\n[[Wilderness]] is generally defined as a natural environment on Earth that has not been significantly modified by [[human]] activity. The [[WILD Foundation]] goes into more detail, defining wilderness as: \"The most intact, undisturbed wild natural areas left on our planet - those last truly wild places that humans do not control and have not developed with roads, pipelines or other industrial infrastructure.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |title=The WILD Foundation |publisher=Wild.org |accessdate=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121204162126/http://www.wild.org/main/about/what-is-a-wilderness-area/ |archivedate=2012-12-04 }}</ref> Wilderness areas and protected [[parks]] are considered important for the survival of certain [[species]], ecological studies, [[Habitat conservation|conservation]], solitude, and [[recreation]]. Wilderness is deeply valued for cultural, spiritual, [[moral]], and [[aesthetic]] reasons. Some nature writers believe wilderness areas are vital for the human spirit and creativity.<ref>No Man's Garden by Daniel B. Botkin p155-157</ref>\n\nThe word, \"wilderness\", derives from the notion of [[wildness]]; in other words that which is not controllable by humans. The word's [[etymology]] is from the [[Old English]] ''wildeornes'', which in turn derives from ''wildeor'' meaning ''wild beast'' (wild + deor = beast, deer).<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wilderness wilderness]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved November 29, 2012.</ref> From this point of view, it is the wildness of a place that makes it a wilderness. The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being \"wilderness.\" Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered \"wild.\" This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.\n\n[[Wildlife]] includes all non-[[domesticated]] plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas\u2014including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites\u2014all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.\n\n[[File:Ahja j\u00f5e \u00fcrgorg.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.1|<center>A view of [[wilderness]] in Estonia</center>]]\n\n==Challenges==\n<!-- Images -->\n[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\n[[File:Amazon Rainforest-bird site.jpg|thumb|[[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Brazil]].

The study of streams and waterways in general is known as ''surface [[hydrology]].''<ref>http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ [https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/hydrology.html/ |date=June 20, 2019]</ref> \n{{Further|Stream}}\n\n=== Lakes ===\n[[File:LAGO LACAR.JPG|thumb|right|[[L\u00e1car Lake]], of [[glacier|glacial]] origin, in the {{province|Neuqu\u00e9n|Argentina}}]]\n\n{{Main|Lake}}\n\nA lake (from Latin ''lacus'') is a [[terrain feature]], a body of water that is localized to the bottom of [[Depression (geology)|basin]]. A body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, is not part of an [[ocean]], and is larger and deeper than a [[pond]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/328083/lake\n|author=Britannica Online\n|accessdate=2008-06-25\n|title=Lake (physical feature)\n|quote=[a Lake is] any relatively large body of slowly moving or standing water that occupies an inland basin of appreciable size. Definitions that precisely distinguish lakes, ponds, swamps, and even rivers and other bodies of nonoceanic water are not established. It may be said, however, that rivers and streams are relatively fast moving; marshes and swamps contain relatively large quantities of grasses, trees, or shrubs; and ponds are relatively small in comparison to lakes. Geologically defined, lakes are temporary bodies of water.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Dictionary.com definition\n|accessdate=2008-06-25\n|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lake\n|quote=a body of fresh or salt water of considerable size, surrounded by land.}}</ref>\n[[File:Everglades Park swamp.JPG|thumb|left|A [[swamp]] area in [[Everglades National Park]], [[Florida]], [[US]].]]\n\nNatural lakes on Earth are generally found in [[mountain]]ous areas, [[rift zone]]s, and areas with ongoing or recent [[glacier|glaciation]]. Other lakes are found in [[endorheic basin]]s or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last [[Ice Age]]. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Ponds ====\n{{Main|Pond}}\nA pond is a [[body of water|body]] of [[Water stagnation|standing water]], either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a [[lake]]. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including [[water garden]]s designed for aesthetic ornamentation, [[fish pond]]s designed for commercial fish breeding, and [[solar pond]]s designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams by their [[Flow velocity|current speed]]. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as [[stream pool]]s and [[tide pool]]s.\n\n=== Human impact on water ===\nHumans impact the water in different ways such as modifying rivers (through [[dam]]s and [[Channelization (rivers)|stream channelization]]), [[urbanization]], and [[deforestation]]. These impact lake levels, groundwater conditions, water pollution, thermal pollution, and marine pollution. Humans modify rivers by using direct channel manipulation.<ref name=Goudie>{{Cite book|title=The Human Impact on the Natural Environment|last=Goudie|first=Andrew|publisher=This MIT Press|year=2000|isbn=0-262-57138-2|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=[https://archive.org/details/humanimpactonn00goud/page/203 203\u2013239]|url=https://archive.org/details/humanimpactonn00goud/page/203}}</ref> We are building dams and reservoirs and manipulating the direction of the rivers and water path. Dams are good for us, some communities need the reservoirs to survive. However, reservoirs and dams may negatively impact the environment and wildlife. Dams stops fish migration and the moving of organisms down stream. Urbanization effects the environment because of deforestation and changing lake levels, groundwater conditions, etc. Deforestation and urbanization go hand in hand. Deforestation may cause flooding, declining stream flow, and changes in riverside vegetation. The changing vegetation occurs because when trees cannot get adequate water they start to deteriorate, leading to a decreased food supply for the wildlife in an area.<ref name=Goudie/>\n\n== Atmosphere, climate and weather ==\n[[File:Top of Atmosphere.jpg|thumb|right|Atmospheric gases [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter blue light more than other wavelengths]], creating a blue [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] when seen from space.]]\n[[File:Troposphere CIMG1853.JPG|thumb|right|A view of Earth's [[troposphere]] from an [[airplane]]]]\n[[File:Lightnings sequence 2 animation-wcag.gif|thumb|[[Lightning]] is an [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] discharge of [[electricity]] accompanied by [[thunder]], which occurs during [[thunderstorm]]s and certain other natural conditions.<ref name=\"noaa1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/seg/hazard/stratoguide/galunfeat.html|title=Volcanic Lightning|accessdate=September 21, 2007|publisher=National Geophysical Data Center - NOAA|author=NGDC - NOAA}}</ref>]]\n\nThe atmosphere of the Earth serves as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem. The thin layer of [[gas]]es that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry [[air]] consists of 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], 1% [[argon]] and other [[inert gases]], such as [[carbon dioxide]]. The remaining gases are often referred to as trace gases,<ref>{{cite web |author=Joe Buchdahl |url=http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/Atmosphere/Older/Trace_Gases.html |title=Atmosphere, Climate & Environment Information Programme |publisher=Ace.mmu.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009044345/http://www.ace.mmu.ac.uk/eae/atmosphere/older/Trace_Gases.html |archivedate=2010-10-09 }}</ref> among which are the [[greenhouse gas]]es such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Filtered air includes trace amounts of many other [[chemical compound]]s. Air also contains a variable amount of [[water vapor]] and [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of water droplets and [[ice]] crystals seen as [[cloud]]s. Many natural substances may be present in tiny amounts in an unfiltered air sample, including [[dust]], [[pollen]] and [[spores]], [[sea spray]], [[volcanic ash]], and [[meteoroid]]s. Various industrial [[pollutant]]s also may be present, such as [[chlorine]] (elementary or in compounds), [[fluorine]] compounds, elemental [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[sulphur]] compounds such as [[sulphur dioxide]] [SO<sub>2</sub>].\n\nThe [[ozone layer]] of the Earth's atmosphere plays an important role in depleting the amount of [[ultraviolet]] (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As [[DNA]] is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.\n\n===Layers of the atmosphere===\n{{Main|Earth's atmosphere}}\n\n====Principal layers====\nEarth's atmosphere can be divided into five main layers. These layers are mainly determined by whether temperature increases or decreases with altitude. From highest to lowest, these layers are:\n* [[Exosphere]]: The outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere extends from the exobase upward, mainly composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].\n* [[Thermosphere]]: The top of the thermosphere is the bottom of the exosphere, called the [[exobase]]. Its height varies with solar activity and ranges from about {{convert|350|-|800|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[International Space Station]] orbits in this layer, between {{convert|320|and|380|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* [[Mesosphere]]: The mesosphere extends from the stratopause to {{convert|80|-|85|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. It is the layer where most [[meteor]]s burn up upon entering the atmosphere.\n* [[Stratosphere]]: The stratosphere extends from the tropopause to about {{convert|51|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}. The [[stratopause]], which is the boundary between the stratosphere and mesosphere, typically is at {{convert|50|to|55|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}.\n* [[Troposphere]]: The troposphere begins at the surface and extends to between {{convert|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the poles and {{convert|17|km|ft|abbr=on}} at the equator, with some variation due to weather. The troposphere is mostly heated by transfer of energy from the surface, so on average the lowest part of the troposphere is warmest and temperature decreases with altitude. The [[tropopause]] is the boundary between the troposphere and stratosphere.\n\n; Other layers\nWithin the five principal layers determined by temperature there are several layers determined by other properties.\n* The [[ozone layer]] is contained within the stratosphere. It is mainly located in the lower portion of the stratosphere from about {{convert|15|-|35|km|mi ft|abbr=on}}, though the thickness varies seasonally and geographically. About 90% of the ozone in our atmosphere is contained in the stratosphere.\n* The [[ionosphere]], the part of the atmosphere that is ionized by solar radiation, stretches from {{convert|50|to|1000|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} and typically overlaps both the exosphere and the thermosphere. It forms the inner edge of the magnetosphere.\n* The [[homosphere]] and [[heterosphere]]: The homosphere includes the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere. The upper part of the heterosphere is composed almost completely of hydrogen, the lightest element.\n* The [[planetary boundary layer]] is the part of the troposphere that is nearest the Earth's surface and is directly affected by it, mainly through [[turbulence|turbulent diffusion]].\n\n====Effects of global warming====\n[[File:Gletscherschmelze.jpg|thumb|left|The retreat of glaciers since 1850 of [[Aletsch Glacier]] in the [[Swiss Alps]] (situation in 1979, 1991 and 2002), due to [[global warming]]]]\n{{Main|Effects of global warming}}\n\nThe dangers of [[global warming]] are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isro.gov.in/update/03-jun-2016/world%E2%80%99s-space-agencies-unite-to-face-climate-challenge|title=World\u2019s Space Agencies Unite To Face The Climate Challenge - ISRO|website=www.isro.gov.in|access-date=2019-12-10}}</ref> These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how [[climate change]] and global warming caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]], or human-made releases of [[greenhouse gas]]es, most notably [[carbon dioxide]], can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the [[greenhouse effect]], which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/climate-change-75518/home|title=Climate Change|website=sites.google.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-08}}</ref> This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.<ref>{{cite web|last=Forthofer|first=Ron|title=It's Time To Act On Global Warming|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|publisher=Boulder Daily Camera|accessdate=2013-10-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616203811/http://www.commondreams.org/views01/0218-08.htm|archivedate=2013-06-16}}</ref>\nEfforts have been increasingly focused on the [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]] of greenhouse gases that are causing climatic changes, on [[Adaptation to global warming|developing adaptative strategies]] to global warming, to assist humans, other animal, and plant species, ecosystems, regions and [[nation]]s in adjusting to the [[effects of global warming]].

These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the [[jet stream]]. Weather systems in the [[mid-latitudes]], such as [[extratropical cyclone]]s, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. Because the Earth's [[Earth's rotation|axis]] is tilted relative to its orbital plane, [[sunlight]] is incident at different angles at different times of the year. On the Earth's surface, temperatures usually range \u00b140&nbsp;\u00b0C (100&nbsp;\u00b0F to \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F) annually. Over thousands of years, changes in the Earth's orbit have affected the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate\n\nSurface [[temperature]] differences in turn cause pressure differences. Higher altitudes are cooler than lower altitudes due to differences in compressional heating. Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] for a future time and a given location. The [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is a [[chaos theory|chaotic system]], and small changes to one part of the system can grow to have large effects on the system as a whole. Human attempts to [[weather control|control the weather]] have occurred throughout human history, and there is evidence that civilized human activity such as [[agriculture]] and [[industry]] has inadvertently modified weather patterns.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Diversity of plants image version 5.png|thumb|left|<center>There are many [[plant species]] on the planet.</center>]]\n[[File:Animal diversity.png|thumb|right|<center>An example of the many [[animal species]] on the Earth</center>]]\n{{Main|Life|Biology|Biosphere}}\n\nEvidence suggests that [[life|life on Earth]] has existed for about 3.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years.<ref>\"[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/historyoflife.php History of life through time]\".

[[Eugene Odum]], one of the founders of the science of [[ecology]], stated: \"Any unit that includes all of the organisms (i.e.: the \"community\") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Odum |first=E.

This reduces the effect before the ecosystem's structure is fundamentally changed to a different state. This is not universally the case and there is no proven relationship between the species diversity of an ecosystem and its ability to provide goods and services on a sustainable level.\n\nThe term ecosystem can also pertain to human-made environments, such as [[human ecosystem]]s and human-influenced ecosystems, and can describe any situation where there is relationship between living organisms and their environment. Fewer areas on the surface of the earth today exist free from human contact, although some genuine [[wilderness]] areas continue to exist without any forms of human intervention.\n{{br}}\n\n==Biomes==\n[[File:Vegetation-no-legend.PNG|thumb|right|Map of terrestrial [[biomes]] classified by vegetation]]\n{{Main|Biome}}\n\n[[Biomes]] are terminologically similar to the concept of ecosystems, and are [[Climate|climatically]] and geographically defined areas of ecologically similar climatic conditions on the Earth, such as [[Community (ecology)|communities]] of [[plant]]s, animals, and [[Soil biology|soil organisms]], often referred to as ecosystems. Biomes are defined on the basis of factors such as plant structures (such as trees, shrubs, and grasses), leaf types (such as broadleaf and needleleaf), plant spacing (forest, woodland, savanna), and climate. Unlike [[ecozone]]s, biomes are not defined by genetic, taxonomic, or historical similarities.

It is a cycle which includes gaseous components.\n* The [[water cycle]], is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water can change states among liquid, vapour, and ice at various places in the water cycle. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go.\n* The [[carbon cycle]] is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth.\n* The [[oxygen cycle]] is the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the [[lithosphere]]. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is [[photosynthesis]], which is responsible for the modern Earth's atmospheric composition and life.\n* The [[phosphorus cycle]] is the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.

The mere presence or activity of people does not disqualify an area from being \"wilderness.\" Many ecosystems that are, or have been, inhabited or influenced by activities of people may still be considered \"wild.\" This way of looking at wilderness includes areas within which natural processes operate without very noticeable human interference.\n\n[[Wildlife]] includes all non-[[domesticated]] plants, animals and other organisms. Domesticating wild plant and animal species for human benefit has occurred many times all over the planet, and has a major impact on the environment, both positive and negative. Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, rain forests, plains, and other areas\u2014including the most developed [[Urban area|urban]] sites\u2014all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by civilized human factors, most scientists agree that wildlife around the world is (now) impacted by human activities.\n\n[[File:Ahja j\u00f5e \u00fcrgorg.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.1|<center>A view of [[wilderness]] in Estonia</center>]]\n\n==Challenges==\n<!-- Images -->\n[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]\n[[File:Amazon Rainforest-bird site.jpg|thumb|[[Amazon rainforest]] in [[Brazil]].
