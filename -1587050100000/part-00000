She became empress upon Justinian's accession in 527 and was one of his chief advisers. Along with her spouse, Theodora is a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], commemorated on 14 November.\n\n==Historiography==\nThe main historical sources for her life are the works of her contemporary [[Procopius]]. The historian offered three contradictory portrayals of the Empress. ''[[History of the Wars|The Wars of Justinian]]'', largely completed in 545, paints a picture of a courageous and influential empress who saved the throne for Justinian.\n\nLater, he wrote the ''[[Historia Arcana|Secret History]]'', which survives in only one manuscript suggesting it was not widely read during the Byzantine era. The work has sometimes been interpreted as representing a deep disillusionment with the emperor Justinian, the empress, and even his patron Belisarius. Justinian is depicted as cruel, venal, prodigal and incompetent; as for Theodora, the reader is treated to a detailed and titillating portrayal of vulgarity and insatiable lust, combined with shrewish and calculating mean-spiritedness; Procopius even claims both are demons whose heads were seen to leave their bodies and roam the palace at night.  Alternatively, scholars versed in political rhetoric of the era have viewed these statements from the Secret History as formulaic expressions within the tradition of invective.\n\nProcopius' ''[[Peri Ktismaton|Buildings of Justinian]]'', written about the same time as the ''Secret History'', is a [[panegyric]] which paints Justinian and Theodora as a pious couple and presents particularly flattering portrayals of them. Besides her piety, her beauty is praised within the conventional language of the text's rhetorical form. Although Theodora was dead when this work was published, Justinian was alive, and perhaps commissioned the work.<ref name=\"roman-emperors.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/dora.htm|title=Roman Emperors \u2013 DIR Theodora|work=roman-emperors.org}}</ref>\n\nHer contemporary [[John of Ephesus]] writes about Theodora in his ''Lives of the Eastern Saints'' and mentions an illegitimate daughter.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]], vol. 3, ed. J. Martindale. 1992.</ref>\n\nVarious other historians presented additional information on her life. [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions some familial relations of Theodora to figures not mentioned by Procopius. [[Victor Tonnennensis]] notes her familial relation to the next empress, [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]].\n\n[[Michael the Syrian]], the ''[[Chronicle of 1234]]'' and [[Bar-Hebraeus]] place her origin in the city of Daman, near [[Raqqa|Kallinikos]], [[Syria]]. They contradict Procopius by making Theodora the daughter of a priest, trained in the pious practices of [[Miaphysitism]] since birth. These are late Miaphysite sources and record her depiction among members of their creed. The Miaphysites have tended to regard Theodora as one of their own and the tradition may have been invented as a way to improve her reputation and is also in conflict with what is told by the contemporary Miaphysite historian John of Ephesus.<ref name=\"Garland.

From then on, Theodora would be their supporter.\n\nAccording to Procopius, (in his ''Secret History'') Theodora followed her sister Komito's example from an early age and worked in a Constantinople [[brothel]] serving low-status customers; later, she performed on stage.<ref name=dauphin>{{cite journal|title=Brothels, Baths and Babes: Prostitution in the Byzantine Holy Land|author=Claudine M.

During this time, she met the future wife of [[Belisarius]], [[Antonina (wife of Belisarius)|Antonina]], who would become a part of the women's court led by Theodora.\n\nAt the age of 16, Theodora traveled to [[North Africa]] as the companion of a Syrian official named Hecebolus when he went to the [[Cyrenaica|Libyan Pentapolis]] as governor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nShe stayed with him for almost four years before returning to Constantinople. Abandoned and maltreated by Hecebolus, on her way back to the [[Constantinople|capital of the Byzantine Empire]], she settled for a while in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].\nShe is said to have met [[Pope Timothy III (IV) of Alexandria|Patriarch Timothy III]] in Alexandria, who was [[Miaphysite]], and it was at that time that she converted to Miaphysite Christianity. From Alexandria, she went to [[Antioch]], where she met a Blue faction's dancer, Macedonia, who was perhaps an informer of [[Justinian I|Justinian]].\n\nWhen Justinian sought to marry Theodora, he could not: he was the designated heir of his uncle, [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Justin I]], and a [[Roman law]] from [[Constantine I|Constantine's]] time prevented anyone of senatorial rank from marrying actresses. In 525, Justin repealed the law, and Justinian married Theodora.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} By this point, she already had a daughter (whose name has been lost). Justinian apparently treated the daughter and the daughter's son Athanasius as fully legitimate,<ref>Diehl, Charles.

Rosenbaum from the original French ''Theodora, Imperatrice de Byzance''), 69\u201370.</ref> although sources disagree whether Justinian was the girl's father.\n\n==Empress==\n[[File:Meister_von_San_Vitale_in_Ravenna.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Justinian from a contemporary portrait mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]]]]\nWhen Justinian succeeded to the throne in 527, two years after the marriage, Theodora became empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. She shared in his plans and political strategies, participated in state councils, and Justinian called her his \"partner in my deliberations.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantine Empresses|last=Diehl|first=Charles|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>  She had her own court, her own official entourage, and her own imperial seal.\n\nShe was the first Eastern Roman empress consort to have coinage struck in her name.\u00a0She was often present when the Emperor held court, and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell. She was given charge of his imperial seal, implying that her perusal and consent were necessary before any document or order received legal validity. The Emperor sought her views on most matters before issuing orders. The only other Eastern Roman empress to command such devotion from her husband was Theodore's niece\u00a0Sophia. However, Sophia In contrast his Theodora had little power and influence and Theodora is therefore unique in the annals of the Eastern Roman  Empire for the political influence she wielded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Their Own: Women in Europe, Vol 1|last=Anderson & Zinsser|first=Bonnie & Judith|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|page=47|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===The Nika riots===\nTheodora proved herself a worthy and able leader during the [[Nika riots]]. There were two rival [[political faction]]s in the Empire, the Blues and the Greens, who started a riot in January 532 during a chariot race in the hippodrome. The riots stemmed from many grievances, some of which had resulted from Justinian's and Theodora's own actions.<ref>Dielh, ''ibid.''</ref>\n\nThe rioters set many public buildings on fire, and proclaimed a new emperor, [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]], the nephew of former emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]]. Unable to control the mob, Justinian and his officials prepared to flee.\nAt a meeting of the government council, Theodora spoke out against leaving the palace and underlined the significance of someone who died as a ruler instead of living as an exile or in hiding, reportedly saying, \"royal purple is the noblest shroud\".<ref>Safire, William, ed, ''Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History'', W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 1992, p. 37</ref>\n\nAs the emperor and his counsellors were still preparing their project, Theodora interrupted them and claimed :<blockquote>\"My lords, the present occasion is too serious to allow me to follow the convention that a woman should not speak in a man\u2019s council.  Those whose interests are threatened by extreme danger should think only of the wisest course of action, not of conventions.  In my opinion, flight is not the right course, even if it should bring us to safety.  It is impossible for a person, having been born into this world, not to die; but for one who has reigned it is intolerable to be a fugitive.  May I never be deprived of this purple robe, and may I never see the day when those who meet me do not call me empress. If you wish to save yourself, my lord, there is no difficulty.  We are rich; over there is the sea, and yonder are the ships.  Yet reflect for a moment whether, when you have once escaped to a place of security, you would not gladly exchange such safety for death.  As for me, I agree with the adage that the royal purple is the noblest shroud.\"<ref>William Safire, ''Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History'', Rosetta Books</ref></blockquote>Her determined speech convinced them all, including Justinian himself, who had been preparing to run. As a result, Justinian ordered his loyal troops, led by the officers, [[Belisarius]] and [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]], to attack the demonstrators in the hippodrome, killing (according to Procopius) over 30,000 rebels. Despite his claims that he was unwillingly named emperor by the mob, Hypatius was also put to death, apparently at Theodora's insistence.<ref>Diehl, ''ibid.''</ref> Interpretations that Justinian never forgot that it was Theodora who had saved his throne depend on seeing Procopius' account as a straightforward report, and not framed to impugn Justinian with the implication that he was more cowardly than his wife.\n\n===Later life===\n\nFollowing the Nika revolt, Justinian and Theodora rebuilt and reformed Constantinople and made it the most splendid city the world had seen for centuries, building or rebuilding aqueducts, bridges and more than twenty five churches. The greatest of these is [[Hagia Sophia]], considered the epitome of [[Byzantine architecture]] and one of the architectural wonders of the world.\n\nTheodora was punctilious about court ceremony. According to [[Procopius]], the Imperial couple made all senators, including patricians, prostrate themselves before them whenever they entered their presence, and made it clear that their relations with the civil militia were those of masters and slaves.\n{{Quote|Not even the government officials could approach the Empress without expending much time and effort. They were treated like servants and kept waiting in a small, stuffy room for an endless time. After many days, some of them might at last be summoned, but going into her presence in great fear, they very quickly departed. They simply showed their respect by lying face down and touching the instep of each of her feet with their lips; there was no opportunity to speak or to make any request unless she told them to do so. The government officials had sunk into a slavish condition, and she was their slave-instructor.}}\nThey also carefully supervised the magistrates, much more so than previous emperors, possibly to reduce bureaucratic corruption.\n\nTheodora also created her own centers of power. The eunuch [[Narses]], who in old age developed into a brilliant general, was her protege, as was the praetorian prefect [[Peter Barsymes]]. [[John the Cappadocian]], Justinian's chief tax collector, was identified as her enemy, because of his independent and great influence, and was brought down by a plot devised by Theodora and Antonina. She engaged in matchmaking, forming a network of alliances between the old powers, represented by [[Emperor Anastasius]]' family and the pre-existing nobility, and the new, who were Justinian's and her relatives. According to ''Secret History'', she attempted marry her grandson Anastasius to Joannina, Belisarius' and Antonina's daughter and heiress, against her parents' will, although the couple would eventually fall in love with each other. The marriage of her niece [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]] to Justinian's nephew [[Justin II|Justin II]], who would succeed to the throne, is suspected to have been instigated by Theodora.\n\nTheodora participated in Justinian's legal and spiritual reforms. In ''Novel 8.1'' (AD 535), she is publicly acknowledged as shaping an anti-corruption legislation, and provincial officials had to take an oath to her as well as the emperor.\n\nHer involvement in helping underprivileged women was substantial, being \"known for buying girls who had been sold into prostitution, freeing them, and providing for their future.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Their Own: Women in Europe Vol 1|last=Anderson & Zinsser|first=Bonnie & Judith|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|page=48|quote=|via=}}</ref> She closed brothels and made pimping a criminal offense. She created a convent on the [[Asia]]n side of the [[Dardanelles]] called the ''Metanoia'' (Repentance), where the ex-prostitutes could support themselves.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Procopius|Procopius']] ''Secret History'' maintained that instead of preventing forced prostitution (as in ''Buildings'' 1.9.3ff), Theodora is said to have 'rounded up' 500 prostitutes, confining them to a convent. They sought to escape 'the unwelcome transformation' by leaping over the walls (''SH'' 17). On the other hand, [[John Malalas]], his fellow contemporary chronicler, wrote she \"freed the girls from the yoke of their wretched slavery.\" <ref> John Malalas, ''The Chronicle of John Malalas'', 18.440.14-441.7</ref> A century later, John of Nikiu observed its positive impact, noting that Theodora \"put an end to the prostitution of women, and gave orders for their expulsion from every place.\"\n\nJustinian's legislations also expanded the rights of women in divorce and property ownership, instituted the death penalty for rape, forbade exposure of unwanted infants, gave mothers some guardianship rights over their children, and forbade the killing of a wife who committed adultery. Though her specific involvement in these legal reforms is not recorded, <ref>Garland. Page 18.</ref> Procopius, in ''Wars'', mentioned that she was naturally inclined to assist women in misfortune, and according ''Secret History'', she championed the wives' causes when their husbands charged them with adultery (''SH'' 17).\n\n==Religious policy==\n{{Infobox saint\n|name          = Saint Theodora\n|birth_date    =\n|death_date    =\n|feast_day     = 14 November\n|venerated_in  = [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]<br>[[Eastern Catholicism]]<br> [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]\n|image         = File:Mosaic of Theodora - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna, Italy).jpg\n|imagesize     = 300px\n|caption       = Empress Theodora and attendants (mosaic from [[Basilica of San Vitale]], 6th century)\n|birth_place   =\n|death_place   =\n|titles        = Empress\n|beatified_date=\n|beatified_place=\n|beatified_by=\n|canonized_date=\n|canonized_place=\n|canonized_by=\n|attributes    = Imperial Vestment\n|patronage     =\n|major_shrine  = [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], [[Constantinople]] modern day [[Istanbul, Turkey]]\n|issues=\n}}\nTheodora worked against her husband's support of [[Chalcedonian]] Christianity in the ongoing struggle for the predominance of each faction.<ref name=about>{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/library/bio/blbio_theodora.htm |title=Theodora \u2013 Byzantine Empress |publisher=[[About.com]] |date= |accessdate=11 April 2008}}</ref> As a result, she was accused of fostering [[heresy]] and thus undermined the unity of [[Christendom]].\n\nIn spite of Justinian being [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]], Theodora founded a [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] monastery in [[Galata|Sykae]] and provided shelter in the palace for Miaphysite leaders who faced opposition from the majority of Chalcedonian Christians, like [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]] and [[Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople|Anthimus]]. Anthimus had been appointed [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] under her influence, and after the excommunication order he was hidden in Theodora's quarters for twelve years, until her death. When the [[Chalcedonian]] Patriarch [[Ephraim of Antioch|Ephraim]] provoked a violent revolt in Antioch, eight Miaphysite bishops were invited to Constantinople and Theodora welcomed them and housed them in the [[Hormisdas Palace]] adjoining the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]], which had been Justinian and Theodora's own dwelling before they became emperor and empress.\n\nIn Egypt, when [[Pope Timothy III (IV) of Alexandria|Timothy III]] died, Theodora enlisted the help of Dioscoros, the Augustal Prefect, and Aristomachos the duke of Egypt, to facilitate the enthronement of a disciple of Severus, [[Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria|Theodosius]], thereby outmaneuvering her husband, who had intended a Chalcedonian successor as patriarch. But [[Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria]], even with the help of imperial troops, could not hold his ground in Alexandria against Justinian's Chalcedonian followers. When he was exiled by Justinian along with 300 Miaphysites to the fortress of [[Delcus]] in [[Thrace]], Theodora rescued him and brought him to the Hormisdas Palace. He lived under her protection and, after her death in 548, under Justinian's.\n\nWhen [[Pope Silverius]] refused Theodora's demand that he remove the [[anathema]] of [[Pope Agapetus I]] from [[Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople|Patriarch Anthimus]], she sent [[Belisarius]] instructions to find a pretext to remove Silverius. When this was accomplished, [[Pope Vigilius]] was appointed in his stead.\n\nIn [[Nobatia|Nobatae]], south of Egypt, the inhabitants were converted to Miaphysite Christianity about 540. Justinian had been determined that they be converted to the Chalcedonian faith and Theodora equally determined that they should be Miaphysites. Justinian made arrangements for Chalcedonian missionaries from [[Thebaid]] to go with presents to Silko, the king of the Nobatae. But on hearing this, Theodora prepared her own missionaries and wrote to the duke of Thebaid that he should delay her husband's embassy, so that the Miaphysite missionaries should arrive first. The duke was canny enough to thwart the easygoing Justinian instead of the unforgiving Theodora. He saw to it that the Chalcedonian missionaries were delayed. When they eventually reached Silko, they were sent away, for the Nobatae had already adopted the Miaphysite creed of Theodosius.\n\n==Death==\nTheodora's death is recorded by [[Victor of Tonnena]], with the cause uncertain but the Greek terms used are often translated as \"cancer.\" The date was 28 June 548 at the age of 48.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0h2gDLv3MOEC&pg=PA75 |title=Breast Cancer|isbn=978-0955422102|last1=Harding|first1=Fred|year= 2007}}</ref> Later accounts frequently attribute the death to [[breast cancer]], although it was not identified as such in the original report where the use of the term \"cancer\" probably referred to \"a suppurating ulcer or malignant tumor\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Other sources report that she died at 51.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Their Own: Women in Europe, Vol 1|last=Anderson & Zinsser|first=Bonnie & Judith|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|page=48|quote=|via=}}</ref> Justinian wept bitterly at her funeral.<ref>Diehl, ''ibid.'', p. 197.</ref> Her body was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople.\n\nBoth Theodora and Justinian are represented in mosaics that exist to this day in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]], which was completed a year before her death.\n\n==Lasting influence==\nHer influence on Justinian was so strong that after her death he worked to bring harmony between the Monophysites and the Chalcedonian Christians in the Empire, and he kept his promise to protect her little community of Monophysite refugees in the Hormisdas Palace.\nTheodora provided much political support for the ministry of [[Jacob Baradaeus]], and apparently personal friendship as well.

She became empress upon Justinian's accession in 527 and was one of his chief advisers. Along with her spouse, Theodora is a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], commemorated on November 14.\n\n==Historiography==\nThe main historical sources for her life are the works of her contemporary [[Procopius]]. The historian offered three contradictory portrayals of the Empress. ''[[History of the Wars|The Wars of Justinian]]'', largely completed in 545, paints a picture of a courageous and influential empress who saved the throne for Justinian.\n\nLater he wrote the ''[[Historia Arcana|Secret History]]'', which survives in only one manuscript suggesting it was not widely read during the Byzantine era. The work has sometimes been interpreted as representing a deep disillusionment with the emperor Justinian, the empress, and even his patron Belisarius. Justinian is depicted as cruel, venal, prodigal and incompetent; as for Theodora, the reader is treated to a detailed and titillating portrayal of vulgarity and insatiable lust, combined with shrewish and calculating mean-spiritedness; Procopius even claims both are demons whose heads were seen to leave their bodies and roam the palace at night.  Alternatively, scholars versed in political rhetoric of the era have viewed these statements from the Secret History as formulaic expressions within the tradition of invective.\n\nProcopius' ''[[Peri Ktismaton|Buildings of Justinian]]'', written about the same time as the ''Secret History'', is a [[panegyric]] which paints Justinian and Theodora as a pious couple and presents particularly flattering portrayals of them. Besides her piety, her beauty is praised within the conventional language of the text's rhetorical form. Although Theodora was dead when this work was published, Justinian was alive, and perhaps commissioned the work.<ref name=\"roman-emperors.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.roman-emperors.org/dora.htm|title=Roman Emperors \u2013 DIR Theodora|work=roman-emperors.org}}</ref>\n\nHer contemporary [[John of Ephesus]] writes about Theodora in his ''Lives of the Eastern Saints'' and mentions an illegitimate daughter.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]], vol. 3, ed. J. Martindale. 1992.</ref>\n\nVarious other historians presented additional information on her life. [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions some familial relations of Theodora to figures not mentioned by Procopius. [[Victor Tonnennensis]] notes her familial relation to the next empress, [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]].\n\n[[Michael the Syrian]], the ''[[Chronicle of 1234]]'' and [[Bar-Hebraeus]] place her origin in the city of Daman, near [[Raqqa|Kallinikos]], [[Syria]]. They contradict Procopius by making Theodora the daughter of a priest, trained in the pious practices of [[Miaphysitism]] since birth. These are late Miaphysite sources and record her depiction among members of their creed. The Miaphysites have tended to regard Theodora as one of their own and the tradition may have been invented as a way to improve her reputation and is also in conflict with what is told by the contemporary Miaphysite historian John of Ephesus.<ref name=\"Garland. Page 13\">Garland, p. 13.</ref> These accounts are thus usually ignored in favor of Procopius.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Early years==\nTheodora, according to Michael Grant, was of [[Greek Cypriot]] descent.<ref>Michael Grant.

From then on Theodora would be their supporter.\n\nAccording to Procopius, (in his ''Secret History'') Theodora followed her sister Komito's example from an early age and worked in a Constantinople [[brothel]] serving low-status customers; later she performed on stage.<ref name=dauphin>{{cite journal|title=Brothels, Baths and Babes: Prostitution in the Byzantine Holy Land|author=Claudine M.

During this time she met the future wife of [[Belisarius]], [[Antonina (wife of Belisarius)|Antonina]], who would become a part of the women's court led by Theodora.\n\nAt the age of 16, Theodora traveled to [[North Africa]] as the companion of a Syrian official named Hecebolus when he went to the [[Cyrenaica|Libyan Pentapolis]] as governor.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nShe stayed with him for almost four years before returning to Constantinople. Abandoned and maltreated by Hecebolus, on her way back to the [[Constantinople|capital of the Byzantine Empire]], she settled for a while in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]].\nShe is said to have met [[Pope Timothy III (IV) of Alexandria|Patriarch Timothy III]] in Alexandria, who was [[Miaphysite]], and it was at that time that she converted to Miaphysite Christianity. From Alexandria she went to [[Antioch]], where she met a Blue faction's dancer, Macedonia, who was perhaps an informer of [[Justinian I|Justinian]].\n\nWhen Justinian sought to marry Theodora, he could not: he was the designated heir of his uncle, [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Justin I]], and a [[Roman law]] from [[Constantine I|Constantine's]] time prevented anyone of senatorial rank from marrying actresses. In 525, Justin repealed the law, and Justinian married Theodora.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} By this point, she already had a daughter (whose name has been lost). Justinian apparently treated the daughter and the daughter's son Athanasius as fully legitimate,<ref>Diehl, Charles.

Rosenbaum from the original French ''Theodora, Imperatrice de Byzance''), 69\u201370.</ref> although sources disagree whether Justinian was the girl's father.\n\n==Empress==\n[[File:Meister_von_San_Vitale_in_Ravenna.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Justinian from a contemporary portrait mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]]]]\nWhen Justinian succeeded to the throne in 527, two years after the marriage, Theodora became empress of the Eastern Roman Empire. She shared in his plans and political strategies, participated in state councils, and Justinian called her his \"partner in my deliberations.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Byzantine Empresses|last=Diehl|first=Charles|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>  She had her own court, her own official entourage, and her own imperial seal.\n\nShe was the first Eastern Roman empress consort to have coinage struck in her name.\u00a0She was often present when the Emperor held court, and even held court independently when the Emperor was unwell. She was given charge of his imperial seal, implying that her perusal and consent were necessary before any document or order received legal validity. The Emperor sought her views on most matters before issuing orders. The only other Eastern Roman empress to command such devotion from her husband was Theodore's niece\u00a0Sophia. However, Sophia In contrast his Theodora had little power and influence and Theodora is therefore unique in the annals of the Eastern Roman  Empire for the political influence she wielded.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Their Own: Women in Europe, Vol 1|last=Anderson & Zinsser|first=Bonnie & Judith|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|page=47|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===The Nika riots===\nTheodora proved herself a worthy and able leader during the [[Nika riots]]. There were two rival [[political faction]]s in the Empire, the Blues and the Greens, who started a riot in January 532 during a chariot race in the hippodrome. The riots stemmed from many grievances, some of which had resulted from Justinian's and Theodora's own actions.<ref>Dielh, ''ibid.''</ref>\n\nThe rioters set many public buildings on fire, and proclaimed a new emperor, [[Hypatius (consul 500)|Hypatius]], the nephew of former emperor [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]]. Unable to control the mob, Justinian and his officials prepared to flee.\nAt a meeting of the government council, Theodora spoke out against leaving the palace and underlined the significance of someone who died as a ruler instead of living as an exile or in hiding, reportedly saying, \"royal purple is the noblest shroud\".<ref>Safire, William, ed, ''Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History'', W.W. Norton & Co., New York, 1992, p. 37</ref>\n\nAs the emperor and his counsellors were still preparing their project, Theodora interrupted them and claimed :<blockquote>\"My lords, the present occasion is too serious to allow me to follow the convention that a woman should not speak in a man\u2019s council.  Those whose interests are threatened by extreme danger should think only of the wisest course of action, not of conventions.  In my opinion, flight is not the right course, even if it should bring us to safety.  It is impossible for a person, having been born into this world, not to die; but for one who has reigned it is intolerable to be a fugitive.  May I never be deprived of this purple robe, and may I never see the day when those who meet me do not call me empress. If you wish to save yourself, my lord, there is no difficulty.  We are rich; over there is the sea, and yonder are the ships.  Yet reflect for a moment whether, when you have once escaped to a place of security, you would not gladly exchange such safety for death.  As for me, I agree with the adage that the royal purple is the noblest shroud.\"<ref>William Safire, ''Lend Me Your Ears: Great Speeches in History'', Rosetta Books</ref></blockquote>Her determined speech convinced them all, including Justinian himself, who had been preparing to run. As a result, Justinian ordered his loyal troops, led by the officers, [[Belisarius]] and [[Mundus (general)|Mundus]], to attack the demonstrators in the hippodrome, killing (according to Procopius) over 30,000 rebels. Despite his claims that he was unwillingly named emperor by the mob, Hypatius was also put to death, apparently at Theodora's insistence.<ref>Diehl, ''ibid.''</ref> Interpretations that Justinian never forgot that it was Theodora who had saved his throne depend on seeing Procopius' account as a straightforward report, and not framed to impugn Justinian with the implication that he was more cowardly than his wife.\n\n===Later life===\n\nFollowing the Nika revolt, Justinian and Theodora rebuilt and reformed Constantinople and made it the most splendid city the world had seen for centuries, building or rebuilding aqueducts, bridges and more than twenty five churches. The greatest of these is [[Hagia Sophia]], considered the epitome of [[Byzantine architecture]] and one of the architectural wonders of the world.\n\nTheodora was punctilious about court ceremony. According to [[Procopius]], the Imperial couple made all senators, including patricians, prostrate themselves before them whenever they entered their presence, and made it clear that their relations with the civil militia were those of masters and slaves.\n{{Quote|Not even the government officials could approach the Empress without expending much time and effort. They were treated like servants and kept waiting in a small, stuffy room for an endless time. After many days, some of them might at last be summoned, but going into her presence in great fear, they very quickly departed. They simply showed their respect by lying face down and touching the instep of each of her feet with their lips; there was no opportunity to speak or to make any request unless she told them to do so. The government officials had sunk into a slavish condition, and she was their slave-instructor.}}\nThey also carefully supervised the magistrates, much more so than previous emperors, possibly to reduce bureaucratic corruption.\n\nTheodora also created her own centers of power. The eunuch [[Narses]], who in old age developed into a brilliant general, was her protege, as was the praetorian prefect [[Peter Barsymes]]. [[John the Cappadocian]], Justinian's chief tax collector, was identified as her enemy, because of his independent and great influence, and was brought down by a plot devised by Theodora and Antonina. She engaged in matchmaking, forming a network of alliances between the old powers, represented by [[Emperor Anastasius]]' family and the pre-existing nobility, and the new, who were Justinian's and her relatives. According to ''Secret History'', she attempted marry her grandson Anastasius to Joannina, Belisarius' and Antonina's daughter and heiress, against her parents' will, although the couple would eventually fall in love with each other. The marriage of her niece [[Sophia (empress)|Sophia]] to Justinian's nephew [[Justin II|Justin II]], who would succeed to the throne, is suspected to have been instigated by Theodora.\n\nTheodora participated in Justinian's legal and spiritual reforms. In ''Novel 8.1'' (AD 535), she is publicly acknowledged as shaping an anti-corruption legislation, and provincial officials had to take an oath to her as well as the emperor.\n\nHer involvement in helping underprivileged women was substantial, being \"known for buying girls who had been sold into prostitution, freeing them, and providing for their future.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Their Own: Women in Europe Vol 1|last=Anderson & Zinsser|first=Bonnie & Judith|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|page=48|quote=|via=}}</ref> She closed brothels and made pimping a criminal offense. She created a convent on the [[Asia]]n side of the [[Dardanelles]] called the ''Metanoia'' (Repentance), where the ex-prostitutes could support themselves.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} [[Procopius|Procopius']] ''Secret History'' maintained that instead of preventing forced prostitution (as in ''Buildings'' 1.9.3ff), Theodora is said to have 'rounded up' 500 prostitutes, confining them to a convent. They sought to escape 'the unwelcome transformation' by leaping over the walls (''SH'' 17). On the other hand, [[John Malalas]], his fellow contemporary chronicler, wrote she \"freed the girls from the yoke of their wretched slavery.\" <ref> John Malalas, ''The Chronicle of John Malalas'', 18.440.14-441.7</ref> A century later, John of Nikiu observed its positive impact, noting that Theodora \"put an end to the prostitution of women, and gave orders for their expulsion from every place.\"\n\nJustinian's legislations also expanded the rights of women in divorce and property ownership, instituted the death penalty for rape, forbade exposure of unwanted infants, gave mothers some guardianship rights over their children, and forbade the killing of a wife who committed adultery. Though her specific involvement in these legal reforms is not recorded, <ref>Garland. Page 18.</ref> Procopius, in ''Wars'', mentioned that she was naturally inclined to assist women in misfortune, and according ''Secret History'', she championed the wives' causes when their husbands charged them with adultery (''SH'' 17).\n\n==Religious policy==\n{{Infobox saint\n|name          = Saint Theodora\n|birth_date    =\n|death_date    =\n|feast_day     = November 14\n|venerated_in  = [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]<br>[[Eastern Catholicism]]<br> [[Oriental Orthodox Church]]\n|image         = File:Mosaic of Theodora - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna, Italy).jpg\n|imagesize     = 300px\n|caption       = Empress Theodora and attendants (mosaic from [[Basilica of San Vitale]], 6th century)\n|birth_place   =\n|death_place   =\n|titles        = Empress\n|beatified_date=\n|beatified_place=\n|beatified_by=\n|canonized_date=\n|canonized_place=\n|canonized_by=\n|attributes    = Imperial Vestment\n|patronage     =\n|major_shrine  = [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], [[Constantinople]] modern day [[Istanbul, Turkey]]\n|issues=\n}}\nTheodora worked against her husband's support of [[Chalcedonian]] Christianity in the ongoing struggle for the predominance of each faction.<ref name=about>{{cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/library/bio/blbio_theodora.htm |title=Theodora \u2013 Byzantine Empress |publisher=[[About.com]] |date= |accessdate=11 April 2008}}</ref> As a result, she was accused of fostering [[heresy]] and thus undermined the unity of [[Christendom]].\n\nIn spite of Justinian being [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian]], Theodora founded a [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] monastery in [[Galata|Sykae]] and provided shelter in the palace for Miaphysite leaders who faced opposition from the majority of Chalcedonian Christians, like [[Severus of Antioch|Severus]] and [[Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople|Anthimus]]. Anthimus had been appointed [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] under her influence, and after the excommunication order he was hidden in Theodora's quarters for twelve years, until her death. When the [[Chalcedonian]] Patriarch [[Ephraim of Antioch|Ephraim]] provoked a violent revolt in Antioch, eight Miaphysite bishops were invited to Constantinople and Theodora welcomed them and housed them in the [[Hormisdas Palace]] adjoining the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]], which had been Justinian and Theodora's own dwelling before they became emperor and empress.\n\nIn Egypt, when [[Pope Timothy III (IV) of Alexandria|Timothy III]] died, Theodora enlisted the help of Dioscoros, the Augustal Prefect, and Aristomachos the duke of Egypt, to facilitate the enthronement of a disciple of Severus, [[Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria|Theodosius]], thereby outmaneuvering her husband, who had intended a Chalcedonian successor as patriarch. But [[Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria]], even with the help of imperial troops, could not hold his ground in Alexandria against Justinian's Chalcedonian followers. When he was exiled by Justinian along with 300 Miaphysites to the fortress of [[Delcus]] in [[Thrace]], Theodora rescued him and brought him to the Hormisdas Palace. He lived under her protection and, after her death in 548, under Justinian's.\n\nWhen [[Pope Silverius]] refused Theodora's demand that he remove the [[anathema]] of [[Pope Agapetus I]] from [[Patriarch Anthimus I of Constantinople|Patriarch Anthimus]], she sent [[Belisarius]] instructions to find a pretext to remove Silverius. When this was accomplished, [[Pope Vigilius]] was appointed in his stead.\n\nIn [[Nobatia|Nobatae]], south of Egypt, the inhabitants were converted to Miaphysite Christianity about 540. Justinian had been determined that they be converted to the Chalcedonian faith and Theodora equally determined that they should be Miaphysites. Justinian made arrangements for Chalcedonian missionaries from [[Thebaid]] to go with presents to Silko, the king of the Nobatae. But on hearing this, Theodora prepared her own missionaries and wrote to the duke of Thebaid that he should delay her husband's embassy, so that the Miaphysite missionaries should arrive first. The duke was canny enough to thwart the easygoing Justinian instead of the unforgiving Theodora. He saw to it that the Chalcedonian missionaries were delayed. When they eventually reached Silko, they were sent away, for the Nobatae had already adopted the Miaphysite creed of Theodosius.\n\n==Death==\nTheodora's death is recorded by [[Victor of Tonnena]], with the cause uncertain but the Greek terms used are often translated as \"cancer.\" The date was 28 June 548 at the age of 48.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0h2gDLv3MOEC&pg=PA75 |title=Breast Cancer|isbn=978-0955422102|last1=Harding|first1=Fred|year= 2007}}</ref> Later accounts frequently attribute the death to [[breast cancer]], although it was not identified as such in the original report where the use of the term \"cancer\" probably referred to \"a suppurating ulcer or malignant tumor\".<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Other sources report that she died at 51.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Their Own: Women in Europe, Vol 1|last=Anderson & Zinsser|first=Bonnie & Judith|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|page=48|quote=|via=}}</ref> Justinian wept bitterly at her funeral.<ref>Diehl, ''ibid.'', p. 197.</ref> Her body was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople.\n\nBoth Theodora and Justinian are represented in mosaics that exist to this day in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Italy]], which was completed a year before her death.\n\n==Lasting influence==\nHer influence on Justinian was so strong that after her death he worked to bring harmony between the Monophysites and the Chalcedonian Christians in the Empire, and he kept his promise to protect her little community of Monophysite refugees in the Hormisdas Palace.\nTheodora provided much political support for the ministry of [[Jacob Baradaeus]], and apparently personal friendship as well.

{"title_page": "Servilia gens", "text_new": "The '''gens Servilia''' was a [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family at [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].  The [[gens]] was celebrated during the early ages of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and the names of few gentes appear more frequently at this period in the [[Fasti consulares|consular Fasti]].  It continued to produce men of influence in the state down to the latest times of the Republic, and even in the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]].  The first member of the gens who obtained the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius Priscus Structus]] in 495 BC, and the last of the name who appears in the consular Fasti is Quintus Servilius Silanus, in AD 189, thus occupying a prominent position in the Roman state for nearly seven hundred years.\n\nLike other Roman gentes, the Servilii of course had their own [[sacra (ancient Rome)|sacra]]; and they are said to have worshipped a ''triens'', or copper coin, which is reported to have increased or diminished in size at various times, thus indicating the increase or diminution of the honors of the gens.  Although the Servilii were originally patricians, in the later Republic there were also [[plebeian]] Servilii.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 793 (\"Servilia Gens\").</ref><ref name=\"Fasti Capitolini\">''[[Fasti Capitolini]]'', {{AE|1900|83}}; 1904, 114; {{AE|1927|101}}; 1940, 59, 60.</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Gaius Plinius Secundus]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', xxxiv. 13. s. 38.</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n\nAccording to tradition, the Servilia gens was one of the [[Alba Longa|Alban]] houses removed to Rome by [[Tullus Hostilius]], and enrolled by him among the patricians.  It was, consequently, one of the ''gentes minores''.  The [[Roman naming convention#Nomen|nomen]] ''Servilius'' is a patronymic surname, derived from the [[praenomen]] ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]]'' (meaning \"one who keeps safe\" or \"preserves\"), which must have been borne by the ancestor of the gens.<ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', i. 30.</ref><ref>George Davis Chase, \"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\", in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', vol. VIII (1897).</ref>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe different branches of the Servilii each used slightly different sets of [[praenomen|praenomina]].  The oldest stirpes used the praenomina ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]], [[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]'', and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]''.  The Servilii Caepiones used primarily ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' and ''Quintus''.  The Servilii Gemini employed ''Gnaeus, Quintus, Publius, Gaius'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  The ancestors of the gens must have used the praenomen ''Servius'', but the family no longer used it in historical times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Servilii were divided into numerous families; of these the names in the Republican period are ''Ahala, Axilla, Caepio, Casca, Geminus, Glaucia, Globulus, Priscus'' (with the agnomen ''Fidenas''), ''Rullus, Structus, Tucca'', and ''Vatia'' (with the agnomen ''Isauricus'').  The Structi, Prisci, Ahalae, and Caepiones were patricians; the Gemini originally patrician, and later plebeian; the Vatiae and Cascae plebeians.  Other [[cognomen|cognomina]] appear under the Empire.  The only surnames found on coins are those of ''Ahala, Caepio, Casca'', and ''Rullus''.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\"/><ref>[[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel]], ''Doctrina Numorum Veterum'', v. p. 308 ''ff.''</ref>\n\nThe cognomen ''Structus'' almost always occurs in connection with those of ''Priscus'' or ''Ahala''.  The only Structus who is mentioned with this cognomen alone is Spurius Servilius Structus, who was [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribune]] in 368 BC.  The fact that ''Structus'' appears in two of the oldest stirpes of the Servilii, neither of which clearly predates the other, could indicate that persons bearing this surname were ancestral to both great houses.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 928 (\"Structus\").</ref>\n\nThe Prisci (\"antique\") were an ancient family of the Servilia gens, and filled the highest offices of the state during the early years of the Republic.  They also bore the agnomen of ''Structus'', which is always appended to their name in the Fasti, till it was supplanted by that of ''Fidenas'', which was first obtained by Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus, who took [[Fidenae]] in his [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]], in 435 BC, and which was also borne by his descendants.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 528 (\"Servilius Priscus\").</ref>\n\n''Ahala'', of which ''Axilla'' is merely another form, is a diminutive of ''ala'', a wing.  A popular legend related that the name was first given to [[Gaius Servilius Ahala|Gaius Servilius Structus]], [[Master of the Horse|magister equitum]] in 439 BC, because he hid the knife with which he slew [[Spurius Maelius]] in his armpit (also ''ala'').  However, this does not appear to be the case, since the name had been in use by the family for at least a generation before that event.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 83 (\"Ahala\"), 448 (\"Axilla\").</ref>\n\nThe surnames ''Caepio'' and ''Geminus'' appear almost simultaneously in the middle of the third century BC, with the consuls of 253 and 252.  Each was the grandson of a Gnaeus Servilius, suggesting that the two cognomina belonged to two branches of the same family.  ''Caepio'', an onion, belongs to a large class of surnames derived from ordinary objects, while ''Geminus'' originally denoted a twin, and was typically given to the younger of two brothers.  In a discussion concerning appearances, [[Cicero]] mentions a certain Quintus Servilius Geminus, who was frequently mistaken for his brother, Publius, the consul of 252 BC.  The Servilii Vatiae (\"cross-legged\") seem to be descended from the Gemini.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 533\u2013535 (\"Caepio\"), vol. II, p. 239 (\"Geminus\"), vol. III, pp. 1232, 1233 (\"Vatia\").</ref><ref>Chase, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica Priora'', ii. 84.</ref>\n\n==Members==\n\n===Servilii Prisci===\n* Publius Servilius Priscus Structus, father of the consul of 495 BC.\n* [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius P. f.

The [[gens]] was celebrated during the early ages of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], and the names of few gentes appear more frequently at this period in the [[Fasti consulares|consular Fasti]].  It continued to produce men of influence in the state down to the latest times of the Republic, and even in the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]].  The first member of the gens who obtained the [[Roman consul|consulship]] was [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius Priscus Structus]] in 495 BC, and the last of the name who appears in the consular Fasti is Quintus Servilius Silanus, in AD 189, thus occupying a prominent position in the Roman state for nearly seven hundred years.\n\nLike other Roman gentes, the Servilii of course had their own [[sacra (ancient Rome)|sacra]]; and they are said to have worshipped a ''triens'', or copper coin, which is reported to have increased or diminished in size at various times, thus indicating the increase or diminution of the honors of the gens.  Although the Servilii were originally patricians, in the later Republic there were also [[plebeian]] Servilii.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\">''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 793 (\"Servilia Gens\").</ref><ref name=\"Fasti Capitolini\">''[[Fasti Capitolini]]'', {{AE|1900|83}}; 1904, 114; {{AE|1927|101}}; 1940, 59, 60.</ref><ref>[[Pliny the Elder|Gaius Plinius Secundus]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', xxxiv. 13. s. 38.</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n\nAccording to tradition, the Servilia gens was one of the [[Alba Longa|Alban]] houses removed to Rome by [[Tullus Hostilius]], and enrolled by him among the patricians.  It was, consequently, one of the ''gentes minores''.  The [[Roman naming convention#Nomen|nomen]] ''Servilius'' is a patronymic surname, derived from the [[praenomen]] ''[[Servius (praenomen)|Servius]]'' (meaning \"one who keeps safe\" or \"preserves\"), which must have been borne by the ancestor of the gens.<ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', i. 30.</ref><ref>George Davis Chase, \"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\", in ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'', vol. VIII (1897).</ref>\n\n==Praenomina==\nThe different branches of the Servilii each used slightly different sets of [[praenomen|praenomina]].  The oldest stirpes used the praenomina ''[[Publius (praenomen)|Publius]], [[Quintus (praenomen)|Quintus]], [[Spurius (praenomen)|Spurius]]'', and ''[[Gaius (praenomen)|Gaius]]''.  The Servilii Caepiones used primarily ''[[Gnaeus (praenomen)|Gnaeus]]'' and ''Quintus''.  The Servilii Gemini employed ''Gnaeus, Quintus, Publius, Gaius'', and ''[[Marcus (praenomen)|Marcus]]''.  The ancestors of the gens must have used the praenomen ''Servius'', but the family no longer used it in historical times.\n\n==Branches and cognomina==\nThe Servilii were divided into numerous families; of these the names in the Republican period are ''Ahala, Axilla, Caepio, Casca, Geminus, Glaucia, Globulus, Priscus'' (with the agnomen ''Fidenas''), ''Rullus, Structus, Tucca'', and ''Vatia'' (with the agnomen ''Isauricus'').  The Structi, Prisci, Ahalae, and Caepiones were patricians; the Gemini originally patrician, and later plebeian; the Vatiae and Cascae plebeians.  Other [[cognomen|cognomina]] appear under the Empire.  The only surnames found on coins are those of ''Ahala, Caepio, Casca'', and ''Rullus''.<ref name=\"DGRBM Servilia Gens\"/><ref>[[Joseph Hilarius Eckhel]], ''Doctrina Numorum Veterum'', v. p. 308 ''ff.''</ref>\n\nThe cognomen ''Structus'' almost always occurs in connection with those of ''Priscus'' or ''Ahala''.  The only Structus who is mentioned with this cognomen alone is Spurius Servilius Structus, who was [[tribuni militum consulari potestate|consular tribune]] in 368 BC.  The fact that ''Structus'' appears in two of the oldest stirpes of the Servilii, neither of which clearly predates the other, could indicate that persons bearing this surname were ancestral to both great houses.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 928 (\"Structus\").</ref>\n\nThe Prisci (\"antique\") were an ancient family of the Servilia gens, and filled the highest offices of the state during the early years of the Republic.  They also bore the agnomen of ''Structus'', which is always appended to their name in the Fasti, till it was supplanted by that of ''Fidenas'', which was first obtained by Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus, who took [[Fidenae]] in his [[Roman dictator|dictatorship]], in 435 BC, and which was also borne by his descendants.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. III, p. 528 (\"Servilius Priscus\").</ref>\n\n''Ahala'', of which ''Axilla'' is merely another form, is a diminutive of ''ala'', a wing.  A popular legend related that the name was first given to [[Gaius Servilius Ahala|Gaius Servilius Structus]], [[Master of the Horse|magister equitum]] in 439 BC, because he hid the knife with which he slew [[Spurius Maelius]] in his armpit (also ''ala'').  However, this does not appear to be the case, since the name had been in use by the family for at least a generation before that event.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 83 (\"Ahala\"), 448 (\"Axilla\").</ref>\n\nThe surnames ''Caepio'' and ''Geminus'' appear almost simultaneously in the middle of the third century BC, with the consuls of 253 and 252.  Each was the grandson of a Gnaeus Servilius, suggesting that the two cognomina belonged to two branches of the same family.  ''Caepio'', an onion, belongs to a large class of surnames derived from ordinary objects, while ''Geminus'' originally denoted a twin, and was typically given to the younger of two brothers.  In a discussion concerning appearances, [[Cicero]] mentions a certain Quintus Servilius Geminus, who was frequently mistaken for his brother, Publius, the consul of 252 BC.  The Servilii Vatiae (\"cross-legged\") seem to be descended from the Gemini.<ref>''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', vol. I, pp. 533\u2013535 (\"Caepio\"), vol. II, p. 239 (\"Geminus\"), vol. III, pp. 1232, 1233 (\"Vatia\").</ref><ref>Chase, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>Cicero, ''Academica Priora'', ii. 84.</ref>\n\n==Members==\n\n===Servilii Prisci===\n* Publius Servilius Priscus Structus, father of the consul of 495 BC.\n* [[Publius Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 495 BC)|Publius Servilius P. f.

He is told that three officers of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]\u2014lieutenants [[Breaker Morant|Harry Morant]] ([[Edward Woodward]]), [[Peter Handcock]] ([[Bryan Brown]]) and [[George Witton]] ([[Lewis Fitz-Gerald]])\u2014have been arrested and charged with the murder of captured [[Boer]]s and a German missionary. Explaining ominously that the German Emperor\u2014[[Wilhelm II]]\u2014has protested diplomatically about the latter killing, Kitchener asks Major Bolton to appear for the prosecution. To the Major's visible dismay, he is told that witnesses which would help the defence have been sent to [[British Raj|India]] and that the defence counsel is expected to give him no trouble.\n\nThe defence counsel, Major James Francis Thomas ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) meets Morant, Handcock and Witton the day before he is to represent them in court. He tells them that he knows only the basic facts, which look bad. A small town [[solicitor]] from [[New South Wales]] in civilian life, Major Thomas explains that he has never handled anything except legal documents like wills. Handcock quips, \"Might come in handy\".\n\nAs court martial proceedings begin the following morning, Major Thomas argues, because his clients are Australians, that only the [[Australian Army]] can court martial them. Unmoved, the president of the court martial, Lt. Col. Denny, explains that the defendants may be tried for alleged crimes committed while serving under British command in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]. Without further ado, Denny reads the indictment. The three stand accused of the murder of a Boer prisoner named Denys Visser (Michael Procanin Bernosky) and the subsequent shooting of six other captured Boers whose names are unknown. Morant and Handcock are charged with the murder of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese]].\n\nBolton begins by calling witnesses who describe a lack of discipline, drunkenness, widespread looting and corruption among the Bushveldt Carbineers at Fort Edward. Thomas manages to damage their credibility during [[cross examination]]. The testimony then turns to the shooting of Visser, which is shown in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nOn 5 April 1901, Morant's friend, Captain Simon Hunt, had led a group of men to a farmhouse at [[Duiwelskloof]] intending to capture or kill [[Boer Commando]] [[Field Cornet]] Barend Viljoen. On arrival, the Carbineers found the farm swarming with far more armed men than expected. Captain Hunt was wounded, pinned down by enemy fire and left behind when he ordered his men to retreat. When the patrol returned to Fort Edward without Captain Hunt, Intelligence Corps Captain [[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] ([[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]]) suggests Morant \"avenge Captain Hunt\". After returning to the farm and finding Captain Hunt's body mutilated with knives, Morant gave chase, ambushed Viljoen's men, and forced them to retreat with many losses. After capturing a Boer named Visser who was wearing Captain Hunt's jacket, an enraged Morant ordered his men to line up into a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. They obey his order.\n\nThomas argues that standing orders existed to shoot \"all Boers captured wearing [[khaki]]\". To the shock of Thomas and his clients, Bolton explains that those orders only applied to Boers wearing British uniforms as a [[ruse of war]]. When Morant takes the witness stand and is grilled by Bolton, he defends the shooting of Visser by saying that he fought the Boers as they fought him. When asked which of the [[rules of engagement]] justifies shooting an unarmed prisoner, Morant shouts, in reference to the calibre of his rifle, \"Rule 303\". That night, Thomas angrily tells Morant that he was the best witness the prosecution has yet had. The following day, testimony turns to the shooting of the six Boers.\n\nTaylor testifies that Captain Hunt had paid a visit to Kitchener's headquarters. Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Morant had brought in a group of Boers who had surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders from Kitchener, relayed through Colonel [[Hubert Hamilton]], decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Saying, \"The gentlemen's war is over\", Hunt had had the prisoners all shot while Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners. According to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing [[white flag]]s. Morant ordered them disarmed, lined them up, and had them shot. One prisoner runs at Witton, who kills him.\n\nThomas demands that Kitchener be summoned as a witness. He argues that, as his clients [[Nuremberg Defense|only followed orders]], all charges must be dropped. Denny recoils at the suggestion that Kitchener, a man revered throughout the [[British Empire]], would be capable of giving such criminal orders. Equally contemptuous of the idea, Bolton privately tells Thomas that, if Kitchener testifies and denies giving the orders, the defendants' lives will be doomed. He vainly urges Thomas not to insist. In private Kitchener tells Hamilton that, when he had issued orders to take no prisoners, he was trying to break the Boer guerrillas by waging [[total war]]. Now he is trying to win the hearts and minds of the [[Afrikaner people]] and arrange a peace conference. To this end, a few soldiers \"have to be sacrificed\" for the misdeeds of the British Army. He orders Hamilton to testify in his place and when asked for what to say, Kitchener comments, \"I think you know what to do\".\n\nThe following day, Hamilton takes the stand and denies ever having spoken to Captain Hunt. An outraged Morant stands up and yells that the Colonel is a liar. Denny comments that there will be no more talk of orders to shoot prisoners. Thomas explains that Hamilton's testimony is irrelevant. The fact is, his clients ''believed'' that such orders existed and thus cannot be held accountable for following them. The trial then turns to the murder of the Reverend Heese. A Corporal Sharp testifies that, shortly before the massacre of the six Boers, Heese had passed through Fort Edward in a buggy. Shortly after his departure, Handcock had ridden up to Morant, spoken briefly to him and then ridden off, looking \"agitated\", in the same direction as Heese, with a rifle. Thomas damages Sharp on cross examination by revealing his hatred of the defendants.\n\nOn stand, Morant explains that Heese was under orders to never speak to prisoners while passing through Fort Edward and violated them. When Bolton asks why such orders existed, Morant explains, \"It was for security reasons\". When Morant had confronted the Heese, he had been told that the prisoners had begged Heese to pray with them and that he could not refuse. Heese then left the Fort and was later found, shot dead, along the road. Bolton suggests that Heese was going to inform their commanding officer of Morant's plans to kill the prisoners and accuses Morant of ordering Handcock to silence him. Unmoved, Morant insists that his commanding officer already knew and suggests that he be recalled from India to testify. He adds, \"I don't mind waiting\".\n\nAfter Morant stands down, Thomas requests and is granted a brief recess to confer with Handcock before putting him on the stand. Late into the night, Thomas pleads with Handcock to tell him the truth, calling the Heese murder \"the most serious charge\". At last, Handcock opens up about his whereabouts. The following morning, Handcock testifies that, when he left Fort Edward, he had travelled to the homes of two married Afrikaner women to 'entertain' them. As Bolton eyes him, Thomas produces signed depositions from the women to confirm Handcock's story. The court and the prosecution accept the depositions without summoning the women to give evidence.\n\nLater, in the prison courtyard, Witton wonders aloud about who really did kill Heese. Handcock smiles and says, \"Me\". To Witton's horror, Handcock explains that his visits to his \"two lady friends\" happened afterwards. When Witton asks whether Thomas knows, Morant explains that there is no reason for him to know. Morant explains that the Bushveldt Carbineers represent a new kind of warfare \"for a new century\". As the Boers do not wear uniforms, the enemy is everyone, including men, women, children, even missionaries. That is why, after Heese had left the Fort, Morant had told Handcock that he believed that the Reverend was a Boer spy and had said that he was going towards [[Leydsdorp]]. A seething Handcock replied that anything could happen on the way there, had ridden after Heese and shot him.\n\nAfter a powerful summing up speech from Thomas, the defendants are acquitted of murdering Heese. They celebrate, believing they have escaped  the [[death penalty]] but Taylor takes Morant aside and tells him that he and Handcock are almost certainly going to be shot. He offers to have a horse ready and says that many of the Highland Scots guards are sympathetic. He urges Morant to flee to [[Portuguese Mozambique]], take ship from [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]] and \"see the world\". Unmoved, Morant says, \"I've seen it\". Next morning, the defendants are sentenced to death, with Witton's commuted to \"life in penal servitude\". Thomas rushes to Kitchener's headquarters to demand a commutation and finds that Kitchener has already left. He is also told that London and the Australian Government support the verdict and sentences. There now will be a peace conference and every British and Commonwealth soldier will be going home.\n\nThe next morning, as Witton is led away, Morant tells him \"we are the scapegoats of Empire\". Morant's poem ''[http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/moranth/poetry/butchered.html Butchered to Make a Dutchmen's Holiday]'' is recited in [[voiceover]] while he and Handcock are led before a [[firing squad]]. As both men are seated for their execution, Morant shouts, \"Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it!\" before being shot dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Lt. [[Breaker Morant|Harry \"Breaker\" Morant]]\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Lt.

The distributors, Roadshow, insisted that Jack Thompson be given a role.<ref name=\"stratton\">Stratton, David. ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p.55</ref> The movie was the second of two films Beresford intended to make for the [[South Australian Film Corporation]]. He wanted to make ''Breakout'', about the [[Cowra Breakout]] but could not find a script he was happy with so he turned to the story of Breaker Morant.<ref name=\"stratton\"/>\n\n==Historical inaccuracies==\n===Alleged German pressure===\nIn conversation with Bolton, Lord Kitchener states that [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] has formally protested about the murder of Heese, whom he describes as a German citizen. He says that the [[German people]] support the Boer cause, that their elected representatives covet the gold and diamond mines of the [[Boer Republics]], and that the British Government fears German entry into the war. This, Kitchener explains, is why Morant, Handcock, and Witton must be convicted at all costs.\n\nAccording to the South African historian Charles Leach, the legend that the German Foreign Office protested about the case \"cannot be proved through official channels\". \"No personal or direct communication\" between the Kaiser and his uncle, King [[Edward VII]], \"has been found despite widespread legend that this was definitely the case\". Questions raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 April 1902 were answered by an insistence that the War Office, the Foreign Office, or Lord Kitchener had not received \"any such communication on this subject\" \"on behalf of the German government\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\">Leach (2012), page 80.</ref>\n\nUnder international law, the German government had no grounds to protest. Despite being attached to the [[Berlin Missionary Society]], Heese had been born in [[Cape Colony]] and \"was, technically speaking, a British, and not a German citizen\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/> The scene contains a kernel of truth. Leach writes, \"Several eminent South African historians, local enthusiasts and commentators share the opinion that had it not been for the murder of Heese, none of the other [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] murders would have gone to trial\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\n===Three defendants===\nAlthough only Morant, Handcock, and Witton are shown as being on trial, there were three other defendants:\n* Lieutenant Henry Picton, a British-born Australian officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers, was charged with Morant, Handcock and Witton with \"committing the offense of murder\" for delivering a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' after the shooting of the wounded prisoner Floris Visser. Picton was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]] from the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013113, 117, 203.</ref>\n* Captain [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred James Taylor]], the Irish-born commander of [[military intelligence]] at Fort Edward, stood accused of the murder of six unarmed Afrikaner men and boys, the theft of their money and livestock and the subsequent murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper. He was acquitted.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013107.</ref>\n* Major Robert Lenehan, the Australian [[Field Commander]] of the Bushveldt Carbineers, stood accused of covering up the murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper who had disapproved of shooting prisoners. The official charge was \"When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was duty to make\". Lenehan was found guilty and sentenced to be reprimanded.<ref>Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\n===Role of other ranks and Colonel Hall===\nThe soldiers from the Fort Edward garrison who testify against Morant, Handcock and Witton are depicted as motivated by grudges against their former officers. A prime example is Corporal Sharp, who expresses a willingness to walk across South Africa to serve in the defendants' firing squad. Other prosecution witnesses have been thrown out of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the defendants for looting, drunkenness and other offences. All are portrayed with British accents.\n\nHall the officer commanding at [[Pietersburg]] is depicted as fully aware and even complicit in the [[total war]] tactics of the Fort Edward garrison. He is also described as having been sent to India to prevent him from giving testimony favourable to the defence. Surviving documents tell that the arrest of the six defendants was ''ordered'' by Hall after a letter from the other ranks at Fort Edward. The letter, dated 4 October 1901, was written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former [[Justice of the Peace]] from [[Western Australia]] and signed by 15 members of the Fort Edward garrison.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 98\u2013101.</ref><ref>Arthur Davey (1987), ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'', Second Series No. 18. [[Van Riebeeck Society]], [[Cape Town]]. Pages 78\u201382.</ref>\n\nAfter listing numerous murders and [[attempted murder]]s of unarmed Boer prisoners, local civilians and BVC personnel who disapproved, the letter concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek\".<ref>Leach (2012), page 101.</ref>\n\n===Arrest at Fort Edward===\nDuring his conversation with Handcock and Witton in the prison courtyard, Morant alleges that the [[British Army]] has marked them for death \"ever since they arrested us at Fort Edward\" but their arrests took place elsewhere. After the letter Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and non-commissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of [[mounted infantry]] five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97\u201398.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of deals for leniency===\nIn the film, the British military is determined to kill the defendants. According to the Australian historians Margaret Carnegie and Frank Shields, Morant and Handcock rejected an offer of [[immunity from prosecution]] in return for turning [[king's evidence]]. Military prosecutors allegedly hoped to use them as witnesses against BVC Major Robert Lenehan, who was believed to have issued orders to [[take no prisoners]].<ref>Carnegie and Shields (1979), ''In Search of Breaker Morant'', pages 124\u2013125.</ref> Towards the end of the film, Taylor informs Morant that the British Army will never dare to prosecute him, as he really can implicate Kitchener in war crimes. According to the South African historian Andries Pretorius, the trial of Alfred Taylor was almost certainly saved for the last because \"The prosecution must have been hoping\", in vain for the accused officers, \"to implicate Taylor\". Their refusal to do so seems to have ensured that Taylor was not convicted at his trial.<ref>Leach (2012), page 189.</ref>\n\n===Captain Hunt===\nIn the film, Hunt is inaccurately depicted as having an [[Australian accent]]. According to the South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt \"was an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\". A surviving photograph of Hunt also reveals that he was far younger than the actor who plays him on screen.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Breaker Morant'' a 100% \"fresh\" rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 8.45/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/breaker_morant/ \"Breaker Morant (1980)\"] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 1 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe film also stirred debate on the legacy of the trial with its pacifist theme. D. L. Kershen wrote \"''Breaker Morant'' tells the story of the court martial of Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton in South Africa in 1902. Yet, its overriding theme is that \"war is evil\". ''Breaker Morant'' is a beautiful antiwar statement \u2014 a plea for the end of the intrigues and crimes that war entails\".<ref>[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm \"Breaker Morant\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106034741/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm |date=6 January 2009 }} ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' Volume 22, Number 1 (1997).

Another issue, which I find particularly fascinating, concerns the fairness of the hearing. We would ask whether [[due process]] was present, after accounting for the exigencies of the battlefield. Does ''Breaker Morant'' demonstrate what happens when due process is not observed?<ref>[http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~pyle/pla4020/Breaker.html \"Breaker Morant\"] on the [[University of Central Florida]] website Retrieved 24 July 2009</ref>}}\n\nBruce Beresford claimed the film is often misunderstood as the story of men [[kangaroo court|railroaded]] by the British,\n\n{{quote|But that's not what it's about at all. The film never pretended for a moment that they weren't guilty. It said they were guilty.

It's the pressures that are put to bear on people in war time... Look at all the things that happen in these countries committed by people who appear to be quite normal. That was what I was interested in examining. I always get amazed when people say to me that this is a film about poor Australians who were framed by the Brits.<ref name=\"bruce\"/>}}\n\nAfter the success of ''Breaker Morant'', Beresford was offered dozens of Hollywood scripts including ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', which he later directed. The 1983 film earned him his only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] to date, even though ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' (1989) which he directed, won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Beresford said that ''Breaker Morant'' was not that successful commercially,\n\n{{quote|Critically, it was important, which is a key factor, and it has kept being shown over the years.

He is told that three officers of the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]\u2014lieutenants [[Breaker Morant|Harry Morant]] ([[Edward Woodward]]), [[Peter Handcock]] ([[Bryan Brown]]) and [[George Witton]] ([[Lewis Fitz-Gerald]])\u2014have been arrested and charged with the murder of captured [[Boer]]s and a German missionary. Explaining ominously that the German Emperor\u2014[[Wilhelm II]]\u2014has protested diplomatically about the latter killing, Kitchener asks Major Bolton to appear for the prosecution. To the Major's visible dismay, he is told that witnesses which would help the defence have been sent to [[British Raj|India]] and that the defence counsel is expected to give him no trouble.\n\nThe defence counsel, Major James Francis Thomas ([[Jack Thompson (actor)|Jack Thompson]]) meets Morant, Handcock and Witton the day before he is to represent them in court. He tells them that he knows only the basic facts, which look bad. A small town [[solicitor]] from [[New South Wales]] in civilian life, Major Thomas explains that he has never handled anything except legal documents like wills. Handcock quips, \"Might come in handy\".\n\nAs court martial proceedings begin the following morning, Major Thomas argues, because his clients are Australians, that only the [[Australian Army]] can court martial them. Unmoved, the president of the court martial, Lt. Col. Denny, explains that the defendants may be tried for alleged crimes committed while serving under British command in the [[Bushveldt Carbineers]]. Without further ado, Denny reads the indictment. The three stand accused of the murder of a Boer prisoner named Denys Visser (Michael Procanin Bernosky) and the subsequent shooting of six other captured Boers whose names are unknown. Morant and Handcock are charged with the murder of the Reverend [[Daniel Heese]].\n\nBolton begins by calling witnesses who describe a lack of discipline, drunkenness, widespread looting and corruption among the Bushveldt Carbineers at Fort Edward. Thomas manages to damage their credibility during [[cross examination]]. The testimony then turns to the shooting of Visser, which is shown in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]].\n\nOn 5 April 1901, Morant's friend, Captain Simon Hunt, had led a group of men to a farmhouse at [[Duiwelskloof]] intending to capture or kill [[Boer Commando]] [[Field Cornet]] Barend Viljoen. On arrival, the Carbineers found the farm swarming with far more armed men than expected. Captain Hunt was wounded, pinned down by enemy fire and left behind when he ordered his men to retreat. When the patrol returned to Fort Edward without Captain Hunt, Intelligence Corps Captain [[Alfred Taylor (soldier)|Alfred Taylor]] ([[John Waters (actor)|John Waters]]) suggests Morant \"avenge Captain Hunt\". After returning to the farm and finding Captain Hunt's body mutilated with knives, Morant gave chase, ambushed Viljoen's men, and forced them to retreat with many losses. After capturing a Boer named Visser who was wearing Captain Hunt's jacket, an enraged Morant ordered his men to line up into a [[firing squad]] and shoot him. They obey his order.\n\nThomas argues that standing orders existed to shoot \"all Boers captured wearing [[khaki]]\". To the shock of Thomas and his clients, Bolton explains that those orders only applied to Boers wearing British uniforms as a [[ruse of war]]. When Morant takes the witness stand and is grilled by Bolton, he defends the shooting of Visser by saying that he fought the Boers as they fought him. When asked which of the [[rules of engagement]] justifies shooting an unarmed prisoner, Morant shouts, in reference to the calibre of his rifle, \"Rule 303\". That night, Thomas angrily tells Morant that he was the best witness the prosecution has yet had. The following day, testimony turns to the shooting of the six Boers.\n\nTaylor testifies that Captain Hunt had paid a visit to Kitchener's headquarters. Following Hunt's return to Fort Edward, Morant had brought in a group of Boers who had surrendered, only to be told by Captain Hunt that new orders from Kitchener, relayed through Colonel [[Hubert Hamilton]], decreed that no more prisoners were to be taken. Saying, \"The gentlemen's war is over\", Hunt had had the prisoners all shot while Morant watched. Captain Taylor testifies that Morant had continued to bring prisoners in until after Captain Hunt had been killed. Afterwards, he always ordered his men to shoot them. On cross examination, Bolton damages Taylor by forcing him to admit that he is also awaiting court martial for shooting prisoners. According to other witnesses, a group of six Boer guerrillas had approached Fort Edward after Captain Hunt's death, bearing [[white flag]]s. Morant ordered them disarmed, lined them up, and had them shot. One prisoner runs at Witton, who kills him.\n\nThomas demands that Kitchener be summoned as a witness. He argues that, as his clients [[Nuremberg Defense|only followed orders]], all charges must be dropped. Denny recoils at the suggestion that Kitchener, a man revered throughout the [[British Empire]], would be capable of giving such criminal orders. Equally contemptuous of the idea, Bolton privately tells Thomas that, if Kitchener testifies and denies giving the orders, the defendants' lives will be doomed. He vainly urges Thomas not to insist. In private Kitchener tells Hamilton that, when he had issued orders to take no prisoners, he was trying to break the Boer guerrillas by waging [[total war]]. Now he is trying to win the hearts and minds of the [[Afrikaner people]] and arrange a peace conference. To this end, a few soldiers \"have to be sacrificed\" for the misdeeds of the British Army. He orders Hamilton to testify in his place and when asked for what to say, Kitchener comments, \"I think you know what to do\".\n\nThe following day, Hamilton takes the stand and denies ever having spoken to Captain Hunt. An outraged Morant stands up and yells that the Colonel is a liar. Denny comments that there will be no more talk of orders to shoot prisoners. Thomas explains that Hamilton's testimony is irrelevant. The fact is, his clients ''believed'' that such orders existed and thus cannot be held accountable for following them. The trial then turns to the murder of the Reverend Heese. A Corporal Sharp testifies that, shortly before the massacre of the six Boers, Heese had passed through Fort Edward in a buggy. Shortly after his departure, Handcock had ridden up to Morant, spoken briefly to him and then ridden off, looking \"agitated\", in the same direction as Heese, with a rifle. Thomas damages Sharp on cross examination by revealing his hatred of the defendants.\n\nOn stand, Morant explains that Heese was under orders to never speak to prisoners while passing through Fort Edward and violated them. When Bolton asks why such orders existed, Morant explains, \"It was for security reasons\". When Morant had confronted the Heese, he had been told that the prisoners had begged Heese to pray with them and that he could not refuse. Heese then left the Fort and was later found, shot dead, along the road. Bolton suggests that Heese was going to inform their commanding officer of Morant's plans to kill the prisoners and accuses Morant of ordering Handcock to silence him. Unmoved, Morant insists that his commanding officer already knew and suggests that he be recalled from India to testify. He adds, \"I don't mind waiting\".\n\nAfter Morant stands down, Thomas requests and is granted a brief recess to confer with Handcock before putting him on the stand. Late into the night, Thomas pleads with Handcock to tell him the truth, calling the Heese murder \"the most serious charge\". At last, Handcock opens up about his whereabouts. The following morning, Handcock testifies that, when he left Fort Edward, he had travelled to the homes of two married Afrikaner women to 'entertain' them. As Bolton eyes him, Thomas produces signed depositions from the women to confirm Handcock's story. The court and the prosecution accept the depositions without summoning the women to give evidence.\n\nLater, in the prison courtyard, Witton wonders aloud about who really did kill Heese. Handcock smiles and says, \"Me\". To Witton's horror, Handcock explains that his visits to his \"two lady friends\" happened afterwards. When Witton asks whether Thomas knows, Morant explains that there is no reason for him to know. Morant explains that the Bushveldt Carbineers represent a new kind of warfare \"for a new century\". As the Boers do not wear uniforms, the enemy is everyone, including men, women, children, even missionaries. That is why, after Heese had left the Fort, Morant had told Handcock that he believed that the Reverend was a Boer spy and had said that he was going towards [[Leydsdorp]]. A seething Handcock replied that anything could happen on the way there, had ridden after Heese and shot him.\n\nAfter a powerful summing up speech from Thomas, the defendants are acquitted of murdering Heese. They celebrate, believing they have escaped  the [[death penalty]] but Taylor takes Morant aside and tells him that he and Handcock are almost certainly going to be shot. He offers to have a horse ready and says that many of the Highland Scots guards are sympathetic. He urges Morant to flee to [[Portuguese Mozambique]], take ship from [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]] and \"see the world\". Unmoved, Morant says, \"I've seen it\". Next morning, the defendants are sentenced to death, with Witton's commuted to \"life in penal servitude\". Thomas rushes to Kitchener's headquarters to demand a commutation and finds that Kitchener has already left. He is also told that London and the Australian Government support for the verdict and sentences. There now will be a peace conference and every British and Commonwealth soldier will be going home.\n\nThe next morning, as Witton is led away, Morant tells him \"we are the scapegoats of Empire\". Morant's poem ''[http://www.middlemiss.org/lit/authors/moranth/poetry/butchered.html Butchered to Make a Dutchmen's Holiday]'' is recited in [[voiceover]] while he and Handcock are led before a [[firing squad]]. As both men are seated for their execution, Morant shouts, \"Shoot straight, you bastards! Don't make a mess of it!\" before being shot dead.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Edward Woodward]] as Lt. [[Breaker Morant|Harry \"Breaker\" Morant]]\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as Lt.

The distributors, Roadshow, insisted that Jack Thompson be given a role.<ref name=\"stratton\">Stratton, David. ''The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival'', Angus & Robertson, 1980 p.55</ref> The movie was the second of two films Beresford intended to make for the [[South Australian Film Corporation]]. He wanted to make ''Breakout'', about the [[Cowra Breakout]] but could not find a script he was happy with so he turned to the story of Breaker Morant.<ref name=\"stratton\"/>\n\n==Historical inaccuracies==\n===Alleged German pressure===\nIn conversation with Bolton, Lord Kitchener states that [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] has formally protested about the murder of Heese, whom he describes as a German citizen. He says that the [[German people]] support the Boer cause, that their elected representatives covet the gold and diamond mines of the [[Boer Republics]], and that the British Government fears German entry into the war. This, Kitchener explains, is why Morant, Handcock, and Witton must be convicted at all costs.\n\nAccording to the South African historian Charles Leach, the legend that the German Foreign Office protested about the case \"cannot be proved through official channels\". \"No personal or direct communication\" between the Kaiser and his uncle, King [[Edward VII]], \"has been found despite widespread legend that this was definitely the case\". Questions raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 8 April 1902 were answered by an insistence that the War Office, the Foreign Office, or Lord Kitchener had not received \"any such communication on this subject\" \"on behalf of the German government\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\">Leach (2012), page 80.</ref>\n\nUnder international law, the German government had no grounds to protest. Despite being attached to the [[Berlin Missionary Society]], Heese had been born in [[Cape Colony]] and \"was, technically speaking, a British, and not a German citizen\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/> The scene contains a kernel of truth. Leach writes, \"Several eminent South African historians, local enthusiasts and commentators share the opinion that had it not been for the murder of Heese, none of the other [[Bushveldt Carbineers]] murders would have gone to trial\".<ref name=\"Leach 2012, page 80\"/>\n\n===Three defendants===\nAlthough only Morant, Handcock, and Witton are shown as being on trial, there were three other defendants:\n* Lieutenant Henry Picton, a British-born Australian officer of the Bushveldt Carbineers, was charged with Morant, Handcock and Witton with \"committing the offense of murder\" for delivering a ''[[coup de gr\u00e2ce]]'' after the shooting of the wounded prisoner Floris Visser. Picton was found guilty of [[manslaughter]] and sentenced to be [[Cashiering|cashiered]] from the [[British Armed Forces]].<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013113, 117, 203.</ref>\n* Captain [[Alfred Taylor (British Army officer)|Alfred James Taylor]], the Irish-born commander of [[military intelligence]] at Fort Edward, stood accused of the murder of six unarmed Afrikaner men and boys, the theft of their money and livestock and the subsequent murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper. He was acquitted.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 105\u2013107.</ref>\n* Major Robert Lenehan, the Australian [[Field Commander]] of the Bushveldt Carbineers, stood accused of covering up the murder of a Bushveldt Carbineers Trooper who had disapproved of shooting prisoners. The official charge was \"When on active service by culpable neglect failing to make a report which it was duty to make\". Lenehan was found guilty and sentenced to be reprimanded.<ref>Leach (2012), page 203.</ref>\n\n===Role of other ranks and Colonel Hall===\nThe soldiers from the Fort Edward garrison who testify against Morant, Handcock and Witton are depicted as motivated by grudges against their former officers. A prime example is Corporal Sharp, who expresses a willingness to walk across South Africa to serve in the defendants' firing squad. Other prosecution witnesses have been thrown out of the Bushveldt Carbineers by the defendants for looting, drunkenness and other offences. All are portrayed with British accents.\n\nHall the officer commanding at [[Pietersburg]] is depicted as fully aware and even complicit in the [[total war]] tactics of the Fort Edward garrison. He is also described as having been sent to India to prevent him from giving testimony favourable to the defence. Surviving documents tell that the arrest of the six defendants was ''ordered'' by Hall after a letter from the other ranks at Fort Edward. The letter, dated 4 October 1901, was written by BVC Trooper Robert Mitchell Cochrane, a former [[Justice of the Peace]] from [[Western Australia]] and signed by 15 members of the Fort Edward garrison.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 98\u2013101.</ref><ref>Arthur Davey (1987), ''Breaker Morant and the Bushveldt Carbineers'', Second Series No. 18. [[Van Riebeeck Society]], [[Cape Town]]. Pages 78\u201382.</ref>\n\nAfter listing numerous murders and [[attempted murder]]s of unarmed Boer prisoners, local civilians and BVC personnel who disapproved, the letter concluded, \"Sir, many of us are [[Australian people|Australians]] who have fought throughout nearly the whole war while others are [[Afrikaner people|Africaners]] who have fought from [[Battle of Colenso|Colenso]] till now. We cannot return home with the stigma of these crimes attached to our names. Therefore we humbly pray that a full and exhaustive inquiry be made by Imperial officers in order that the truth be elicited and justice done. Also we beg that all witnesses may be kept in camp at Pietersburg till the inquiry is finished. So deeply do we deplore the opprobrium which must be inseparably attached to these crimes that scarcely a man once his time is up can be prevailed to re-enlist in this corps. Trusting for the credit of thinking you will grant the inquiry we seek\".<ref>Leach (2012), page 101.</ref>\n\n===Arrest at Fort Edward===\nDuring his conversation with Handcock and Witton in the prison courtyard, Morant alleges that the [[British Army]] has marked them for death \"ever since they arrested us at Fort Edward\" but their arrests took place elsewhere. After the letter Hall summoned all Fort Edward officers and non-commissioned officers to Pietersburg on 21 October 1901. All were met by a party of [[mounted infantry]] five miles outside Pietersburg on the morning of 23 October 1901 and \"brought into town like criminals\". Morant was arrested after returning from leave in [[Pretoria]], where he had gone to settle the affairs of his deceased friend Captain Hunt.<ref>Leach (2012), pages 97\u201398.</ref>\n\n===Rejection of deals for leniency===\nIn the film, the British military is determined to kill the defendants. According to the Australian historians Margaret Carnegie and Frank Shields, Morant and Handcock rejected an offer of [[immunity from prosecution]] in return for turning [[king's evidence]]. Military prosecutors allegedly hoped to use them as witnesses against BVC Major Robert Lenehan, who was believed to have issued orders to [[take no prisoners]].<ref>Carnegie and Shields (1979), ''In Search of Breaker Morant'', pages 124\u2013125.</ref> Towards the end of the film, Taylor informs Morant that the British Army will never dare to prosecute him, as he really can implicate Kitchener in war crimes. According to the South African historian Andries Pretorius, the trial of Alfred Taylor was almost certainly saved for the last because \"The prosecution must have been hoping\", in vain for the accused officers, \"to implicate Taylor\". Their refusal to do so seems to have ensured that Taylor was not convicted at his trial.<ref>Leach (2012), page 189.</ref>\n\n===Captain Hunt===\nIn the film, Hunt is inaccurately depicted as having an [[Australian accent]]. According to the South African historian Charles Leach, Captain Hunt \"was an Englishman, a former Lieutenant in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts, and a fine horseman\". A surviving photograph of Hunt also reveals that he was far younger than the actor who plays him on screen.<ref>Leach (2012), page 27.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\n[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave ''Breaker Morant'' a 100% \"fresh\" rating, based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 8.45/10.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/breaker_morant/ \"Breaker Morant (1980)\"] on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Retrieved 1 July 2019.</ref>\n\nThe film also stirred debate on the legacy of the trial with its pacifist theme. D. L. Kershen wrote \"''Breaker Morant'' tells the story of the court martial of Harry Morant, Peter Handcock, and George Witton in South Africa in 1902. Yet, its overriding theme is that \"war is evil\". ''Breaker Morant'' is a beautiful antiwar statement \u2014 a plea for the end of the intrigues and crimes that war entails\".<ref>[http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm \"Breaker Morant\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106034741/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/lpop/etext/okla/kershen22.htm |date=6 January 2009 }} ''Oklahoma City University Law Review'' Volume 22, Number 1 (1997).

Another issue, which I find particularly fascinating, concerns the fairness of the hearing. We would ask whether [[due process]] was present, after accounting for the exigencies of the battlefield. Does ''Breaker Morant'' demonstrate what happens when due process is not observed?<ref>[http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~pyle/pla4020/Breaker.html \"Breaker Morant\"] on the [[University of Central Florida]] website Retrieved 24 July 2009</ref>}}\n\nBruce Beresford claimed the film is often misunderstood as the story of men [[kangaroo court|railroaded]] by the British,\n\n{{quote|But that's not what it's about at all.

It's the pressures that are put to bear on people in war time... Look at all the things that happen in these countries committed by people who appear to be quite normal. That was what I was interested in examining. I always get amazed when people say to me that this is a film about poor Australians who were framed by the Brits.<ref name=\"bruce\"/>}}\n\nAfter the success of ''Breaker Morant'', Beresford was offered dozens of Hollywood scripts including ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', which he later directed. The 1983 film earned him his only [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] to date, even though ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' (1989) which he directed, won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]. Beresford said that ''Breaker Morant'' was not that successful commercially,\n\n{{quote|Critically, it was important, which is a key factor, and it has kept being shown over the years.
