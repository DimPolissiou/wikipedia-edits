The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

Data indicated there would be a decreased willingness for attendance of activities in confined spaces, large immobile groups (such as cinemas), or tactile activities; with an increase in interest for activities outdoors or with large spaces (such as zoos and botanic gardens).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.colleendilen.com/2020/03/25/how-is-covid-19-impacting-likelihood-to-attend-different-cultural-entities-data/|title=Post-Pandemic, Which Cultural Entity Types Are People More Likely to Revisit?

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community; maintain the safety of their employees, collections, and the public; while reacting to the unexpected change in their [[business model]] with an unknown end.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world most cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed (or at least with their services radically curtailed) exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative or additional services through digital platforms, to maintain essential activities with minimal resources, to document the events themselves through new acquisitions, and simultaneously an awareness that there would be many new [[creative works]] which had been inspired by the event.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available. Equally, [[financial stimulus]] from governments and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country. The public demand for cultural activities was expected to return, but at an unknown time and with the assumption that different kinds of experiences would be popular.\n\n==Closures==\nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

YIVO Encyclopedia.</ref> It was a typical [[shtetl]], a small town with a majority Jewish community coexistent with its Polish minority and surrounded by majority Polish countryside, one of many such towns in [[Second Polish Republic|prewar Poland]]. The region politically supported the right-wing [[National Democracy|National Democrats]],{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} who sought to counter what they said was Jewish economic competition against Catholic Poles, and opposed the Polish socialist government of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and his successors. Nevertheless, there were good prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town, possibly better than elsewhere in the country. At their most tense, a 1934 rumor that drew a connection between the killing of a Jewish woman and the killing of a Catholic man was quashed by a priest and a rabbi addressing the matter together, before it escalated.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=19}}\n\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by [[National Democracy]]'s far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}}\n\nAccording to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}} \n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

The guidelines for such massacres were formulated by [[Reinhard Heydrich]],{{sfn|Browning|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=d9Wg4gjtP3cC&pg=PA262 262]}} who ordered his officers to induce anti-Jewish incidents in the territories newly occupied by the German forces, including pogroms. \"Hooliganism set the tone\", according to [[Michael C. Steinlauf]].{{sfn|Steinlauf|1997|p=31}}\n\nThree days into the invasion, six Poles (three ethnic Poles and three Jews) who had collaborators with the Soviets were lynched in Jedwabne. Some accounts say they were first beaten or tortured by the locals, then shot by the Germans. The same day, two wives of Jewish activists for the Soviets who had evacuated with the Red Army committed suicide with their children. Other Jews faced robberies and attacks, which the Germans tolerated. Antisemitic violence broke out in pogroms across the newly German-occupied [[Podlasie]] region.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}} In the first days of the occupation of Jedwabne, the Germans set up a Field Gendarmerie (''[[Feldgendarmerie#Operations|Feldgendarmerie]]''), staffed by 8 or 11 military police, according to different testimonies. These established cooperation with a new town council, headed by the brother-in-law of a previous mayor, Marian Karolak. Scholars say it is likely that the Germans consented to the formation of a Polish volunteer [[town guard]]. Some of these may have been resistance fighters during the Soviet occupation who later joined the German auxiliary police, because Polish testimonials refer to them as ''szucman'', from ''[[Schutzmannschaft]]''.{{sfn|Persak|2011}}{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Pogroms===\nPolish villagers participated in massacres of Jews, with varying degrees of German involvement, in 23 localities of the \u0141om\u017ca and Bia\u0142ystok areas of the [[Podlasie]] region after the occupation.

YIVO Encyclopedia.</ref> It was a typical [[shtetl]], a small town with a majority Jewish community coexistent with its Polish minority and surrounded by majority Polish countryside, one of many such towns in [[Second Polish Republic|prewar Poland]]. The region politically supported the right-wing [[National Democracy|National Democrats]],{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=18}} who sought to counter what they said was Jewish economic competition against Catholic Poles, and opposed the Polish socialist government of [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] and his successors. Nevertheless, there were good prewar Polish-Jewish relations in the town, possibly better than elsewhere in the country. At their most tense, a 1934 rumor that drew a connection between the killing of a Jewish woman and the killing of a Catholic man was quashed by a priest and a rabbi addressing the matter together, before it escalated.{{sfn|Gross|2001|p=19}}\n\nResidents of Jedwabne had memory of the nearby [[Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom#Background|Radzi\u0142\u00f3w pogrom]] of 1933, organized by [[National Democracy]]'s far-right faction, the [[Camp of Great Poland]] (OWP). The organization referred to the violence as a \"revolution\" against the Polish state, which it saw as a protector of Jews. One Jew was killed by the pogromists and four pogromists were killed by the Polish police; the OWP was then banned by Poland in 1934 for anti-state and racist activities.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=9}}\n\nAccording to [[Anna Bikont]], archival documents show Poland's government at this time was hostile to the Polish nationalist movement, because of the latter's attacks on Jews as well as its opposition to the Polish state; the government felt responsible for Jews and tried to protect them (arresting violent nationalists) and it perceived Jews as trying to show loyalty to the Polish state.{{sfn|Bikont|2015|p=31}} \n\n===World War II===\nThe start of [[European Theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]] began with the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] on 1 September 1939.

{"title_page": "Constable of the Tower", "text_new": "[[File:Constable Dannatt.jpg|thumb|right|300px|General The Lord Dannatt, dressed in full ceremonial uniform of HM's Constable of The Tower]]\nThe '''Constable of the Tower''' is the most senior appointment at the [[Tower of London]]. In the Middle Ages a [[constable]] was the person in charge of a castle when the owner\u2014the king or a nobleman\u2014was not in residence. The Constable of the Tower had a unique importance as the person in charge of the principal fortress defending the capital city of [[England]].\n\nToday the role of Constable is a ceremonial one and mainly involves taking part in traditional ceremonies within the Tower as well as being part of the community that lives within its perimeter. The Constable is also a trustee of [[Historic Royal Palaces]] and of the [[Royal Armouries]]. \n\nUnder the ''[[Queen's Regulations|Queen's Regulations for the Army]]'', the office of [[Constable]] is conferred upon a [[field marshal]] or a retired [[general]] officer for a five-year term.<ref>''The Queen's Regulations for the Army'' (Ministry of Defence): Chapter 9, Annex B.</ref>   <!-- <ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/linkedfiles/combined_services_sport/queens_regulations_incl_a27.doc The Queen's Regulations for the Army (Ministry of Defence) : ''see annex B to chapter 9''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626113602/http://www.army.mod.uk/linkedfiles/combined_services_sport/queens_regulations_incl_a27.doc |date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> --> The Constable appointed in 2016 is General Sir [[Nick Houghton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lord Houghton of Richmond|url=https://www.hospitalityandcateringnews.com/2016/10/160th-constable-instillation-tower-london/|date=11 October 2016 |\nwebsite=Hospitality and Catering News|accessdate=1 October 2018}}</ref> The Constable's ceremonial deputy is the [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]], currently [[Simon Mayall]];\nthis office is generally entrusted to a general officer of lower rank than the Constable.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Constable's Installation ceremony, the [[Lord Chamberlain]] symbolically hands over the Queen's House to the Constable. He in turn entrusts it to the [[Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House|Resident Governor]], who is responsible for the day-to-day running of Her Majesty's Palace and Fortress, the Tower of London.\n\n== History ==\nThe office of Constable of the Tower is one of the oldest in England, dating back to within a few years of the Conquest, and has always been one of great honour and dignity. In the past, this appointment has been held by eminent prelates of the Church, prominent politicians and distinguished soldiers. The first Constable, [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]] was appointed by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] (AD 1066-87) in the 11th century. Formerly, in the absence of the Sovereign, the Constable would have been among the most powerful men in London. Today the Constable retains the right of direct access to the Sovereign. Since 1784 the Constable has always been a senior military officer.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] the Constable ran the Tower which included building maintenance, soldiers' pay and, as the Royal menagerie was housed in the Tower, supervision of the 'Keeper of the King's Animals'. He was also ultimately responsible for the prisoners kept there. The first known prisoner was the [[Normans|Norman]] [[bishop]] [[Ranulf Flambard]] in 1100, and the London gangsters [[Kray twins|Ronnie and Reggie Kray]] were the last official prisoners, for a few days in 1952, for refusing to do their [[National Service]]. They were sent to the Tower as it was the barracks of the 1st Battalion [[Royal Fusiliers|Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]] to which they had been assigned.\n\nThe Constable's responsibility for prisoners was made clear in the words with which he was entrusted with them: \u201cYou are to guard them securely in the prison of our said tower in such a way that you shall answer for them body for body ... Fail in no part of this on pain of forfeiture of life and limb and all property you hold in our realms.\u201d\n\nUntil the [[Edict of Expulsion|expulsion of the Jews]] in 1290, the Constable was responsible for the regulation and protection of London's [[Jewish population|Jewry]].\n\n==Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets==\nUntil 1899, the Constable also held the office of [[Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets]].\nThe [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets]] was an area of SE [[Middlesex]] that urbanised as inner [[East London]] and included the area of the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|eponymous modern borough]] and most of what is now the [[London Borough of Hackney]]. \n\nThis was an unusual arrangement as [[Lord Lieutenant|Lord Lieutenancy]] powers were usually exercised at county level; they enabled the Constable to raise local forces to supplement the [[Tower of London|Tower]] garrison at times of increased tension, or for use in the field.\n\n== Constable's dues ==\nIn the Middle Ages it was a profitable position; among the Constable's entitlements were:\n* any horses, oxen, pigs or sheep that fell off London Bridge\n* any cart that fell into the Tower moat\n* all herbage growing on Tower Hill\n* 6/8d (six [[shillings]] and eight [[pence]]) annually from each boat fishing between the Tower and the sea\n* 1s (1 shilling) a year from all ships carrying [[herring]] to London\n* 2d (2 pence) from each pilgrim who came to London, by sea, to worship at the shrine of St James\n* all swans swimming under London Bridge.\n\nEvery ship that came upstream to London had to moor at Tower Wharf to give a portion of its cargo to the Constable, as payment for the protection afforded by the Tower's cannon. These dues included oysters, mussels, cockles, rushes, and wine. The tradition is still maintained today by the [[Royal Navy]], at the annual Ceremony of the Constable's Dues, when one large vessel presents the Constable with a barrel of rum.<ref>[http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Constables%27s%20Dues.pdf Ceremony of the Constable's Dues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221043405/http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Constables's%20Dues.pdf |date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1784 the tradition has been for the Constable to be a senior military officer, usually a general officer. Perhaps the most famous Constable was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], who served from 1825 to 1852. During his tenure, the royal menagerie and record office were removed and many buildings were restored to their medieval state. The moat was drained and converted into a parade ground. [[Yeomen Warders]] were no longer permitted to buy and sell their places but were to be drawn only from [[sergeant]]s in the Army. To His Grace's displeasure, tourism at the Tower increased during his Constableship.\n\nEach Constable is now appointed for five years. The new Constable is handed the keys as a symbol of office. On state occasions the Constable has custody of the crown and other royal jewels.\n\n== List of Constables ==\nThis is an incomplete list of people who have served as '''Constable of the Tower of London''', a post traditionally combined with that of '''[[Lord Lieutenant]] of the [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets]]'''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In the Middle Ages a [[constable]] was the person in charge of a castle when the owner\u2014the king or a nobleman\u2014was not in residence. The Constable of the Tower had a unique importance as the person in charge of the principal fortress defending the capital city of [[England]].\n\nToday the role of Constable is a ceremonial one and mainly involves taking part in traditional ceremonies within the Tower as well as being part of the community that lives within its perimeter. The Constable is also a trustee of [[Historic Royal Palaces]] and of the [[Royal Armouries]]. \n\nUnder the ''[[Queen's Regulations|Queen's Regulations for the Army]]'', the office of [[Constable]] is conferred upon a [[field marshal]] or a retired [[general]] officer for a five-year term.<ref>''The Queen's Regulations for the Army'' (Ministry of Defence): Chapter 9, Annex B.</ref>   <!-- <ref>[http://www.army.mod.uk/linkedfiles/combined_services_sport/queens_regulations_incl_a27.doc The Queen's Regulations for the Army (Ministry of Defence) : ''see annex B to chapter 9''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626113602/http://www.army.mod.uk/linkedfiles/combined_services_sport/queens_regulations_incl_a27.doc |date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> --> The Constable appointed in 2016 is General Sir [[Nick Houghton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lord Houghton of Richmond|url=https://www.hospitalityandcateringnews.com/2016/10/160th-constable-instillation-tower-london/|date=11 October 2016 |\nwebsite=Hospitality and Catering News|accessdate=1 October 2018}}</ref> The Constable's ceremonial deputy is the [[Lieutenant of the Tower of London]], currently [[Simon Mayall]];\nthis office is generally entrusted to a general officer of lower rank than the Constable.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Constable's Installation ceremony, the [[Lord Chamberlain]] symbolically hands over the Queen\u2019s House to the Constable. He in turn entrusts it to the [[Resident Governor of the Tower of London and Keeper of the Jewel House|Resident Governor]], who is responsible for the day-to-day running of Her Majesty\u2019s Palace and Fortress, the Tower of London.\n\n== History ==\nThe office of Constable of the Tower is one of the oldest in England, dating back to within a few years of the Conquest, and has always been one of great honour and dignity. In the past, this appointment has been held by eminent prelates of the Church, prominent politicians and distinguished soldiers. The first Constable, [[Geoffrey de Mandeville (11th century)|Geoffrey de Mandeville]] was appointed by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] (AD 1066-87) in the 11th century. Formerly, in the absence of the Sovereign, the Constable would have been among the most powerful men in London. Today the Constable retains the right of direct access to the Sovereign. Since 1784 the Constable has always been a senior military officer.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] the Constable ran the Tower which included building maintenance, soldiers' pay and, as the Royal menagerie was housed in the Tower, supervision of the 'Keeper of the King\u2019s Animals'. He was also ultimately responsible for the prisoners kept there. The first known prisoner was the [[Normans|Norman]] [[bishop]] [[Ranulf Flambard]] in 1100, and the London gangsters [[Kray twins|Ronnie and Reggie Kray]] were the last official prisoners, for a few days in 1952, for refusing to do their [[National Service]]. They were sent to the Tower as it was the barracks of the 1st Battalion [[Royal Fusiliers|Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]] to which they had been assigned.\n\nThe Constable\u2019s responsibility for prisoners was made clear in the words with which he was entrusted with them: \u201cYou are to guard them securely in the prison of our said tower in such a way that you shall answer for them body for body ... Fail in no part of this on pain of forfeiture of life and limb and all property you hold in our realms.\u201d\n\nUntil the [[Edict of Expulsion|expulsion of the Jews]] in 1290, the Constable was responsible for the regulation and protection of London's [[Jewish population|Jewry]].\n\n==Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets==\nUntil 1899, the Constable also held the office of [[Lord Lieutenant of the Tower Hamlets]].\nThe [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets]] was an area of SE [[Middlesex]] that urbanised as inner [[East London]] and included the area of the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|eponymous modern borough]] and most of what is now the [[London Borough of Hackney]]. \n\nThis was an unusual arrangement as [[Lord Lieutenant|Lord Lieutenancy]] powers were usually exercised at county level; they enabled the Constable to raise local forces to supplement the [[Tower of London|Tower]] garrison at times of increased tension, or for use in the field.\n\n== Constable's dues ==\nIn the Middle Ages it was a profitable position; among the Constable\u2019s entitlements were:\n* any horses, oxen, pigs or sheep that fell off London Bridge\n* any cart that fell into the Tower moat\n* all herbage growing on Tower Hill\n* 6/8d (six [[shillings]] and eight [[pence]]) annually from each boat fishing between the Tower and the sea\n* 1s (1 shilling) a year from all ships carrying [[herring]] to London\n* 2d (2 pence) from each pilgrim who came to London, by sea, to worship at the shrine of St James\n* all swans swimming under London Bridge.\n\nEvery ship that came upstream to London had to moor at Tower Wharf to give a portion of its cargo to the Constable, as payment for the protection afforded by the Tower's cannon. These dues included oysters, mussels, cockles, rushes, and wine. The tradition is still maintained today by the [[Royal Navy]], at the annual Ceremony of the Constable's Dues, when one large vessel presents the Constable with a barrel of rum.<ref>[http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Constables%27s%20Dues.pdf Ceremony of the Constable's Dues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221043405/http://www.hrp.org.uk/Resources/Constables's%20Dues.pdf |date=2007-12-21 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1784 the tradition has been for the Constable to be a senior military officer, usually a general officer. Perhaps the most famous Constable was [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], who served from 1825 to 1852. During his tenure, the royal menagerie and record office were removed and many buildings were restored to their medieval state. The moat was drained and converted into a parade ground. [[Yeomen Warders]] were no longer permitted to buy and sell their places but were to be drawn only from [[sergeant]]s in the Army. To His Grace's displeasure, tourism at the Tower increased during his Constableship.\n\nEach Constable is now appointed for five years. The new Constable is handed the keys as a symbol of office. On state occasions the Constable has custody of the crown and other royal jewels.\n\n== List of Constables ==\nThis is an incomplete list of people who have served as '''Constable of the Tower of London''', a post traditionally combined with that of '''[[Lord Lieutenant]] of the [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets]]'''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
