Air Max shoes are identified by their midsoles incorporating flexible urethane pouches filled with pressurized gas, visible from the exterior of the shoe and intended to provide cushioning underfoot. Air Max was conceptualized by [[Tinker Hatfield]], who initially worked for Nike designing stores<ref>{{cite news|last=Reidy|first=Tess|title=Nike's iconic Air Max trainer celebrates 25th anniversary with Tinker Hatfield|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/dec/14/nike-air-max-trainer-25-anniversary-tinker-hatfield|accessdate=December 23, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian (UK)|date=December 14, 2013}}</ref>, with the underlying technology being created and patented by [[M. Frank Rudy]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[Image:AirmaxBWJPG.jpg|thumb|The Air Max IV/Air Max 91; contemporarily known as the Air Max BW (Big Window)]]\nAs the name indicates, all Air Max shoes feature one or more translucent pouches of pressurized gas embedded in the midsole and visible from the outside of the shoe. Referred to as \"Air units\" or \"airbags,\" their stated purpose is to provide superior cushioning to traditional foam while also reducing weight. The effectiveness of the technology for this purpose is disputed; nevertheless, the shoes enjoy consistent popularity, especially among sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. \n\nThe size, design, and number of air units varies within the product line; the \"retro\" Air Max 1 simply includes one small unit under the heel, while in the contemporary Air VaporMax, effectively the entire midsole is composed of air units with no conventional foam present. \n\n==Culture and fashion==\n[[File:First air classic.jpg|Air Max IV/BW in its original \"Persian Violet\" colorway|thumb]]\nThe line of sneakers is popular amongst many subcultures, for example [[hip hop]] and [[gabber]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the mid-1990s the line, especially the Air Max 95 model, experienced such a surge of popularity in Japan that it led to a phenomenon known as \"Air Max hunting\". The extremely inflated prices of the shoes led to a rash of muggings in the normally-peaceful country wherein Air Max wearers were attacked and their shoes were stolen. Even used shoes were in demand, and fakes also became a serious problem.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lev|first=Michael A.|title=`Air Max Hunting' Shocks Japan -- Holdups, Beatings Blamed On Mania For Used Sneakers|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=November 17, 1996|access-date=July 4, 2015|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961117&slug=2360191}}</ref>\n\n==Air Max 1==\nReleased in 1987 as simply the Air Max, the Air Max 1 was the first shoe ever to employ Max Air technology. It was marketed for running, which would continue to be the case for new Air Max designs until 2018's Air Max 270. Its upper was composed of nylon and synthetic felt, with a leather version being released in 1988. The Air Max 1 continues to enjoy significant popularity with sneaker enthusiasts, with Nike releasing \"retro\" models employing both original and pre-existing exterior designs (\"colorways\") on a regular basis.\n\n==Air Max Light==\nReleased in 1989 as the Air Max II, the Air Max Light weighed less than the original, achieved by replacing the forefoot polyurethane midsole with one made of EVA foam. Re-released in 2007, Nike has continued to release additional colorways.\n\n==Air Max 90==\n[[File:Air max 90.JPG|thumb|Air Max 5 CL]]\n[[File:Leather Air max 90.JPG|thumb|left|Leather Air Max 90s]]\nKnown as the Air Max III until 2000, when it was reissued taking its name from the year of its launch. The original colourway of white/black/cool grey with infrared was chosen to exaggerate the thickness of the sole air cushion. The upper featured Duromesh, synthetic felt and synthetic leather.  Nike specially designed a pair of Nike Air Max 90s for President [[George H.W. Bush]].

Air Max shoes are identified by their midsoles incorporating flexible urethane pouches filled with pressurized gas, visible from the exterior of the shoe and intended to provide cushioning underfoot. Air Max was conceptualized by [[Tinker Hatfield]], who initially worked for Nike designing stores<ref>{{cite news|last=Reidy|first=Tess|title=Nike's iconic Air Max trainer celebrates 25th anniversary with Tinker Hatfield|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/dec/14/nike-air-max-trainer-25-anniversary-tinker-hatfield|accessdate=December 23, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian (UK)|date=December 14, 2013}}</ref>, with the underlying technology being created and patented by [[M. Frank Rudy]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[Image:AirmaxBWJPG.jpg|thumb|The Air Max IV/Air Max 91; contemporarily known as the Air Max BW (Big Window)]]\nAs the name indicates, all Air Max shoes feature one or more translucent pouches of pressurized gas embedded in the midsole and visible from the outside of the shoe. Referred to as \"Air units\" or \"airbags,\" their stated purpose is to provide superior cushioning to traditional foam while also reducing weight. The effectiveness of the technology for this purpose is disputed; nevertheless, the shoes enjoy consistent popularity, especially among sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. \n\nThe size, design, and number of air units varies within the product line; the \"retro\" Air Max 1 simply includes one small unit under the heel, while in the contemporary Air VaporMax, effectively the entire midsole is composed of air units with no conventional foam present. \n\n==Culture and fashion==\n[[File:First air classic.jpg|Air Max IV/BW in its original \"Persian Violet\" colorway|thumb]]\nThe line of sneakers is popular amongst many subcultures, for example [[hip hop]] and [[gabber]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn the mid-1990s the line, especially the Air Max 95 model, experienced such a surge of popularity in Japan that it led to a phenomenon known as \"Air Max hunting\". The extremely inflated prices of the shoes led to a rash of muggings in the normally-peaceful country wherein Air Max wearers were attacked and their shoes were stolen. Even used shoes were in demand, and fakes also became a serious problem.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lev|first=Michael A.|title=`Air Max Hunting' Shocks Japan -- Holdups, Beatings Blamed On Mania For Used Sneakers|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=November 17, 1996|access-date=July 4, 2015|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961117&slug=2360191}}</ref>\n\n==Air Max 1==\nReleased in 1987 as simply the Air Max, the Air Max 1 was the first shoe ever to employ Max Air technology. It was marketed for running, which would continue to be the case for new Air Max designs until 2018's Air Max 270. Its upper was composed of nylon and synthetic felt, with a leather version being released in 1988. The Air Max 1 continues to enjoy significant popularity with sneaker enthusiasts, with Nike releasing \"retro\" models employing both original and pre-existing exterior designs (\"colorways\") on a regular basis.\n\n==Air Max Light==\nReleased in 1989 as the Air Max II, the Air Max Light weighed less than the original, achieved by replacing the forefoot polyurethane midsole with one made of EVA foam. Re-released in 2007, Nike has continued to release additional colorways.\n\n==Air Max 90==\n[[File:Air max 90.JPG|thumb|Air Max 5 CL]]\n[[File:Leather Air max 90.JPG|thumb|left|Leather Air Max 90s]]\nKnown as the Air Max III until 2000, when it was reissued taking its name from the year of its launch. The original colourway of white/black/cool grey with infrared was chosen to exaggerate the thickness of the sole air cushion. The upper featured Duromesh, synthetic felt and synthetic leather.  Nike specially designed a pair of Nike Air Max 90s for President [[George H.W. Bush]].
