The single reached No. 11 in Australia, but only 68 in the UK due to distribution problems. It was clear at this point that the hit single career was beginning to wane. A second single from the ''Rock Hard'' album, titled \"Lipstick\", was released in February 1981, but radio refused to play it as they claimed it sounded too much like ''[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]'' by [[Them (band)|Them]]. ''Suzi Quatro's Greatest Hits'', which was released in 1980, peaked at No. 4 in the UK charts, becoming her highest-charting album there.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===Independence===\n\nAfter Chapman's Dreamland Records folded 1981, Quatro was left without a record label.<ref>{{Discogs label|label=Dreamland Records, Inc.|name=Chapman's Dreamland Records}}</ref>\n\nHer last UK hit for some time was \"[[Heart of Stone (Suzi Quatro song)|Heart of Stone]]\" in late 1982. In 1983 another single \"Main Attraction\" was released. It failed to chart, but did become a moderate airplay hit.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> She commented in an article for ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in 1983, after playing a successful show at [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]] on August 27, that she did not care about being in the charts, but was more interested releasing what she wanted to; commenting that she started in 1964, and did not become famous for nine years \"I would never accept having my career moulded by other people&nbsp;... I've kept working consistently even though I've not been in the charts.\" Around this time, Quatro recorded a new album that was shelved until 1997, when it was released under ''Unreleased Emotion'' Quatro briefly returned to recording for two more singles \"I Go Wild\" in 1984 and in 1985, her \"[[Tonight I Could Fall in Love]]\"/\"Good Girl (Looking for a Bad Time)\" single reached No. 140 in the UK charts.<ref name=timeline>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/guntaandressen9/sq-timeline.html\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120203454/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/guntaandressen9/sq-timeline.html\n|archivedate=January 20, 2008\n|title=Suzi Quatro Timeline, Gunta Anderson, via Wayback\n|date= January 20, 2008\n|accessdate= February 25, 2012\n}}</ref> Quatro also collaborated with [[Bronski Beat]] and members of [[the Kinks]], [[Eddie and the Hot Rods]] and [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] on the Mark Cunningham-produced cover version of [[David Bowie]]'s \"[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]\", released the following year as the 1986 [[BBC]] ''[[Children in Need]]'' single. Quatro also released a cover version of \"[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]\" in November 1986, as a duet with [[The Troggs]] singer [[Reg Presley]]. \"Can the Can\"/\"Devil Gate Drive\" were re-released in 1987 as a single and reached number 87 in the UK charts.<ref name=timeline /> She was also part of the [[Ferry Aid]] charity single \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", which was a UK No. 1, 13 years and 26 days after Quatro's last UK No. 1. \n\nIn 1989, Quatro released a prerecorded backing track single \"Baby You're a Star\", which was released in the UK, though it failed to chart. By the late 80's, it was clear that Quatro's hitmaking days were over, though she still recorded persistently despite lack of chart success. During the 1990s, Quatro released four new albums, though ''Unreleased Emotion'' had been recorded several years previously. ''[[What Goes Around \u2013 Greatest & Latest]]'' was released in 1995 and consisted of mainly older hits rerecorded; this proved a success in Denmark. Except for 1999's ''[[Free the Butterfly]]'' [[self-help]] album, it would take a further 11 years for Quatro to release a new album. ''[[Back to the Drive]]'' in 2006 showed a return to Quatro's harder rock roots, rather than the smoother sounds of her previous albums. ''Back to the Drive'' also returned Quatro to the worldwide charts - her first album to do so since 1980's ''Rock Hard''. ''Back to the Drive'' also produced a download only single \"I'll Walk Through the Fire with You\". Quatro released ''[[In the Spotlight]]'' in 2011 with the lead single, \"Whatever Love Is\".

She's never had their best material (they don't play many games with her) and each of her singles has been less gripping than the one before. Unless they suddenly imagine a new joke, she's in danger of petering out and she lacks the resources to fight back. None of her own musical talents has been needed and so they've been ignored (except on the throwaway B-sides) and while Sweet and Mud have their histories and themselves to draw on for support, Suzi's present has nothing to do with her past and her group was formed only to play Chinnichap music. Mud may become a top cabaret act and Sweet a respected rock group, but Suzi will only be a memory. Mickie Most's skill in the '60s was to make pop music out of British blues and R&B and folk; Chinn and Chapman's skill in the '70s has been to make pop music out of an audience.

The single reached No. 11 in Australia, but only 68 in the UK due to distribution problems. It was clear at this point that the hit single career was beginning to wane. A second single from the ''Rock Hard'' album, titled \"Lipstick\", was released in February 1981, but radio refused to play it as they claimed it sounded too much like ''[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]'' by [[Them (band)|Them]].

By the late 80's, it was clear that Quatro's hitmaking days were over, though she still recorded persistently despite lack of chart success. During the 1990s, Quatro released four new albums, though ''Unreleased Emotion'' had been recorded several years previously. ''[[What Goes Around \u2013 Greatest & Latest]]'' was released in 1995 and consisted of mainly older hits rerecorded; this proved a success in Denmark. Except for 1999's ''[[Free the Butterfly]]'' [[self-help]] album, it would take a further 11 years for Quatro to release a new album. ''[[Back to the Drive]]'' in 2006 showed a return to Quatro's harder rock roots, rather than the smoother sounds of her previous albums.

As this audience ages and changes, so will its music and Suzi Quatro will have been just an affectionate part of growing up.<ref name=\"PhonographFrith1974\" />}}\n\nIn 1983, journalist [[Tom Hibbert]] wrote that Quatro may have overstated her role as a leading light among female rock musicians. He said that {{quote|...&nbsp;it was in the wake of the 1977 punk revolution that the traditions of rock were turned upside down and female musicians truly came to the fore. But Suzi Quatro, with her tomboy sneers, her bass guitar and her stompingly persuasive teen-tunes, had at least laid down a challenge to the male-dominated rock orthodoxy. On stage in the Eighties, Quatro was still conveying energy and excitement{{snd}} and she still lacked class.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of Rock: Oh, Suzi Q!! |year=1983 |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/oh-suzi-q |first=Tom |last=Hibbert}} {{subscription required}}</ref>}}\n\n===Views of scholars===\nIn his 2008 paper ''Suzi Quatro: A prototype in the archsheology {{sic}} of rock'', Frank Oglesbee writes that \"The rebellion of rock music was largely a male rebellion; the women\u2014often, in the 1950s and '60s, girls in their teens\u2014in rock usually sang songs as person\u00e6 utterly dependent on their macho boyfriends\". He describes Quatro as \"a female rock pioneer, in some ways ''the'' female rock pioneer ... a cornerstone in the archsheology of rock.\" He said she grew up to become \"the first female lead singer and bassist, an electric ax-woman, who sang and played as freely as the males, inspiring other females.\"<ref name=\"archsheology\">\n{{cite journal\n | last = Oglesbee\n | first = Frank W.\n | date = July 24, 2008\n | title = Suzi Quatro: A prototype in the archsheology of rock\n |journal= Popular Music and Society\n | volume = 23\n | issue = 2\n | page = 29\n | doi = 10.1080/03007769908591731\n }}</ref>\n\nPhilip Auslander says that \"Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a traditionally feminine position in popular music\".

It is best known for the 1963 hit version by [[the Kingsmen]] and has become a [[Standard (music)|standard]] in [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]]. The song is based on the tune \"El Loco Cha Cha\" popularized by bandleader [[Ren\u00e9 Touzet]] and is an example of Latin influence on American popular music.\n\n\"Louie Louie\" tells, in simple [[verse\u2013chorus form]], the first-person story of a Jamaican sailor returning to the island to see his lover.\n\n\"Louie Louie\" has been recognized by organizations and publications worldwide for its influence on the history of rock and roll. A partial list (see \"Recognition and rankings\" table below) includes the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]], [[National Public Radio]], [[VH1]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Magazine, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and the [[RIAA|Recording Industry Association of America]].  Other major examples of the song's legacy include the celebration of [[International Louie Louie Day]] every year on April 11; the annual Louie Louie Parade in [[Philadelphia]] from 1985 to 1989; the [[LouieFest]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] from 2003 to 2012; the ongoing annual Louie Louie Street Party in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; and the unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to make it the state song of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\nThe Kingsmen's recording was the subject of an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation about the supposed, but nonexistent, [[Mondegreen#Examples|obscenity of the lyrics]], an investigation that ended without prosecution.<ref name=\"TSG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/funny/lascivious-louie-louie|title=The Lascivious 'Louie Louie'|website=[[The Smoking Gun]]|accessdate=February 18, 2009}}</ref> The nearly unintelligible (and innocuous) lyrics were widely misinterpreted, and the song was banned by radio stations as well as being investigated by the FBI.\n\n[[Dave Marsh]], in his book ''The History and Mythology of the World's Most Famous Rock 'n' Roll Song'' wrote, \"It is the best of songs, it is the worst of songs\"{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=3}} and rock historian Peter Blecha notes, \"Far from shuffling off to a quiet retirement, evidence indicates that 'Louie Louie' may actually prove to be immortal.\"<ref name=\"Blecha 2007\"/>\n\n==Original version by Richard Berry==\n[[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]] was inspired to write the song in 1955 after listening to an R&B interpretation of \"El Loco Cha Cha\" performed by the Latin R&B group Ricky Rillera and the Rhythm Rockers.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|pp=13, 31}} The tune was written originally as \"Amarren Al Loco\" (\"Tie Up the Madman\") by Cuban bandleader Rosendo Ruiz Jr., also known as Rosendo Ruiz Quevedo, but became best known in the \"El Loco Cha Cha\" arrangement by [[Ren\u00e9 Touzet]] which included a rhythmic ten-note \"1-2-3 1\u20132 1-2-3 1\u20132\" pattern.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=31}}\n\n[[File:Louie Louie rhythm.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|\"Louie Louie\" 10-note riff]] Touzet performed the tune regularly in Los Angeles clubs in the 1950s. In Berry's mind, the words \"Louie Louie\" superimposed themselves over the repeating [[bassline]]. Lyrically, the [[first-person narrative|first person]] perspective of the song was influenced by \"[[One for My Baby (And One More for the Road)]],\" which is sung from the perspective of a customer talking to a bartender (\"Louie\" was the name of Berry's bartender).{{sfn|Marsh|1993|pp=31\u201333}} Berry cited [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[After School Session|Havana Moon]]\" and his exposure to [[Latin American music]] for the song's speech pattern and references to [[Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes | year = 1989 | title = The Best of Louie Louie | type = Album liner notes | others = Various artists | location = | publisher = [[Rhino Records]] | OCLC = | id = R1 70605 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\nLos Angeles-based [[Flip Records (1950s)|Flip Records]] issued Berry's adaptation with his [[Backup band|backing band]] the Pharaohs in April 1957 as a single B-side of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\". The single was a regional hit on the west coast, particularly in San Francisco. When the group toured the Pacific Northwest, local R&B bands began to play the song, increasing its popularity. The song was then re-released as an A-side single. However, the single never appeared on the various [[Billboard R&B charts|''Billboard'' R&B charts]] nor broader [[Hot 100]]. Berry's label reported that the single had sold 40,000 copies. After a series of unsuccessful follow-ups, Berry sold his portion of publishing and songwriting rights for $750 to the head of Flip Records in 1959.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=45}}\n\nWhile the title of the song is often rendered with a comma (\"Louie, Louie\"), in 1988, Berry told ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine that the correct title of the song was \"Louie Louie\" with no comma.<ref name=Esquire>{{Cite magazine |title=The Man Who Wrote 'Louie Louie' |last=Greene |first=Bob |authorlink= Bob Greene |magazine = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=September 1988 |issue=110 |pages=63\u201367}}</ref>\n\nAlthough similar to the original, the version on [[Rhino Records|Rhino]]'s 1983 ''The Best of Louie, Louie'' compilation<ref name=bestOf1>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-best-of-louie-louie-vol-1-mw0000652173 |title=Vaious artists: ''The Best of Louie Louie, Vol. 1'' - Review |last=Hamilton |first=Andrew |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=September 21, 2013}}</ref> is actually a note-for-note re-recording created because licensing could not be obtained for Berry's 1957 version.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=41}} The original version was not legitimately re-released until the [[Ace Records (UK)|Ace Records]] ''Love That Louie'' compilation in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|title=Love That Louie - The Louie Louie Files (CD)|publisher=Bear Family Records|url=https://www.bear-family.com/various-love-that-louie-the-louie-louie-files-cd.html|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n==Cover versions==\n\nBy some accounts \"Louie Louie\" is the world's most recorded rock song with estimates ranging from over 1,600<ref name=\"Blecha 2007\">{{cite news |last=Blecha |first=Peter |title=Garage Rock Anthem \"Louie Louie\" Turns 50 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/garage-rock-anthem-louie-louie-turns-50/ |accessdate=July 21, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=April 1, 2007}}</ref> to more than 2,000.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eric|last=Predoehl|publisher=louielouie.net|location=Santa Cruz, CA|url=http://www.louielouie.net/blog/?p=483  |title=Little Bill & the Bluenotes (2008) \u2013 LOUIE of the Week  |date=November 10, 2008  |accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref> The current [[Louie Louie discography]] lists approximately 3,000 versions.\n{{Main|Louie Louie discography}}\n===1960s===\n====Rockin' Robin Roberts====\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Louie Louie\n| cover      = Etiquette_ET-1_Label.jpeg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Rockin' Robin Roberts]]\n| B-side     = Maryanne\n| released   = {{Start date|1961}}\n| format     = [[45 rpm record]]\n| recorded   = 1960\n| studio     =\n| genre      =\n*[[Rhythm and blues]]\n*[[rock and roll]]\n| length     = {{Duration|m=2|s=40}}\n| label      = Etiquette\n| writer     = [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]\n| producer   =\n}}\n[[Rockin' Robin Roberts|Robin Roberts]] developed an interest in rock 'n' roll and [[rhythm and blues]] records as a high school student in [[Tacoma, Washington]].

The Kingsmen recorded the song at Northwestern, Inc., Motion Pictures and Recording in Portland. The session cost $50, and the band split the cost.{{sfn|Blecha|2009|p=138}}<ref>On September 5, 2013, the city of Portland dedicated a plaque at the site, 411 SW 13th Avenue, to commemorate the event. {{cite web |last=Cheesman |first=Shannon |title=Everybody sing!

The engineer for the session was the studio owner, Robert Lindahl. The Kingsmen's lead vocalist, [[Jack Ely]], based his version on the recording by Rockin' Robin Roberts with the Fabulous Wailers, unintentionally introducing a change in the rhythm as he showed the other members how to play it with a 1\u20132\u20133, 1\u20132, 1\u20132\u20133 beat instead of the 1\u20132\u20133\u20134, 1\u20132, 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 beat on the Wailers record.{{sfn|Marsh|1999|p=15}} The night before their recording session, the band played a 90-minute version of the song during a gig at a local teen club. The Kingsmen's studio version was recorded in one take. They also recorded the B-side of the release, an original instrumental by the group called \"Haunted Castle\".\n\nA significant error on the Kingsmen version occurs just after the lead guitar break. As the group was going by the Wailers version, which has a brief restatement of the riff twice over before the lead vocalist comes back in, it would be expected that Ely would do the same. Ely, however, overshot his mark, coming in too soon, before the restatement of the riff. He realized his mistake and stopped the verse short, but the band did not realize that he had done so. As a quick fix, drummer Lynn Easton covered the pause with a [[Fill (music)|drum fill]], but before the verse ended, the rest of the band went into the chorus at the point where they expected it to be. This error is now so embedded in the consciousness of some groups that they deliberately duplicate it when performing the song.\n\nThe Kingsmen transformed Berry's easy-going ballad into a raucous romp, complete with a twangy guitar, occasional background chatter, and nearly unintelligible lyrics by Ely.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=97}}  Ely had to stand on tiptoe to sing into a boom mike, and his braces further impeded his singing. A guitar break is triggered by the shout, \"Okay, let's give it to 'em right now!\", which first appeared in the Wailers version,{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=67}} as did the entire guitar break (although, in the Wailers version, a few notes differ, and the entire band played the break). Critic [[Dave Marsh]] suggests it is this moment that gives the recording greatness: \"[Ely] went for it so avidly you'd have thought he'd spotted the jugular of a lifelong enemy, so crudely that, at that instant, Ely sounds like Donald Duck on helium. And it's that faintly ridiculous air that makes the Kingsmen's record the classic that it is, especially since it's followed by a guitar solo that's just as wacky.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1999|p=14}} Marsh ranks the song as number eleven out of the 1001 greatest singles ever made.\n\nFirst released in May 1963, the single was initially issued by the small [[Jerden Records|Jerden]] label, before being picked up by the larger [[Wand Records]] and released by them in October 1963. It entered the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for December 7, and peaked at number two the following week, a spot which it held for six non-consecutive weeks; it would remain in the top 10 through December and January before dropping off in early February.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Whitburn, Joel | title = Joel Whitburn Presents Billboard Top 10 Singles Charts | year = 2001 | location = Menomonee, Wisconsin | publisher = Record Research, Inc. | pages = 69\u201372 | isbn = 0-89820-146-2 | authorlink = Joel Whitburn}}</ref> In total, the Kingsmen's version spent 16 weeks on the Hot 100.

Things changed when Boston's biggest DJ, [[Arnie Ginsburg]], was given the record by a pitchman. Amused by its slapdash sound, he played it on his program as \"The Worst Record of the Week\". Despite the slam, listener response was swift and positive.\n\nBy the end of October, it was listed in Billboard as a regional breakout and a \"bubbling under\" entry for the national chart. Meanwhile, the Raiders version, with far stronger promotion, was becoming a hit in California and was also listed as \"bubbling under\" one week after the Kingsmen debuted on the chart. For a few weeks, the two singles appeared destined to battle each other, but demand for the Kingsmen single acquired momentum and, by the end of 1963, [[Columbia Records]] had stopped promoting the Raiders version, as ordered by [[Mitch Miller]].\n\nBy the time the Kingsmen version had achieved national popularity, the band had split. Two rival editions\u2014one featuring lead singer Jack Ely, the other with Lynn Easton who held the rights to the band's name\u2014were competing for live audiences across the country. A settlement was reached later in 1964 giving Easton the right to the Kingsmen name but requiring all future pressings of the original version of \"Louie Louie\" to display \"Lead vocal by Jack Ely\" on the label.\n\nOn November 9, 1998, after a protracted lawsuit that lasted five years and cost $1.3 million, the Kingsmen were awarded ownership of all their recordings released on [[Wand Records]] from [[Gusto Records]], including \"Louie Louie\". They had not been paid royalties on the songs since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Kingsmen reign - High court grants royalties, tapes of 'Louie'|url=https://variety.com/1998/music/news/kingsmen-reign-1117488295/|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 9, 1998|first=Christopher|last=Stern}}</ref><ref>[http://www.louielouie.org/modules.php?name=Lawsuit_Info Lawsuit info at Louielouie.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312073206/http://www.louielouie.org/modules.php?name=Lawsuit_Info |date=March 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Jack Ely died on April 28, 2015, his son reported that \"my father would say, 'We were initially just going to record the song as an instrumental, and at the last minute I decided I'd sing it.{{'\"}} When it came time to do that, however, Ely discovered the sound engineer had raised the studio's only microphone several feet above his head. Then he placed Ely in the middle of his fellow musicians, all in an effort to create a better \"live feel\" for the recording. The result, Ely would say over the years, was that he had to stand on his toes, lean his head back and shout as loudly as he could just to be heard over the drums and guitars.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dubois |first1=Steven |last2=Rogers |first2=John |title='Louie Louie' Singer Jack Ely Dies in Oregon at 71 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/28/louie-louie-jack-ely-dies_n_7165492.html |website=[[Huffington Post]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |date=April 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Paul Revere & the Raiders====\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Louie Louie\n| cover      = Raiders Sande 45.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]]\n| album      = Here They Come!\n| B-side     = Night Train\n| released   = {{Start date|1963|06}}\n| format     = [[45 rpm record]]\n| recorded   = April 1963\n| studio     = \n| genre      =\n| length     = {{Duration|m=2|s=38}}\n| label      = Sand\u0113\n| writer     = [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]\n| producer   = Roger Hart\n| prev_title = So Fine\n| prev_year  = 1963\n| next_title = [[Louie, Louie Go Home|Louie Go Home]]\n| next_year  = 1963\n}}\n[[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] also recorded a version of \"Louie Louie\", probably on April 13, 1963, in the same Portland studio as the Kingsmen.<ref>Blecha p. 139</ref><ref>Following the death of Kingsmen singer Jack Ely, Mark Lindsay tweeted on April 28, 2015, \"To settle it once and for all: Jack Ely/The Kingsmen recorded Louie Louie 3 days BEFORE the Raiders.\"</ref>  The recording was paid for and produced by [[KISN (Portland)|KISN]] radio personality Roger Hart, who soon became personal manager for the band. Released on Hart's Sand\u0113 label, their version was more successful locally. [[Columbia Records]] issued the single nationally in June 1963 and it went to #1 in the West and Hawaii. The quick success of \"Louie Louie\" suddenly halted, however, and a few years later Paul Revere & the Raiders learned the reason\u2014Columbia A&R man [[Mitch Miller]], a former bandleader (''[[Sing Along With Mitch]]'') who hated rock and roll, had pulled the plug on their version.\n\nRobert Lindahl, president and chief engineer of NWI and sound engineer on both the Kingsmen and Raiders recordings, noted that the Raiders version was not known for \"garbled lyrics\" or an amateurish recording technique. But despite these attributes, the single never seized the public's attention the way the less-polished Kingsmen version did.\n\nThe Raiders version also contains a scarcely audible \"dirty lyric\" when Mark Lindsay says, \"Do she fuck?

It enjoyed a comeback in 1978\u20131979 and was associated with [[fraternities and sororities|college fraternity]] parties when it was sung, complete with the supposedly obscene lyrics, by Bluto ([[John Belushi]]) and his fellow Delta House brothers in the movie ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' despite the anachronism of the film taking place in 1962, a year before the Kingsmen recording (although this is mitigated by the fact that the Deltas were fans of at least one black R&B musician, and 1962 was five years ''after'' Richard Berry released his original version of the song, plus the song had been popular with local bands in the Northwest following [[Rockin' Robin Roberts]]' 1961 single). Aside from the ''Animal House'' appearance, the song appeared in many other films, typically in raucous and humorous contexts.\n\nSome bands have taken liberties with the lyrics, including attempts to record the supposed \"obscene lyrics\", notably  [[the Stooges]], whose version can be heard on their live album ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' [[Iggy Pop]] later recorded a more civilized [[cover version]] of the song, with new lyrics composed by Pop, for his 1993 album ''[[American Caesar (album)|American Caesar]]''. He continues to play it live at shows.\n\n[[The Who]] were directed in their early recording career by the riff/rhythm of \"Louie Louie\", owing to the song's influence on the Kinks, who, like the Who, were produced by [[Shel Talmy]]&nbsp;\u2014 the Kinks on the [[Pye Records|Pye]] label and the Who on [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]]. Talmy wanted the successful sounds of the Kinks' 1964 hits \"You Really Got Me\", \"[[All Day and All of the Night]]\", and \"[[Till the End of the Day]]\" to be copied by the Who. As a result, [[Pete Townshend]] penned \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", released in March 1965. During a pre-song interview with host [[Brian Matthew]] on ''[[Saturday Club (BBC radio)|Saturday Club]]'' in May, Pete explained that \"I Can't Explain\" was released to \"introduce the Who to the charts\" and that they were now trying to create the sort of sound they achieved on stage at present&nbsp;\u2014 hence the new single they were about to sing live on ''Saturday Club'', the feedback-driven, Mod-inspired \"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\". (In 1979 \"Louie Louie\" would be featured on the [[Quadrophenia (soundtrack album)|soundtrack album to ''Quadrophenia'']].)\n\n[[Ian Curtis]] of [[Joy Division]] can be heard saying \"You should hear our version of 'Louie Louie', woah\" at the end of the band's live cover of [[The Velvet Underground]]'s [[Sister Ray]] on their ''[[Still (Joy Division album)|Still]]'' album.\n\n\"Louie Louie\" is referenced in the John Prine song \"Lake Marie\" and uses the words, \"Oh baby, we gotta go now\"\n\nDuring a change in format from adult-contemporary to all-oldies, radio station WMXP-FM in Peoria, Illinois became \"all Louie, all the time,\" playing nothing but covers of \"Louie Louie\" for six straight days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/place/portland-oregon/louie-louie|publisher=Songfacts|accessdate=August 1, 2019|title=Louie Louie by the Kingsmen}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-03-18-9703180009-story.html|title=Too Much Of A Good Thing?

It is best known for the 1963 hit version by [[the Kingsmen]] and has become a [[Standard (music)|standard]] in [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]]. The song is based on the tune \"El Loco Cha Cha\" popularized by bandleader [[Ren\u00e9 Touzet]] and is an example of Latin influence on American popular music.\n\n\"Louie Louie\" tells, in simple [[verse\u2013chorus form]], the first-person story of a Jamaican sailor returning to the island to see his lover.\n\n\"Louie Louie\" has been recognized by organizations and publications worldwide for its influence on the history of rock and roll. A partial list (see \"Recognition and rankings\" table below) includes the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]], [[National Public Radio]], [[VH1]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Magazine, the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and the [[RIAA|Recording Industry Association of America]].  Other major examples of the song's legacy include the celebration of [[International Louie Louie Day]] every year on April 11; the annual Louie Louie Parade in [[Philadelphia]] from 1985 to 1989; the [[LouieFest]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] from 2003 to 2012; the ongoing annual Louie Louie Street Party in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]]; and the unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to make it the state song of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\nThe Kingsmen's recording was the subject of an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation about the supposed, but nonexistent, [[Mondegreen#Examples|obscenity of the lyrics]], an investigation that ended without prosecution.<ref name=\"TSG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/funny/lascivious-louie-louie|title=The Lascivious 'Louie Louie'|website=[[The Smoking Gun]]|accessdate=February 18, 2009}}</ref> The nearly unintelligible (and innocuous) lyrics were widely misinterpreted, and the song was banned by radio stations as well as being investigated by the FBI.\n\n[[Dave Marsh]], in his book ''The History and Mythology of the World's Most Famous Rock 'n' Roll Song'' wrote, \"It is the best of songs, it is the worst of songs\"{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=3}} and rock historian Peter Blecha notes, \"Far from shuffling off to a quiet retirement, evidence indicates that 'Louie Louie' may actually prove to be immortal.\"<ref name=\"Blecha 2007\"/>\n\n==Original version by Richard Berry==\n[[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]] was inspired to write the song in 1955 after listening to an R&B interpretation of \"El Loco Cha Cha\" performed by the Latin R&B group Ricky Rillera and the Rhythm Rockers.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|pp=13, 31}} The tune was written originally as \"Amarren Al Loco\" (\"Tie Up the Madman\") by Cuban bandleader Rosendo Ruiz Jr., also known as Rosendo Ruiz Quevedo, but became best known in the \"El Loco Cha Cha\" arrangement by [[Ren\u00e9 Touzet]] which included a rhythmic ten-note \"1-2-3 1\u20132 1-2-3 1\u20132\" pattern.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=31}}\n\n[[File:Louie Louie rhythm.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|\"Louie Louie\" 10-note riff]] Touzet performed the tune regularly in Los Angeles clubs in the 1950s. In Berry's mind, the words \"Louie Louie\" superimposed themselves over the repeating [[bassline]]. Lyrically, the [[first-person narrative|first person]] perspective of the song was influenced by \"[[One for My Baby (And One More for the Road)]],\" which is sung from the perspective of a customer talking to a bartender (\"Louie\" was the name of Berry's bartender).{{sfn|Marsh|1993|pp=31\u201333}} Berry cited [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[After School Session|Havana Moon]]\" and his exposure to [[Latin American music]] for the song's speech pattern and references to [[Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes | year = 1989 | title = The Best of Louie Louie | type = Album liner notes | others = Various artists | location = | publisher = [[Rhino Records]] | OCLC = | id = R1 70605 | ref = harv}}</ref>\n\nLos Angeles-based [[Flip Records (1950s)|Flip Records]] issued Berry's adaptation with his [[Backup band|backing band]] the Pharaohs in April 1957 as a single B-side of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\". The single was a regional hit on the west coast, particularly in San Francisco. When the group toured the Pacific Northwest, local R&B bands began to play the song, increasing its popularity. The song was then re-released as an A-side single. However, the single never appeared on the various [[Billboard R&B charts|''Billboard'' R&B charts]] nor broader [[Hot 100]]. Berry's label reported that the single had sold 40,000 copies.

The engineer for the session was the studio owner, Robert Lindahl. The Kingsmen's lead vocalist, [[Jack Ely]], based his version on the recording by Rockin' Robin Roberts with the Fabulous Wailers, unintentionally introducing a change in the rhythm as he showed the other members how to play it with a 1\u20132\u20133, 1\u20132, 1\u20132\u20133 beat instead of the 1\u20132\u20133\u20134, 1\u20132, 1\u20132\u20133\u20134 beat on the Wailers record.{{sfn|Marsh|1999|p=15}} The night before their recording session, the band played a 90-minute version of the song during a gig at a local teen club. The Kingsmen's studio version was recorded in one take. They also recorded the B-side of the release, an original instrumental by the group called \"Haunted Castle\".\n\nA significant error on the Kingsmen version occurs just after the lead guitar break. As the group was going by the Wailers version, which has a brief restatement of the riff twice over before the lead vocalist comes back in, it would be expected that Ely would do the same. Ely, however, overshot his mark, coming in too soon, before the restatement of the riff. He realized his mistake and stopped the verse short, but the band did not realize that he had done so. As a quick fix, drummer Lynn Easton covered the pause with a [[Fill (music)|drum fill]], but before the verse ended, the rest of the band went into the chorus at the point where they expected it to be. This error is now so embedded in the consciousness of some groups that they deliberately duplicate it when performing the song.\n\nThe Kingsmen transformed Berry's easy-going ballad into a raucous romp, complete with a twangy guitar, occasional background chatter, and nearly unintelligible lyrics by Ely.{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=97}}  Ely had to stand on tiptoe to sing into a boom mike, and his braces further impeded his singing. A guitar break is triggered by the shout, \"Okay, let's give it to 'em right now!\", which first appeared in the Wailers version,{{sfn|Marsh|1993|p=67}} as did the entire guitar break (although, in the Wailers version, a few notes differ, and the entire band played the break). Critic [[Dave Marsh]] suggests it is this moment that gives the recording greatness: \"[Ely] went for it so avidly you'd have thought he'd spotted the jugular of a lifelong enemy, so crudely that, at that instant, Ely sounds like Donald Duck on helium. And it's that faintly ridiculous air that makes the Kingsmen's record the classic that it is, especially since it's followed by a guitar solo that's just as wacky.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1999|p=14}} Marsh ranks the song as number eleven out of the 1001 greatest singles ever made.\n\nFirst released in May 1963, the single was initially issued by the small [[Jerden Records|Jerden]] label, before being picked up by the larger [[Wand Records]] and released by them in October 1963. It entered the top ten on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for December 7, and peaked at number two the following week, a spot which it held for six non-consecutive weeks; it would remain in the top 10 through December and January before dropping off in early February.<ref>{{Cite book| author = Whitburn, Joel | title = Joel Whitburn Presents Billboard Top 10 Singles Charts | year = 2001 | location = Menomonee, Wisconsin | publisher = Record Research, Inc. | pages = 69\u201372 | isbn = 0-89820-146-2 | authorlink = Joel Whitburn}}</ref> In total, the Kingsmen's version spent 16 weeks on the Hot 100.

Things changed when Boston's biggest DJ, [[Arnie Ginsburg]], was given the record by a pitchman. Amused by its slapdash sound, he played it on his program as \"The Worst Record of the Week\". Despite the slam, listener response was swift and positive.\n\nBy the end of October, it was listed in Billboard as a regional breakout and a \"bubbling under\" entry for the national chart. Meanwhile, the Raiders version, with far stronger promotion, was becoming a hit in California and was also listed as \"bubbling under\" one week after the Kingsmen debuted on the chart. For a few weeks, the two singles appeared destined to battle each other, but demand for the Kingsmen single acquired momentum and, by the end of 1963, [[Columbia Records]] had stopped promoting the Raiders version, as ordered by [[Mitch Miller]].\n\nBy the time the Kingsmen version had achieved national popularity, the band had split. Two rival editions\u2014one featuring lead singer Jack Ely, the other with Lynn Easton who held the rights to the band's name\u2014were competing for live audiences across the country. A settlement was reached later in 1964 giving Easton the right to the Kingsmen name but requiring all future pressings of the original version of \"Louie Louie\" to display \"Lead vocal by Jack Ely\" on the label.\n\nOn November 9, 1998, after a protracted lawsuit that lasted five years and cost $1.3 million, the Kingsmen were awarded ownership of all their recordings released on [[Wand Records]] from [[Gusto Records]], including \"Louie Louie\". They had not been paid royalties on the songs since the 1960s.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Kingsmen reign - High court grants royalties, tapes of 'Louie'|url=https://variety.com/1998/music/news/kingsmen-reign-1117488295/|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 9, 1998|first=Christopher|last=Stern}}</ref><ref>[http://www.louielouie.org/modules.php?name=Lawsuit_Info Lawsuit info at Louielouie.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312073206/http://www.louielouie.org/modules.php?name=Lawsuit_Info |date=March 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Jack Ely died on April 28, 2015, his son reported that \"my father would say, 'We were initially just going to record the song as an instrumental, and at the last minute I decided I'd sing it.{{'\"}} When it came time to do that, however, Ely discovered the sound engineer had raised the studio's only microphone several feet above his head. Then he placed Ely in the middle of his fellow musicians, all in an effort to create a better \"live feel\" for the recording. The result, Ely would say over the years, was that he had to stand on his toes, lean his head back and shout as loudly as he could just to be heard over the drums and guitars.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dubois |first1=Steven |last2=Rogers |first2=John |title='Louie Louie' Singer Jack Ely Dies in Oregon at 71 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/28/louie-louie-jack-ely-dies_n_7165492.html |website=[[Huffington Post]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |date=April 28, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Paul Revere & the Raiders====\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Louie Louie\n| cover      = Raiders Sande 45.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]]\n| album      = Here They Come!\n| B-side     = Night Train\n| released   = {{Start date|1963|06}}\n| format     = [[45 rpm record]]\n| recorded   = April 1963\n| studio     = \n| genre      =\n| length     = {{Duration|m=2|s=38}}\n| label      = Sand\u0113\n| writer     = [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]\n| producer   = Roger Hart\n| prev_title = So Fine\n| prev_year  = 1963\n| next_title = [[Louie, Louie Go Home|Louie Go Home]]\n| next_year  = 1963\n}}\n[[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] also recorded a version of \"Louie Louie\", probably on April 13, 1963, in the same Portland studio as the Kingsmen.<ref>Blecha p. 139</ref><ref>Following the death of Kingsmen singer Jack Ely, Mark Lindsay tweeted on April 28, 2015, \"To settle it once and for all: Jack Ely/The Kingsmen recorded Louie Louie 3 days BEFORE the Raiders.\"</ref>  The recording was paid for and produced by [[KISN (Portland)|KISN]] radio personality Roger Hart, who soon became personal manager for the band.

It enjoyed a comeback in 1978\u20131979 and was associated with [[fraternities and sororities|college fraternity]] parties when it was sung, complete with the supposedly obscene lyrics, by Bluto ([[John Belushi]]) and his fellow Delta House brothers in the movie ''[[National Lampoon's Animal House]]'' despite the anachronism of the film taking place in 1962, a year before the Kingsmen recording (although this is mitigated by the fact that the Deltas were fans of at least one black R&B musician, and 1962 was five years ''after'' Richard Berry released his original version of the song, plus the song had been popular with local bands in the Northwest following [[Rockin' Robin Roberts]]' 1961 single). Aside from the ''Animal House'' appearance, the song appeared in many other films, typically in raucous and humorous contexts.\n\nSome bands have taken liberties with the lyrics, including attempts to record the supposed \"obscene lyrics\", notably  [[the Stooges]], whose version can be heard on their live album ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' [[Iggy Pop]] later recorded a more civilized [[cover version]] of the song, with new lyrics composed by Pop, for his 1993 album ''[[American Caesar (album)|American Caesar]]''. He continues to play it live at shows.\n\n[[The Who]] were directed in their early recording career by the riff/rhythm of \"Louie Louie\", owing to the song's influence on the Kinks, who, like the Who, were produced by [[Shel Talmy]]&nbsp;\u2014 the Kinks on the [[Pye Records|Pye]] label and the Who on [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]]. Talmy wanted the successful sounds of the Kinks' 1964 hits \"You Really Got Me\", \"[[All Day and All of the Night]]\", and \"[[Till the End of the Day]]\" to be copied by the Who. As a result, [[Pete Townshend]] penned \"[[I Can't Explain]]\", released in March 1965. During a pre-song interview with host [[Brian Matthew]] on ''[[Saturday Club (BBC radio)|Saturday Club]]'' in May, Pete explained that \"I Can't Explain\" was released to \"introduce the Who to the charts\" and that they were now trying to create the sort of sound they achieved on stage at present&nbsp;\u2014 hence the new single they were about to sing live on ''Saturday Club'', the feedback-driven, Mod-inspired \"[[Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere]]\". (In 1979 \"Louie Louie\" would be featured on the [[Quadrophenia (soundtrack album)|soundtrack album to ''Quadrophenia'']].)\n\n[[Ian Curtis]] of [[Joy Division]] can be heard saying \"You should hear our version of 'Louie Louie', woah\" at the end of the band's live cover of [[The Velvet Underground]]'s [[Sister Ray]] on their ''[[Still (Joy Division album)|Still]]'' album.\n\n\"Louie Louie\" is referenced in the John Prine song \"Lake Marie\" and uses the words, \"Oh baby, we gotta go now\"\n\nDuring a change in format from adult-contemporary to all-oldies, radio station WMXP-FM in Peoria, Illinois became \"all Louie, all the time,\" playing nothing but covers of \"Louie Louie\" for six straight days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/place/portland-oregon/louie-louie|publisher=Songfacts|accessdate=August 1, 2019|title=Louie Louie by the Kingsmen}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1997-03-18-9703180009-story.html|title=Too Much Of A Good Thing?

States and southern [[Ontario]] between April 30 and May 11, 2003. The twelve-day outbreak is the largest ever in the US since storm data was preserved in 1950.\n\nOverall, the outbreak was responsible for at least 42 deaths across five states with the majority of them during the busiest day on May 4, 2003 in which 39 were killed in [[Tennessee]], [[Missouri]] and [[Kansas]]. There were also hundreds of injuries and extensive damage was reported across several areas.\n\nBelow is the list of tornadoes that were confirmed by [[National Weather Service]] officials during the outbreak sequence.\n\n==Total confirmed tornadoes==\n\n{{Tornado Chart | Total=401 | F0=212 | F1=123 | F2=38 | F3=22 | F4=4 | F5=0 }}<!--Only add once confirmed by NWS offices-->\n\n==April 30 event==\n\n===Confirmed tornadoes===\n{{Tornado Chart | Total=21 | F0=18 | F1=3 | F2=0 | F3=0 | F4=0 | F5=0 }}<!--Only add once confirmed by NWS offices-->\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" width=\"100%\"\n!colspan=\"6\"|Confirmed tornadoes \u2013 Wednesday, April 30, 2003\n|-\n|<center>'''[[Fujita scale|F#]]'''</center> || <center>'''Location'''</center> || <center>'''County'''</center> || <center>'''Time (CST)'''</center> || <center>'''Path length'''</center> || <center>'''Damage'''</center>\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" align=center|'''[[Colorado]]'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|storm}} | <big>'''F0'''</big>\n|'''E of [[Hudson, Colorado|Hudson]]'''\n|[[Weld County, Colorado|Weld]]\n|1600\n|0.1 miles <br> (0.16&nbsp;km)\n|Small tornado; no damage reported.\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|storm}} | <big>'''F0'''</big>\n|'''SE of [[Prospect Valley, Colorado|Prospect Valley]]'''\n|[[Weld County, Colorado|Weld]]\n|1621\n|0.1 miles <br> (0.16&nbsp;km)\n|No damage reported.\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" align=center|'''[[Iowa]]'''\n|-\n|bgcolor=#{{Storm colour|storm}} | <big>'''F0'''</big>\n|'''E of [[Lockman, Iowa|Lockman]] '''\n|[[Monroe County, Missouri|Monroe]], [[Wapello County, Iowa|Wapello]] \n|1730\n|2.5 miles <br> (4.0&nbsp;km)\n|Short-lived, weak tornado.
