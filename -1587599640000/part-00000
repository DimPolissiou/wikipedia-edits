As the subject of the 2003 [[Plame affair]], also known as the CIA leak scandal, Plaine's identity as a CIA officer was [[news leak|leaked]] to and subsequently published by [[Robert Novak]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]''.\n\nIn the aftermath of the scandal, [[Richard Armitage (naval officer)|Richard Armitage]] in the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] was identified as one source of the information, and [[I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby]], Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted of lying to investigators. After a failed appeal, President [[George W. Bush]] commuted Libby's sentence and in 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] pardoned him. No one was formally charged with leaking the information.\n\nIn collaboration with a ghostwriter, Plame wrote a [[memoir]] detailing her career and the events leading up to her resignation from the CIA.

As the subject of the 2003 [[Plame affair]], also known as the CIA leak scandal, Plame's identity as a CIA officer was [[news leak|leaked]] to and subsequently published by [[Robert Novak]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]''.\n\nIn the aftermath of the scandal, [[Richard Armitage (naval officer)|Richard Armitage]] in the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] was identified as one source of the information, and [[I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby]], Chief of Staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, was convicted of lying to investigators. After a failed appeal, President [[George W. Bush]] commuted Libby's sentence and in 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] pardoned him.

The contestants are then voted on by the audience to see who is safe and continues, or who will compete in a further round of singing in that episode, and possibly elimination.\n\n==Production==\nThe third season featured 18 new costumes.

Further, passionate fans of the show had been able to work out identities of the singers from early clue packages, so more difficult clue packages were created for the celebrities in the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-cast-contestants-clues-1203448727/|title=''The Masked Singer'' Season 3: New Changes, Tougher Clues and 'Big Names' in the Cast|first=Elizabeth|last=Wagmeister|date=December 19, 2019|access-date=February 20, 2020|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\n==Panelists and host==\n{{multiple image\n| total_width   = 420\n| align         = left\n| direction     = horizontal\n| header        = Season 3 panelists and host\n| image1        = Robin Thicke 2019 by Glenn Francis.jpg\n| caption1      = [[Robin Thicke]]\n| image2        = Jenny McCarthy at E3 2006.jpg\n| caption2      = [[Jenny McCarthy]]\n| image3        = Ken Jeong March 2015.jpg\n| caption3      = [[Ken Jeong]]\n| image4        = Nicole Scherzinger 2012.jpg\n| caption4      = [[Nicole Scherzinger]]\n| image5        = Nick Cannon by David Shankbone.jpg\n| caption5      = [[Nick Cannon]] \n}}\n\n[[Nick Cannon]], singer-songwriter [[Robin Thicke]], television personality [[Jenny McCarthy]], actor and comedian [[Ken Jeong]], and recording artist [[Nicole Scherzinger]] will return for their third season as host and panelists.<ref name=\"Season 3 EW\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/12/30/what-we-know-the-masked-singer-season-3/|title=What we know (so far) about ''The Masked Singer'' season 3: New costumes, 18 contestants, and more|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|author=Rachel Yang |date=December 30, 2019|access-date=December 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nGuest panelists included [[Jamie Foxx]] during the first episode, [[Jason Biggs]] in the second episode, [[Leah Remini]] in the third episode, [[Gabriel Iglesias]] in the fifth episode, season 1 winner, [[T-Pain]], in the sixth episode, [[Joel McHale]] in the eighth episode, [[Will Arnett]] in the ninth episode, [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] in the eleventh episode, [[Sharon Osbourne]] in the twelfth episode,<ref name=\"TFC E12\"/> [[Gordon Ramsay]] in the thirteenth episode,<ref name=\"TFC E13\"/> and [[Jeff Dye]] in the fourteenth episode.<ref name=\"TFC E14\"/>\n\n==Contestants==\nDuring the season, eighteen contestants will compete.<ref name=\"Season 3 EW\" /> \n\nThe competitors are said to have a combined 69 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations, 88 [[RIAA certification|gold records]], 11 [[Super Bowl]] appearances, three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], hundreds of tattoos, and one title in the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]].<ref>{{cite web|website=[[TVGuide]]|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/the-masked-singer-season-3-jamie-foxx/|title=The Masked Singer Season 3 Adds Jamie Foxx as Guest Panelist|author= Amanda Bell|date= January 7, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; \"\n|- \n! rowspan=\"3\" | Stage name<ref>{{cite web |title=From the Banana to the Taco, 'The Masked Singer' Season 3 Costumes Have Been Revealed|url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/masked-singer-season-3-costumes-first-look-photos-1203485426/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=January 31, 2020|date=January 29, 2020}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"3\"| Celebrity\n! rowspan=\"3\"| Occupation\n! colspan=\"13\"| Episodes\n|-\n! colspan=\"1\" |1\n! colspan=\"1\" |2\n! colspan=\"1\" |3\n! colspan=\"1\" |4\n! colspan=\"1\" |5\n! colspan=\"1\" |6\n! colspan=\"1\" |7\n! colspan=\"1\" |8\n! colspan=\"1\" |9\n! rowspan=\"2\" |10\n! rowspan=\"2\" |11\n! rowspan=\"2\" |12\n! rowspan=\"2\" |13\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"| Group A\n! colspan=\"3\"| Group B\n! colspan=\"3\"| Group C\n|-\n!

After a discussion about how they are \"the hunters\" instead of \"the hunted,\" Whitney goes to bed and Rainsford hears gunshots. He climbs onto the yacht's rail and accidentally falls overboard, swimming to Ship-Trap Island, which is notorious for shipwrecks. On the island, he finds a palatial chateau inhabited by two [[Cossack]]s: the owner, General Zaroff, and his gigantic [[deaf-mute]] servant, Ivan.\n\nZaroff, another big-game hunter, knows of Rainsford from his published account of hunting [[snow leopard]]s in [[Tibet]]. Over dinner, he explains that hunting animals has become boring for him, so he moved to Ship-Trap and set it up to trick ships into wrecking themselves on the jagged rocks that surround it. He takes the survivors captive and hunts them for sport, giving them food, clothing, a knife, and a three-hour head start, and using only a small-caliber pistol for himself. Any captives who can elude Zaroff, Ivan, and a pack of [[hunting dog]]s for three days are set free. He reveals that he has won every hunt to date. Captives are offered a choice between being hunted or turned over to Ivan, who once served as official [[knout]]er for [[Nicholas II of Russia|The Great White Czar]]. Rainsford denounces the hunt as barbarism, but Zaroff replies by claiming that \"[[survival of the fittest|life is for the strong]].\" Realizing he has no way out, Rainsford reluctantly agrees to be hunted.\n\nDuring his head start, Rainsford lays an intricate trail in the forest and then climbs a tree. Zaroff finds him easily, but decides to play with him like a cat would a mouse, standing underneath the tree Rainsford is hiding in, smoking a cigarette, and then abruptly departing. After the failed attempt at eluding Zaroff, Rainsford builds a Malay man-catcher, a [[Deadfall trap|weighted log attached to a trigger]]. This contraption injures Zaroff's shoulder, causing him to return home for the night, but he shouts his respect for the trap before departing. The next day Rainsford creates a [[Trapping pit|Burmese tiger pit]], which kills one of Zaroff's hounds. He sacrifices his knife and ties it to a sapling to make another trap, which kills Ivan when he stumbles into it. To escape Zaroff and his approaching hounds, Rainsford dives off a cliff into the sea; Zaroff, disappointed at Rainsford's apparent suicide, returns home. Zaroff smokes a pipe by his fireplace, but two issues keep him from peace of mind: the difficulty of replacing Ivan, and the uncertainty of whether Rainsford perished in his dive.\n\nZaroff locks himself in his bedroom and turns on the lights, only to find Rainsford waiting for him; he had swum around the island in order to sneak into the chateau without the dogs finding him. Zaroff congratulates him on winning the \"game,\" but Rainsford decides to fight him, saying he is still a beast-at-bay and that the original hunt is not over. Accepting the challenge, Zaroff says that the loser will be fed to the dogs, while the winner will sleep in his bed. The story ends with Rainsford enjoying the comfort of Zaroff's bed.\n\n== Analysis ==\n\"The Most Dangerous Game\" is a popular read within middle and high school curricula due to the strength of the themes within the story. The first and foremost question that the story bears is that of justifiable murder. Rainsford justifies his hunting of animals because he believes that man is superior to animals because animals do not feel. To contradict, General Zaroff believes that men are superior because they are able to reason. Zaroff uses his reasoning to explain why men are the most interesting game to hunt; men can reason, and thus provide a challenge that no animal can contend with. The story simultaneously highlights through the experience of Rainsford, as he is hunted, the fears that animals must experience while being hunted.\n\nZaroff himself is a contradiction because his exquisite manners are juxtaposed with his heartless brutality in killing men. The idea of a man who is proper in all aspects, but still contains a desire to kill, is a suggestion by Connell that men possess murderous instincts that can only be subdued by the presence of society and law. Zaroff is only able to partake in his \"hobby\" because he does not live within a civilization.\n\nThe ending of the story bears questions about the true nature of Rainsford, who is implied to have killed Zaroff in order to secure his own safety. By killing Zaroff, he thus took part in the \"game\" that Zaroff wanted him to play.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.enotes.com/topics/most-dangerous-game/themes|title=The Most Dangerous Game Themes |publisher=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-15}}</ref>\n\n== Real-life parallels ==\n[[Robert Hansen]], a serial killer who was active in the early 1980s, would kidnap women and release them in Alaska's [[Knik River]] Valley.

RER C was created from an amalgamation and renovation of several old SNCF commuter lines unlike RER A and B which had newer sections owned and constructed by RATP. Each day, over 531 trains run on the RER C alone, and carries over 540,000 passengers daily,<ref>[https://malignec.transilien.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/C_JEUDI_n27_blog.pdf \u00ab JEUDI, le mag des jeudis de la ligne C Transilien \u00bb], 27, Novembre 2012, page 2 (consult\u00e9 le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2016).</ref> 150,000 passengers more than the entirety of the [[TGV]] network. \n\nIt is the most popular RER line for tourists, who represent 15% of its passengers, as the line serves many monuments and museums, including the [[Palace of Versailles]]. However, the numerous stops, combined with the old and fragile infrastructure the line inherited, makes the Parisian section of the RER C very slow and inefficient. The numerous old curves and steep grades on RER C means trains sometimes need to slow down to {{convert|40|km/h|abbr=on}} to safely pass sections with tight alignments.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Jacquot, ''La ligne C du RER'', p 108</ref> In contrast, RER A was constructed with more modern standards enabling much higher average operating speeds. These problems are particularly evident on trips to and from the northern suburbs to the city center as taking Transilien lines and transferring to the [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] is much faster than taking the meandering RER C with closely spaced stops. In addition, the RER C's complicated operating schedule created by its complex network of numerous branches means the entire line is vulnerable to delays from even the smallest incidents. \n\nThese issues have led to the line being called \"'''R'''\u00e9seau '''E'''scargot '''R'''\u00e9gional\" (Regional Snail Network) by the local populace.<ref name=stif2007>{{cite web |title=Changements dans l\u2019air dans le RER|url=http://www.metro-pole.net/actu/article843.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225101809/http://www.metro-pole.net/actu/article843.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 December 2013|website=metro-pole.net, via web.archive.org|date=15 December 2007|accessdate=12 May 2015}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Paris RER C crosses the Seine on Pont Rouelle.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The view from [[\u00cele aux Cygnes]] towards the [[Eiffel Tower]], with a RER-C train crossing the [[Pont Rouelle]]]]\n{{RER C}}\nLine C was opened on 26 September 1979, following the construction of a new {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=on}} tunnel connecting the Gare d'Orsay railway terminus (now [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (Paris RER)|Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]) with the ''[[Invalides (Paris RER)|Invalides]]'', terminus of the Rive Gauche line to [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], along the banks of the [[Seine]].

This branch mostly used the infrastructure of the \"ligne d'Auteuil\" (incorporated into the \"[[Chemin de fer de Petite Ceinture|ligne de petite ceinture]]\" from 1867, closed to passengers from 22 July 1934), and a new {{convert|3|km|mi|adj=on}} tunnel connection between Batignolles and [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Ouen]], connecting to the RER C's main trunk at [[Champ de Mars - Tour Eiffel (Paris RER)|Champ de Mars-Tour Eiffel]] via a curved bridge (the only one in Paris) over the Seine river. That extended services to [[Montigny \u2013 Beauchamp (SNCF)|Montigny \u2013 Beauchamp]] and [[Argenteuil]].\n\nPorte de Clichy opened on 29 September 1991. Located between [[Pereire - Levallois (Paris RER)|Pereire \u2013 Levallois]] and [[Saint-Ouen, Seine-Saint-Denis|St-Ouen]].\n\nIn 1992, the line was extended from [[Juvisy-sur-Orge|Juvisy]] to [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]].\n\nA further {{convert|9|km|mi}} extension from [[Montigny \u2013 Beauchamp (SNCF)|Montigny \u2013 Beauchamp]] to [[Pontoise]] was opened on 28 August 2000. On the same day a new station, Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, opened in order to create a new connexion with M\u00e9tro [[Paris M\u00e9tro Line 14|Line 14]], located between Paris-Austerlitz and Boulevard Mass\u00e9na, which was closed and replaced by the new station.\n\nAnother new station, [[Gare de Saint-Ouen-l'Aum\u00f4ne \u2013 Liesse|St-Ouen-l'Aum\u00f4ne-Liesse]], opened on 24 March 2002. Located between [[Gare de Pierrelaye|Pierrelaye]] and [[Gare de Saint-Ouen-l'Aum\u00f4ne|St-Ouen-l'Aum\u00f4ne]].\n\nThe C3 branch (from [[Ermont \u2013 Eaubonne (SNCF)|Ermont-Eaubonne]] to [[Argenteuil (SNCF)|Argenteuil]]) transferred to the [[Transilien Paris \u2013 Saint-Lazare]] suburban rail network on 27 August 2006.\n\nOn 16 December 2006, Boulevard Victor was renamed [[Boulevard Victor - Pont du Garigliano (Paris RER)|Boulevard Victor \u2013 Pont du Garigliano]] to highlight the new interchange with tramway line [[Paris Tramway Line 3|T3]].\n\nIn February 2012, Versailles - Rive Gauche was renamed Versailles-Ch\u00e2teau-Rive-Gauche, to avoid frequent tourist confusion with other stations in Versailles.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of stations of the Paris M\u00e9tro]]\n* [[List of stations of the Paris RER]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Commonscat-inline|Paris RER ligne C}}\n* [http://ratp.fr/ RATP official website] ''(in French)''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20140510221801/http://www.ratp.fr/en/ratp/c_5001/menu-principal/ RATP English website]\n* [http://www.ratp.info/orienter/cv/carterer.php Interactive map of the RER (from RATP's website)]\n* [http://www.ratp.info/orienter/cv/carteparis.php Interactive map of the Paris m\u00e9tro (from RATP's website)]\n* [http://membres.lycos.fr/mobidf/ Mobidf website, dedicated to the RER (unofficial)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''(in French)''\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051208073801/http://www.metro-pole.net/ Metro-Pole website, dedicated to Paris public transports (unofficial)] ''(in French)''\n\n{{Paris Transport Network}}{{Paris Rail Stations}}\n\n[[Category:R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|C0, RER C]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1979]]\n", "text_old": "{{use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox rail line\n| name           = RER C\n| color          = {{RER color|C}}\n| logo           = {{rint|Paris|R|size=50}} {{rint|Paris|R|C|size=50}}\n| logo_width     = \n| logo_alt       = \n| image          = \n| image_width    = \n| image_alt      = \n| caption        = \n| type           = [[Rapid transit]]/[[commuter rail]]\n| system         = [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional]]\n| status         = Operational\n| stations       = 84\n| ridership2     = 140,000,000 journeys per year\n| open           = 26 September 1979<br>(last extension in 2006)\n| close          = \n| operator       = [[SNCF]]\n| start          = [[Pontoise station|Pontoise]] (C1), [[Versailles-Ch\u00e2teau-Rive-Gauche station|Versailles-Ch\u00e2teau-Rive-Gauche]] (C5), [[Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines\u2013Montigny-le-Bretonneux station|Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines]] (C7)\n| end            = [[Gare de Massy \u2013 Palaiseau|Massy \u2013 Palaiseau]] (C2), [[Gare de Dourdan-la-For\u00eat|Dourdan-la-For\u00eat]] (C4), [[Saint-Martin-d'\u00c9tampes (Paris RER)|Saint-Martin-d'\u00c9tampes]] (C6), [[Versailles-Chantiers station|Versailles-Chantiers]] (C8)\n| stock          = [[Z 5600]], [[Z 8800]], [[Z 20500]], [[Z 20900]]\n| linelength_km  = 185.6\n| gauge          = {{RailGauge|1435mm|lk=on}}\n| speed_km/h     = \n| elevation_m    = \n| website        = \n| map = [[File:RER C.svg|frameless|upright=1.5|center]]<br>Geographically accurate path of the RER C\n}}\nThe '''RER C''' is one of the five lines in the [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] system serving [[:Paris]], France. It is operated by [[SNCF]].\n\nThe line runs from the northwestern termini [[Gare de Pontoise|Pontoise]] (C1), [[Versailles-Ch\u00e2teau-Rive-Gauche Station|Versailles-Ch\u00e2teau-Rive-Gauche]] (C5) and [[Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines (Paris RER)|Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines]] (C7) to the southeastern termini [[Massy-Palaiseau (Paris RER)|Massy-Palaiseau]] (C2), [[Dourdan-la-For\u00eat (Paris RER)|Dourdan-la-For\u00eat]] (C4),  [[Saint-Martin d'\u00c9tampes (Paris RER)|Saint-Martin d'\u00c9tampes]] (C6) and [[Versailles \u2013 Chantiers (Paris RER)|Versailles \u2013 Chantiers]] (C8).\n\nThe RER C line is the second-longest in the network, with over {{convert|187|km|mi|abbr=on}} of route. RER C was created from an amalgamation and renovation of several old SNCF commuter lines unlike RER A and B which had newer sections owned and constructed by RATP. Each day, over 531 trains run on the RER C alone, and carries over 540,000 passengers daily,<ref>[https://malignec.transilien.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/C_JEUDI_n27_blog.pdf \u00ab JEUDI, le mag des jeudis de la ligne C Transilien \u00bb], 27, Novembre 2012, page 2 (consult\u00e9 le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2016).</ref> 150,000 passengers more than the entirety of the [[TGV]] network. \n\nIt is the most popular RER line for tourists which represents 15% of its passengers, as the line serves many monuments and museums, including the [[Palace of Versailles]]. However, the numerous stops, combined with the old and fragile infrastructure the line inherited, makes the Parisian section of the RER C very slow and inefficient. The numerous old curves and steep grades on RER C means trains sometimes need to slow down to {{convert|40|km/h|abbr=on}} to safely pass sections with tight alignments.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Jacquot, ''La ligne C du RER'', p 108</ref> In contrast, RER A was constructed with more modern standards enabling much higher average operating speeds. These problems are particularly evident on trips to and from the northern suburbs to the city center as taking Transilien lines and transferring to the [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] is much faster than taking the meandering RER C with closely spaced stops. In addition, the RER C's complicated operating schedule created by its complex network of numerous branches means the entire line is vulnerable to delays from even the smallest incidents. \n\nThese issues have led to the line being called \"'''R'''\u00e9seau '''E'''scargot '''R'''\u00e9gional\" (Regional Snail Network) by the local populace.<ref name=stif2007>{{cite web |title=Changements dans l\u2019air dans le RER|url=http://www.metro-pole.net/actu/article843.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225101809/http://www.metro-pole.net/actu/article843.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 December 2013|website=metro-pole.net, via web.archive.org|date=15 December 2007|accessdate=12 May 2015}}.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Paris RER C crosses the Seine on Pont Rouelle.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The view from [[\u00cele aux Cygnes]] towards the [[Eiffel Tower]], with a RER-C train crossing the [[Pont Rouelle]]]]\n{{RER C}}\nLine C was opened on 26 September 1979, following the construction of a new {{convert|1|km|mi|adj=on}} tunnel connecting the Gare d'Orsay railway terminus (now [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (Paris RER)|Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]) with the ''[[Invalides (Paris RER)|Invalides]]'', terminus of the Rive Gauche line to [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], along the banks of the [[Seine]].

He won four medals again (two silver and two bronze) in 1998.<ref>[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=SVK&gender=all&medal=all&sport=all&games=all Slovakia at the Paralympics], International Paralympic Committee</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Slovakia won its first Winter gold medals, with [[Henrieta Farkasova]] and [[Jakub Krako]] each winning three gold and a silver in visually impaired alpine skiing.
