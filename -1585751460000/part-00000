The philosophical difference between Maoism and Marxism\u2013Leninism is that the [[peasantry]] are the [[Vanguardism|revolutionary vanguard]] in pre-industrial societies rather than the [[proletariat]]. This updating and adaptation of Marxism\u2013Leninism to Chinese conditions in which revolutionary praxis is primary and ideological orthodoxy is secondary represents urban Marxism\u2013Leninism adapted to pre-industrial China.

''Mao's China and After'', New York:Free Press, 1999. pp. 12\u201316.</ref>\n\n==== Iconoclastic revolution and anti-Confucianism ====\nBy the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of [[Confucianism]].<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 10.</ref> These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival\u2014or as historian of China [[Maurice Meisner]] would label it, their defection\u2014heralded the beginning of the destruction of the [[gentry]] as a social class in China.<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe fall of the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial Chinese dynasty]] in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and [[social conservatism]] in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 14.</ref>\n\nChinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by [[Chen Duxiu]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] which occurred between 1915 and 1919.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/> Proposing the \"total destruction of the traditions and values of the past\", the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the ''[[New Youth]]'', a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young [[Mao Zedong]], whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/>\n\n==== Nationalism and the appeal of Marxism ====\nAlong with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.</ref> Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in [[Shandong]] were\u2014without consultation with the Chinese\u2014transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe negative reaction culminated in the [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident]] in 1919 during which a protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan. The protest took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or being in the direct pay of, the Japanese.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Page 17\"/>\n\nAnother international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia. The [[Russian Revolution]] elicited great interest among Chinese intellectuals, although socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident.<ref name=After>Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 18.</ref> Afterwards, \"[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present\".<ref name=After/>\n\n=== Yan'an period between November 1935 and March 1947 ===\nDuring the period immediately following the [[Long March]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) were headquartered in [[Yan'an]], which is a prefecture-level city in [[Shaanxi]] province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the \"thought of Mao Zedong\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 45.</ref> The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\"/>\n\nAlthough the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved, including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically, the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) \"the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.</ref> These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.\n\n; Formative Maoist period (1927\u20131935)\nIn this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the \"Marxist method of political and class analysis\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.</ref> Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.\n\n; Mature Maoist period (1935\u20131940)\nIntellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December 1936). This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice.<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.</ref> Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u56fd\u9769\u547d\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u6218\u7565\u95ee\u989803531.jpg|thumb|''Strategic Issues in the Chinese Revolutionary War'' (1947)]]\n; Civil War period (1940\u20131949)\nUnlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory. He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge.<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\">Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.</ref> The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice: \"The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism\u2013Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east\".<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\"/> The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) [[dogmatism]], the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) [[empiricism]], excessive dependence on experience.\n\n; Post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory\nThe victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. \"Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.</ref> Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. \"In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 119.</ref>\n\n=== Differences from Marxism ===\nThe two differences between Maoism and [[Marxism]] are how the [[proletariat]] are defined and what political and economic conditions would start a [[communist revolution]]: \n# For [[Karl Marx]], the proletariat were the urban [[working class]], which was determined in the revolution by which the [[bourgeoisie]] overthrew [[feudalism]].<ref>Sandmo, Agnar. ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011, p.000.</ref> For Mao Zedong, the proletariat were the millions of peasants, to whom he referred as ''the popular masses''. Mao based his revolution upon the peasants, because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 \"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective\"]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref>\n# For Marx, [[proletarian revolution]] was internally fueled, by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]; that, as capitalism developed, \"a tension arises between the [[productive forces]] and the [[mode of production]]\".<ref>Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p.000.</ref> The political tension between the productive forces (the workers) and the owners of the [[means of production]] (the capitalists) would be an inevitable incentive to proletarian revolution, which would result in a [[Communist society]] as the main economic structure. Mao did not subscribe to Marx's proposal of inevitable cyclicality in the economic system. His goal was to unify the Chinese nation and so realize progressive change for China in the form of Communism, hence, revolution was needed as soon as possible. In ''The Great Union of the Popular Masses'' (1919), Mao said: \"The decadence of the state, the sufferings of humanity, and the darkness of society have all reached an extreme\".<ref>Mao, Zedong.

Retrieved 25 April 2019.</ref>\n\n== Components ==\n=== New Democracy ===\n{{Marxism\u2013Leninism sidebar|variants}}\nThe theory of the [[New Democracy]] was known to the Chinese revolutionaries from the late 1940s. This thesis held that for the majority of the people of the planet, the long road to [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] could only be opened by a \"national, popular, democratic, anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution, run by the communists\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Amin|first=Samir|title=The Countries of the South Must Take Their Own Independent Initiatives|publisher=The Third World Forum|date=October 2009|url=http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|accessdate=22 February 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131304/http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|archivedate=23 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== People's war ===\nHolding that \"[[political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch05.htm|title=Quotations From Chairman Mao|publisher=Peking Foreign Languages Press|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> Maoism emphasizes the \"revolutionary struggle of the vast majority of people against the exploiting classes and their state structures\", which Mao termed a \"[[people's war]]\". Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]], Maoist Thought focuses on \"surrounding the cities from the countryside\".\n\nMaoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban [[Developed country|developed]] [[First World]] societies ruling over rural [[Developing country|developing]] [[Third World]] societies.<ref>Alexander C. Cook, \"Third World Maoism\" in A Critical Introduction to Mao. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University, 2011. p. 290.</ref> Maoism identifies peasant insurgencies in particular national contexts were part of a context of world revolution, in which Maoism views the global countryside would overwhelm the global cities.<ref name=\"Mao.

Cambridge 2011. P. 289-290\"/>\n\n=== Mass line ===\nContrary to the [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] model employed by the [[Bolshevik]]s, the theory of the [[mass line]] holds that party must not be separate from the popular masses, either in policy or in revolutionary struggle. To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be told to the party so that the party can interpret them with a Marxist view.\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\nThe theory of the [[Cultural Revolution]] states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology\u2014the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.\n\n=== Contradiction ===\nMao drew from the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of \"contradiction\" (''maodun''). In two major essays, ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he adopts the [[positivist]]-[[empiricist]] idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: \"The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist\".<ref>Mao Tse Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm \"On contradiction\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Language Press, Peking, 1967, p. 75.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, each contradiction (including [[class struggle]], the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. \"There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions\".<ref>Mao Tse-Tung, \"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm On contradiction]\", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op. cit., p. 89.</ref>\n\nThus, the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction \"solidify\". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay ''[[On Practice]]'', \"on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\". Here, ''Practice'' connects \"contradiction\" with \"class struggle\" in the following way, claiming that inside a mode of production there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.<ref>Cfr. Mao Tse-Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm \"On practice. On the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op.cit., p. 55: \"Man's social practice is not confined to activity in production, but takes many forms&mdash;class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also though his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life)\".</ref>\n\nThese three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes&mdash;like Marx in trying to confront the \"bourgeois idealism\" of his time&mdash;that knowledge must be based on [[empirical evidence]].\n\nKnowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, \"scientifically\", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.\n\nMao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.\n\n[[File:Mao Zedong in Red.svg|thumb|Maoism is described as being [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] adapted to Chinese conditions whereas its variant [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] is considered universally applicable]]\n\n=== Three Worlds Theory ===\n[[Three Worlds Theory]] states that during the [[Cold War]] two imperialist states formed the \"first world\"\u2014the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are \"bought up\" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.<ref name=\"emg\">[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism \"Maoism\"]. Glossary of Terms. ''Encyclopedia of Marxism''.</ref>\n\n=== Agrarian socialism ===\nMaoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces\u2014this is known as [[agrarian socialism]]. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal, and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the framework of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], dismissing it as \"[[State capitalism|state capitalist]]\" and \"[[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]\", a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from [[Historical materialism|historical]] and [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nAlthough Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban [[industrialization]] as a prerequisite to expand [[economic development]] and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.<ref>John H. Badgley, John Wilson Lewis. Peasant Rebellion and Communist Revolution in Asia. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1974. p. 249.</ref>\n\n== In China ==\nIn its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as \"[[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] applied in a Chinese context\", synthesized by Mao and China's \"[[Generations of Chinese leadership|first-generation leaders]]\". It asserts that [[class struggle]] continues even if the [[proletariat]] has already overthrown the [[bourgeoisie]] and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed \"socialist construction\". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated \"imperialism and feudalism\" and created a \"New China\" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as [[Deng Xiaoping]] abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called \"[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|title=Xinhua: Constitution of the Communist Party of China|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017214011/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|archivedate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== After Mao Zedong's death ==\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony for the Vice Premier of China. - NARA - 183157-restored(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]]]]\nShortly after Mao's death in 1976, [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market reforms]] in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|title=UC Berkeley Journalism -Faculty - Deng's Revolution|accessdate=22 August 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132630/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|archivedate=4 January 2009}}</ref> Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to \"[[seek truth from facts]]\" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of [[ideology]] in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as [[Holy Writ|holy writ]], as was done in Mao's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's ''[[Reform and Opening]]'' economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's [[productive forces]].\n\nIn addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring [[capitalism]] and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are \"Maoist\".\n\nAlthough Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the [[Four Cardinal Principles]] of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|official view]] is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the [[primary stage of socialism]], in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place.

In the West and Third World, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOnly one Western classic communist party sided with the CPC, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]]. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the [[Soviets]], although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.\n\nAnother effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the [[International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations]] (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Germany]] (MLPD), the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Organization \u2013 Proletarian Way]]. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nThe [[Progressive Youth Organization]] was a Maoist organization in [[Afghanistan]].

The pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Belgium]] experienced a split of a Maoist wing under [[Jacques Grippa]]. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as Grippisten or Grippistes. When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the [[Communist Party of Belgium \u2013 Marxist\u2013Leninist]] (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized [[Borinage]] region of [[Wallonia]], but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party, and was recognized at the time of its foundation as the largest and most important Maoist organization in Europe outside of [[Albania]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjM-4ZG9iuMC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=pcbml+european+maoist+party&source=bl&ots=3WwrGN5owp&sig=ACfU3U02V3qK0mU9WsEzQhJvSbbQAhPMQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiplaaqlY7lAhUwIjQIHcZfBkoQ6AEwCnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=pcbml%20european%20maoist%20party&f=false|title=Maoism in the Developed World|last=Alexander|first=Robert Jackson|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275961480|location=|pages=59|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/world-outlook/v05n37-nov-17-1967-wo.pdf|title=End of the Road for Grippa?|last=|first=|date=17 November 1967|work=World Outlook|access-date=10 October 2019|page=930}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the PCBML never really gained a foothold in [[Flanders]], there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Ghent]], but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.<ref>D.

''Mao's China and After'', New York:Free Press, 1999. pp. 12\u201316.</ref>\n\n==== Iconoclastic revolution and anti-Confucianism ====\nBy the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of [[Confucianism]].<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 10.</ref> These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival\u2014or as historian of China [[Maurice Meisner]] would label it, their defection\u2014heralded the beginning of the destruction of the [[gentry]] as a social class in China.<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe fall of the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial Chinese dynasty]] in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and [[social conservatism]] in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 14.</ref>\n\nChinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by [[Chen Duxiu]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] which occurred between 1915 and 1919.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/> Proposing the \"total destruction of the traditions and values of the past\", the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the ''[[New Youth]]'', a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young [[Mao Zedong]], whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/>\n\n==== Nationalism and the appeal of Marxism ====\nAlong with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.</ref> Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in [[Shandong]] were\u2014without consultation with the Chinese\u2014transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe negative reaction culminated in the [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident]] in 1919 during which a protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan. The protest took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or being in the direct pay of, the Japanese.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Page 17\"/>\n\nAnother international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia. The [[Russian Revolution]] elicited great interest among Chinese intellectuals, although socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident.<ref name=After>Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 18.</ref> Afterwards, \"[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present\".<ref name=After/>\n\n=== Yan'an period between November 1935 and March 1947 ===\nDuring the period immediately following the [[Long March]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) were headquartered in [[Yan'an]], which is a prefecture-level city in [[Shaanxi]] province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the \"thought of Mao Zedong\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 45.</ref> The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\"/>\n\nAlthough the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved, including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically, the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) \"the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.</ref> These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.\n\n; Formative Maoist period (1927\u20131935)\nIn this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the \"Marxist method of political and class analysis\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.</ref> Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.\n\n; Mature Maoist period (1935\u20131940)\nIntellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December 1936). This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice.<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.</ref> Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u56fd\u9769\u547d\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u6218\u7565\u95ee\u989803531.jpg|thumb|''Strategic Issues in the Chinese Revolutionary War'' (1947)]]\n; Civil War period (1940\u20131949)\nUnlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory. He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge.<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\">Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.</ref> The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice: \"The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism\u2013Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east\".<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\"/> The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) [[dogmatism]], the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) [[empiricism]], excessive dependence on experience.\n\n; Post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory\nThe victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. \"Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.</ref> Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. \"In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 119.</ref>\n\n=== Differences from Marxism ===\nThe two differences between Maoism and [[Marxism]] are how the [[proletariat]] are defined and what political and economic conditions would start a [[communist revolution]]: \n# For [[Karl Marx]], the proletariat were the urban [[working class]], which was determined in the revolution by which the [[bourgeoisie]] overthrew [[feudalism]].<ref>Sandmo, Agnar. ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011, p.000.</ref> For Mao Zedong, the proletariat were the millions of peasants, to whom he referred as ''the popular masses''. Mao based his revolution upon the peasants, because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 \"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective\"]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref>\n# For Marx, [[proletarian revolution]] was internally fueled, by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]; that, as capitalism developed, \"a tension arises between the [[productive forces]] and the [[mode of production]]\".<ref>Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p.000.</ref> The political tension between the productive forces (the workers) and the owners of the [[means of production]] (the capitalists) would be an inevitable incentive to proletarian revolution, which would result in a [[Communist society]] as the main economic structure. Mao did not subscribe to Marx's proposal of inevitable cyclicality in the economic system. His goal was to unify the Chinese nation and so realize progressive change for China in the form of Communism, hence, revolution was needed as soon as possible.

Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]], Maoist Thought focuses on \"surrounding the cities from the countryside\".\n\nMaoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban [[Developed country|developed]] [[First World]] societies ruling over rural [[Developing country|developing]] [[Third World]] societies.<ref>Alexander C.

To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be told to the party so that the party can interpret them with a Marxist view.\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\nThe theory of the [[Cultural Revolution]] states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology\u2014the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.\n\n=== Contradiction ===\nMao drew from the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of \"contradiction\" (''maodun''). In two major essays, ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he adopts the [[positivist]]-[[empiricist]] idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: \"The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist\".<ref>Mao Tse Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm \"On contradiction\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Language Press, Peking, 1967, p. 75.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, each contradiction (including [[class struggle]], the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. \"There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions\".<ref>Mao Tse-Tung, \"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm On contradiction]\", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op. cit., p. 89.</ref>\n\nThus, the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction \"solidify\". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay ''[[On Practice]]'', \"on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\". Here, ''Practice'' connects \"contradiction\" with \"class struggle\" in the following way, claiming that inside a mode of production there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.<ref>Cfr. Mao Tse-Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm \"On practice. On the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op.cit., p. 55: \"Man's social practice is not confined to activity in production, but takes many forms&mdash;class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also though his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life)\".</ref>\n\nThese three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes&mdash;like Marx in trying to confront the \"bourgeois idealism\" of his time&mdash;that knowledge must be based on [[empirical evidence]].\n\nKnowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, \"scientifically\", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.\n\nMao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.\n\n[[File:Mao Zedong in Red.svg|thumb|Maoism is described as being [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] adapted to Chinese conditions whereas its variant [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] is considered universally applicable]]\n\n=== Three Worlds Theory ===\n[[Three Worlds Theory]] states that during the [[Cold War]] two imperialist states formed the \"first world\"\u2014the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are \"bought up\" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.<ref name=\"emg\">[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism \"Maoism\"]. Glossary of Terms. ''Encyclopedia of Marxism''.</ref>\n\n=== Agrarian socialism ===\nMaoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces\u2014this is known as [[agrarian socialism]]. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal, and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the framework of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], dismissing it as \"[[State capitalism|state capitalist]]\" and \"[[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]\", a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from [[Historical materialism|historical]] and [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nAlthough Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban [[industrialization]] as a prerequisite to expand [[economic development]] and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.<ref>John H. Badgley, John Wilson Lewis. Peasant Rebellion and Communist Revolution in Asia. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1974. p. 249.</ref>\n\n== In China ==\nIn its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as \"[[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] applied in a Chinese context\", synthesized by Mao and China's \"[[Generations of Chinese leadership|first-generation leaders]]\". It asserts that [[class struggle]] continues even if the [[proletariat]] has already overthrown the [[bourgeoisie]] and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed \"socialist construction\". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated \"imperialism and feudalism\" and created a \"New China\" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as [[Deng Xiaoping]] abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called \"[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|title=Xinhua: Constitution of the Communist Party of China|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017214011/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|archivedate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== After Mao Zedong's death ==\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony for the Vice Premier of China. - NARA - 183157-restored(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]]]]\nShortly after Mao's death in 1976, [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market reforms]] in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|title=UC Berkeley Journalism -Faculty - Deng's Revolution|accessdate=22 August 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132630/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|archivedate=4 January 2009}}</ref> Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to \"[[seek truth from facts]]\" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of [[ideology]] in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as [[Holy Writ|holy writ]], as was done in Mao's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's ''[[Reform and Opening]]'' economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's [[productive forces]].\n\nIn addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring [[capitalism]] and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are \"Maoist\".\n\nAlthough Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the [[Four Cardinal Principles]] of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|official view]] is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the [[primary stage of socialism]], in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place. The 35,000-word ''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'' reads: <blockquote>Chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'cultural revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong...

Many of the foreign parties that were [[fraternal party|fraternal parties]] aligned with the Chinese government before 1975 either disbanded, abandoned the new Chinese government entirely, or even renounced [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and developed into non-communist, [[social democratic]] parties.

In the West and Third World, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOnly one Western classic communist party sided with the CPC, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]]. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the [[Soviets]], although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.\n\nAnother effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the [[International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations]] (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Germany]] (MLPD), the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Organization \u2013 Proletarian Way]]. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nThe [[Progressive Youth Organization]] was a Maoist organization in [[Afghanistan]].

The pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Belgium]] experienced a split of a Maoist wing under [[Jacques Grippa]]. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as Grippisten or Grippistes. When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the [[Communist Party of Belgium \u2013 Marxist\u2013Leninist]] (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized [[Borinage]] region of [[Wallonia]], but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party, and was recognized at the time of its foundation as the largest and most important Maoist organization in Europe outside of [[Albania]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjM-4ZG9iuMC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=pcbml+european+maoist+party&source=bl&ots=3WwrGN5owp&sig=ACfU3U02V3qK0mU9WsEzQhJvSbbQAhPMQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiplaaqlY7lAhUwIjQIHcZfBkoQ6AEwCnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=pcbml%20european%20maoist%20party&f=false|title=Maoism in the Developed World|last=Alexander|first=Robert Jackson|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275961480|location=|pages=59|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/world-outlook/v05n37-nov-17-1967-wo.pdf|title=End of the Road for Grippa?|last=|first=|date=17 November 1967|work=World Outlook|access-date=10 October 2019|page=930}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the PCBML never really gained a foothold in [[Flanders]], there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Ghent]], but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.<ref>D.

The CPI (Maoist) is designated as a terrorist organisation in India under [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maoists-fourth-deadliest-terror-outfit-after-taliban-is-boko-haram-report/articleshow/54354196.cms|title=Maoists fourth deadliest terror outfit after Taliban, IS, Boko Haram: Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/864540/are-all-terrorists-really-muslims/|title=Are all terrorists really Muslims?|quote=Most terrorists in India are Hindus, the ones whom we have conveniently labelled 'Maoist' instead of 'Hindu'.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/718458/most-extremists-in-india-are-not-muslim-they-are-hindu|title=Most extremists in India are not Muslim \u2013 they are Hindu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/are-most-terrorists-in-india-muslims/293911|title=Are Most Terrorists In India Muslims?}}</ref>\n\n=== Iran ===\n{{main|1982 Amol uprising}}\nThe [[Union of Iranian Communists (Sarbedaran)]] was an [[Iran]] Maoist organization. The UIC (S) was formed in 1976 after the alliance of a number of Maoist groups carrying out military actions within Iran. In 1982, the UIC (S) mobilized forces in forests around [[Amol]] and launched an insurgency against the Islamist Government. The uprising was eventually a failure and many UIC (S) leaders were shot.\n\n=== Palestine ===\nThe [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] is a Maoist political and military organization. The DFLP's original political orientation was based on the view that Palestinian national goals could be achieved only through revolution of the masses and [[people's war]].\n\n=== Philippines ===\n{{main|Communist Party of the Philippines}}\nThe [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] is the largest communist party in the Philippines, active since December 26, 1968 (Mao's birthday). It was formed as a result of the [[First Great Rectification Movement]] and a split between the old [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930]] which the founders saw as revisionist. The CPP was formed on Maoist lines in stark contrast with the old PKP which put primary focus to the parliamentary struggle. The CPP was founded by [[Jose Maria Sison]] and other cadres from the old party.<ref name=\"saulo\">{{cite book|last=Saulo|first=Alfredo|title=Communism in the Philippines}}</ref>\n\nThe CPP also has an armed wing which it exercises absolute control over, namely the [[New People's Army]]. It currently wages a guerrilla war against the government of the Republic of the Philippines in the countryside and is still currently active. Both the CPP and the NPA are part of the [[National Democratic Front of the Philippines]], a consolidation of Maoist sectoral organizations such as [[Kabataang Makabayan]] as part of the united front strategy. The NDFP also represents the people's democratic government in peace talks.<ref name=\"cppsbp\">{{cite book|title=Constitution and Program|publisher=Communist Party of the Philippines|edition=2016|url=https://www.philippinerevolution.info/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2016-CPP-consti-ppdr_en.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Portugal ===\n[[File:Flag of For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril.svg|thumb|The flag of [[For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril|FP-25]]]]\nMaoist movements in Portugal were very active during the 1970s, especially during the [[Carnation Revolution]] that led to the fall of the fascist government the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] in 1974.\n\nThe largest Maoist movement in Portugal was the [[Portuguese Workers' Communist Party]]. The party was among the most active resistance movements before the [[Carnation Revolution|Portuguese democratic revolution of 1974]], especially among students of Lisbon. After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large and highly artistic mural paintings.\n\nIntensely active during 1974 and 1975, during that time the party had members that later came to be very important in national politics. For example, a future Prime Minister of Portugal, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]] was active within Maoist movements in Portugal and identified as a Maoist. In the 1980s, the [[For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril]] was another far-left Maoist armed organization operating in Portugal between 1980 and 1987 with the goal of creating socialism in post-[[Carnation Revolution]] Portugal.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe [[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)]] was a [[Spain|Spanish]] clandestine Maoist party. The armed wing of the party was [[First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups]].\n\n===Sweden===\nIn 1968, a small extremist Maoist sect called Rebellerna (\"The Rebels\") was established in [[Stockholm]]. Lead by [[Francisco Sarri\u00f3n]], the group unsuccessfully demanded the Chinese embassy to admit them into the Communist Party of China. The organization only lasted a few months.<ref>{{cite book |last1=S\u00e4fve |first1=Torbj\u00f6rn |title=Rebellerna i Sverige.

It was founded in 1972 with [[\u0130brahim Kaypakkaya]] as its first leader. The armed wing of the party is named the Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army in Turkey (TIKKO).\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Category:Maoist organisations in the United Kingdom}}\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States during the late 1960s, parts of the emerging [[New Left]] rejected the Marxism espoused by the Soviet Union and instead adopted pro-Chinese communism.\n\nThe [[Black Panther Party]], especially under the leadership of [[Huey Newton]], was influenced by Mao Zedong's ideas. Into the 1970s, Maoists in the United States, e.g. Maoist representative Jon Lux, formed a large part of the [[New Communist movement]].\n\nThe [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]] is also a Maoist movement.\n\n== Criticism and implementation ==\n[[File:ForbiddenCity MaoZedongPortrait (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Despite falling out of favor within the [[Communist Party of China]] by 1978, Mao is still revered, with Deng's famous \"70% right, 30% wrong\" line]]\nMaoism has fallen out of favour within the Communist Party of China, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978. Deng believed that Maoism showed the dangers of \"ultra-leftism\", manifested in the harm perpetrated by the various mass movements that characterized the Maoist era. In Chinese communism, the term \"left\" can be taken as a euphemism for Maoist policies. However, Deng stated that the revolutionary side of Maoism should be considered separate from the governance side, leading to his famous epithet that Mao was \"70% right, 30% wrong\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ips-journal.eu/in-focus/the-politics-of-memory/article/show/70-per-cent-good-30-per-cent-bad-2216/|title=70 per cent good, 30 per cent bad|publisher=}}</ref> Chinese scholars generally agree that Deng's interpretation of Maoism preserves the legitimacy of Communist rule in China, but at the same time criticizes Mao's brand of economic and political governance.\n\nCritic Graham Young says that Maoists see [[Joseph Stalin]] as the last true socialist leader of the Soviet Union, but allows that the Maoist assessments of Stalin vary between the extremely positive and the more ambivalent.<ref>Graham Young, ''On Socialist Development and the Two Roads'', The Australian Journal of Chinese Affairs, No. 8 (July 1982), pp. 75\u201384, {{doi|10.2307/2158927}}.</ref> Some political philosophers, such as Martin Cohen, have seen in Maoism an attempt to combine [[Confucianism]] and [[socialism]]\u2014what one such called \"a third way between communism and capitalism\".<ref>Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Martin Cohen, p. 206, published 2001 by Pluto Press, London and Sterling VA {{ISBN|0-7453-1603-4}}.</ref>\n\n[[Enver Hoxha]] critiqued Maoism from a Marxist\u2013Leninist perspective, arguing that New Democracy halts class struggle,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch6.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> the theory of the three worlds is \"counter-revolutionary\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch4.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref> and questioned Mao's guerilla warfare methods.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/imp_rev/imp_ch3.htm|title=Enver Hoxha: Imperialism and the Revolution (1979)|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>\n\nSome say Mao departed from Leninism not only in his near-total lack of interest in the urban working class, but also in his concept of the nature and role of the party. For Lenin, the party was sacrosanct because it was the incarnation of the \"proletarian consciousness\" and there was no question about who were the teachers and who were the pupils.

Page 44\"/> The concept of \"[[people's war]]\" which is so central to Maoist thought is directly populist in its origins. Mao believed that intellectuals and party cadres had to become first students of the masses to become teachers of the masses later. This concept was vital to the strategy of the aforementioned \"people's war\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

{"title_page": "Addled Parliament", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Parliaments of England 1601}}\n\nThe '''Parliament of 1614''' was the second [[Parliament of England]] of the reign of [[James VI and I]], which sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614.

Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614.

Lasting only two months, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. This spreading, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. The Commons were pitted against the Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 MPs sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James fell back on new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20141625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} urging for \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the [[Blessed Parliament]], was called in 1604; it took seven years, five sessions, to dissolve,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in the Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, to ease outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, unification faced such criticism from MPs that it was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of between \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|Impositions were bringing James \u00a370,000 annually, a sum which would only expand with the growth of trade in England.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} By the 1630s, they were bringing the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament were outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hope of securing at least some more funds, James grew impatient, and proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament on 31 December.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98-99}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed the meeting,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, reluctantly, James summoned another parliament in 1614. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Prologue===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344-345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251-252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221-222}} and James was unapologetic in packing the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]].

James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's grievances.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} A large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament,{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors found themselves in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222-223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the crown.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} However, there is more evidence of an apathy towards this Parliament from the [[Privy Council]]: few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41-42}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597-98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels, his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience precipitated the disorder that Parliament would quickly descend into.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though an spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening: Rumours and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies.

For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had finally been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} By the end, resentment against the undertakers had dissipated, and Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation from Parliament in his efforts to remedy its grievances.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116-117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130-131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broke down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132-133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===Finale: James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinancy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton was finally gratified, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.

It has a population of 67,038, and is the industrial capital of the [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego Province]]. It is located {{convert|212|km}} north-east of [[Ushuaia]] the capital of the province. It is one of the southernmost cities on [[Earth]].\n\nIt is served by [[Hermes Quijada International Airport]].\n\n==History==\n\nSheep farming, as many other places in [[Patagonia]], was the main impetus for population settlements beginning in the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nAbundant rivers, the seacoast, and good [[pasture]]s were some of the reasons that fueled population growth. R\u00edo Grande was founded on July 11, 1921, when the central government issued a decree recognising this locality as the \"Agricultural Colony of R\u00edo Grande\".\n\nIn the beginning, the land was subdivided among a few families, owning large estates until the [[agrarian reform]] of 1925. Cattle raising became one of the most important economic activities in the area.\n\nTo promote industrial development, Tierra del Fuego is excluded from VAT and federal income tax. As a result, several manufacturing companies, particularly those involving electronic products, have opened factories in this city. The population grew as a result of the television set production and assembly plants which opened in the 1980s, notably by [[ITT Inc.|ITT]]. One of the most rapidly growing sectors is the production of [[laptop]]s and [[netbook]]s. These products were totally imported until 2006 but by 2010, and due to initiatives under the Kirchner administrations, 42% of the Argentine market for these goods was supplied by firms established in R\u00edo Grande and [[Vicente L\u00f3pez, Buenos Aires|Vicente L\u00f3pez]]. [[Portfolio investment]]s announced in 2011 plan the production of 6.9 million units in Tierra del Fuego Province, principally in R\u00edo Grande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tecnologia.iprofesional.com/notas/115015-En-2012-mas-de-la-mitad-de-las-computadoras-vendidas-en-el-pais-seran-nacionales|title=En 2012 m\u00e1s de la mitad de las computadoras vendidas en el pa\u00eds ser\u00e1n nacionales|publisher=iProfesional.com}}</ref>\n\nThe city's population has grown rapidly since 1980. Many people have relocated from the northern parts of Argentina and from other countries, such as Bolivia, to work in factories that offer higher wages than other parts of Argentina.\n\nIn 2014 a mob of some 300 vehicles blocked the escape of the support staff for the BBC Television program ''[[Top Gear: Patagonia Special|Top Gear]]'' after they had already been attacked with eggs and stones in [[Tolhuin]], which prompted everyone to move cross-country, leaving the main road. Arriving at the river border crossing, the crew were to illegally cross the border into Chile, which they were all able to do successfully.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/top-gear/11137879/Jeremy-Clarkson-stoned-as-Top-Gear-crew-abandon-cars-and-flee-Argentina.html|title=Jeremy Clarkson 'stoned' as Top Gear crew abandon cars and flee Argentina|publisher=}}</ref><ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jeremy-clarkson-footage-of-top-gear-team-under-attack-is-real-insists-presenter-9938231.html</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nRio Grande's climate is strongly influenced by the ocean: generally quite cool, and sometimes very windy.

It has a population of 67,038, and is the industrial capital of the [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina|Tierra del Fuego Province]]. It is located {{convert|212|km}} north-east of [[Ushuaia]] the capital of the province.\n\nIt is served by [[Hermes Quijada International Airport]].\n\n==History==\n\nSheep farming, as many other places in [[Patagonia]], was the main impetus for population settlements beginning in the late 19th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nAbundant rivers, the seacoast, and good [[pasture]]s were some of the reasons that fueled population growth. R\u00edo Grande was founded on July 11, 1921, when the central government issued a decree recognising this locality as the \"Agricultural Colony of R\u00edo Grande\".\n\nIn the beginning, the land was subdivided among a few families, owning large estates until the [[agrarian reform]] of 1925. Cattle raising became one of the most important economic activities in the area.\n\nTo promote industrial development, Tierra del Fuego is excluded from VAT and federal income tax. As a result, several manufacturing companies, particularly those involving electronic products, have opened factories in this city. The population grew as a result of the television set production and assembly plants which opened in the 1980s, notably by [[ITT Inc.|ITT]]. One of the most rapidly growing sectors is the production of [[laptop]]s and [[netbook]]s. These products were totally imported until 2006 but by 2010, and due to initiatives under the Kirchner administrations, 42% of the Argentine market for these goods was supplied by firms established in R\u00edo Grande and [[Vicente L\u00f3pez, Buenos Aires|Vicente L\u00f3pez]]. [[Portfolio investment]]s announced in 2011 plan the production of 6.9 million units in Tierra del Fuego Province, principally in R\u00edo Grande.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tecnologia.iprofesional.com/notas/115015-En-2012-mas-de-la-mitad-de-las-computadoras-vendidas-en-el-pais-seran-nacionales|title=En 2012 m\u00e1s de la mitad de las computadoras vendidas en el pa\u00eds ser\u00e1n nacionales|publisher=iProfesional.com}}</ref>\n\nThe city's population has grown rapidly since 1980. Many people have relocated from the northern parts of Argentina and from other countries, such as Bolivia, to work in factories that offer higher wages than other parts of Argentina.\n\nIn 2014 a mob of some 300 vehicles blocked the escape of the support staff for the BBC Television program ''[[Top Gear: Patagonia Special|Top Gear]]'' after they had already been attacked with eggs and stones in [[Tolhuin]], which prompted everyone to move cross-country, leaving the main road. Arriving at the river border crossing, the crew were to illegally cross the border into Chile, which they were all able to do successfully.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/top-gear/11137879/Jeremy-Clarkson-stoned-as-Top-Gear-crew-abandon-cars-and-flee-Argentina.html|title=Jeremy Clarkson 'stoned' as Top Gear crew abandon cars and flee Argentina|publisher=}}</ref><ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jeremy-clarkson-footage-of-top-gear-team-under-attack-is-real-insists-presenter-9938231.html</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n\nRio Grande's climate is strongly influenced by the ocean: generally quite cool, and sometimes very windy.

Lofoten is known for a distinctive scenery with dramatic mountains and peaks, open sea and sheltered [[bay]]s, beaches and untouched lands. Its capital and largest town, [[Leknes|Leknes]], lies approximately 169 km inside the [[Arctic Circle]], or approximately 2,420 km away from the [[North Pole]], thus making Lofoten one of the world's northernmost populated regions. Though lying within the Arctic Circle, the [[archipelago]] experiences one of the world's largest elevated temperature anomalies relative to its [[Polar region|high]] [[latitude]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Lofoten'' ({{lang-non|L\u00f3f\u00f3t}}) was the original name of the island [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8ya]]. The first element is ''l\u00f3'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"[[lynx]]\") and the last element is derived from Norse ''f\u00f3tr'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"foot\"), as the shape of the island must have been compared with that of a lynx's foot. (The old name of the neighbouring island [[Flakstad\u00f8ya]] was ''Vargf\u00f3t'', \"[[wolf]]'s foot\", from ''vargr'' \"wolf\". See also [[Ofoten]].)\n\n== History ==\n[[File:(Raftsund, Lofoten, Digermulen, Norway) (LOC) (3175025812).jpg|thumb|\"Raftsund, Lofoten, Digermulen, Norway\", c. 1890\u20131900.]]\n\"There is evidence of human settlement extending back at least 11,000 years in Lofoten, and the earliest archaeological sites ... are only about 5,500 years old, at the transition from the early to [[late Stone Age]].\" [[Iron Age]] agriculture, livestock, and significant human habitation can be traced back to {{nowrap|c. 250 BC.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert M. |last=D'Anjou |first2=Raymond S. |last2=Bradley |first3=Nicholas L. |last3=Balascio |first4=David B. |last4=Finkelstein |title=Climate impacts on human settlement and agricultural activities in northern Norway revealed through sediment biogeochemistry |journal=PNAS |volume=109 |issue=50 |pages=20332\u201320337 |year=2012 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1212730109 }}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Lofoten Svolvear F\u00e4hrhafen Ausfahrt.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Svolv\u00e6r in Lofoten, Norway.

It existed in the early [[Viking Age]], maybe earlier, and was located on the southern coast on eastern Lofoten, near today's village [[Kabelv\u00e5g]] in [[V\u00e5gan]] municipality. However, the [[Lofotr Viking Museum]] with the reconstructed 83-metre-long [[Mead hall|longhouse]] (the largest known) is located near Borg on [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y]], which has many archeological finds from the Iron Age and Viking Age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travels-in-time.net/e/norway15moneng.htm|title=Norway \u2013 Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y \u2013 Vendalsjord|author=|date=|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe islands have for more than 1,000 years been the centre of great [[cod]] [[fisheries]], especially in winter, when the cod migrates south from the [[Barents Sea]] and gathers in Lofoten to [[spawn (biology)|spawn]]. [[Bergen]] in southwestern Norway was for a long time the hub for further export south to different parts of Europe, particularly so when trade was controlled by the [[Hanseatic League]]. In the lowland areas, particularly Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y, agriculture plays a significant role, as it has done since the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nLofotr was originally the name of the island of Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y only. Later it became the name of the chain of islands. The chain of islands with its pointed peaks looks like a lynx foot from the mainland. In Norwegian, it is always a singular. Another name one might come across, is \"Lofotveggen\" or the Lofoten wall. The archipelago looks like a closed wall when seen from elevated points around [[Bod\u00f8]] or when arriving from the sea, some {{convert|100|km|abbr=off}} long, and {{convert|800|-|1,000|m|abbr=off}} high.\n\nIn March 1941 the islands were raided by [[British Commandos]] during [[Operation Claymore]], and in a subsequent [[Operation Anklet|diversionary attack]] to support the [[Operation Archery|Vaagso raid]] in December.\n\nAs of 2017, the islands attract one million tourists a year.<ref name=\"vecono\" >{{cite news|title=Why Norway may leave $65bn worth of oil in the ground|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2017/08/economist-explains-12|work=[[The Economist]]|author=M.F.|date=29 Aug 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Map-of-Lofoten-and-Vesteraalen.svg|thumb|Lofoten and [[Vester\u00e5len]].]]\nLofoten is located at the [[68th parallel north|68th]] and [[69th parallel north|69th parallels north]] of the [[Arctic Circle]] in [[North Norway]]. It is known for its natural environment within Norway. Lofoten encompasses the municipalities of [[V\u00e5gan]], [[Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y]], [[Flakstad]], [[Moskenes]], [[V\u00e6r\u00f8y]], and [[R\u00f8st]].

The total land area amounts to {{convert|1,227|km2|abbr=off}}, and the population totals 24,500.\nMany will argue that Hinn\u00f8ya, the northern part of [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] and several hundred smaller islands, skerries and rocks to the east of [[Austv\u00e5g\u00f8y]] are also part of the Lofoten complex. Historically, the territorial definition of Lofoten has changed significantly. Between the mainland and the Lofoten archipelago lies the vast, open [[Vestfjorden]], and to the north is [[Vester\u00e5len]]. The principal towns in Lofoten are [[Leknes]] in Vestv\u00e5g\u00f8y and [[Svolv\u00e6r]] in V\u00e5gan. The main islands are joined to each other and the mainland by road bridges.

Lofoten is known for a distinctive scenery with dramatic mountains and peaks, open sea and sheltered [[bay]]s, beaches and untouched lands. Its capital and largest town, [[Leknes|Leknes]], lies approximately 169 km inside the [[Arctic Circle]], or approximately 2,420 km away from the [[North Pole]], thus making Lofoten one of the world's northernmost populated regions.

The first element is ''l\u00f3'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"[[lynx]]\") and the last element is derived from Norse ''f\u00f3tr'' (i.e.,&nbsp;\"foot\"), as the shape of the island must have been compared with that of a lynx's foot.

Later it became the name of the chain of islands. The chain of islands with its pointed peaks looks like a lynx foot from the mainland. In Norwegian, it is always a singular.

However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind.<ref name=\"ROBW\" />\n\nLeif wintered in 1001, probably near [[Cape Bauld]] on the northern tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], where one day his foster father [[Tyrker]] was found drunk, on what the saga describes as \"wine-berries.\" [[Viburnum edule|Squashberries]], [[gooseberries]], and [[Cranberry|cranberries]] all grew wild in the area.

Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the [[barricade]]. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring.

North America, by the name [[Winland]], first appeared in written sources in a work by [[Adam of Bremen]] from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], were recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries.

It was in Vinland that the settlement described in the sagas was founded.\n\n===Leif's winter camp===\n[[File:Sk\u00e1lholt-Karte.png|thumb|The 1590 [[Sk\u00e1lholt Map]] showing Latinized Norse placenames in North America<ref>http://www.myoldmaps.com/renaissance-maps-1490-1800/4316-skalholt-map/4316-skalholt-map.pdf</ref>:\n* Land of the ''[[J\u00f6tunn|Risi]]'' (a [[Norse cosmology|mythical location]])\n* [[Greenland]]\n* [[Helluland]] ([[Baffin Island]])\n* [[Markland]] (the [[Labrador Peninsula]])\n* Land of the ''[[Skr\u00e6lingjar]]'' (location undetermined)\n* Promontory of [[Vinland]] (the [[Great Northern Peninsula]])]]\n\nUsing the routes, landmarks, [[ocean current|currents]], rocks, and winds that Bjarni had described to him, Leif sailed from Greenland westward across the Labrador Sea, with a crew of 35\u2014sailing the same [[knarr]] Bjarni had used to make the voyage. He described Helluland as \"level and wooded, with broad white beaches wherever they went and a gently sloping shoreline.\"<ref name=\"ROBW\" /> Leif and others had wanted his father, Erik the Red, to lead this expedition and talked him into it.  However, as Erik attempted to join his son Leif on the voyage towards these new lands, he fell off his horse as it slipped on the wet rocks near the shore; thus he was injured and stayed behind.<ref name=\"ROBW\" />\n\nLeif wintered in 1001, probably near [[Cape Bauld]] on the northern tip of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], where one day his foster father [[Tyrker]] was found drunk, on what the saga describes as \"wine-berries.\" [[Viburnum edule|Squashberries]], [[gooseberries]], and [[Cranberry|cranberries]] all grew wild in the area. There are varying explanations for Leif apparently describing [[Fermentation (wine)|fermented berries]] as \"wine.\"\n\nLeif spent another winter at \"Leifsb\u00fa\u00f0ir\" without conflict, and sailed back to [[Brattahl\u00ed\u00f0]] in Greenland to assume filial duties to his father.\n\n===Thorvald's voyage (1004 AD)===\nIn 1004, Leif's brother [[Thorvald Eiriksson]] sailed with a crew of 30 men to Vinland and spent the following winter at Leif's camp. In the spring, Thorvald attacked nine of the local people who were sleeping under three skin-covered [[canoe]]s. The ninth victim escaped and soon came back to the Norse camp with a force. Thorvald was killed by an arrow that succeeded in passing through the [[barricade]]. Although brief hostilities ensued, the Norse explorers stayed another winter and left the following spring. Subsequently, another of Leif's brothers, Thorstein, sailed to the New World to retrieve his dead brother's body, but he died before leaving Greenland.<ref name=\"ROBW\" />\n\n[[File:I. E. C.

After a cruel winter, he headed south and landed at [[Straumfj\u00f6r\u00f0|''Straumfjord'']].  He later moved to ''Straums\u00f6y'', possibly because the current was stronger there.  A sign of peaceful relations between the  [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and the Norsemen is noted here. The two sides [[barter]]ed with furs and [[eastern gray squirrel|gray squirrel]] skins for [[milk]] and red cloth, which the natives tied around their heads as a sort of [[headdress]].\n\nThere are conflicting stories but one account states that a bull belonging to Karlsefni came storming out of the wood, so frightening the natives that they ran to their skin-boats and rowed away.

The sagas first gained serious historic respectability in 1837 when the Danish antiquarian [[Carl Christian Rafn]] pointed out the possibility for a Norse settlement in, or voyages to, North America. North America, by the name [[Winland]], first appeared in written sources in a work by [[Adam of Bremen]] from approximately 1075. The most important works about North America and the early Norse activities there, namely the [[Sagas of Icelanders]], were recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries. These Norse sites were also depicted in the [[Sk\u00e1lholt#Sk\u00e1lholt map|Sk\u00e1lholt Map]], made by an Icelandic teacher in 1570 and depicting part of northeastern North America and mentioning Helluland, Markland and Vinland.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ingstad|first1=Helga|last2=Ingstad|first2=Anne Stine|title=The Viking Discovery of America: The Excavation of a Norse Settlement in L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland|date=2001|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0816047161|page=111|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gj-I5hdpzGoC&pg=PA111&dq=Sk%C3%A1lholt+Map+%22north+america%22#v=onepage&q=Sk%C3%A1lholt%20Map%20%22north%20america%22&f=false|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nEvidence of the Norse west of Greenland came in the 1960s when archaeologist [[Anne Stine Ingstad]] and her husband, outdoorsman and author [[Helge Ingstad]], excavated a Norse site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in [[Newfoundland]].

The location of Vinland poses a thornier question.\n\nIn 2012 Canadian researchers identified possible signs of Norse outposts in [[Nanook, Baffin Island|Nanook]] at [[Tanfield Valley]] on [[Baffin Island]], as well as on Nunguvik, Willows Island, and [[Avayalik]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/10/121019-viking-outpost-second-new-canada-science-sutherland/ |title=Evidence of Viking Outpost Found in Canada |accessdate=2013-01-28 |last=Pringle |first=Heather |date=19 Oct 2012 |work=National Geographic News |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Vikings and Native Americans |journal=National Geographic |date=November 2012 |first=Heather |last=Pringle |volume=221 |issue=11 |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/vikings-and-indians/pringle-text |accessdate=2013-01-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=The Nature of Things|url=http://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episode/the-norse-an-arctic-mystery.html |title=The Norse: An Arctic Mystery |accessdate=2013-01-29 |authorlink=The Nature of Things |date=22 Nov 2012 |publisher=[[CBC Television]]}}</ref> Unusual fabric cordage found on Baffin Island in the 1980s and stored at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] was identified in 1999 as possibly of Norse manufacture; that discovery led to more in-depth exploration of the Tanfield Valley archaeological site for points of contact between Norse Greenlanders and the indigenous [[Dorset culture|Dorset people]].<ref>{{cite conference | first =Patricia | last =Sutherland | author-link=Patricia Sutherland|title =Strands of Culture Contact: Dorset-Norse Interactions in the Canadian Eastern Arctic | book-title =Identities and Cultural Contacts in the Arctic: Proceedings from a Conference at the Danish National Museum, Copenhagen, November 30 to December 2, 1999 |editor-first1=Martin |editor-last1=Appelt |editor-first2=Joel |editor-last2=Berglund |editor-first3=Hans Christian |editor-last3=Gull\u00f8v | pages =159\u2013169 | publisher =The Danish National Museum & Danish Polar Center | date =2000 | location =Copenhagen, Denmark | url =https://www.historymuseum.ca/learn/research/resources-for-scholars/essays/dorset-norse-interactions-in-the-canadian-eastern-arctic/ | access-date =December 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/archeo/helluland/str0301e.html | title =Strangers, Partners, Neighbors?
