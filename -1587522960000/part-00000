One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel Universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ara\u00f1a]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].\n\nMany other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as the [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;<ref name =\"Black spider\">{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones & Beatty |title=''Batman'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> in the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders. In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Static Shock|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story. Trapped in a world based around Japanese role-playing game [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, she makes use of webs, various types of poison and venom attacks, and her intellect to survive.<ref>Kakashi, A., & Baba, O.

Due to her father's skill with cloth dyeing, Arachne became adept in the art of weaving.

The goddess conceded that Arachne's weaving was flawless, but she was infuriated by the mortal's pride.

One of the most notable characters in comic book history has taken his identity from the spider, the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book hero [[Spider-Man]]. Peter Parker was accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider and then, as Spider-Man, was able to scale tall buildings and shoot web fluid from a device attached to his wrist. Along with these abilities, came super senses and instant reflexes. Writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Steve Ditko]] originated this franchise. Due to the character's popularity, Spider-Man appeared in [[Spider-Man in other media|movies and various other media]]. In addition to Spider-Man, the [[Marvel Universe]] includes several subsequent characters using the spider as their patron; including [[Spider-Woman]], [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Spider-Girl]], the [[Scarlet Spider]], [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], [[Ara\u00f1a]], the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]], and the [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]]. The [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] also include characters named [[Spider Girl]] and the [[Tarantula (DC Comics)|Tarantula]].\n\nMany other comic book, [[manga]] and [[anime]] characters have taken the guise of a spider, such as the [[Black Spider]] from the [[Batman]] universe;<ref name =\"Black spider\">{{cite book |last=Moench |author2=Jones & Beatty |title=''Batman'' #518|date=May 1995 |publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> in the [[Pok\u00e9mon]] franchise, [[Spinarak]] and [[Ariados]], [[Joltik]] and [[Galvantula]], and [[Dewpider]] and [[Araquanid]], are all variously based on spiders. In the ''[[Static Shock]]'' series, [[Static Shock|Anansi the Spider]] takes his name and techniques from the African trickster god. In the second season of the anime based on the manga ''[[Kuroshitsuji]]'', one main antagonist, the demon butler Claude Faustus, has spiderlike qualities and powers. He is also capable of transforming into a spider and making webs.\n\nIn the manga ''[[The Saga of Darren Shan]]'', the titular character is fascinated by spiders. He kept them as pets until he killed one that he got when he was nine years old. He used to let them go into his mouth and he would imagine them eating him from the inside out. Normally, the spiders would stay with him for about a day or two, but some lasted longer. Later on, we find out that he can communicate with spiders.\n\nThe manga ''[[Ghost in The Shell]]'' by [[Masamune Shirow]] prominently features spiderlike, AI-equipped, multi-legged combat vehicles called [[Fuchikoma]] (evolving into the [[Tachikoma]], Uchikoma and Logicoma in subsequent anime versions of the series). These mobile weapon platforms are used by the members of [[Section 9]] to aid in their various missions.\nIn the manga ''[[Monster Musume]]'' by [[Okayado]], the character Rachnera Arachnera is an Arachne who is feared by her host family and initially abandoned. She demonstrates skills in web weaving. She initially hated humans for how judgmental they were of her,\nbut Kimihito was able to change her mind;\nshe now lives with him.\n\nThe [[light novel]] and manga series ''[[So I'm a Spider, So What?]]'', the protagonist is turned into a spider at the beginning of the story. Trapped in a world based around Japanese role-playing game [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s, she makes use of webs, various types of poison and venom attacks, and her intellect to survive.<ref>Kakashi, A., & Baba, O.

[[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] of samples collected through [[nasopharyngeal swab]] is the most commonly used method for detection of the virus.<ref name=\"Abdul-Rasool_2010\" /> [[Viral culture]] or [[blood serum]] testing for [[antibodies]] may also be used for the confirmation of infection.\n\n==Prevention==\nThe United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends several measures for the prevention of infection with HCoV-NL63 including:  washing hands often with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and not touching the eyes, mouth, or nose.<ref>{{cite web | work = Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/ | title = About Coronavirus | access-date = July 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment and prognosis==\nTreatment for the HCoV-NL63 virus is dependent on the severity of associated symptomology.  Most mild to moderate infections will go away on their own.  Symptoms can be relieved by taking a pain reliever or fever medication, taking a hot shower, or using a [[humidifier]].  [[Antiviral]] treatment may be necessary for infected patients that end up in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) due to [[acute respiratory infection]].  [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] is an [[FDA]] approved HCoV-NL63 inhibitor that is also used to treat [[primary immune deficiency]], [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]], and [[Kawasaki disease]].<ref name=\"van_der_Hoek_2006\" />\n\n==Recent research==\nRecent data suggest an association of ''HCoV-NL63'' infection with [[Kawasaki disease]], a systemic [[vasculitis]] in childhood that may result in [[aneurysm]]s of the coronary arteries. In the developed world, Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children.<ref>{{cite web | work = Mayo Clinic | url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kawasaki-disease/basics/definition/con-20024663 | title = Kawasaki Disease | access-date = July 22, 2015 }}</ref> Further analysis of HCoV-NL63 pathogenicity seems warranted, in particular because of recent evidence that this virus uses the same cellular receptor as [[SARS coronavirus|SARS-CoV]] ([[ACE2]]).<ref name=\"Hofmann_2005\" /> HCoV-NL63 has also been found in the intestinal tract of infected individuals and linked to [[gastroenteritis]].<ref name=\"Fielding_2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fielding BC | title = Human coronavirus NL63: a clinically important virus? | journal = Future Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 153\u20139 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21366416 | doi = 10.2217/fmb.10.166 | doi-access = free }}</ref> This type of infection is the direct result of the viral invasion of the [[mucosal lining]] of the intestines.  The role of HCoV-NL63 in gastroenteritis is unclear due to typical co-infection with other viruses in this condition. HCoV-NL63 is likely under-detected due its role in many mild to moderate respiratory infections and comorbidity with other disease.  Researchers have suggested that more comprehensive, population-based studies are necessary to determine the effects of this virus on systems outside of the respiratory tract.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Human coronavirus NL63|''Human coronavirus NL63''}}\n\n{{Human coronaviruses}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q8351095}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Human Coronavirus Nl63}}\n[[Category:Alphacoronaviruses]]\n[[Category:Viral respiratory tract infections]]\n", "name_user": "72.74.52.198", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eMechanism)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63"}

A long process of development and financing began in 2005, with filming commencing in April 2010.\n\n[[Tilda Swinton]] stars as the mother of Kevin, struggling to come to terms with her son and the horrors he has committed. The film premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2011.\n\nSwinton was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] for Best Actress in a Leading Role. It received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences alike.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Kevin Khatchadourian is in prison after committing a [[massacre]] at his high school. His mother, Eva, once a successful [[travel writer]], lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near the prison, where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the hostility of her neighbors. \n\nKevin is detached and difficult from childhood. He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva, and she has trouble bonding with him. As a baby, he cries incessantly, but only around her; as a child, he resists [[toilet training]], rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. He behaves like a happy, loving son when his father Franklin is watching. Eva's frustration drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. Kevin tells Franklin he fell, using the incident to manipulate Eva into doing what he wants.\n\nFranklin dismisses Eva's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever, Eva reads him a book about [[Robin Hood]]; when Robin competes in [[John, King of England|Prince John]]'s archery contest, Kevin shows Eva affection for the first time. Franklin gives him a [[bow and arrow]] and teaches him [[archery]].\n\nEva and Franklin have a second child, Celia, who is lively and cheerful. However, Kevin is disdainful and jealous. A few years later, Celia's pet guinea pig is killed and she is blinded in one eye by caustic cleaning fluid. Eva suspects Kevin is to blame, but Franklin defends him. Eva's suspicion strains the couple's marriage and they discuss divorce. Eva comes to fear her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's sadism.\n\nAs a teenager, Kevin locks several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow. When Eva arrives home, she finds Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia. On the second anniversary of the massacre, Eva visits Kevin in prison. Eva asks him why he committed the murders. Kevin, who is about to be transferred to an adult prison, responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure. Eva hugs Kevin and walks away sadly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Eva Khatchadourian\n* [[John C.

A long process of development and financing began in 2005, with filming commencing in April 2010.\n\n[[Tilda Swinton]] stars as the mother of Kevin, struggling to come to terms with her son and the horrors he has committed. The film premiered at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]] and was released in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2011.\n\nSwinton was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]], [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and the [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] for Best Actress in a Leading Role. It received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences alike.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Kevin Khatchadourian is in prison after committing a [[massacre]] at his high school. His mother, Eva, once a successful [[travel writer]], lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near the prison, where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the hostility of her neighbors. \n\nKevin is detached and difficult from childhood. He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva, and she has trouble bonding with him. As a baby, he cries incessantly, but only around her; as a child, he resists [[toilet training]], rebuffs Eva's attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. He behaves like a happy, loving son when his father Franklin is watching. Eva's frustration drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. Kevin tells Franklin he fell, using the incident to manipulate Eva into doing what he wants.\n\nFranklin dismisses Eva's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever, Eva reads him a book about [[Robin Hood]]; when Robin competes in [[John, King of England|Prince John]]'s archery contest, Kevin shows Eva affection for the first time. Franklin gives him a [[bow and arrow]] and teaches him [[archery]].\n\nEva and Franklin have a second child, Celia, who is lively and cheerful. However, Kevin is disdainful and jealous. A few years later, Celia's pet guinea pig is killed and she is blinded in one eye by caustic cleaning fluid. Eva suspects Kevin is to blame, but Franklin defends him. Eva's suspicion strains the couple's marriage and they discuss divorce. Eva comes to fear her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's sadism.\n\nAs a teenager, Kevin locks several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow. When Eva arrives home, she finds Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia. On the second anniversary of the massacre, Eva visits Kevin in prison. Eva asks him why he committed the murders. Kevin, who is about to be transferred to an adult prison, responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure. Eva hugs Kevin and walks away sadly.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tilda Swinton]] as Eva Khatchadourian\n* [[John C.

Non-piercing jewelry refers to any type of jewelry that fastens to the body without piercing the skin. There are numerous possibilities for [[illusion]] jewelry available from clip-on earrings or a fake belly ring. Jewelry may be worn for fashion, cultural tradition, religious beliefs, personal symbolism, and many other reasons. These temporary jewelry options give people the freedom to try out body jewelry and figure out if it's right for them. The term is most commonly used in reference to body jewelry, but it also includes clip-on earrings.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warber (Jewelry Designer) |first1=Adrienne |title=Non Piercing Jewelry |url=https://jewelry.lovetoknow.com/Non_Piercing_Jewelry |website=Love To Know |accessdate=22 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Benefits ==\nBody piercing sometimes has a long healing process. For example, a [[belly ring]] can take six months to a year to properly heal. Sometimes during a long healing process, the risk of [[infection]] is greater. Piercing can also pose a risk for people with [[nickel allergy|metal allergies]]. Sometimes fake body jewelry is a healthier option for people concerned about the risks of piercing.\n\nPeople can find temporary jewelry to decorate any part of their body, including intimate areas. It may even be safer to select clip-on jewelry for certain parts of their body that people'd rather not have pierced.\n\nConsidering temporary body jewelry give people new jewelry styles. It could help users decide if piercing is right for them, or this type of jewelry could simply add new fashion possibilities to their wardrobe. If someone are trying out body jewelry, temporary jewelry can help him/ her safely experiment with different looks without committing to the piercing process. This is a good way to see if people even like the look and if it feels right.\n\n== Fastening Methods ==\nThere are several different fastening methods for non-piercing jewelry:\n* Metal clip-on devices\n* Spring hoop\n* Magnets\n* Stick-on adhesives\n\n== Types ==\nFaux body jewelry comes in many forms. Common types of body decoration include:\n* Belly rings: Belly rings decorate the navel area. This jewelry comes in styles with dangling charms or gemstones as well as fake studs.\n* Monroes: Named after actress Marilyn Monroe's famous beauty mark, monroes are imitation studs that are placed above the upper lip on either the right or left side of the mouth. Some faux monroes are gemstones and others have a design.\n* Lip hoops: Small lip hoops are easy to attach because many simply clip on. They come in traditional silver or gold, and other colors ranging from red to blue.\n* Nipple shields: Nipple shields for a pierced look vary from simple metal shapes to elaborate metal designs. Small stud-like and dangle type designs are also available.\n* Plugs: Cheater plugs look like the real thing without any ear stretching. Many screw on to fit. Some are simply plug designs attached to a stud that requires traditional ear piercing and won't work for non-pierced ears.\n\n== Quality ==\nPierced-look jewelry is available in a range of materials at various price ranges. people can find stainless steel, sterling silver, and titanium jewelry, as well as 14K yellow and white gold pieces. People with metal allergies should look for jewelry labeled as nickel-free or hypoallergenic. Stainless steel jewelry, yellow gold and titanium is sometimes an option for some people with metal allergies, but even these can be an issue for others. Be careful with plated metals, sterling silver and white gold because they may contain nickel.The higher end items tend to have better craftsmanship and last longer. Cheaper clip-on jewelry is typically lower quality and may not be as durable. If possible, examine the jewelry before purchase for overall quality and check to make sure the fasteners don't have sharp edges or loose fittings.\n\n== Tips for trying out ==\n* Here are some tips for trying out non piercing body jewelry: \n* Pick jewelry styles that work with their wardrobe and lifestyle. If people decide to get a piercing, the look should fit their personal style. \n* Be aware of how a temporary jewelry piece fastens and keep it fastened correctly. The magnetic type can be tricky and sometimes dangerous, such as magnetic [[labret]]s for chins that fit between the cheeks and gums. Be careful not to swallow this type of jewelry. \n* Follow the manufacturer's instructions for how to wear the jewelry and care for it. \n* How do others react to their body jewelry? If people get any negative feedback from loved ones, they must decide if that matters to them. People will have to live with this reaction if they decide.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Non piercing jewellery}}\n\n{{Jewellery}}\n[[Category:Body non piercing jewellery]]\n", "text_old": "{{Otheruses|Body jewelry}}\n'''Body non piercing jewellery''', or '''pierced-look/ temporary jewellery''', is [[jewellery|jewelry]] manufactured specifically for use in the look of [[piercings]] without [[body piercing]].
