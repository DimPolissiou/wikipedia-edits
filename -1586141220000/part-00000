Many of the letterforms differed from those of modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in [[manuscript]]s, and changed over time. Few fonts include [[glyph]]s sufficient to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with [[Unicode]] policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.\n\nThe Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern [[Church Slavonic]] language. In Microsoft Windows, the [[Segoe UI]] user interface font is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Unicode\" style=\"vertical-align:top;

Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many [[icon]] inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.\n\n[[Peter the Great]], Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of [[Civil script|westernized letter forms]] ([[:ru:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442|ru]]) in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of [[serif]]s, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic upright-cursive-n.svg|frame|right|Letters Ge, De, I, I kratkoye, Me, Te, Tse, Be and Ve in upright (printed) and cursive (handwritten) variants. (Top is set in Georgia font, bottom in Odessa Script.)]]\nCyrillic [[capital letters|uppercase]] and [[lower case|lowercase]] letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially [[small caps|small capitals]] (with exceptions: Cyrillic {{angle bracket|\u0430}}, {{angle bracket|\u0435}}, {{angle bracket|\u0456}}, {{angle bracket|\u0458}}, {{angle bracket|\u0440}}, and {{angle bracket|\u0443}} adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0444}} is typically designed under the influence of Latin {{angle bracket|p}}, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0431}}, {{angle bracket|\u0452}} and {{angle bracket|\u045b}} are traditional handwritten forms), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.<ref>Bringhurst (2002) writes \"in Cyrillic, the difference between normal lower case and small caps is more subtle than it is in the Latin or Greek alphabets,{{nbsp}}...\" (p 32) and \"in most Cyrillic faces, the lower case is close in color and shape to Latin small caps\" (p 107).</ref>\n\nCyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have [[roman type|roman]] and [[italic type|italic]] types (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in most Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words \"roman\" and \"italic\" in this sense.<ref>Name ''{{lang|ru-Latn|ital'yanskiy shrift}}'' (Italian font) in Russian refers to a particular font family [http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg JPG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926182512/http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg |date=26 September 2007 }}, whereas ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rimskiy shrift}}'' (roman font) is just a synonym for Latin font, Latin alphabet.</ref> Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|Cyrillic letters in cursive]]\n*Roman type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|pryamoy shrift}}'' (\"upright type\")\u2014compare with ''{{lang|de|Normalschrift}}'' (\"regular type\") in German\n*Italic type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursiv}}'' (\"cursive\") or ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursivniy shrift}}'' (\"cursive type\")\u2014from the German word ''{{lang|de|Kursive}}'', meaning italic typefaces and not cursive writing\n*[[Cursive]] handwriting is ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rukopisniy shrift}}'' (\"handwritten type\") in Russian\u2014in German: ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Kurrentschrift|Kurrentschrift]]}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Laufschrift}}'', both meaning literally 'running type'\n\nAs in Latin typography, a [[sans-serif]] face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type (''{{lang|ru-Latn|naklonniy shrift}}''\u2014\"sloped\", or \"slanted type\") instead of italic.\n\nSimilarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for handwritten or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts: for example, italic Cyrillic <span style=\"font-family: times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger\">{{angle bracket|''\u0442''}}</span> is the lowercase counterpart of {{angle bracket|''\u0422''}} not of {{angle bracket|''\u041c''}}.\n\nA boldfaced type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|poluzhirniy shrift}}'' (\"semi-bold type\"), because there existed fully boldfaced shapes that have been out of use since the beginning of the 20th century. A bold italic combination (bold slanted) does not exist for all font families.\n\nIn Standard Serbian, as well as in Macedonian,<ref>{{cite book |title=Pravopis na makedonskiot jazik |date=2017 |publisher=Institut za makedonski jazik Krste Misirkov |location=Skopje |isbn=978-608-220-042-2 |page=3 |url=http://www.pravopis.mk/sites/default/files/Pravopis-2017.PDF |ref=MakedonskiPravopis}}</ref> some italic and cursive letters are allowed to be different to resemble more to the handwritten letters.

Other Cyrillic alphabets include the [[Molodtsov alphabet]] for the Komi language and various alphabets for [[Caucasian languages]].\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Cyrillic monument.jpg|thumb|165px|Cyrillic Script Monument in [[Antarctica]]]]\nSince the script was conceived and popularised by the followers of [[Cyril and Methodius]], rather than by Cyril and Methodius themselves, its name denotes homage rather than authorship. The name \"Cyrillic\" often confuses people who are not familiar with the script's history, because it does not identify a country of origin (in contrast to the \"Greek alphabet\"). Among the general public, it is often called \"the Russian alphabet,\" because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably [[Stefan Tsanev]], have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the \"Bulgarian alphabet\" instead, for the sake of historical accuracy.<ref>Tsanev, Stefan. ''\u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0445\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u0442\u043e\u043c 4 (Bulgarian Chronicles, Volume 4)'', Sofia, 2009, p. 165</ref> It must be noted here that 'alphabet' is not the same as 'script' (e.g. letter \u0407\u0457 exists in the Cyrillic script since its very invention and is still used in Ukrainian, but is absent in the modern Bulgarian alphabet, that is Cyrillic as used in Bulgarian), so the accurate name is actually 'the Bulgarian script'.\n\nIn Bulgarian, Macedonian, Russian, and Serbian, the Cyrillic alphabet is also known as ''azbuka'', derived from the old names of the first two letters of most Cyrillic alphabets (just as the term ''alphabet'' came from the first two Greek letters ''alpha'' and ''beta''). In the Russian language [[Syllabary|syllabaries]], especially the Japanese [[kana]], are commonly referred to as 'syllabic azbukas' rather than 'syllabic scripts'.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Early Cyrillic alphabet}}\n[[File:Azbuka 1574 by Ivan Fyodorov.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|A page from \u0410\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430 (\u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430) (ABC (Reader)), the first Ruthenian language textbook, printed by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1574.

''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', p. 374</ref> The alphabet used for the modern [[Church Slavonic language]] in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. A notable example of such linguistic reform can be attributed to [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107|Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] who updated the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] by removing certain graphemes no longer represented in the vernacular, and introducing graphemes specific to Serbian (i.e. \u0409 \u040a \u0402 \u040b \u040f \u0408), distancing it from Church Slavonic alphabet in use prior to the reform. Today, [[Languages using Cyrillic|many languages]] in the [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkans]], Eastern Europe, and [[Eurasiatic languages|northern Eurasia]] are written in Cyrillic alphabets.\n\n==Relationship to other writing systems==\n===Latin script===\nA number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a [[Latin alphabet]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Romanian Language|Romanian]] (in the [[Republic of Moldova]] until 1989, in [[Romania]] throughout the 19th century). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of [[Transnistria]], where [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic]] is official), [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Azerbaijan]]. [[Uzbekistan]] still uses both systems, and [[Kazakhstan]] has officially begun a transition from Cyrillic to Latin (scheduled to be complete by 2025). The [[Russia]]n government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all [[federal subjects of Russia]], to promote closer ties across the federation.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]] speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=2|Distribution of the Cyrillic script worldwide:<br>\n{{legend|#0b280b|Cyrillic is the sole official script.}}\n{{legend|#217821|Cyrillic is co-official with another alphabet.

Many of the letterforms differed from those of modern Cyrillic, varied a great deal in [[manuscript]]s, and changed over time. Few fonts include [[glyph]]s sufficient to reproduce the alphabet. In accordance with [[Unicode]] policy, the standard does not include letterform variations or [[Ligature (typography)|ligatures]] found in manuscript sources unless they can be shown to conform to the Unicode definition of a character.\n\nThe Unicode 5.1 standard, released on 4 April 2008, greatly improves computer support for the early Cyrillic and the modern [[Church Slavonic]] language. In Microsoft Windows, the [[Segoe UI]] user interface font is notable for having complete support for the archaic Cyrillic letters since Windows 8.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"Unicode\" style=\"vertical-align:top;

Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (still found on many [[icon]] inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.\n\n[[Peter the Great]], Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of [[Civil script|westernized letter forms]] ([[:ru:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442|ru]]) in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of [[serif]]s, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic upright-cursive-n.svg|frame|right|Letters Ge, De, I, I kratkoye, Me, Te, Tse, Be and Ve in upright (printed) and cursive (handwritten) variants. (Top is set in Georgia font, bottom in Odessa Script.)]]\nCyrillic [[capital letters|uppercase]] and [[lower case|lowercase]] letter forms are not as differentiated as in Latin typography. Upright Cyrillic lowercase letters are essentially [[small caps|small capitals]] (with exceptions: Cyrillic {{angle bracket|\u0430}}, {{angle bracket|\u0435}}, {{angle bracket|\u0456}}, {{angle bracket|\u0458}}, {{angle bracket|\u0440}}, and {{angle bracket|\u0443}} adopted Western lowercase shapes, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0444}} is typically designed under the influence of Latin {{angle bracket|p}}, lowercase {{angle bracket|\u0431}}, {{angle bracket|\u0452}} and {{angle bracket|\u045b}} are traditional handwritten forms), although a good-quality Cyrillic typeface will still include separate small-caps glyphs.<ref>Bringhurst (2002) writes \"in Cyrillic, the difference between normal lower case and small caps is more subtle than it is in the Latin or Greek alphabets,{{nbsp}}...\" (p 32) and \"in most Cyrillic faces, the lower case is close in color and shape to Latin small caps\" (p 107).</ref>\n\nCyrillic fonts, as well as Latin ones, have [[roman type|roman]] and [[italic type|italic]] types (practically all popular modern fonts include parallel sets of Latin and Cyrillic letters, where many glyphs, uppercase as well as lowercase, are simply shared by both). However, the native font terminology in most Slavic languages (for example, in Russian) does not use the words \"roman\" and \"italic\" in this sense.<ref>Name ''{{lang|ru-Latn|ital'yanskiy shrift}}'' (Italian font) in Russian refers to a particular font family [http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg JPG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926182512/http://citforum.univ.kiev.ua/open_source/fonts/theory/thumbs/ris320.jpg |date=26 September 2007 }}, whereas ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rimskiy shrift}}'' (roman font) is just a synonym for Latin font, Latin alphabet.</ref> Instead, the nomenclature follows German naming patterns:\n\n[[File:Cyrillic cursive.svg|thumb|Cyrillic letters in cursive]]\n*Roman type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|pryamoy shrift}}'' (\"upright type\")\u2014compare with ''{{lang|de|Normalschrift}}'' (\"regular type\") in German\n*Italic type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursiv}}'' (\"cursive\") or ''{{lang|ru-Latn|kursivniy shrift}}'' (\"cursive type\")\u2014from the German word ''{{lang|de|Kursive}}'', meaning italic typefaces and not cursive writing\n*[[Cursive]] handwriting is ''{{lang|ru-Latn|rukopisniy shrift}}'' (\"handwritten type\") in Russian\u2014in German: ''{{lang|de|[[:de:Kurrentschrift|Kurrentschrift]]}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Laufschrift}}'', both meaning literally 'running type'\n\nAs in Latin typography, a [[sans-serif]] face may have a mechanically sloped oblique type (''{{lang|ru-Latn|naklonniy shrift}}''\u2014\"sloped\", or \"slanted type\") instead of italic.\n\nSimilarly to Latin fonts, italic and cursive types of many Cyrillic letters (typically lowercase; uppercase only for handwritten or stylish types) are very different from their upright roman types. In certain cases, the correspondence between uppercase and lowercase glyphs does not coincide in Latin and Cyrillic fonts: for example, italic Cyrillic <span style=\"font-family: times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger\">{{angle bracket|''\u0442''}}</span> is the lowercase counterpart of {{angle bracket|''\u0422''}} not of {{angle bracket|''\u041c''}}.\n\nA boldfaced type is called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|poluzhirniy shrift}}'' (\"semi-bold type\"), because there existed fully boldfaced shapes that have been out of use since the beginning of the 20th century.

The name \"Cyrillic\" often confuses people who are not familiar with the script's history, because it does not identify a country of origin (in contrast to the \"Greek alphabet\"). Among the general public, it is often called \"the Russian alphabet,\" because Russian is the most popular and influential alphabet based on the script. Some Bulgarian intellectuals, notably [[Stefan Tsanev]], have expressed concern over this, and have suggested that the Cyrillic script be called the \"Bulgarian alphabet\" instead, for the sake of historical accuracy.<ref>Tsanev, Stefan.

In the Russian language [[Syllabary|syllabaries]], especially the Japanese [[kana]], are commonly referred to as 'syllabic azbukas' rather than 'syllabic scripts'.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Early Cyrillic alphabet}}\n[[File:Azbuka 1574 by Ivan Fyodorov.png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|A page from \u0410\u0437\u0431\u0443\u043a\u0430 (\u0427\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430) (ABC (Reader)), the first Ruthenian language textbook, printed by [[Ivan Fyodorov (printer)|Ivan Fyodorov]] in 1574.

Hence expressions such as \"\u0418 is the tenth Cyrillic letter\" typically refer to the order of the Church Slavonic alphabet; not every Cyrillic alphabet uses every letter available in the script.\n\nThe Cyrillic script came to dominate Glagolitic in the 12th century.

Fortson. ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction'', p. 374</ref> The alphabet used for the modern [[Church Slavonic language]] in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic]] rites still resembles early Cyrillic. However, over the course of the following millennium, Cyrillic adapted to changes in spoken language, developed regional variations to suit the features of national languages, and was subjected to academic reform and political decrees. A notable example of such linguistic reform can be attributed to [[Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107|Vuk Stefanovi\u0107 Karad\u017ei\u0107]] who updated the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] by removing certain graphemes no longer represented in the vernacular, and introducing graphemes specific to Serbian (i.e. \u0409 \u040a \u0402 \u040b \u040f \u0408), distancing it from Church Slavonic alphabet in use prior to the reform. Today, [[Languages using Cyrillic|many languages]] in the [[Languages of the Balkans|Balkans]], Eastern Europe, and [[Eurasiatic languages|northern Eurasia]] are written in Cyrillic alphabets.\n\n==Relationship to other writing systems==\n===Latin script===\nA number of languages written in a Cyrillic alphabet have also been written in a [[Latin alphabet]], such as [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Romanian Language|Romanian]] (in the [[Republic of Moldova]] until 1989, in [[Romania]] throughout the 19th century). After the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, some of the former republics officially shifted from Cyrillic to Latin. The transition is complete in most of Moldova (except the breakaway region of [[Transnistria]], where [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan Cyrillic]] is official), [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Azerbaijan]]. [[Uzbekistan]] still uses both systems, and [[Kazakhstan]] has officially begun a transition from Cyrillic to Latin (scheduled to be complete by 2025). The [[Russia]]n government has mandated that Cyrillic must be used for all public communications in all [[federal subjects of Russia]], to promote closer ties across the federation.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} This act was controversial for speakers of many Slavic languages; for others, such as [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]] speakers, the law had political ramifications. For example, the separatist Chechen government mandated a Latin script which is still used by many Chechens. Those in the diaspora especially refuse to use the Chechen Cyrillic alphabet, which they associate with Russian imperialism.\n\n[[File:Cyrillic alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|upright=2|Distribution of the Cyrillic script worldwide:<br>\n{{legend|#0b280b|Cyrillic is the sole official script.}}\n{{legend|#217821|Cyrillic is co-official with another alphabet.

Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha clan, a notorious [[ninja]] family, and one of the most powerful, allied with {{nihongo|Konohagakure|\u6728\u30ce\u8449\u96a0\u308c\u306e\u91cc||English version: \"Hidden Leaf Village\"}}. Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older brother, [[Itachi Uchiha]], before the series began, leaving Sasuke one of the few living. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Sakura Haruno]], Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]]. Sasuke appears in several of the series' [[Naruto#Films|animated feature films]] and related media, including [[List of Naruto video games|video games]], [[Naruto#Original video animations|original video animations]] ([[original video animations|OVAs]]), and ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' (2015) and its manga [[sequel]], ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' (2016), in which he is depicted as a [[vigilante]] supporting his village and a mentor to Naruto's son [[Boruto Uzumaki]].\n\nKishimoto conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series' title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's dark [[character arc|character development]] later in the story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga's animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by [[Noriaki Sugiyama]] in Japanese and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] in English.\n\nSasuke's character has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. His impressive fighting skills, plot contribution, and rivalry with Naruto Uzumaki received some praise, but he was criticized as a stereotypical rival in the mold of similar characters from other [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] and as exhibiting a cold personality. Nevertheless, Sasuke's characterization in latter parts of the story and more mature personality in the ''Boruto'' sequels earned further positive comments.

For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from [[CyberConnect2]], the video game development studio who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''. There was a need to make every movement in the fight look realistic, giving Sasuke a scary look as well as hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto's wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact.

Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older brother, [[Itachi Uchiha]], before the series began, leaving Sasuke one of the few living. Despite becoming empathetic toward his teammates [[Naruto Uzumaki]] and [[Sakura Haruno]], Sasuke's feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his friends and his home in his quest to become stronger, and to find [[Orochimaru (Naruto)|Orochimaru]]. Sasuke appears in several of the series' [[Naruto#Films|animated feature films]] and related media, including [[List of Naruto video games|video games]], [[Naruto#Original video animations|original video animations]] ([[original video animations|OVAs]]), and ''[[Boruto: Naruto the Movie]]'' (2015) and its manga [[sequel]], ''[[Boruto: Naruto Next Generations]]'' (2016), in which he is depicted as a [[vigilante]] supporting his village and a mentor to Naruto's son [[Boruto Uzumaki]].\n\nKishimoto conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series' title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's dark [[character arc|character development]] later in the story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga's animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by [[Noriaki Sugiyama]] in Japanese and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] in English.\n\nSasuke's character has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. His impressive fighting skills, plot contribution, and rivalry with Naruto Uzumaki received some praise, but he was criticized as a stereotypical rival in the mold of similar characters from other [[sh\u014dnen manga|''sh\u014dnen'' manga]] and as exhibiting a cold personality. Nevertheless, Sasuke's characterization in latter parts of the story and more mature personality in the ''Boruto'' sequels earned further positive comments. Sasuke has also placed highly in ''Naruto'' reader popularity polls and has also been the subject of studies by scholars. Character-based merchandise, including [[action figure]]s and [[Keychain|key chains]], has been released.\n\n=={{anchor|Creation and conception}}Creation==\n===Development===\n[[Manga]] artist [[Masashi Kishimoto]] did not include Sasuke Uchiha in his original concept for the ''[[Naruto]]'' series, a story revolving around the character [[Naruto Uzumaki]].

For the scenario, Pierrot received assistance from [[CyberConnect2]], the video game development studio who had already adapted this battle through the fighting game ''[[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4]]''. There was a need to make every movement in the fight look realistic, giving Sasuke a scary look as well as hair movement in order to express the idea of both fighters willing to do anything to kill each other, which confused some due to Naruto's wish to avoid this fate. The final clash between Sasuke's Chidori and Naruto's Rasengan moves involved references from other scenes of the series to gave the viewer a bigger emotional impact. The staff noted that following this fight, Sasuke's face became calmer despite his initial look, giving room to explore his redemption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pierrot2.com/naruto/2016/10/03/%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%83%90%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E8%A3%8F%E8%A9%B1/|title=\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u306e\u88cf\u8a71|publisher=Pierrot|language=Japanese|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nKishimoto found Sasuke a difficult character to write, requiring considerable planning.

He also plays the [[accordion]] and the [[piano]]. He is known for his 20-year collaboration with [[Al Stewart]].  Peter's brother, [[Danny White (musician)|Danny White]], was one of the original members who formed the UK-based band [[Matt Bianco]].\n\n==Early Life==\nPeter White was born in Luton, England in 1954 to an English father, Ken White, and a French mother, Gilberte. In 1955 the family moved to [[Letchworth]], a few miles away, the first [[Garden City movement|garden city]]. He grew up there with his older brother, John, and younger siblings, Danny and Michelle. White lived in Letchworth until he moved to London in October 1974.\n\nWhite\u2019s father was very influential in his musical upbringing, giving him lessons on a variety of instruments: the [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], the piano, and the clarinet before the age of 10. He bought White his first acoustic guitar around age nine.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbJ--iW9dJQ&feature=youtu.be Living Legends interview, Youtube]</ref>\n\nAt age 10 his father enrolled White in the Letchworth Brass band where he learned to play the trombone, the cornet, and the E\u266d Horn (known in the US as the [[tenor Horn]] and he would participate in Sunday afternoon concerts in the park.\n\nAt age 12 White took up harmonica lessons, becoming the British junior harmonica champion in 1967 and 1968. Harmonica great [[Larry Adler]] was the adjudicator.\n\nAt age 13 White\u2019s school, [[Hitchin Boys' School]], gave him a violin and violin lessons, but he did not pursue them because he was becoming more interested in the guitar. He had already given up the recorder, the clarinet, and the brass band by age 13 to concentrate on playing the piano, harmonica, and the guitar.\n\nBy age 14 he had also given up playing the harmonica. However, he has taken it up in the last few years, playing it onstage  and recording with it. (\"Peaceful\" on the ''Starlux Airline'' album).\n\nIronically, the guitar was the only instrument on which White did not receive any formal training. He learned to play by listening to the radio and copying what he heard. [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were a huge influence. The guitar riff to ''[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]'' was the first riff he ever played, quickly followed by the guitar intro to ''[[Day Tripper]]'' by the Beatles.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJseo0tlEp0&feature=youtu.be Living Legends interview, Youtube]</ref>\n\nHe describes his early influences: \u201cA school friend, David Visick, had an older sister who collected rock and blues albums and so I used to go to his house after school (and sometimes during school) to listen to new albums by [[Fleetwood Mac]] (who were mainly a blues band at that time) and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]. Then [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. Pretty much all British rock in the mid 60s was based on the blues so that\u2019s what I aspired to play and finally I acquired my first electric guitar at age 13\u201d. Soon after, however this guitar was destroyed in a fire accidentally set by his younger brother Danny, forcing White to return to playing acoustic guitar.\n\nAt that time, an acoustic music movement swept England pioneered by British artists such as [[Cat Stevens]], [[Al Stewart]], [[Bert Jansch]], [[John Renbourn]] and US artists [[James Taylor]], [[CSN&Y]], [[Joni Mitchell]] (Canadian) and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. White taught himself acoustic guitar finger-style he heard on James Taylor albums on Simon and Garfunkel's ''[[The Boxer]]''. \n\nAfter graduation, White worked a series of jobs: on a French farm, at a soup factory, and a musical instrument distribution warehouse. Whilst in the latter position, White got his first professional gig playing with a band at a seaside resort.\n\nThis experience led to a role with Principal Edwards Magic Theatre, a psychedelic band, as a multi-instrumentalist (piano and guitar). The band broke up without doing a single gig but through their manager, [[Stewart Copeland]], White met Al Stewart\u2019s manager, Luke O\u2019Reilly, who asked him to audition for Al Stewart.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fjv0A4Zxn1w&feature=youtu.be Living Legends interview, Youtube]</ref> \n\n==Al Stewart Years Years 1975-1994==\nIn early 1975, at the age of 20, White joined Al Stewart\u2019s band playing keyboards. It was during a subsequent tour that Stewart became aware that he also played guitar.\n\nDuring the summer of 1975 Stewart entered [[Abbey Road Studios]] to record the ''[[Year of the Cat]]'' album and asked White to contribute acoustic guitar, synthesizer, and organ. Stewart also handed White his own Spanish guitar to play on the song ''On The Border''. On the subsequent tour in 1976, White stepped out from behind the keyboards to play the Spanish guitar as he had done on the recording and the die was cast. He had found his identity--from that moment on the Spanish guitar became his sound. \n\nOn the next Al Stewart album, [[Time Passages]], in 1978 Peter collaborated with Al in writing two of the songs: ''Time Passages'', which became a top ten hit in the USA and ''End of the Day'', which featured more of White\u2019s Spanish guitar.  During the making of the [[Time Passages]] album, White learnt to play the accordion and recorded it on the song ''Timeless Skies''. He has continued to play and record with the accordion on many of his recordings and those of others.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kag08cIbTQM&feature=youtu.be Living Legends interview, Youtube]</ref>\n\n==Basia==\nIn the early 80s, White\u2019s brother [[Danny White (musician)|Danny White]] formed the band, [[Matt Bianco]]. White played Spanish guitar on one song from their debut album, ''[[Whose Side Are You On]]''. The song, ''Half a Minute'', featured a Polish singer named [[Basia Trzetrzelewska]]. Basia went on to a solo career a few years later in 1987, with Danny as co-writer and co-producer and Peter White has played on all her album releases since then. He also did two world tours with Basia and Danny, in 1990 and 1994. \n\nDuring a 20-year tenure with Stewart, he co-wrote many songs, including Stewart's 1978 top-ten hit \"[[Time Passages (song)|Time Passages]]\". He also formed Shot In The Dark, a band which backed Stewart and released an eponymous album in 1981.

{"title_page": "Complexity class", "text_new": "[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among several important complexity classes]]\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], a '''complexity class''' is a set of [[Computational problem|problems]] of related resource-based complexity. A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the langauge <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''', the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class in its own right because it turns out it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.

A typical complexity class has a definition of the form:\n\n:the set of problems that can be solved by an [[abstract machine]] M using [[Big O notation|O]](f(''n'')) of [[computational resource|resource]] R, where ''n'' is the size of the input.\n\n==Background==\n\nComplexity classes are concerned with the rate of growth of the requirement in resources as the input size ''n'' increases. It is an abstract measurement, and does not give time or space in requirements in terms of seconds or bytes, which would require knowledge of implementation specifics. The function inside the O(...) expression could be a constant, for [[algorithm]]s which are unaffected by the size of ''n'', or an expression involving a [[logarithm]], an expression involving a power of ''n'', i.e. a [[polynomial]] expression, and many others. The O is read as \"order of..\". For the purposes of computational complexity theory, some of the details of the function can be ignored, for instance many possible polynomials can be grouped together as a class.\n\nThe resource in question can either be time, essentially the number of primitive operations on an abstract machine, or (storage) space. For example, the class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is the set of [[decision problem]]s whose solutions can be determined by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial time]], while the class '''[[PSPACE]]''' is the set of decision problems that can be solved by a [[deterministic Turing machine]] in [[polynomial space]].\n\n===Characterization===\n\nThe simplest complexity classes are defined by the type of computational problem, the model of computation, and the resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds.  The resource and bounds are usually stated together, such as \"polynomial time\", \"logarithmic space\", \"constant depth\", etc.\n\nMany complexity classes can be characterized in terms of the [[mathematical logic]] needed to express them; see [[descriptive complexity]].\n\n====Computational problem====\n\nThe most commonly used problems are [[decision problem]]s. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s (an example is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''), [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s (e.g. '''[[Sharp-P|#P]]'''), [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.\n\n====Model of computation====\n\nThe most common model of computation is the [[deterministic Turing machine]], but many complexity classes are based on [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]s, [[boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.\n\n====Resource bounds====\n\nBounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis]] states that \"the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related\" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class '''[[P (complexity)|P]]''', which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is '''[[FP (complexity)|FP]]'''.\n\nThe [[Blum axioms]] can be used to define complexity classes without referring to a concrete [[computational model]].\n\n==Common complexity classes==\n{{Main|List of complexity classes}}\n\n'''[[ALL (complexity)|ALL]]''' is the class of all [[decision problem]]s. Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the [[Time complexity|time]] or [[Space complexity|space]] used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:\n\n===Time-complexity classes===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n\n! Model of computation\n!

These classes help to better describe the complexity of [[randomized algorithm]]s.\n\nUnlike with standard Turing machines, the definition of a probabilistic Turing machine introduces the potential for error; that is, strings that the Turing machine is meant to accept may on some occasions be rejected and strings that the Turing machine is meant to reject may on some occasions be accepted. As a result, the complexity classes based on the probabilistic Turing machine are defined in large part around the amount of allowable error. In particular, they are defined using an ''error probability'' <math>\\epsilon</math>: a probabilistic Turing machine <math>M</math> is said to recognize a language <math>L</math> with error probability <math>\\epsilon</math> if:\n# a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ accepts } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n# a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies that <math>\\text{Pr}[M \\text{ rejects } w] \\geq 1 - \\epsilon</math>\n\nA straightforward class based upon this definition is '''[[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]]''' (zero-error probabilistic polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 0. Another is '''[[RP (complexity)|RP]]''' (randomized polynomial time), the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/2 for strings in the language and with error probability 0 for strings not in the language. Finally, the class '''[[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]''' (bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time) is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by probabilistic Turing machines with error probability 1/3. The class '''BPP''' is at the center of the important unsolved problem in computer science over whether '''[[BPP (complexity)#Problems|P=BPP]]''', which if true would mean that randomness does not increase the computational power of computers, i.e. any probabilistic Turing machine could be simulated by a deterministic Turing machine with at most polynomial slowdown.\n\n====Interactive  proof systems====\n{{Main|Interactive proof system}}\nA number of complexity classes are defined using ''interactive proof systems''. Interactive proofs generalize the proofs definition of the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' and yield insights into [[cryptography]], [[approximation algorithm]]s, and [[formal verification]].\n\n[[File:Interactive proof (complexity).svg|thumb|300px|General representation of an interactive proof protocol.]]\nInteractive proof systems are [[abstract machine]]s that model computation as the exchange of messages between two parties: a prover <math>P</math> and a verifier <math>V</math>. The parties interact by exchanging messages, and an input string is accepted by the system if the verifier decides to accept the input on the basis of the messages it has received from the prover. The prover <math>P</math> has unlimited computational power while the verifier has bounded computational power (the standard definition of interactive proof systems defines the verifier to be polynomially-time bounded). The prover, however, is untrustworthy (this prevents all languages from being trivially recognized by the proof system by having the computationally unbounded prover determine if a string is in a language and then sending a \"YES\" or \"NO\" to the verifier), so the verifier must conduct an \"interrogation\" of the prover by \"asking it\" successive rounds of questions, accepting if it develops a high degree of confidence that the string is in the language.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4|page=144|quote=\"The verifier conducts an interrogation of the prover, repeatedly asking questions and listening to the prover's responses.\"}}</ref>\n\nThe class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' is a simple proof system in which the verifier is restricted to being a deterministic, polynomial-time machine and the procedure is restricted to one round (that is, the prover sends only a single, full [[Certificate (complexity)|proof]] to the verifier). Put another way, in the definition of the class '''NP'''\u2014the set of decision problems for which the problem instances, when the answer is \"YES\", have proofs verifiable in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine\u2014is a proof system in which the proof is constructed by the prover and the deterministic Turing machine is the verifier. \n\nIt turns out that '''NP''' describes the full power of interactive proof systems with deterministic (polynomial-time) verifiers because, for any proof systems with deterministic verifiers, it is never necessary to need more than a single round of messaging between the prover and the verifier. Interactive proof systems that provide greater computational power over standard complexity classes thus require ''probabilistic verifiers'', which means that the verifiers' questions to provers are computed using [[probabilistic algorithm]]s. As noted in the section above, probabilistic algorithms introduce error into the system, so complexity classes based on probabilistic proof systems are defined in terms of the error probability. \n\nThe most general complexity class arising out of this characterization is the class '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]''' (interactive polynomial time), which is the class of all problems solvable by an interactive proof system <math>(P,V)</math>, where <math>V</math> is probabilistic polynomial-time and the proof system satisfies two properties: for a language <math>L \\in </math> '''IP'''\n# (Completeness) a string <math>w</math> in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}</math>\n# (Soundness) a string <math>w</math> not in <math>L</math> implies <math>\\Pr[V \\text{ accepts }w \\text{ after interacting with } P] \\le \\tfrac{1}{3}</math>\n\nAn important feature of '''IP''' is that it equals '''[[PSPACE]]'''.\n\nA modification of the protocol for '''IP''' produces another important complexity class: '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' (Arthur\u2013Merlin protocol). In the definition of interactive proof systems used by '''IP''', the prover was not able to see the coins utilized by the verifier in its probabilistic computation\u2014it was only able to see the messages that the verifier produced with these coins. For this reason, the coins are called ''private random coins''. The interactive proof system can be constrained so that the coins used by the verifier are ''public random coins'', that is the prover is able to see the coins. Formally, '''AM''' is defined as the class of languages with an interactive proof in which the verifier sends a random string to the prover, the prover responds with a message, and the verifier either accepts or rejects by applying a deterministic polynomial-time function to the message from the prover. '''AM''' can be generalized to '''AM'''[k], where k is the number of messages exchanged (so in the generalized form the standard '''AM''' defined above is '''AM'''[2]). However, it is the case that for all k<math>\\geq</math>2, '''AM'''[k]='''AM'''[2]. It is also the case that '''AM'''[k]<math>\\subseteq</math>'''IP'''[k].\n\nOther complexity classes defined using interactive proof systems include '''[[Interactive proof system#MIP|MIP]]''' (mutliprover interactive polynomial time) and '''[[QIP (complexity)|QIP]]''' (quantum interactive polynomial time).\n\n====Boolean circuit models====\n{{Main|Circuit complexity}}\nAn alternative model of computation to the [[Turing machine]] is the ''[[Boolean circuit]]'', a simplified model of the [[digital circuit]]s used in modern [[computer]]s. Not only does this model provide a more intuitive connection between computation in theory and computation in practice, but it is also a natural model for [[non-uniform computation]] (different input sizes within the same problem use different algorithms) that leads to a number of new complexity classes.\n\nFormally, a Boolean circuit <math>C</math> is a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which edges represent ''wires'' (which carry the [[bit]] values 0 and 1), the input bits are represented by ''source vertices'' (vertices with no incoming edges), and all non-source vertices represent ''[[logic gate]]s'' (generally the [[AND gate|AND]], [[OR gate|OR]], and [[NOT gate]]s). One logic gate is designated the ''output gate'', and represents the end of the computation. The input/output behavior of a circuit <math>C</math> with <math>n</math> input variables is represented by the [[Boolean function]] <math>f_C:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to \\{0,1\\}</math>; for example, on input bits <math>a_1,a_2,...,a_n</math>, the output bit <math>b</math> of the circuit is represented mathematically as <math>b = f_C(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)</math>. The circuit <math>C</math> is said to ''compute'' the Boolean function <math>f_C</math>.\n\nA particular circuit only acts on inputs of fixed size. [[Formal language|Languages]] (the formal representation of [[decision problem]]s), however, contain strings of different lengths, so languages cannot be fully captured by a single circuit (in contrast to the Turing machine model, in which a language is fully described by a single Turing machine). A language is instead represented by a ''circuit family''. A circuit family is an infinite list of circuits <math>(C_0,C_1,C_2,...)</math>, where <math>C_n</math> has <math>n</math> input variables. A circuit family is said to decide a language <math>L</math> if, for every string <math>w</math>, <math>w</math> is in the langauge <math>L</math> if and only if <math>C_n(w)=1</math>, where <math>n</math> is the length of <math>w</math>. In other words, a language is the set of strings which, when applied to the circuits corresponding to their lengths, evaluate to 1.\n\nWhile complexity classes defined using Turing machines are described in terms of [[time complexity]], circuit complexity classes are defined in terms of circuit size. The size of a circuit is the number of vertices in it. The size complexity of a circuit family <math>(C_0,C_1,...)</math> is the function <math>f:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, where <math>f(n)</math> is the circuit size of <math>C_n</math>. The familiar function classes follow naturally from this; for example, a polynomial-size complexity is one such that the function <math>f</math> is a [[polynomial]].\n\nThis leads directly to the complexity class '''[[P/poly]]''': the set of languages that are decidable by polynomial-size circuit families. It turns out that there is a natural connection between circuit complexity and time complexity. Intuitively, a language with small time complexity (requires relatively few sequential operations on a Turing machine), also has a small circuit complexity (requires relatively few Boolean operations). Formally, it can be shown that if a language is in '''TIME'''<math>(t(n))</math>, where <math>t</math> is a function <math>t:\\mathbb{N} \\to \\mathbb{N}</math>, then it has circuit complexity <math>O(t^2(n))</math>.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|page=355}}</ref> It follows directly from this that '''[[P]]'''<math>\\subseteq</math>'''P/poly'''. In other words, any problem that can be computed in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine can also be computed by a polynomial-size circuit family. It is further the case that the inclusion is proper ('''P'''<math>\\subset</math>'''P/poly''') because there are undecidable problems that are in '''P/poly'''.\n\n'''P/poly''' turns out to have a number of properties that make it highly useful in the study of the relationships between complexity classes. In particular, it is helpful in investigating problems related to [[P versus NP|'''P''' versus '''NP''']]. For example, if there is any language in '''NP''' that is not in '''P/poly''', then '''P'''<math>\\neq</math>'''NP'''.<ref>Arora and Barak p. 286</ref> '''P/poly''' also helps to investigate properties of the [[polynomial hierarchy]]. For example, if '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]''' \u2286 '''P/poly''', then '''PH''' collapses to <math>\\Sigma_2^{\\mathsf P}</math>. A full description of the relations between '''P/poly''' and other complexity classes is available at \"[[P/poly#Importance of P/poly|Importance of P/poly]]\". '''P/poly''' also has the interesting feature that it can be equivalently defined as the class of languages recognized by a polynomial-time Turing machine with a polynomial-bounded [[advice (complexity)|advice function]].\n\nTwo subclasses of '''P/poly''' that have interesting properties in their own right are '''[[NC (complexity)|NC]]''' and '''[[AC (complexity)|AC]]'''. These classes are defined not only in terms of their circuit size but also in terms of their ''depth''. The depth of a circuit is the length of the longest [[directed path]] from an input node to the output node. The class '''NC''' is the set of languages that can be solved by circuit families that are restricted not only to having polynomial-size but also to having ''polylogarithmic depth''. The class '''AC''' is defined similarly to '''NC''', however gates are allowed to have unbounded fan-in (that is, the AND and OR gates can be applied to more than two bits). '''NC''' is an important class in its own right because it turns out it represents the class of languages that have efficient ''[[parallel algorithm]]s''.\n\n====Quantum Turing machines====\n\nThe classes '''[[BQP]]''' and '''[[QMA]]''', which are of key importance in [[quantum information science]], are defined using [[quantum Turing machine]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n====Counting problems====\n\n'''[[Sharp-P|#P]]''' is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems).\n\n{{expand section|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Enumeration algorithms===\n\nSeveral [[output-sensitive algorithm|output-sensitive]] classes have been defined for [[enumeration algorithm]]s.\n\n{{expand section|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Reduction==\n{{main article|Reduction (complexity)}}\nMany complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as [[Cook reduction]]s, [[Karp reduction]]s and [[Levin reduction]]s, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.\n\nThe most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.\n\nThis motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems '''C''' if every problem in '''C''' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in '''C''' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in '''C'''. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than '''P''', polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for '''NP''' is the set of '''[[NP-hard]]''' problems.\n\nIf a problem ''X'' is in '''C''' and is hard for '''C''', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for '''C'''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in '''C''' (Since there could be many problems which are equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in '''C'''). Thus the class of [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in '''NP''', in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP''' is not solved, being able to reduce a known '''NP'''-complete problem, \u03a0<sub>2</sub>, to another problem, \u03a0<sub>1</sub>, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for \u03a0<sub>1</sub>.  This is because a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>1</sub> would yield a polynomial-time solution to \u03a0<sub>2</sub>. Similarly, because all '''NP''' problems can be reduced to the set, finding an '''NP'''-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that '''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''NP'''.\n\n==Closure properties of classes==\nComplexity classes have a variety of closure properties; for example, decision classes may be closed under [[negation]], [[disjunction]], [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]], or even under all [[Logical connective|Boolean operations]]. Moreover, they might also be closed under a variety of quantification schemes. '''P''', for instance, is closed under all Boolean operations, and under quantification over polynomially sized domains. However, it is most likely not closed under quantification over exponential sized domains.\n\nEach class '''X''' that is not closed under negation has a complement class '''co-Y''', which consists of the complements of the languages contained in '''X'''. Similarly one can define the Boolean closure of a class, and so on; this is however less commonly done.\n\nOne possible route to separating two complexity classes is to find some closure property possessed by one and not by the other.\n\n==Relationships between complexity classes==\n\n===Savitch's theorem===\n{{Main|Savitch's theorem}}\nSavitch's theorem establishes that '''PSPACE''' = '''NPSPACE''' and '''EXPSPACE''' = '''NEXPSPACE'''. One central question of complexity theory is whether nondeterminism adds significant power to a computational model. This is central to the open '''P''' versus '''NP''' problem in the context of time. Savitch's theorem shows that for space, nondeterminism does not add significantly more power, where \"significant\" means the difference between polynomial and superpolynomial resource requirements (or, for '''EXPSPACE''', the difference between exponential and superexponential). For example, Savitch's theorem proves that no problem that requires exponential space for a deterministic Turing machine can be solved by a nondeterministic polynomial space Turing machine.\n\n===Other relations===\n\nThe following table shows some of the classes of problems (or languages, or grammars) that are considered in complexity theory.  If class '''X''' is a strict [[subset]] of '''Y''', then '''X''' is shown below '''Y''', with a dark line connecting them.  If '''X''' is a subset, but it is unknown whether they are equal sets, then the line is lighter and is dotted.  Technically, the breakdown into decidable and undecidable pertains more to the study of [[computability theory]] but is useful for putting the complexity classes in perspective.\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"0\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |\n\n| colspan=4 |\n{| cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"background:lightBlue;

In particular, although '''DTIME'''(''n'') is contained in '''DTIME'''(''n''<sup>2</sup>), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.\n\nMore precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DTIME}\\big(f(n) \\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DTIME} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log^{2}(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that\n:<math>\\mathbf{DSPACE}\\big(f(n)\\big) \\subsetneq \\mathbf{DSPACE} \\big(f(n) \\sdot \\log(f(n)) \\big)</math>.\n\nThe time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that '''P''' is strictly contained in '''EXPTIME''', and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that '''L''' is strictly contained in '''PSPACE'''.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of complexity classes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak|author1link=Sanjeev Arora |first2=Boaz|author2link=Boaz Barak |title=Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4}}\n* {{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Sipser|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation|edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=Thomson Course Technology|location=USA|isbn=978-0-534-95097-2|title-link=Introduction to the Theory of Computation}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo The Complexity Zoo]: A huge list of complexity classes, a reference for experts.\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |author=[[Neil Immerman]] |title=Computational Complexity Theory |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416021243/https://people.cs.umass.edu/~immerman/complexity_theory.html |archivedate=2016-04-16}} Includes a diagram showing the hierarchy of complexity classes and how they fit together.\n*[[Michael Garey]], and [[David S.
