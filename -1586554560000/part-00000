{"title_page": "Skully (game)", "text_new": "'''Skully''' (also called skelly, skellies, skelsy, skellzies, scully, skelzy, scummy top, tops or caps but widely known as Skully) is a [[children's game]]  played on the streets of [[New York City]] and other urban areas.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Popik\n  | first = Barry\n  | title = Skelly (or skelsy, skellzies, scully, tops, caps)\n  | date = 2005-04-05\n  | url = http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/skelly_or_skelsy_skellzies_scully_tops_caps/\n  | accessdate = 2008-01-05 }}</ref>  Sketched on the street usually in chalk, a skully or skelly board allows a game for two to six players. A sidewalk is sometimes used, offering greater protection from vehicular traffic; however, the asphalt on a typical city street is smoother and provides better game play than a bumpy concrete sidewalk.\n\nGame time varies, but a match of two to three players is usually completed in 20 minutes. Local variations in rules are common and make it difficult to document the game.  Rule variations are agreed upon by players before starting a game, especially when players from different neighborhoods play against each other.\n\n==The skully board==\n[[File:skully cp.gif|thumb|250px|Typical skully board as found in New York City]]\nThe skully field of play, or board, is a large square approximately six feet (2&nbsp;m) a side.  This board is drawn on a flat surface, such as the pavement of a street or playground.\n\nAt each corner and along the edges of the board are drawn 12 smaller squares, called ''boxes'', of about six inches (15&nbsp;cm) a side each (see diagram).   These boxes are labeled \"1\" to \"12\" in a pattern so that the path from one square to the next requires\u2014as much as possible\u2014crossing through a large center square called the ''skull'' or ''skully'' (hence the name of the game).  Boxes \"1\" and \"2\" are in opposite corners of the board, as are \"3\" and \"4\".\n\nIn the center of the skull, a 13th box is drawn at the same size as the other boxes  and is labeled \"13\".  The areas around the 13 box are marked with skulls or numbers, and describe a penalty area where players are not meant to shoot their game pieces, called ''caps''.\n\nA short distance from the \"1\" box is found a ''start line'' approximately six inches long.\n\nThe dimensions of the skully board can vary depending upon physical restrictions and neighborhood game play practices.  Earlier versions of the board had only 9 boxes, and boards used in the similar games like ''[[deadbox]]'' (played mainly in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]) have upwards of 15 boxes.\n\nIn some layouts, the central area is labeled \"MUD\" and if your bottlecap lands in the MUD you lose 3 turns.  The 13 is in a small circle in the middle of the MUD.\n\n==Game play==\n\nPlayers use ''caps''\u2014usually bottle caps, or similar items like checkers, or chair glides\u2014to play. Many players use clay, wax, and most commonly crayons melted into the bottle cap (these having been referred to as \"melties\"), even a coin covered with tar or a bottle cap filled with tar that was dug from the streets{{CN|date=September 2018}} to weigh down their caps for easier gliding. Caps were typically soft drink bottle caps. Some players took extreme pride in customizing their playing pieces.\n\nOn hands and knees, each player begins by placing his cap on the start line, and flicks a cap using the middle or index finger launched from behind the thumb.{{CN|date=September 2018}} The object is to land it in the ''box'' labeled \"1\". If successful (the cap cannot touch a line), the player continues by flicking for the next number - and so on in the sequence: \"2\", \"3\", \"4\" etc., up to \"12\". If any flick is unsuccessful, the player's turn is forfeit and the next player is up. The cap remains where it lies. When all players have had their turns, the first player resumes by flicking for the square previously missed.\n\nFlicking a piece into a square without touching a line allows the player to immediately take another turn.  In addition, if a player strikes another player's cap, he is immediately rewarded with the next box he is going for, allowing him to pick up his cap, walk over to that number, and immediately take an additional turn from there. The player whose cap has been hit must play from where it now lies.\n\nA complication in the game involves the space surrounding the square box \"13\".  If, in flicking for any square (including \"13\"), a player accidentally lands on the area surrounding \"13\" (''the skull''), the player remains stuck there until freed by another player's shot. In one variation such good behavior is motivated by assigning each area a number of bonus squares which advance the player who frees a stuck player.  In other variations, the freeing player gets a number of bonus turns equal to the last number in the number the stuck player had reached before getting stuck.\n\nAfter the player completes the circuit from \"1\" to \"12\" and successfully flicks into the square labeled \"13\", a circuit of the four trapezoids surrounding the \"13\" square must be made. The circuit of these must be performed in succession in a single turn, with the player saying \"I\" in the first, \"am\" in the second, \"a\" in the third, and finally \"killer\" in the fourth, or a variation, such as \"I'm\", \"a\", \"killa\". If all trapezoids are not negotiated in succession in a single turn, the turn is forfeit and the process must start again on the player's next turn by first flicking for the \"13\" square. If the trapezoids are successfully negotiated, the player is deemed to be a 'killer'.\n\nIn another variation of the game, players must complete the circuit of numbers from \"1\" to \"13\", then backwards back to \"1\", before making the attempt to become a killer. This version consequently takes more time to play.\n\n===End of game sequence===\nOnce a player becomes a killer, further flicks of the bottle cap can be used to knock another competitor's bottle cap outside the six-foot square.  If successful in this, the player knocked outside the square is \"killed,\" i.e., removed from the game.   In other common variations of the game, the killer needs to strike a non-killer's cap three times in succession in order to \"kill\" that player, or another killer's cap only once.  In some variations, a non-killer can become a killer by striking the killer's cap (hit-a-killer); additionally, a killer's turn may either end or continue when he \"kills\" another player, based upon local convention. Also, some variations allow the killer to \"walk the lines\", the killer will pick up their cap and walk or jump along the lines of the board to get close to another player's cap and shoot from the closest point on the line. Some variations require the new killer to \"get out of \"town\" (the skelly board) to the \"killer line\" drawn some distance away from the main skelly board.  At that point, the killer flicks his top back to the skelly board at which point the killer rules are negotiated by yelling them out, the player saying them first wins: For instance \"No hit a killer-be a killer\", \"three baby taps\" or \"three blasts\", \"all boxes are mine\", etc. which will govern how powerful the killer will be. Some aggressive players would typically \"kill\" other player's caps by not just flicking but kicking their own cap into opposing players cap's, called booting, and sending it way out of the board, sometimes damaging or losing the cap, adding further insult to the loss.\n\nThe last player on the field wins.\n\n===History===\n\nThe game was one of the most popular street games in New York City and the surrounding areas from the 1950s through the 1980s, but is less popular today. The remnants of spray-painted skully boards may be found on some streets and school yards.{{cn|date=July 2015}} At Bronx House Emanuel Summer Camp an over-sized skully board was painted on the basketball court and the game was played with [[shuffleboard]] equipment.{{cn|date=July 2015}}\n\nIt is said that the game has existed as long as the crown-rimmed [[bottle cap]], which was invented in 1892.

It stars [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] and [[Kajal Aggarwal]], with [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]], [[Vidyut Jammwal]] and [[Jayaram]] in supporting roles. The film revolves around an [[Indian Army]] officer on a mission to track down, destroy and deactivate a [[Sleeper agent|sleeper cell]], after witnessing and barely escaping a bomb blast executed by the cell.\n\n''Thuppakki'' commenced production in January 2012 and was filmed mostly in [[Mumbai]], except for two song sequences which were taken in [[Bangkok]] and Switzerland respectively. The film, produced by [[S. Thanu]], features music composed by [[Harris Jayaraj]] with cinematography handled by [[Santosh Sivan]] and editing by [[A. Sreekar Prasad]].\n\n''Thuppakki'' was released on 13 November 2012, [[Diwali]] day. The film received positive reviews and became a major commercial success, grossing over {{INRConvert|1|b}} in 11 days of its release. It went on to received seven [[Filmfare Awards South]] nominations in the Tamil branch, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Director]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actor]] for Vijay. In 2014 Murugadoss remade the film in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty]]'', while [[Baba Yadav]] remade it in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''[[Game: He Plays To Win]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nJagadish Dhanapal, an [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|intelligence officer]] in the [[Indian Army]], returns to [[Mumbai]] from [[Kashmir]]. On his arrival, his parents and younger sisters force him to see Nisha, who they choose for him to be married to. At the bride-viewing ceremony, Jagadish makes up excuses to avoid marrying her, which includes commenting about her being old-fashioned. On the contrary, Nisha is a university-level boxer, who is completely modern in her outlook. Jagadish notices her in a boxing match and falls in love with her instantly. Nisha reciprocates after refusing him initially.\n\nOne day, Jagadish witnesses the explosion of a bus in which he and his police officer-friend Balaji had travelled. He manages to capture the man who laid the bomb, but he escapes from the hospital where he was kept under custody. Jagadish captures the bomber again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that the bomber is a mere executor, a [[sleeper agent]], whose only role was to plant the bomb. He also discovers that the sleeper cell, which the bomber belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city in a couple of days. Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper agent leader's brother and eleven other agents, including the previously captured sleeper agent.\n\nWhen the leader of the sleeper cell learns about the role of Jagdish in thwarting the attack, he begins to target the families of the army men, except Jagadish, by kidnapping someone close to them. When Jagadish realises the plan, he substitutes one of the people to be kidnapped, with his younger sister Sanjana. Using his pet dog and his sister's ''[[dupatta]]'', he manages to reach the sleeper cell's hideout, rescuing his sister, who was about to be killed after Jagadish's bluff was exposed, and the other victims and eliminating the sleeper agents assembled there. The second-in-command of the sleeper agents is captured and killed by Jagdish.\n\nWith this attack too having failed, the sleeper cell leader decides to target Jagadish himself. He kills one of Jagadish's friends and asks Jagadish to surrender to him or else there would be more attacks. Jagadish decides to sacrifice his life and devises a plan with his fellow army men. Jagadish meets the leader in a ship, which has been rigged with a bomb planted by another of Jagadish's friends. When he learns about the leader's plan of infiltrating the Indian Army with sleeper agents with the help of a traitor in the Indian Defense&nbsp;\u2014 Kameeruddin [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]], the current Joint Secretary in Defence, Jagadish decides to abandon his suicidal plan. He mocks the leader and compels him to a fight before escaping in a boat, with the leader as hostage. After the ship explodes, he kills the bewildered leader. Jagadish confronts Kameeruddin and forces him to commit suicide, before returning to Kashmir along with his fellow army men.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Jagadish Dhanapal<ref name=\"IBTReview\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.in/movie-review-039thuppaki039-hits-bulls-eye-405645 |title=Movie Review: 'Thuppaki' Hits Bull's-Eye |last=Kumar |first=Manoj |date=16 November 2012 |website=[[International Business Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119203514/http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/405645/20121116/thuppaki-movie-review-vijay-murugadoss-film-release.htm |archive-date=19 November 2012 |access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Nisha<ref name=\"On-target\" />\n* [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]] as Balaji<ref name=\"On-target\" />\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as the sleeper cell's unnamed leader<ref name=\"On-target\" />\n* [[Jayaram]] as V.

It stars [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] and [[Kajal Aggarwal]], with [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]], [[Vidyut Jammwal]] and [[Jayaram]] in supporting roles. The film revolves around an [[Indian Army]] officer on a mission to track down, destroy and deactivate a [[Sleeper agent|sleeper cell]], after witnessing and barely escaping a bomb blast executed by the cell.\n\n''Thuppakki'' commenced production in January 2012 and was filmed mostly in [[Mumbai]], except for two song sequences which were taken in [[Bangkok]] and Switzerland respectively. The film, produced by [[S. Thanu]], features music composed by [[Harris Jayaraj]] with cinematography handled by [[Santosh Sivan]] and editing by [[A. Sreekar Prasad]].\n\n''Thuppakki'' was released on 13 November 2012, [[Diwali]] day. The film received positive reviews and became a major commercial success, grossing over {{INRConvert|1|b}} in 11 days of its release. It went on to received seven [[Filmfare Awards South]] nominations in the Tamil branch, including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Film]], [[Filmfare Award for Best Director&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Director]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil|Best Actor]] for Vijay. In 2014 Murugadoss remade the film in [[Hindi]] as ''[[Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty]]'', while [[Baba Yadav]] remade it in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''[[Game: He Plays To Win]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nJagadish Dhanapal, an [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|intelligence officer]] in the [[Indian Army]], returns to [[Mumbai]] from [[Kashmir]]. On his arrival, his parents and younger sisters force him to see Nisha, who they choose for him to be married to. At the bride-viewing ceremony, Jagadish makes up excuses to avoid marrying her, which includes commenting about her being old-fashioned. On the contrary, Nisha is a university-level boxer, who is completely modern in her outlook. Jagadish notices her in a boxing match and falls in love with her instantly. Nisha reciprocates after refusing him initially.\n\nOne day, Jagadish witnesses the explosion of a bus in which he and his police officer-friend Balaji had travelled. He manages to capture the man who laid the bomb, but he escapes from the hospital where he was kept under custody. Jagadish captures the bomber again, and also forces the police officer who helped the bomber's escape, to commit suicide. Jagadish soon learns that the bomber is a mere executor, a [[sleeper agent]], whose only role was to plant the bomb. He also discovers that the sleeper cell, which the bomber belongs to, has planned various such attacks in the city in a couple of days. Enlisting the help of his fellow army men and Balaji, Jagadish manages to thwart these attacks and kill the sleeper agent leader's brother and eleven other agents, including the previously captured sleeper agent.\n\nWhen the leader of the sleeper cell learns about the role of Jagdish in thwarting the attack, he begins to target the families of the army men, except Jagadish, by kidnapping someone close to them. When Jagadish realises the plan, he substitutes one of the people to be kidnapped, with his younger sister Sanjana. Using his pet dog and his sister's ''[[dupatta]]'', he manages to reach the sleeper cell's hideout, rescuing his sister, who was about to be killed after Jagadish's bluff was exposed, and the other victims and eliminating the sleeper agents assembled there. The second-in-command of the sleeper agents is captured and killed by Jagdish.\n\nWith this attack too having failed, the sleeper cell leader decides to target Jagadish himself. He kills one of Jagadish's friends and asks Jagadish to surrender to him or else there would be more attacks. Jagadish decides to sacrifice his life and devises a plan with his fellow army men. Jagadish meets the leader in a ship, which has been rigged with a bomb planted by another of Jagadish's friends. When he learns about the leader's plan of infiltrating the Indian Army with sleeper agents with the help of a traitor in the Indian Defense&nbsp;\u2014 Kameeruddin [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]], the current Joint Secretary in Defence, Jagadish decides to abandon his suicidal plan. He mocks the leader and compels him to a fight before escaping in a boat, with the leader as hostage. After the ship explodes, he kills the bewildered leader. Jagadish confronts Kameeruddin and forces him to commit suicide, before returning to Kashmir along with his fellow army men.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Jagadish Dhanapal<ref name=\"IBTReview\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.in/movie-review-039thuppaki039-hits-bulls-eye-405645 |title=Movie Review: 'Thuppaki' Hits Bull's-Eye |last=Kumar |first=Manoj |date=16 November 2012 |website=[[International Business Times]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119203514/http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/405645/20121116/thuppaki-movie-review-vijay-murugadoss-film-release.htm |archive-date=19 November 2012 |access-date=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Kajal Aggarwal]] as Nisha<ref name=\"On-target\" />\n* [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]] as Balaji<ref name=\"On-target\" />\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as the sleeper cell's unnamed leader<ref name=\"On-target\" />\n* [[Jayaram]] as V.
