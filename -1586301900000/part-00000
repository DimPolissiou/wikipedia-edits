Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants.

The [[sulfur]]-containing amino acids, [[methionine]] and [[homocysteine]], can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized ''de novo'' in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the [[aromatic]] amino acid pair, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Likewise [[arginine]], [[ornithine]], and [[citrulline]], which are interconvertible by the [[urea cycle]], are considered a single group.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Effects of deficiency==\n{{Main|Protein-energy malnutrition}}\nIf one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than adequate.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, including the brain and brain function of infants and young children; the immune system, thus elevating risk of infection; gut [[mucosal]] function and permeability, which affects absorption and vulnerability to [[systemic disease]]; and kidney function.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair.

Measures include the [[biological value]], [[net protein utilization]], [[protein efficiency ratio]], [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score|protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score]] and [[Complete protein|complete proteins concept]]. These concepts are important in the [[animal husbandry|livestock industry]], because the relative lack of one or more of the essential amino acids in [[fodder|animal feeds]] would have a limiting effect on growth and thus on [[feed conversion ratio]]. Thus, various feedstuffs may be fed in combination to increase net protein utilization, or a [[Dietary supplement|supplement]] of an individual amino acid (methionine, lysine, threonine, or tryptophan) can be added to the feed.\n\n===Protein per calorie===\nProtein content in foods is often measured in protein per serving rather than protein per calorie. For instance, the USDA lists 6 grams of protein per large whole egg (a 50-gram serving) rather than 84&nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (71 calories total).<ref>{{cite book |title=SDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference |date=2008 |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service |edition=Release 21}}</ref> For comparison, there are 2.8 grams of protein in a serving of raw broccoli (100 grams) or 82&nbsp;mg of protein per calorie (34 calories total), or the [[Daily Value]] of 47.67g of protein after eating 1,690g of raw broccoli a day at 574 cal.<ref name=Broccoli>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Broccoli%2C_raw_nutritional_value.html |title=Broccoli, raw: nutritional value and analysis |last=Vanovschi |first=Vitalii |website=www.nutritionvalue.org |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> An egg contains 12.5g of protein per 100g, but 4&nbsp;mg more protein per calorie, or the protein DV after 381g of egg, which is 545 cal.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nutritionvalue.org/Egg%2C_poached%2C_cooked%2C_whole_nutritional_value.html |title=Egg, poached, cooked, whole: nutritional value and analysis |last=Vanovschi |first=Vitalii |website=www.nutritionvalue.org |access-date=4 November 2019}}</ref> The ratio of essential amino acids (the quality of protein) is not taken into account, one would actually need to eat more than 3&nbsp;kg of broccoli a day to have a healthy protein profile, and almost 6&nbsp;kg to get enough calories.<ref name=Broccoli/> It is recommended that adult humans obtain between 10\u201335% of their 2000 calories a day as protein.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/protein |title=Web MD Protein: Are You Getting Enough? |publisher=webmd.com |date=2014-09-05 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Complete proteins in non-human animals==\nScientists had known since the early 20th century that rats could not survive on a diet whose only protein source was [[zein]], which comes from [[maize]] (corn), but recovered if they were fed [[casein]] from cow's milk. This led [[William Cumming Rose]] to the discovery of the essential amino acid [[threonine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Rose WC, Haines WJ, Warner DT, Johnson JE |title=The amino acid requirements of man.

Rose's later work showed that eight amino acids are essential for adult human beings, with histidine also being essential for infants. Longer-term studies established histidine as also essential for adult humans.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kopple JD, Swendseid ME |date=May 1975 |title=Evidence that histidine is an essential amino acid in normal and chronically uremic man. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=881\u2013891 |pmid=1123426 |pmc=301830 |doi=10.1172/JCI108016}}</ref>\n\n==Interchangeability==\nThe distinction between essential and non-essential amino acids is somewhat unclear, as some amino acids can be produced from others. The [[sulfur]]-containing amino acids, [[methionine]] and [[homocysteine]], can be converted into each other but neither can be synthesized ''de novo'' in humans. Likewise, cysteine can be made from homocysteine but cannot be synthesized on its own. So, for convenience, sulfur-containing amino acids are sometimes considered a single pool of nutritionally equivalent amino acids as are the [[aromatic]] amino acid pair, [[phenylalanine]] and [[tyrosine]]. Likewise [[arginine]], [[ornithine]], and [[citrulline]], which are interconvertible by the [[urea cycle]], are considered a single group.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Effects of deficiency==\n{{Main|Protein-energy malnutrition}}\nIf one of the essential amino acids is less than needed for an individual the utilization of other amino acids will be hindered and thus protein synthesis will be less than adequate.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> Protein deficiency has been shown to affect all of the body's organs and many of its systems, including the brain and brain function of infants and young children; the immune system, thus elevating risk of infection; gut [[mucosal]] function and permeability, which affects absorption and vulnerability to [[systemic disease]]; and kidney function.<ref name=\"DRI\" /> The physical signs of protein deficiency include edema, failure to thrive in infants and children, poor musculature, dull skin, and thin and fragile hair. Biochemical changes reflecting protein deficiency include low [[serum albumin]] and low [[serum transferrin]].<ref name=\"DRI\" />\n\nThe amino acids that are essential in the human diet were established in a series of experiments led by [[William Cumming Rose]]. The experiments involved elemental diets to healthy male graduate students. These diets consisted of [[Corn starch|cornstarch]], [[sucrose]], [[butterfat]] without protein, [[corn oil]], inorganic salts, the known [[vitamin]]s, a large brown \"candy\" made of liver extract flavored with [[peppermint oil]] (to supply any unknown vitamins), and mixtures of highly purified individual amino acids. The main outcome measure was [[nitrogen balance]]. Rose noted that the symptoms of nervousness, exhaustion, and dizziness were encountered to a greater or lesser extent whenever human subjects were deprived of an essential amino acid.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rose |first1=WC |last2=Haines |first2=WJ |last3=Warner |first3=DT |title=The amino acid requirements of man.

He was the longest-serving original member, having remained in the band until his death and appearing on every studio album released from 1969 to 2014. In 2017, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Yes.<ref name=\"rrhofyes\">{{cite web|title=Inductees: Yes|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/yes|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=20 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nSquire was widely regarded as the dominant bassist among the English progressive rock bands, influencing peers and later generations of bassists with his incisive sound and elaborately contoured, melodic bass lines. His name was associated with his trademark instrument, the [[Rickenbacker 4001]]. From 1991 to 2000, Rickenbacker produced a limited edition signature model bass in his name, the [[Rickenbacker 4001CS|4001CS]].\n\n==Early life==\nSquire was born on 4 March 1948 in the north west London suburb of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]], to Peter and Joanne Squire.<ref name=teamrock2014/> He grew up there and in the nearby [[Queensbury, London|Queensbury]] and [[Wembley]] areas.<ref name=welch24>[[#Welch2008|Welch 2008, p. 24.]]</ref><ref name=hedges15>[[#Hedges1982|Hedges 1982, p. 15.]]</ref><ref name=teamrock2014/> His father was a cab driver and his mother a secretary for an estate agent. As a youngster Squire took a liking to [[Lena Horne]] and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] records belonging to his father, though his main interest was [[church music]].<ref name=hedges15/> At age six,<ref name=welch25>[[#Welch2008|Welch 2008, p. 25.]]</ref> he joined the church choir at St. Andrew's in Kingsbury as a [[soprano]] with [[Andrew Pryce Jackman]], a friend of his who lived nearby. The choir got to perform at [[St. Paul's cathedral]].<ref name=beggs2004/><ref name=circus1975>{{cite journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201081526/http://zenponies.com/yitp/1976/nov/nov25_76.html|url=http://zenponies.com/yitp/1976/nov/nov25_76.html|archive-date=1 December 2016|title=Chris Squire: The Survivor|date=25 November 1975|first=Scott|last=Cohen|magazine=Circus|accessdate=28 November 2019}}</ref> Their choirmaster, [[Barry Rose]], was an early influence on Squire. \"He made me realise that working at it was the way to become best at something\".<ref name=hedges15/> Squire also sang in the choir at his next school, [[Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School]], then located in [[Hampstead]].<ref name=\"close\">Welch, Chris.: ''Close to the Edge: The Story of Yes''. (London: Omnibus Press, 1999).</ref> He played the [[harmonica]] on his way home from school.<ref name=beggs2004/>\n\nSquire did not consider a music career until the age of sixteen when the emergence of [[the Beatles]] and the [[Beat music]] boom in the early 1960s inspired him to \"be in a group that don't use music stands\". A school friend recommended Squire to take up the bass after pointing out his tall frame and large hands, thinking they were ideal for playing the instrument.<ref name=teamrock2014/><ref name=hedges15/><ref name=hedges18>[[#Hedges1982|Hedges 1982, p. 18.]]</ref><ref name=beggs2004/> Squire then purchased his first bass, a Futurama, which he described as \"very cheap, but good enough to learn on.\"<ref name=\"Soocher, Stan 1979\">Soocher, Stan: \"Squire's bass fire\", ''Circus Weekly'', 13 March 1979, 33.</ref> In 1964, on the last day before the summer holidays, Squire's headmaster suspended him and a friend for having their hair too long and they were given two shillings and sixpence to have it cut. Instead, they went home and never returned.<ref name=teamrock2014/><ref name=\"close\"/> After his mother took him to a recruitment agency and enquired for work related to music, Squire landed work selling guitars at a [[Boosey & Hawkes]] shop in [[Regent Street]].<ref name=teamrock2014/> He used the staff discount offer to purchase a new bass, a [[Rickenbacker 4001]], in 1965.<ref name=hedges18/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nSquire's first band was [[the Selfs]], a rock and rhythm and blues band that featured Jackman on keyboards and Martin Adelman on drums. Their first public performance took place at The Graveyard, a youth club in the hall of St. Andrew's.<ref name=hedges18/> In 1965, following several personnel changes, Squire, Jackman and Adelman teamed with singer [[Steve Nardelli]], guitarist John Painter, and drummer Gunnar J\u00f6kull H\u00e1konarson to form a new group, [[the Syn]]. The group performed [[Tamla Motown]] covers before they changed direction towards [[psychedelic rock]].<ref name=teamrock2014/> After several months, Painter was replaced by guitarist [[Peter Banks]].<ref name=hedges18/> The new line-up gained a following large enough to secure a weekly residency at the [[Marquee Club]] in [[Soho]], which was followed by a recording contract with [[Deram Records]]. The band once opened for [[Jimi Hendrix]] at the venue, \"So I saw what was possible, and I just had this innate faith that I was going to make it.\"<ref name=teamrock2014/> Together they released two singles before they disbanded.<ref name=hedges18/>\n\nSquire was fond of using [[LSD]] in the 1960s; a visit to the [[UFO Club]] on the drug on Friday which lasted through Saturday, and recovery on Sunday, became a regular event until a 1967 incident where he had a bad trip on a friend's home made LSD.<ref name=teamrock2014>{{cite web|url=http://teamrock.com/feature/2014-08-13/big-generator|title=Chris Squire: the hands that built prog|date=13 August 2014|first=Mark|last=Blake|publisher=TeamRock|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> When the police asked him to reveal who gave it to him, Squire pretended to be disoriented and made up a story that involved an unknown Australian he met at a [[Wimpy (restaurant)|Wimpy]] restaurant beforehand.<ref name=teamrock2014/> He recalled, \"It was the last time I ever took it, having ended up in hospital in [[Fulham]] for a couple of days not knowing who I was, or what I was, or who anybody else was.\"<ref name=hedges19>[[#Hedges1982|Hedges 1982, p. 19.]]</ref> After his discharge from hospital, Squire spent several months in his girlfriend's apartment, afraid to leave, only managing to visit the corner shop.<ref name=teamrock2014/> He spent each day practising his bass playing which resulted in his distinct style,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.al.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/07/post_176.html|title=Yes Q&A: Chris Squire talks LSD, 'Almost Famous,' Jimmy Page project, current tour featuring classic LPs|publisher=AL.com|first=Matt|last=Wake|date=15 July 2013|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=teamrock2014/> citing bassists [[John Entwistle]], [[Jack Bruce]], [[Larry Graham]],<ref name=\"Soocher, Stan 1979\"/> and [[Bill Wyman]] as early influences.<ref name=beggs2004>{{cite web|url=http://zenponies.com/yitp/2004/oct/oct07_04.html|title=The Day the Earth Stood Still: Chris Squire Interview|date=7 October 2004|first=Nick|last=Beggs|publisher=Kajagoogoo.com|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Yes===\n[[File:Chris Squire, 1973 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|200px|upright|Squire in 1974]]\nIn September 1967, Squire joined [[Mabel Greer's Toyshop]], a psychedelic group that included [[Peter Banks]], singer Clive Bayley and drummer Bob Hagger.<ref name=welch3235>[[#Welch2008|Welch 2008, pp. 32\u201335.]]</ref> They played at the Marquee club where Jack Barrie, owner of the La Chasse drinking club a few doors down, saw them perform. \"The musicianship&nbsp;... was very good but it was obvious they weren't going anywhere\", he recalled.<ref name=welch2223>Welch, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> One evening at La Chasse, Barrie introduced Squire to [[Jon Anderson]], a worker at the bar who had not found success as the lead singer of [[The Gun (band)|The Gun]] or as a solo artist.<ref name=welch2223/> The two found they shared common musical interests including [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[The Association]] and [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]]. In the following days they developed \"Sweetness\", a track later recorded for the [[Yes (Yes album)|first Yes album]].<ref name=welch24/>\n\nAs the band developed, Anderson and Squire brought in drummer [[Bill Bruford]], keyboardist [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] and Banks for rehearsals. The five agreed to drop the name Mabel Greer's Toyshop; they settled on the name Yes, originally Banks's idea.<ref name=welch3235/> The band played their first show as Yes at a youth camp in [[East Mersea]], [[Essex]] on 4 August 1968.<ref name=welch45>Welch, p. 45.</ref> Squire spoke about the band's formation: \"I couldn't get [[session musician|session work]] because most musicians hated my style. They wanted me to play something a lot more basic. We started Yes as a vehicle to develop everyone's individual styles.\"<ref>Gill, Chris. Guitar World's ''Bass Guitar'', Fall 2003 issue, p. 22.</ref> Squire developed a bass solo named \"A Bass Odyssey\".<ref name=teamrock2014/>\n\nIn August 1969, Yes released their self-titled [[Yes (Yes album)|debut album]]. Martyn Adelman, who had played drums with Squire's first group, did the album photos. Squire received writing credits on four of the album's eight tracks\u2014\"Beyond & Before\", \"Looking Around\", \"Harold Land\", and \"Sweetness\".<ref name=yes1969>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Yes|publisher=Atlantic Records|id=588 190|year=1969}}</ref>\n\nAfter Bruford left the band and was replaced by [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] in July 1972, Squire altered his playing to suit the change in the band's rhythm section. He felt he was \"playing too much, though I was never really sure. With Bill, the things that I did felt right ... With Alan, I found that I was able to play a bit less than before and still get my playing across\".<ref>[[#Morse1996|Morse 1996, p. 41.]]</ref>\n\nSquire described his playing on \"The Remembering (High the Memory)\" from ''[[Tales from Topographic Oceans]]'' (1973) as \"one of the nicest things I think I've ever played\".<ref>[[#Morse1996|Morse 1996, p. 47.]]</ref>\n\nSquire was the only member to play on each of their 21 studio albums released from 1969 to 2014. He was seen as one of the main forces behind the band's music, as well as being \"perhaps the most enigmatic\" group member.<ref>[[#Welch2008|Welch 2008, p. 10.]]</ref> ''[[Heaven & Earth (Yes album)|Heaven & Earth]]'' was his final studio album.<ref name=\"dies\">{{cite news|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/chris-squire-dies-yes/|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|first=Nick|last=DeRiso|date=28 June 2015|accessdate=28 June 2015|title=Yes Co-Founder Chris Squire Dies}}</ref>\n\nWhile most of the band's lyrics were written by Anderson, Squire co-wrote much of their music with guitarist [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]] (with Anderson occasionally contributing). In addition, Squire and Howe would supply backing vocals in harmony with Anderson on songs such as \"[[South Side of the Sky]]\" and \"[[Close to the Edge (song)|Close to the Edge]]\".\n\nDuring the band's formative years Squire was frequently known for his lateness, a habit that Bruford often complained about. Because of this, Squire would frequently drive at unsafe speeds to get to gigs on time, once causing an accident on the way to a gig in [[West Germany]] after he fell asleep at the wheel, although nobody was injured. Later on a plaque \"The Late Chris Squire\" was written in reference to it. (Shown Below)<ref name=\"close\"/>\n\nAs Squire, along with [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]] and [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]], co-owned the \"Yes\" name at the time, the 1989 [[Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe|ABWH]] line-up without him (which contained Anderson, Bruford, [[Rick Wakeman|Wakeman]] and Howe) could not record under that name.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/anderson-bruford-wakeman-howe/|title=Yes Minus One: The History of 'Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe'|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|first=Jeff|last=Giles|date=20 June 2015|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Chris Squire Beacon Theatre 2013-04-09.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Squire performing with Yes in April 2013]]\nFollowing Squire's death on 27 June 2015, the band's show on 7 August of the same year marked the first Yes concert ever performed without him.

Aside from his aforementioned use of distortion, Squire occasionally used other effects, most notably [[Chorus effect|chorus]], [[flanger]] and [[wah-wah pedal|wah-wah]] pedals, which until then had mostly been used by guitarists.\n\nIn a 1973 interview for ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, Squire recalled how he had obtained his distinctive tone at the time by rewiring his RM1999 into stereo and sending the bass and treble [[Pick up (music technology)|pick-up]]s each into a separate amplifier. By splitting the signal from his bass into dual high and low frequency outputs and then sending the low frequency output to a conventional bass [[amplifier]] and the high-frequency output to a separate lead guitar amplifier, Squire produced a tonal \"sandwich\" that added a growling, overdrive edge to the sound while retaining the Rickenbacker's powerful bass response. This gave his bass sound bright, growling higher frequencies and clean, solid bass frequencies. This technique allowed Squire to use [[harmonic distortion]] on his bass while avoiding the flat, fuzzy sound, loss of power and poor bass response that typically occurs when bass guitars are overdriven through an amplifier or put through a [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ferris |first=Leonard |date=July 1973 |title=Yes' Bassist Chris Squire |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |page=42}}</ref>\nSquire also made notable use of fret buzz, a normally undesirable condition caused by low string action, to create a further, growling edge to his playing.\n\nSquire claimed to have rewired his bass to stereo, even before Rickenbacker introduced the Rick-O-Sound feature, so he could send the output of the bass (neck) pick-up through a fuzz box, while keeping the treble (bridge) pick-up clean, because the last sounded \"horribly nasal\" when used with the fuzz effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/basso-cantantecontinuo-chris/January-2009/91289 |title=Basso Cantante, Continuo Chris Squire's Singing Bass Rings Again With Yes |publisher=Bassplayer.com |accessdate=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213704/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/basso-cantantecontinuo-chris/January-2009/91289 |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> He also played with a pick which contributed to the sharp attack as well as using fresh Rotosound Swing Bass strings for every show.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxDbKssKXzEC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=%22chris+squire%22++rotosound|title=Bass Heroes: Tom Mulhern |accessdate=17 August 2011|isbn=9780879302740|author1=Mulhern|first1=Tom|year=1993}}</ref> Squire's intricate and complex bass playing style has influenced subsequent bassists such as [[Billy Sheehan]], [[Geddy Lee]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Steve Di Giorgio]] of [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and [[Sadus]], [[Pat Badger]] of [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/4eyDu4I1r9/|title=Pat Badger on Instagram: \u201cI'm deeply saddened to hear of the passing of one of my biggest influences Chris Squire.

Aside from his aforementioned use of distortion, Squire occasionally used other effects, most notably [[Chorus effect|chorus]], [[flanger]] and [[wah-wah pedal|wah-wah]] pedals, which until then had mostly been used by guitarists.\n\nIn a 1973 interview for ''[[Guitar Player]]'' magazine, Squire recalled how he had obtained his distinctive tone at the time by rewiring his RM1999 into stereo and sending the bass and treble [[Pick up (music technology)|pick-up]]s each into a separate amplifier. By splitting the signal from his bass into dual high and low frequency outputs and then sending the low frequency output to a conventional bass [[amplifier]] and the high-frequency output to a separate lead guitar amplifier, Squire produced a tonal \"sandwich\" that added a growling, overdrive edge to the sound while retaining the Rickenbacker's powerful bass response. This gave his bass sound bright, growling higher frequencies and clean, solid bass frequencies. This technique allowed Squire to use [[harmonic distortion]] on his bass while avoiding the flat, fuzzy sound, loss of power and poor bass response that typically occurs when bass guitars are overdriven through an amplifier or put through a [[Distortion (music)|fuzz box]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ferris |first=Leonard |date=July 1973 |title=Yes' Bassist Chris Squire |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |page=42}}</ref>\nSquire also made notable use of fret buzz, a normally undesirable condition caused by low string action, to create a further, growling edge to his playing.\n\nSquire claimed to have rewired his bass to stereo, even before Rickenbacker introduced the Rick-O-Sound feature, so he could send the output of the bass (neck) pick-up through a fuzz box, while keeping the treble (bridge) pick-up clean, because the last sounded \"horribly nasal\" when used with the fuzz effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/basso-cantantecontinuo-chris/January-2009/91289 |title=Basso Cantante, Continuo Chris Squire's Singing Bass Rings Again With Yes |publisher=Bassplayer.com |accessdate=17 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707213704/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/basso-cantantecontinuo-chris/January-2009/91289 |archivedate=7 July 2011 }}</ref> He also played with a pick which contributed to the sharp attack as well as using fresh Rotosound Swing Bass strings for every show.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QxDbKssKXzEC&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=%22chris+squire%22++rotosound|title=Bass Heroes: Tom Mulhern |accessdate=17 August 2011|isbn=9780879302740|author1=Mulhern|first1=Tom|year=1993}}</ref> Squire's intricate and complex bass playing style has influenced subsequent bassists such as [[Billy Sheehan]], [[Geddy Lee]] of [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Steve Di Giorgio]] of [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and [[Sadus]], [[Pat Badger]] of [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/4eyDu4I1r9/|title=Pat Badger on Instagram: \u201cI'm deeply saddened to hear of the passing of one of my biggest influences Chris Squire.

He was most recently the head coach and technical director at [[Major League Soccer]] club [[Toronto FC]], until his dismissal in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toronto FC fires coach Paul Mariner, replaced by Ryan Nelsen|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/soccer/tfc/2013/01/07/toronto_fc_fires_coach_paul_mariner_replaced_by_ryan_nelsen.html|work=Toronto Star|publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nA [[centre forward]] during his playing days, Mariner began his career with [[Chorley F.C.|Chorley]]. He became a professional player in 1973 with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], where he scored 61 goals in 155 appearances and is considered to be one of the club's best players. He joined [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] in 1976, where he achieved domestic and European success under the guidance of [[Bobby Robson]]. He was called up to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]] during his time at [[Portman Road]], and went on to represent his country at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]]. He spent two years with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and then [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] before finishing his career abroad. He played for clubs in Australia, the US, and [[Malta]].\n\nHe took up coaching during his time with the [[Albany Capitals]] and focused on it fully when he retired from playing. After spending time working in [[Japan]], he returned to America to coach, firstly in [[Arizona]] and then at [[Harvard University]]. He joined [[Major League Soccer]] club [[New England Revolution]] in 2004 as a member of [[Steve Nicol]]'s coaching staff. After five years in [[Massachusetts]], Mariner returned to Plymouth Argyle in 2009 as their head coach. He succeeded [[Paul Sturrock]] as the club's manager two months later before returning to his role as head coach upon the arrival of [[Peter Reid]]. In January 2011, he returned to Major League Soccer as director of player development at [[Toronto FC]].\n\nMariner is currently the [[color commentator]] for the New England Revolution of MLS. Starting in 2020, Mariner only commentates for some of the Revolution games, and shares the duty with [[Charlie Davies]]. \n\n==Playing career==\n===1970s===\n[[File:Paul Mariner cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=|Mariner during his time with Ipswich Town|155px]]\n\nMariner started his career as an [[amateur]] player at non-league club [[Chorley F.C.|Chorley]], close to his Lancashire roots and his style at the helm of their attack caught the attention of [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], for whom he signed in 1973.\n\nSo began an impressive scoring record with the [[Devon]] club, with 56 goals in 135 appearances coming before [[Bobby Robson]], who had been personally monitoring Mariner's progress, took him to Ipswich for \u00a3220,000 with [[John Peddelty]] and [[Terry Austin (footballer)|Terry Austin]] moving in the opposite direction as part of the deal. Mariner chose Ipswich ahead of similar offers from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Knight |title=Plymouth Argyle: A Complete Record 1903\u20131989 |year=1989 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |isbn=0-907969-40-2 |pages=157\u2013158}}</ref>\n\nMariner made his debut in September 1976 and quickly settled into the Ipswich side as an old-fashioned number 9 \u2013 i.e., a forward capable of taking hard tackles and rough treatment from [[Defender (football)|defender]]s but willing to give it back, while also scoring a fair share of goals. Received wisdom suggests that Mariner was only a 'target-man'-type centre forward but he scored plenty of goals with his feet and had the skill to create his own chances on the deck, rather than relying entirely on service through the centre and via the flanks.\n\nSuch was Mariner's impact that six months after joining Ipswich, he made his England debut as a [[substitute (soccer)|substitute]] in a 5\u20130 win over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and played from the beginning in the following game against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in the [[British Home Championship]] at [[Windsor Park]], [[Belfast]]. He impressed in both games, though didn't score and was not selected for the next six matches. During this period, Ipswich finished third in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], with Mariner contributing ten goals from 28 games.\n\nMariner's third England cap came in the return World Cup qualifier in Luxembourg, scoring a last-minute goal in a 2\u20130 win which England really needed to win by much more in order to give themselves half a chance of qualifying for the [[Football World Cup 1978|1978 World Cup]] in Argentina. By now, Mariner had become one of a number of 'target man'-type centre forwards for England coach [[Ron Greenwood]] to select from, with the likes of [[Stuart Pearson]] and [[Bob Latchford]] also on the scene. It was Mariner, however, who would get the nod for the majority of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, at club level, Mariner was having a mixed time. He scored eleven goals in 37 appearances for Ipswich, which maintained his England aspirations but the team underperformed in the First Division and finished a lowly 18th. However, they reached the [[FA Cup]] final at Wembley where they memorably beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20130. Mariner hit the woodwork with one chance and generally caused havoc to the Arsenal defence, earning him the ''Man Of The Match'' award afterwards.\n\nGreenwood decided not to select Mariner for England throughout 1979, although he enjoyed his most productive spell for Ipswich in front of goal that season, hitting 13 in 33 matches. It wasn't until 1980 that Mariner won a sixth England cap \u2013 almost exactly two years after his fifth \u2013 and he scored England's goal in a surprising 4\u20131 defeat against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Wrexham]]. He stayed in the reckoning thereafter, scoring in a 2\u20131 win over [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] in [[Sydney]] in the final game before England took to the field for the [[1980 European Football Championship|1980 European Championships]]. Mariner was named in Greenwood's squad for the tournament, despite not kicking a ball during the whole qualifying campaign.\n\nHe didn't play in the opening 1\u20131 draw versus [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in [[Turin]] but came on as a sub in the remaining two group matches \u2013 a defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and a victory over [[Spain national football team|Spain]], which ensured England's elimination from the competition.\n\n===1980s===\nMariner maintained his England place as his Ipswich goalscoring record continued to improve \u2013 17 from 41 games had come in 1980 and Ipswich made the early running as the next season got underway. England began their qualifying campaign for the [[Football World Cup 1982|1982 World Cup]] with a conclusive 4\u20130 win over [[Norway national football team|Norway]], with Mariner scoring a superb goal with a deft turn and shot from 25 yards. He was, however, left out of the next game, which turned into a gruesome 2\u20131 defeat against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in [[Bucharest]]. Greenwood put him back in the side a month later for a now vital match against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], and Mariner scored the opener in a 2\u20131 win.\n\nIpswich were challenging for three trophies as the 1981 season approached its climax, with Mariner again to the fore, scoring 13 times in 36 matches. However, they were to miss out on two domestic fronts, with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] winning the First Division (after Ipswich failed to beat [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]) and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] defeating Ipswich in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. But in the [[UEFA Cup]], Mariner was proving to be a real hero as glory beckoned.\n\nHe scored twice in the early rounds as Ipswich progressed to a tasty quarter final against [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|St \u00c9tienne]]. In the first leg in France Mariner put two away as Ipswich went 4\u20131 up, and added another as Ipswich completed the task in the second leg. After winning the semi-final, Mariner scored again in the first leg of the final against [[AZ Alkmaar]] as Ipswich coasted to a 3\u20130 lead, ultimately winning the competition 5\u20134 on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]]. Weeks later, Greenwood put him back in the England side as the World Cup qualification campaign resumed with a defeat in Switzerland, a vital victory in [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and a shock defeat in Norway. It appeared that they may miss out on the World Cup finals for an unthinkable third tournament in a row.\n\nBut results elsewhere miraculously went their way, meaning England only needed to draw with the already qualified Hungary at Wembley in the final game to guarantee qualification. It was Mariner who scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win, though he got it via a stumble which saw him score via a deflection rather than an actual shot on goal. But it was enough.\n\nInjuries to both [[Achilles tendon]]s restricted Mariner's football over the next few months, and he only scored eight times in 25 games for Ipswich. But in the five final England warm-up matches prior to the World Cup in Spain, he scored four times, including a stunning solo run and strike against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at Wembley. He was named in Greenwood's squad and started the first match of the tournament, against [[France national football team|France]].\n\nEngland went into a 2\u20131 lead thanks to a brace from [[Bryan Robson]] \u2013 the first of which was one of the World Cup Finals' quickest-ever goals \u2013 before Mariner slammed home a close-range volley to complete an impressive 3\u20131 win. It was his eleventh international goal in his 22nd match \u2013 an admirable ratio of one goal every other game. It was his also his sixth consecutive scoring game for England \u2013 a feat previously achieved only by [[Jimmy Greaves]].\n\nGreenwood selected Mariner for the rest of the tournament but he didn't score again and England went out in the second phase after two disappointing goalless draws. Mariner is best remembered for dragging a devastated [[Kevin Keegan]] to his feet in support after the England captain, on as a substitute after a tournament ruined by injury problems, sank to his [[knee]]s, head in hands, missed an open goal with a header which would have sent England into the semi-finals.\n\nMariner's club boss Robson subsequently became England coach and he continued to select him as the qualification campaign for the [[1984 European Football Championship|1984 European Championships]] got underway. Mariner continued to score frequently for Ipswich, whose young and vibrant side had started to age and break-up.\n\nEngland's qualification campaign faltered, though Mariner scored in consecutive pool matches against Hungary and Luxembourg \u2013 the latter of which would prove to be his 13th and final England goal. By the time he next played for England, he was an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player, with the Gunners taking him from Ipswich in February 1984 for \u00a3150,000. By now Mariner was in his thirties but he still initially performed well for Arsenal, scoring seven times in the final fifteen games of the season. But age was starting to get the better of him; and he only scored nine goals in 41 games in [[1984-85 in English football|1984\u201385]].\n\nMariner won two more England caps but a sign of things to come had arrived in the shape of [[Mark Hateley]], a tall but skillful young striker exactly in the Mariner mould, while [[Gary Lineker]] and [[Peter Beardsley]] also establishing themselves as international strikers.\n\nHateley came on as a substitute for Mariner in a friendly victory over [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] in September 1984, before Mariner picked up his 35th and final cap in a goalless draw against Romania in May 1985, a qualifier for the [[Football World Cup 1986|1986 World Cup]]. He had scored 13 times for England - the first goal coming on 12 October 1977 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in a [[1978 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier. His last goal for England came on 16 November 1983, also against Luxembourg, but this time in a [[UEFA Euro 1984|European Championship]] qualifier.<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/paul-mariner-9569/english-caps-1977-85_a11852/]</ref>\n\nHowever, with Hateley in the ascendancy and Mariner regularly sidelined at [[Highbury]] during the 1985\u20131986 season, Robson opted not to select him for the England squad which qualified for Mexico '86.\n\nMeanwhile, at his club Mariner was rarely on the field, only playing nine times in [[1985-86 in English football|1985\u201386]], including one match as an emergency [[centre half]]. In the summer of 1986 Arsenal's new manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] gave Mariner a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]]; in all he played 80 times for Arsenal, scoring 17 goals. He signed for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], where he spent two seasons. In May 1989, he signed with the [[Albany Capitals]] of the [[American Soccer League (1988-1989)|American Soccer League]].<ref>''CAPITALS WILL PUT BOLTS TO THE TEST'' Boston Globe \u2013 Saturday, 27 May 1989</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nMariner returned to the Capitals in 1990 as the team now played in the [[American Professional Soccer League]], formed by the merger of the American Soccer League and [[Western Soccer League]].

In the spring of 1992, the Capitals' owner offered him the position of head coach but when he heard a rumour that the team was about to collapse, he accepted a position as a player-assistant coach with the [[San Francisco Bay Blackhawks]]. He accepted that position and soon after the Capitals announced they were ceasing operations. In the early 1990s Paul made two appearances for Byhams Dairy, a Sunday League team in Sudbury Suffolk<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jonathanvankin.com/mariner1.html |title=The Player |access-date=29 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306204006/http://jonathanvankin.com/mariner1.html |archive-date=6 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Coaching==\n===Early career===\nAfter retiring, Mariner worked as a football pundit for [[BBC Radio Lancashire]] for their Friday-night Non-League Hour<ref>http://www.chorleyfc.com/club-news_article.asp?Key=284{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> before setting up a management company for footballers.

He was called up to play for the [[England national football team|England national team]] during his time at [[Portman Road]], and went on to represent his country at the [[UEFA Euro 1980|1980 European Championships]] and the [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982 World Cup]]. He spent two years with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and then [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] before finishing his career abroad. He played for clubs in Australia, the US, and [[Malta]].\n\nHe took up coaching during his time with the [[Albany Capitals]] and focused on it fully when he retired from playing. After spending time working in [[Japan]], he returned to America to coach, firstly in [[Arizona]] and then at [[Harvard University]]. He joined [[Major League Soccer]] club [[New England Revolution]] in 2004 as a member of [[Steve Nicol]]'s coaching staff. After five years in [[Massachusetts]], Mariner returned to Plymouth Argyle in 2009 as their head coach. He succeeded [[Paul Sturrock]] as the club's manager two months later before returning to his role as head coach upon the arrival of [[Peter Reid]]. In January 2011, he returned to Major League Soccer as director of player development at [[Toronto FC]].\n\nMariner is currently the [[color commentator]] for the New England Revolution of MLS. Starting in 2020, Mariner only commentates for some of the Revolution games, and shares the duty with [[Charlie Davies]]. \n\n==Playing career==\n===1970s===\n[[File:Paul Mariner cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=|Mariner during his time with Ipswich Town|155px]]\n\nMariner started his career as an [[amateur]] player at non-league club [[Chorley F.C.|Chorley]], close to his Lancashire roots and his style at the helm of their attack caught the attention of [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], for whom he signed in 1973.\n\nSo began an impressive scoring record with the [[Devon]] club, with 56 goals in 135 appearances coming before [[Bobby Robson]], who had been personally monitoring Mariner's progress, took him to Ipswich for \u00a3220,000 with [[John Peddelty]] and [[Terry Austin (footballer)|Terry Austin]] moving in the opposite direction as part of the deal. Mariner chose Ipswich ahead of similar offers from [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Knight |title=Plymouth Argyle: A Complete Record 1903\u20131989 |year=1989 |publisher=Breedon Books |location=Derby |isbn=0-907969-40-2 |pages=157\u2013158}}</ref>\n\nMariner made his debut in September 1976 and quickly settled into the Ipswich side as an old-fashioned number 9 \u2013 i.e., a forward capable of taking hard tackles and rough treatment from [[Defender (football)|defender]]s but willing to give it back, while also scoring a fair share of goals. Received wisdom suggests that Mariner was only a 'target-man'-type centre forward but he scored plenty of goals with his feet and had the skill to create his own chances on the deck, rather than relying entirely on service through the centre and via the flanks.\n\nSuch was Mariner's impact that six months after joining Ipswich, he made his England debut as a [[substitute (soccer)|substitute]] in a 5\u20130 win over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] and played from the beginning in the following game against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] in the [[British Home Championship]] at [[Windsor Park]], [[Belfast]]. He impressed in both games, though didn't score and was not selected for the next six matches. During this period, Ipswich finished third in the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], with Mariner contributing ten goals from 28 games.\n\nMariner's third England cap came in the return World Cup qualifier in Luxembourg, scoring a last-minute goal in a 2\u20130 win which England really needed to win by much more in order to give themselves half a chance of qualifying for the [[Football World Cup 1978|1978 World Cup]] in Argentina. By now, Mariner had become one of a number of 'target man'-type centre forwards for England coach [[Ron Greenwood]] to select from, with the likes of [[Stuart Pearson]] and [[Bob Latchford]] also on the scene. It was Mariner, however, who would get the nod for the majority of the time.\n\nMeanwhile, at club level, Mariner was having a mixed time. He scored eleven goals in 37 appearances for Ipswich, which maintained his England aspirations but the team underperformed in the First Division and finished a lowly 18th. However, they reached the [[FA Cup]] final at Wembley where they memorably beat [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 1\u20130. Mariner hit the woodwork with one chance and generally caused havoc to the Arsenal defence, earning him the ''Man Of The Match'' award afterwards.\n\nGreenwood decided not to select Mariner for England throughout 1979, although he enjoyed his most productive spell for Ipswich in front of goal that season, hitting 13 in 33 matches. It wasn't until 1980 that Mariner won a sixth England cap \u2013 almost exactly two years after his fifth \u2013 and he scored England's goal in a surprising 4\u20131 defeat against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at [[Wrexham]]. He stayed in the reckoning thereafter, scoring in a 2\u20131 win over [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] in [[Sydney]] in the final game before England took to the field for the [[1980 European Football Championship|1980 European Championships]]. Mariner was named in Greenwood's squad for the tournament, despite not kicking a ball during the whole qualifying campaign.\n\nHe didn't play in the opening 1\u20131 draw versus [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] in [[Turin]] but came on as a sub in the remaining two group matches \u2013 a defeat against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and a victory over [[Spain national football team|Spain]], which ensured England's elimination from the competition.\n\n===1980s===\nMariner maintained his England place as his Ipswich goalscoring record continued to improve \u2013 17 from 41 games had come in 1980 and Ipswich made the early running as the next season got underway. England began their qualifying campaign for the [[Football World Cup 1982|1982 World Cup]] with a conclusive 4\u20130 win over [[Norway national football team|Norway]], with Mariner scoring a superb goal with a deft turn and shot from 25 yards. He was, however, left out of the next game, which turned into a gruesome 2\u20131 defeat against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in [[Bucharest]]. Greenwood put him back in the side a month later for a now vital match against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]], and Mariner scored the opener in a 2\u20131 win.\n\nIpswich were challenging for three trophies as the 1981 season approached its climax, with Mariner again to the fore, scoring 13 times in 36 matches. However, they were to miss out on two domestic fronts, with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] winning the First Division (after Ipswich failed to beat [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]) and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] defeating Ipswich in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. But in the [[UEFA Cup]], Mariner was proving to be a real hero as glory beckoned.\n\nHe scored twice in the early rounds as Ipswich progressed to a tasty quarter final against [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|St \u00c9tienne]]. In the first leg in France Mariner put two away as Ipswich went 4\u20131 up, and added another as Ipswich completed the task in the second leg. After winning the semi-final, Mariner scored again in the first leg of the final against [[AZ Alkmaar]] as Ipswich coasted to a 3\u20130 lead, ultimately winning the competition 5\u20134 on [[Aggregate score|aggregate]]. Weeks later, Greenwood put him back in the England side as the World Cup qualification campaign resumed with a defeat in Switzerland, a vital victory in [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] and a shock defeat in Norway. It appeared that they may miss out on the World Cup finals for an unthinkable third tournament in a row.\n\nBut results elsewhere miraculously went their way, meaning England only needed to draw with the already qualified Hungary at Wembley in the final game to guarantee qualification. It was Mariner who scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 win, though he got it via a stumble which saw him score via a deflection rather than an actual shot on goal. But it was enough.\n\nInjuries to both [[Achilles tendon]]s restricted Mariner's football over the next few months, and he only scored eight times in 25 games for Ipswich. But in the five final England warm-up matches prior to the World Cup in Spain, he scored four times, including a stunning solo run and strike against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] at Wembley. He was named in Greenwood's squad and started the first match of the tournament, against [[France national football team|France]].\n\nEngland went into a 2\u20131 lead thanks to a brace from [[Bryan Robson]] \u2013 the first of which was one of the World Cup Finals' quickest-ever goals \u2013 before Mariner slammed home a close-range volley to complete an impressive 3\u20131 win. It was his eleventh international goal in his 22nd match \u2013 an admirable ratio of one goal every other game. It was his also his sixth consecutive scoring game for England \u2013 a feat previously achieved only by [[Jimmy Greaves]].\n\nGreenwood selected Mariner for the rest of the tournament but he didn't score again and England went out in the second phase after two disappointing goalless draws. Mariner is best remembered for dragging a devastated [[Kevin Keegan]] to his feet in support after the England captain, on as a substitute after a tournament ruined by injury problems, sank to his [[knee]]s, head in hands, missed an open goal with a header which would have sent England into the semi-finals.\n\nMariner's club boss Robson subsequently became England coach and he continued to select him as the qualification campaign for the [[1984 European Football Championship|1984 European Championships]] got underway. Mariner continued to score frequently for Ipswich, whose young and vibrant side had started to age and break-up.\n\nEngland's qualification campaign faltered, though Mariner scored in consecutive pool matches against Hungary and Luxembourg \u2013 the latter of which would prove to be his 13th and final England goal. By the time he next played for England, he was an [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] player, with the Gunners taking him from Ipswich in February 1984 for \u00a3150,000. By now Mariner was in his thirties but he still initially performed well for Arsenal, scoring seven times in the final fifteen games of the season. But age was starting to get the better of him; and he only scored nine goals in 41 games in [[1984-85 in English football|1984\u201385]].\n\nMariner won two more England caps but a sign of things to come had arrived in the shape of [[Mark Hateley]], a tall but skillful young striker exactly in the Mariner mould, while [[Gary Lineker]] and [[Peter Beardsley]] also establishing themselves as international strikers.\n\nHateley came on as a substitute for Mariner in a friendly victory over [[East Germany national football team|East Germany]] in September 1984, before Mariner picked up his 35th and final cap in a goalless draw against Romania in May 1985, a qualifier for the [[Football World Cup 1986|1986 World Cup]]. He had scored 13 times for England - the first goal coming on 12 October 1977 in a 2\u20130 win over [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]] in a [[1978 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifier. His last goal for England came on 16 November 1983, also against Luxembourg, but this time in a [[UEFA Euro 1984|European Championship]] qualifier.<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football/england/paul-mariner-9569/english-caps-1977-85_a11852/]</ref>\n\nHowever, with Hateley in the ascendancy and Mariner regularly sidelined at [[Highbury]] during the 1985\u20131986 season, Robson opted not to select him for the England squad which qualified for Mexico '86.\n\nMeanwhile, at his club Mariner was rarely on the field, only playing nine times in [[1985-86 in English football|1985\u201386]], including one match as an emergency [[centre half]]. In the summer of 1986 Arsenal's new manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] gave Mariner a [[free transfer (soccer)|free transfer]]; in all he played 80 times for Arsenal, scoring 17 goals. He signed for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], where he spent two seasons. In May 1989, he signed with the [[Albany Capitals]] of the [[American Soccer League (1988-1989)|American Soccer League]].<ref>''CAPITALS WILL PUT BOLTS TO THE TEST'' Boston Globe \u2013 Saturday, 27 May 1989</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nMariner returned to the Capitals in 1990 as the team now played in the [[American Professional Soccer League]], formed by the merger of the American Soccer League and [[Western Soccer League]]. He played three seasons with the Capitals, where he was named to the league's Best XI in 1990.<ref>[http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1990/statsasl90.htm#Albany 1990 Albany Capitals]</ref><ref>[http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1989/statsasl89.htm#Albany 1989 Albany Capitals]</ref><ref>[http://www.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1990.html#APSL The Year in American Soccer \u2013 1990]</ref><ref>[http://a-leaguearchive.tripod.com/1991/stats91.htm#Albany 1991 Albany Capitals]</ref> During his three seasons in Albany, Mariner also served as an assistant coach. In the spring of 1992, the Capitals' owner offered him the position of head coach but when he heard a rumour that the team was about to collapse, he accepted a position as a player-assistant coach with the [[San Francisco Bay Blackhawks]]. He accepted that position and soon after the Capitals announced they were ceasing operations. In the early 90's Paul made two appearances for Byhams Dairy, a Sunday League team in Sudbury Suffolk<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jonathanvankin.com/mariner1.html |title=The Player |access-date=29 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306204006/http://jonathanvankin.com/mariner1.html |archive-date=6 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Coaching==\n===Early career===\nAfter retiring, Mariner worked as a football pundit for [[BBC Radio Lancashire]] for their Friday-night Non-League Hour<ref>http://www.chorleyfc.com/club-news_article.asp?Key=284{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> before setting up a management company for footballers.
