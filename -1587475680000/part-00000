Some Aboriginal people referred to Bates by the [[honorific|courtesy name]] ''Kabbarli'' \"grandmother\" (which is cognate with /kaparli/, a kin term in many [[Australian languages]], and may also mean \"granddaughter\" in some contexts).<ref>Glass, A. and D.

Her father, James Edward O'Dwyer, married Mary Dillon in 1864 and died en route to the United States, so she was raised in [[Roscrea]] by relatives, and educated at the National School in that town.\n\n==Emigration and life in Australia==\nIn November 1882, Dwyer\u2014who by then had changed her first name to Daisy May\u2014emigrated to Australia aboard the {{RMS|Almora}} as part of a Queensland government assisted immigration scheme. Some accounts (based on Dwyer's own claims) say that she left Ireland for \"health reasons\", but biographer [[Julia Blackburn]] discovered that after getting her first job as a [[governess]] in Dublin at age 18, there was a scandal, presumably sexual in nature, which resulted in the young man of the house taking his own life.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} This story has never been verified, but if true, could have spurred Dwyer to leave Ireland and reinvent her history, setting a pattern for the rest of her life.<ref name=\"Reece 2009\">{{cite web |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |title=The Irishness of Daisy Bates |url=http://www.irishheritage.net/durack2009.pdf |publisher=Australian-Irish Heritage Association |accessdate=19 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=18 October 2009 |quote=\"Was her departure hastened by a young man of good family committing suicide on her account?

Dwyer had travelled with Ernest C. Baglehole and James C. Hann, amongst others, on the later stage of her journey.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Both Baglehole and Hann had boarded at Batavia for the journey to Australia. Hann's family, through William Hann's donation of \u00a31000, had been very generous to the construction of St James Church of England some few years before Bishop Stanton had arrived at Townsville.  She subsequently found employment as a governess on Fanning Downs [[Station (Australian agriculture)|Station]].\n\nRecords show that she married poet and horseman [[Breaker Morant]] (Harry Morant aka Edwin Murrant) on 13 March 1884 in [[Charters Towers]]; the union lasted only a short time and Dwyer reputedly threw Morant out because he failed to pay for the wedding and stole some livestock.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maloney |first1=Shane |title=Daisy Bates & Harry \u2018Breaker\u2019 Morant |journal=The Monthly |date=June 2007 |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2007/june/1290560118/shane-maloney/daisy-bates-harry-breaker-morant |accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> The marriage was not in fact legal, as Morant was underage (he declared himself to be twenty-one, when he was actually nineteen).<ref name=\"Reece 2007a\">{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Reece |first=Bob |title=Daisy Bates: Grand Dame of the Desert |date=2007a |publisher=National Library of Australia |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-64-227654-4 |pages=19\u201320 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Daisy_Bates.html?id=P_8KgFI92e4C |oclc=212893816}}</ref><ref name=\"West & Roper\" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} Significantly, they were never divorced. Morant biographer Nick Bleszynski suggests that Dwyer played a more important role in Morant's life than has been previously thought, and that it was she who convinced him to change his name from Edwin Murrant to Harry Harbord Morant.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAfter parting ways with Morant, Dwyer moved to [[New South Wales]]. She said that she became engaged to Philip Gipps (the son of a former governor) but he died before they could marry, though no records support this. Her biographer, Bob Reece, calls this story 'nonsense', as Gipps in fact died in February 1884, before her marriage to Morant.{{sfnp|Reece|2007a|p=21}}\n\nShe then met John (Jack) Bates\u2014like Morant, a bushman and [[Drover (Australian)|drover]]\u2014and they married on 17 February 1885.  Their only child, Arnold Hamilton Bates, was born in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales on 26 August 1886. It is possible that Ernest Baglehole, not Bates, was Arnold's father.<ref name=\"West & Roper\">{{Cite book |last1=West |first1=Joe |last2=Roper |first2=Roger |date=2016 |title=Breaker Morant: The final roundup |publisher=Amberley Publishing |location=Stroud, Gloucesteshire |isbn=978-1-44-565965-7 |oclc=976033815}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} The marriage was not a happy one, probably because Jack's work kept him away from home for long periods.\n\nShe also found time to marry Ernest Baglehole, her emigration voyage shipmate,{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} on 10 June 1885<ref name=\"West & Roper\" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} at St Stephen's Anglican Church, Newtown, Sydney. Although he is shown as being a seaman, he was the son of a wealthy London family and had become a ship's officer after completing an apprenticeship and this might have been an attraction for Daisy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The polygamous nature of these marriages was kept secret during Bates's lifetime.\n\nIn February 1894, Bates returned to England, leaving Arnold in a Catholic boarding school and telling Jack that she would only return when he had a home established for her. She arrived in England penniless, but eventually found a job working for journalist and social campaigner [[W.T Stead|WT Stead]]. Despite her skeptical views she worked as an assistant editor on the psychic quarterly ''Borderlands'', and enjoyed an active intellectual life among London's well-connected and bohemian literary and political milieu. However, after she left Stead's employment in 1896, it is unclear how she supported herself until 1899, when she embarked for Western Australia after Jack wrote to say that he was looking for a property there.<ref name=\"Reece 2007b\">{{cite journal |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |date=2007b |title='You would have loved her for her lore': the letters of Daisy Bates |journal=Australian Aboriginal Studies |issue=1 |pages=51\u201370 |issn=0729-4352 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27You+would+have+loved+her+for+her+lore%27%3A+the+letters+of+Daisy+Bates.-a0169134504 |accessdate=19 June 2018 |via=[[The Free Library]]}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with Australian Aboriginal people==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\nBates's involvement with the Aboriginal Australians was not as a missionary, doctor or teacher. The [[foreword]] of her book written by [[Alan Moorehead]] said, \" As far as I can make out she never tried to teach the Australians Aborigines anything or convert them to any faith. She preferred them to stay as they were and live out the last of their days in peace.\" Alan Moorehead also said, \"She was not an anthropologist but she knew them better than anyone else who ever lived; and she made them interesting not only to herself but to us as well.\"\n\nAt about 1899 a letter was published in ''[[The Times]]'' about the cruelty of West Australian settlers to [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. As Bates was preparing to return to Australia, she wrote to ''The Times'' offering to make full investigations and report the results to them. Her offer was accepted and she sailed back to Australia in August 1899. In all, Bates devoted 40 years of her life to studying Aboriginal life, history, culture, rites, beliefs and customs. She researched and wrote on the subject while living in a tent in small settlements from Western Australia to the edges of the [[Nullarbor Plain]], including at [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea]] in South Australia. She was also famed for her strict lifelong adherence to [[Edwardian]] fashion, including boots, gloves and a veil.\n\nBates set up camps to feed, clothe and nurse the transient population, drawing on her own income to meet the needs of the aged. She was said to have worn [[pistols]] even in her old age and to have been quite prepared to use them to threaten police when she caught them mistreating \"her\" Aborigines.\n\nBates was convinced that the Australian Aborigines were a dying race and that her mission was to record as much as she could about them before they disappeared.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/bates/daisy/passing/epilogue.html|title=The Passing of the Aborigines, by Daisy Bates : Epilogue|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref> In a 1921 article in the Perth ''Sunday Times'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Daisy |title=New Aboriginal Reserve |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57973115 |work=Sunday Times |publisher=via National Library of Australia |date=12 June 1921 |location=(Perth, WA : 1902 - 1954) |pages=8}}</ref> Bates advocated a \"woman patrol\" to prevent the movement of Aborigines from the [[Central Australian Reserve]] into settled areas, and later responded to criticism by the Aboriginal civil-rights leader [[William Harris (Australian)|William Harris]], who maintained that part-Aboriginal people could be of value to Australian society, by writing that \"As to the half-castes, however early they may be taken and trained, with very few exceptions, the only good half-caste is a dead one.\"{{sfnp|Reece|2007a|pp=89\u201390}}\n\n===Western Australia===\nOn her return voyage she met Father Dean Martelli, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest who had worked with Aborigines and who gave her an insight into the conditions they faced. She found a school and home for her son in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], invested some of her money in property as a security for her old age, bought note books and supplies and left for the state's remote north-west to gather information on Aborigines and the effects of white settlement.\n\nShe wrote articles about conditions around [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] and other areas for geographical society journals, local newspapers and ''The Times''. This experience kindled her lifelong interest in the lives and welfare of Aboriginal people in Western and South Australia.\n\nBased at the [[Beagle Bay Mission]] near [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], Bates, now thirty-six, began her life's work. Her accounts, among the first attempts at a serious study of Aboriginal culture, were published in the Journal of Agriculture and later by [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[geography|geographical]] societies in Australia and overseas.\n\nWhile at the mission she also compiled a local dictionary of several [[dialects]], comprising some two thousand words and sentences, as well as notes on legends and myths. In April 1902 Bates, accompanied by her son and her husband, set out on a droving trip from Broome to Perth. It provided good material for her articles but after spending six months in the saddle and travelling four thousand kilometres, Bates knew that her marriage was over.\n\nFollowing her final separation from Bates in 1902, she spent most of the rest of her life in outback Western and South Australia, studying and working for the remote Aboriginal tribes, who were being decimated by the incursions of European settlement and the introduction of modern technology, western culture and exotic diseases.\n\nIn 1904, the Registrar General of Western Australia, Malcolm Fraser,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lomas|first1=Brian D.|title=Queen of Deception|date=2015|publisher=Amazon|isbn=978-0-646-94238-4}}<!--|accessdate=July 30, 2015--></ref> appointed her to research Aboriginal customs, languages and dialects, a task which took nearly seven years to compile and arrange the data. Many of her papers were read at Geographical and [[Royal Society]] meetings.\n\n[[Image:Daisy may bates.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bates and a group of Aboriginal women, circa 1911]]\nIn 1910\u201311 she accompanied anthropologist A. R. Brown (later Professor [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]]) and writer and biologist [[E. L. Grant Watson]] on a [[Cambridge]] ethnological expedition to inquire into Western Australian marriage customs. She was appointed a \"[[Protector of Aborigines|Travelling Protector]]\" with a special commission to conduct inquiries into all native conditions and problems, such as employment on stations, guardianship and the morality of native and half-caste women in towns and mining camps.\n\nLegend has it that Bates later came into conflict with Radcliffe-Brown because she sent him her manuscript report of the expedition. Much to Bates's chagrin, it was not returned for many years and when it came back it was heavily annotated with Radcliffe-Brown's critical remarks. The conflict culminated in a famous incident at a symposium, where Bates accused Radcliffe-Brown of plagiarism\u2014Bates was scheduled to speak after Radcliffe-Brown had presented his paper, but when she rose it was only to compliment him sarcastically on his presentation of her work, after which she resumed her seat.\n\n===A \"Protector of Aborigines\"===\nAfter 1912, despite having earlier been appointed as Travelling Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia, her application to become the Northern Territory's Protector of Aborigines was rejected on basis of her [[gender]], Bates continued her work on her own, financing it by selling her cattle station.\n\nThe same year she became the first woman ever to be appointed Honorary Protector of Aborigines at [[Eucla, Western Australia|Eucla]]. During the sixteen months she spent there, Bates changed from a semi-professional scientist and ethnologist to a staunch friend and protector of the Aborigines, deciding to live among them and look after them, and to observe and record their lives and lifestyle.\n\nBates stayed at Eucla until 1914, when she travelled to [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]] and Sydney to attend the Science Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Science. Before returning to the desert, she gave lectures in Adelaide which aroused the interests of several women's organisations.\n\nDuring her years at [[Ooldea]] she financed the supplies she bought for the Aborigines from the sale of her property. To maintain her income she wrote numerous articles and papers for newspapers, magazines and learned societies. Through journalist and author [[Ernestine Hill]], Bates's work was introduced to the general public, although much of the publicity tended to focus on her sensational stories of cannibalism.\n\nIn August 1933 the Commonwealth Government invited Bates to [[Canberra]] to advise on Aboriginal affairs. The next year she was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. More important to Bates was the opportunity to put her work in print.\n\n===South Australia===\nShe left Ooldea and went to [[Adelaide]] where, with the help of [[Ernestine Hill]], she produced a series of articles for leading Australian newspapers, titled ''[[My Natives and I]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article213918855 |title=MY NATIVES AND I|newspaper=[[The Nowra Leader]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 August 1937 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAged seventy-one, she still walked every day to her office at ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' building. Later the Commonwealth Government paid her a stipend of $4 a week to assist her in putting all her papers and notes in order and prepare her manuscript. But with no other income it was impossible for her to remain in Adelaide so she moved to the village settlement of [[Pyap]] on the [[Murray River]] where she pitched her tent and set up her typewriter.\n\nIn 1938, she published ''[[The Passing of the Aborigines]]''<ref>{{Citation | author1=Bates, Daisy | title=The passing of the Aborigines : a lifetime spent among the natives of Australia | publication-date=1938 | publisher=Murray | edition= 1st | isbn=978-0-7195-0071-8 }}</ref> which asserted practices of [[cannibalism]] and [[infanticide]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article225571211 |title=LATEST in the BOOK SHOPS |newspaper=[[Weekly Times]] |issue=3720 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=14 January 1939 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |page=34 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><!--   amongst clans such as the [[Nyool-Nyool]], [[Bibbulmun]], [[Baduwonga]], [[Kaalurwonga]] and [[Baadu]]  -- citing who? -->\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1941 she went back to her tent life at Wynbring Siding, east of Ooldea, and she remained there on and off until her health forced her back to Adelaide in 1945.\n\nIn 1948 she tried, through the [[Australian Army]], to contact her son Arnold, who had served in France during [[World War I]].

Her father, James Edward O'Dwyer, married Mary Dillon in 1864 and died en route to the United States, so she was raised in [[Roscrea]] by relatives, and educated at the National School in that town.\n\n==Emigration and life in Australia==\nIn November 1882, Dwyer\u2014who by then had changed her first name to Daisy May\u2014emigrated to Australia aboard the {{RMS|Almora}} as part of a Queensland government assisted immigration scheme. Some accounts (based on Dwyer's own claims) say that she left Ireland for \"health reasons\", but biographer [[Julia Blackburn]] discovered that after getting her first job as a [[governess]] in Dublin at age 18, there was a scandal, presumably sexual in nature, which resulted in the young man of the house taking his own life.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} This story has never been verified, but if true, could have spurred Dwyer to leave Ireland and reinvent her history, setting a pattern for the rest of her life.<ref name=\"Reece 2009\">{{cite web |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |title=The Irishness of Daisy Bates |url=http://www.irishheritage.net/durack2009.pdf |publisher=Australian-Irish Heritage Association |accessdate=19 June 2018 |format=PDF |date=18 October 2009 |quote=\"Was her departure hastened by a young man of good family committing suicide on her account?

Dwyer had travelled with Ernest C. Baglehole and James C. Hann, amongst others, on the later stage of her journey.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Both Baglehole and Hann had boarded at Batavia for the journey to Australia. Hann's family, through William Hann's donation of \u00a31000, had been very generous to the construction of St James Church of England some few years before Bishop Stanton had arrived at Townsville.  She subsequently found employment as a governess on Fanning Downs [[Station (Australian agriculture)|Station]].\n\nRecords show that she married poet and horseman [[Breaker Morant]] (Harry Morant aka Edwin Murrant) on 13 March 1884 in [[Charters Towers]]; the union lasted only a short time and Dwyer reputedly threw Morant out because he failed to pay for the wedding and stole some livestock.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Maloney |first1=Shane |title=Daisy Bates & Harry \u2018Breaker\u2019 Morant |journal=The Monthly |date=June 2007 |url=https://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2007/june/1290560118/shane-maloney/daisy-bates-harry-breaker-morant |accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> The marriage was not in fact legal, as Morant was underage (he declared himself to be twenty-one, when he was actually nineteen).<ref name=\"Reece 2007a\">{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Reece |first=Bob |title=Daisy Bates: Grand Dame of the Desert |date=2007a |publisher=National Library of Australia |location=Canberra |isbn=978-0-64-227654-4 |pages=19\u201320 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Daisy_Bates.html?id=P_8KgFI92e4C |oclc=212893816}}</ref><ref name=\"West & Roper\" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} Significantly, they were never divorced. Morant biographer Nick Bleszynski suggests that Dwyer played a more important role in Morant's life than has been previously thought, and that it was she who convinced him to change his name from Edwin Murrant to Harry Harbord Morant.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAfter parting ways with Morant, Dwyer moved to [[New South Wales]]. She said that she became engaged to Philip Gipps (the son of a former governor) but he died before they could marry, though no records support this. Her biographer, Bob Reece, calls this story 'nonsense', as Gipps in fact died in February 1884, before her marriage to Morant.{{sfnp|Reece|2007a|p=21}}\n\nShe then met John (Jack) Bates\u2014like Morant, a bushman and [[Drover (Australian)|drover]]\u2014and they married on 17 February 1885.  Their only child, Arnold Hamilton Bates, was born in [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], New South Wales on 26 August 1886.

Although he is shown as being a seaman, he was the son of a wealthy London family and had become a ship's officer after completing an apprenticeship and this might have been an attraction for Daisy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The polygamous nature of these marriages was kept secret during Bates's lifetime.\n\nIn February 1894, Bates returned to England, leaving Arnold in a Catholic boarding school and telling Jack that she would only return when he had a home established for her. She arrived in England penniless, but eventually found a job working for journalist and social campaigner [[W.T Stead|WT Stead]]. Despite her skeptical views she worked as an assistant editor on the psychic quarterly ''Borderlands'', and enjoyed an active intellectual life among London's well-connected and bohemian literary and political milieu. However, after she left Stead's employment in 1896, it is unclear how she supported herself until 1899, when she embarked for Western Australia after Jack wrote to say that he was looking for a property there.<ref name=\"Reece 2007b\">{{cite journal |last1=Reece |first1=Bob |date=2007b |title='You would have loved her for her lore': the letters of Daisy Bates |journal=Australian Aboriginal Studies |issue=1 |pages=51\u201370 |issn=0729-4352 |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/%27You+would+have+loved+her+for+her+lore%27%3A+the+letters+of+Daisy+Bates.-a0169134504 |accessdate=19 June 2018 |via=[[The Free Library]]}}</ref>\n\n==Involvement with Australian Aboriginal people==\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\nBates's involvement with the Aboriginal Australians was not as a missionary, doctor or teacher. The [[foreword]] of her book written by [[Alan Moorehead]] said, \" As far as I can make out she never tried to teach the Australians Aborigines anything or convert them to any faith. She preferred them to stay as they were and live out the last of their days in peace.\" Alan Moorehead also said, \"She was not an anthropologist but she knew them better than anyone else who ever lived; and she made them interesting not only to herself but to us as well.\"\n\nAt about 1899 a letter was published in ''[[The Times]]'' about the cruelty of West Australian settlers to [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]]. As Bates was preparing to return to Australia, she wrote to ''The Times'' offering to make full investigations and report the results to them. Her offer was accepted and she sailed back to Australia in August 1899. In all, Bates devoted 40 years of her life to studying Aboriginal life, history, culture, rites, beliefs and customs. She researched and wrote on the subject while living in a tent in small settlements from Western Australia to the edges of the [[Nullarbor Plain]], including at [[Ooldea, South Australia|Ooldea]] in South Australia. She was also famed for her strict lifelong adherence to [[Edwardian]] fashion, including boots, gloves and a veil.\n\nBates set up camps to feed, clothe and nurse the transient population, drawing on her own income to meet the needs of the aged. She was said to have worn [[pistols]] even in her old age and to have been quite prepared to use them to threaten police when she caught them mistreating \"her\" Aborigines.\n\nBates was convinced that the Australian Aborigines were a dying race and that her mission was to record as much as she could about them before they disappeared.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/bates/daisy/passing/epilogue.html|title=The Passing of the Aborigines, by Daisy Bates : Epilogue|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref> In a 1921 article in the Perth ''Sunday Times'',<ref>{{cite news |last=Bates |first=Daisy |title=New Aboriginal Reserve |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/57973115 |work=Sunday Times |publisher=via National Library of Australia |date=12 June 1921 |location=(Perth, WA : 1902 - 1954) |pages=8}}</ref> Bates advocated a \"woman patrol\" to prevent the movement of Aborigines from the [[Central Australian Reserve]] into settled areas, and later responded to criticism by the Aboriginal civil-rights leader [[William Harris (Australian)|William Harris]], who maintained that part-Aboriginal people could be of value to Australian society, by writing that \"As to the half-castes, however early they may be taken and trained, with very few exceptions, the only good half-caste is a dead one.\"{{sfnp|Reece|2007a|pp=89\u201390}}\n\n===Western Australia===\nOn her return voyage she met Father Dean Martelli, a [[Roman Catholic]] priest who had worked with Aborigines and who gave her an insight into the conditions they faced. She found a school and home for her son in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], invested some of her money in property as a security for her old age, bought note books and supplies and left for the state's remote north-west to gather information on Aborigines and the effects of white settlement.\n\nShe wrote articles about conditions around [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]] and other areas for geographical society journals, local newspapers and ''The Times''. This experience kindled her lifelong interest in the lives and welfare of Aboriginal people in Western and South Australia.\n\nBased at the [[Beagle Bay Mission]] near [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]], Bates, now thirty-six, began her life's work. Her accounts, among the first attempts at a serious study of Aboriginal culture, were published in the Journal of Agriculture and later by [[anthropology|anthropological]] and [[geography|geographical]] societies in Australia and overseas.\n\nWhile at the mission she also compiled a local dictionary of several [[dialects]], comprising some two thousand words and sentences, as well as notes on legends and myths. In April 1902 Bates, accompanied by her son and her husband, set out on a droving trip from Broome to Perth. It provided good material for her articles but after spending six months in the saddle and travelling four thousand kilometres, Bates knew that her marriage was over.\n\nFollowing her final separation from Bates in 1902, she spent most of the rest of her life in outback Western and South Australia, studying and working for the remote Aboriginal tribes, who were being decimated by the incursions of European settlement and the introduction of modern technology, western culture and exotic diseases.\n\nIn 1904, the Registrar General of Western Australia, Malcolm Fraser,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lomas|first1=Brian D.|title=Queen of Deception|date=2015|publisher=Amazon|isbn=978-0-646-94238-4}}<!--|accessdate=July 30, 2015--></ref> appointed her to research Aboriginal customs, languages and dialects, a task which took nearly seven years to compile and arrange the data. Many of her papers were read at Geographical and [[Royal Society]] meetings.\n\n[[Image:Daisy may bates.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bates and a group of Aboriginal women, circa 1911]]\nIn 1910\u201311 she accompanied anthropologist A. R. Brown (later Professor [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]]) and writer and biologist [[E. L. Grant Watson]] on a [[Cambridge]] ethnological expedition to inquire into Western Australian marriage customs. She was appointed a \"[[Protector of Aborigines|Travelling Protector]]\" with a special commission to conduct inquiries into all native conditions and problems, such as employment on stations, guardianship and the morality of native and half-caste women in towns and mining camps.\n\nLegend has it that Bates later came into conflict with Radcliffe-Brown because she sent him her manuscript report of the expedition. Much to Bates's chagrin, it was not returned for many years and when it came back it was heavily annotated with Radcliffe-Brown's critical remarks. The conflict culminated in a famous incident at a symposium, where Bates accused Radcliffe-Brown of plagiarism\u2014Bates was scheduled to speak after Radcliffe-Brown had presented his paper, but when she rose it was only to compliment him sarcastically on his presentation of her work, after which she resumed her seat.\n\n===A \"Protector of Aborigines\"===\nAfter 1912, despite having earlier been appointed as Travelling Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia, her application to become the Northern Territory's Protector of Aborigines was rejected on basis of her [[gender]], Bates continued her work on her own, financing it by selling her cattle station.\n\nThe same year she became the first woman ever to be appointed Honorary Protector of Aborigines at [[Eucla, Western Australia|Eucla]]. During the sixteen months she spent there, Bates changed from a semi-professional scientist and ethnologist to a staunch friend and protector of the Aborigines, deciding to live among them and look after them, and to observe and record their lives and lifestyle.\n\nBates stayed at Eucla until 1914, when she travelled to [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]] and Sydney to attend the Science Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Science. Before returning to the desert, she gave lectures in Adelaide which aroused the interests of several women's organisations.\n\nDuring her years at [[Ooldea]] she financed the supplies she bought for the Aborigines from the sale of her property. To maintain her income she wrote numerous articles and papers for newspapers, magazines and learned societies. Through journalist and author [[Ernestine Hill]], Bates's work was introduced to the general public, although much of the publicity tended to focus on her sensational stories of cannibalism.\n\nIn August 1933 the Commonwealth Government invited Bates to [[Canberra]] to advise on Aboriginal affairs. The next year she was created a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]. More important to Bates was the opportunity to put her work in print.\n\n===South Australia===\nShe left Ooldea and went to [[Adelaide]] where, with the help of [[Ernestine Hill]], she produced a series of articles for leading Australian newspapers, titled ''[[My Natives and I]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article213918855 |title=MY NATIVES AND I|newspaper=[[The Nowra Leader]] |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 August 1937 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAged seventy-one, she still walked every day to her office at ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' building. Later the Commonwealth Government paid her a stipend of $4 a week to assist her in putting all her papers and notes in order and prepare her manuscript. But with no other income it was impossible for her to remain in Adelaide so she moved to the village settlement of [[Pyap]] on the [[Murray River]] where she pitched her tent and set up her typewriter.\n\nIn 1938, she published ''[[The Passing of the Aborigines]]''<ref>{{Citation | author1=Bates, Daisy | title=The passing of the Aborigines : a lifetime spent among the natives of Australia | publication-date=1938 | publisher=Murray | edition= 1st | isbn=978-0-7195-0071-8 }}</ref> which asserted practices of [[cannibalism]] and [[infanticide]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article225571211 |title=LATEST in the BOOK SHOPS |newspaper=[[Weekly Times]] |issue=3720 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=14 January 1939 |accessdate=19 October 2018 |page=34 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><!--   amongst clans such as the [[Nyool-Nyool]], [[Bibbulmun]], [[Baduwonga]], [[Kaalurwonga]] and [[Baadu]]  -- citing who? -->\n\n==Final years==\nIn 1941 she went back to her tent life at Wynbring Siding, east of Ooldea, and she remained there on and off until her health forced her back to Adelaide in 1945.\n\nIn 1948 she tried, through the [[Australian Army]], to contact her son Arnold, who had served in France during [[World War I]].
