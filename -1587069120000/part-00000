Under the guidance of [[Charles Samuel Myers|Charles Myers]], membership was opened up to members of the medical profession in 1919. In 1941 the society was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]].<ref name=\":0\">Geoff Bunn, [https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/bps.org.uk/files/History%20of%20Psychology/A%20Short%20History%20of%20The%20British%20Psychological%20Society.pdf 'A Short History of British Psychological Society']</ref>\n\n== Mission ==\nThe Society aims to raise standards of training and practice in psychology, raise public awareness of psychology, and increase the influence of psychology practice in society. Specifically it has a number of key aims, as described below.\n\n* Setting standards of training for psychologists at graduate and undergraduate levels.\n* Providing information about psychology to the public.\n* Providing support to its members via its membership networks and mandatory continuing professional development.\n* Hosting conferences and events.\n* Preparing policy statements.\n* Publishing books, journals, the monthly magazine ''[[The Psychologist (publication)|The Psychologist]]'', the [https://digest.bps.org.uk/ Research Digest] blog, including a free fortnightly research update, and various other publications (see below).\n* Setting standards for [[psychological testing]].\n* Maintaining a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150417061446/http://hopc.bps.org.uk/ History of Psychology Centre].\n\n== Organisation ==\nIts current President for 2019-2020 is David Murphy, a [[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychologist]], Educator & Researcher. The Society holds its Annual Conference, usually in May, in a different town or city each year. In recent years it has been held in [[Dublin]] (2008), [[Brighton]] (2009), [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] (2010), [[Glasgow]] (2011), [[London]] (2012), [[Harrogate]] (2013), [[Birmingham]] (2014), [[Liverpool]] (2015) and [[Nottingham]] (2016), [[Brighton]], (2017), [[Nottingham]] (2018), and for 2019, will be in [[Harrogate]].\n\nThe BPS is also a [[Charitable organization|Registered Charity]] and, along with advantages, this also imposes certain constraints on what the Society can and cannot do. For example, it cannot campaign on issues which are seen as party political. The BPS is not the statutory regulation body for Practitioner Psychologists in the UK which is the [[Health and Care Professions Council]].\n\nIn 2012 the BPS had 49,678 members and subscribers, in all fields of psychology, 18,342 of whom were Chartered Members. The Society publishes details of its membership size through its Annual Reports and Annual Review. According to the Annual Review of 2017, total membership stands at over 70,000,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bps.org.uk/how-we-work/membership-and-standards-board-2017|title=BPS Membership and Standards Board}}</ref> and according to the Annual Report,  'Membership and subscribership has continued to grow in 2017, with an overall increase of 8,407 (13.6 per cent). Growth in Graduate and Chartered membership is less at 1,689 (3.9 per cent).'<ref>[https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/bps.org.uk/files/Annual%20Reports/Reviews/Annual%20Report%202017-2018.pdf BPS Annual Report, 2017]</ref>\n\n==Chartership==\nFollowing the receipt of a [[royal charter]] in 1965, the society became the keeper of the Register of Chartered Psychologists. The register was the means by which the Society could regulate the professional practice of psychology. Regulation included the awarding of practising certificates and the conduct of disciplinary proceedings. The register ceased to be when statutory regulation of psychologists began on 1 July 2009.

Activities include an Annual Conference, usually held in September started in 1984, one or more specialist events in the year and symposia at the main Society Conference in March/April. An award scheme started in 1992 with first award winner in 1993 Neil Burgess and Graham Hitch.\n|-\n| Community Psychology || Established in 2010, it aims to bring together psychologists and others who work to dismantle disabling societal barriers and construct psychologically enabling contexts and practices, address people's strengths and competencies as well as problems and difficulties, challenge the dominance of individually-focused models of psychosocial adjustment and psychological intervention \npromote preventative interventions for health and well-being, raise awareness of socio-political and organisational issues affecting education, development and well-being and strive for social justice. Its members work in solidarity and mutual respect alongside people experiencing marginalisation, disempowerment and oppression. \n|-\n| Consciousness and Experiential Psychology || Initiated in 1994 by Jane Henry, [[Max Velmans]], John Pickering, Elizabeth Valentine and Richard Stevens, the section promoted and supported the reincorporation of consciousness studies into mainstream psychology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issuu.com/thepsychologist/docs/bpsannualreview2009 |title=The British Psychological Society Annual Review 2009 |publisher=Issuu.com |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> Official approval was announced in 1997.

It has a mission to promote high quality research into Developmental Psychology and generally to raise the profile of British developmental research in an international arena. These aims are pursued in various ways, including through the [[British Journal of Developmental Psychology]]. The Journal has a history covering seminal work on children's drawing, imagination, communication, attachment, reasoning, theory of mind, developmental disorders (including autism). The annual conference for the section is usually held in early September.\n|-\n| Cyberpsychology || The section exists to pursue and formalise a scientific understanding of the impact, dynamic processes and outcomes that democratised digital technologies have enabled in individuals, groups and the wider society. It promotes research into issues around gaming, social media, virtual reality, online learning and virtual interest groups, we hope to raise (and answer) questions about the motivations, experiences, and effects surrounding the interactions between humanity and technology.\n|-\n| Defence and Security Psychology || \n|-\n| History and Philosophy of Psychology || This is an interdisciplinary section that brings together psychologists, historians and philosophers. It is interested in both the history of psychology and the philosophy of psychology.

The UK government announced its intention to widen statutory regulation, to include ''inter alia'' psychologists, following a number of scandals arising in the 1990s in the [[psychotherapy]] field.  The BPS was in favour of statutory regulation, but opposed the proposed regulator, the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC), preferring the idea of a new Psychological Professions Council which would map quite closely onto its own responsibilities. The government resisted this, however, and in June 2009, under the Health Care and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order, regulation of most of the psychology professions passed to the HCPC, the renamed [[Health and Care Professions Council]].\n\n== Society offices ==\nThe Society's main office is currently in [[Leicester]] in the United Kingdom. According to BPS HR department, as of April 2019 there are 113 staff members at the Leicester office, 9 in London. There are also smaller regional offices in [[Belfast]], [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]]. The archives are deposited at the [[Wellcome Library]] in the [[Euston Road]], [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|title=British Psychological Society Archive|url=http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1972610__SCharles%20Myers__Orightresult__U__X3?lang=eng&suite=cobalt|website=Catalogue|publisher=Wellcome Library|accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Logo ==\nThe British Psychological Society's logo is an image of the Greek mythical figure [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]], personification of the soul, holding a Victorian [[oil lamp]]. The use of her image is a reference to the origins of the word [[psychology]]. The lamp symbolises learning and is also a reference to the story of Psyche. [[Eros]] was in love with Psyche and would visit her at night, but had forbidden her from finding out his identity. She was persuaded by her jealous sisters to discover his identity by holding a lamp to his face as he slept. Psyche accidentally burnt him with oil from the lamp, and he awoke and flew away.<ref>Steinberg, H. (2001). A brief history of the Society logo. ''The Psychologist'', 14, 236\u2013237.

Specifically it has a number of key aims, as described below.\n\n* Setting standards of training for psychologists at graduate and undergraduate levels.\n* Providing information about psychology to the public.\n* Providing support to its members via its membership networks and mandatory continuing professional development.\n* Hosting conferences and events.\n* Preparing policy statements.\n* Publishing books, journals, the monthly magazine ''[[The Psychologist (publication)|The Psychologist]]'', the [https://digest.bps.org.uk/ Research Digest] blog, including a free fortnightly research update, and various other publications (see below).\n* Setting standards for [[psychological testing]].\n* Maintaining a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150417061446/http://hopc.bps.org.uk/ History of Psychology Centre].\n\n== Organisation ==\nIts current President for 2019-2020 is David Murphy, a [[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychologist]], Educator & Researcher. The Society holds its Annual Conference, usually in May, in a different town or city each year. In recent years it has been held in [[Dublin]] (2008), [[Brighton]] (2009), [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] (2010), [[Glasgow]] (2011), [[London]] (2012), [[Harrogate]] (2013), [[Birmingham]] (2014), [[Liverpool]] (2015) and [[Nottingham]] (2016), [[Brighton]], (2017), [[Nottingham]] (2018), and for 2019, will be in [[Harrogate]].\n\nThe BPS is also a [[Charitable organization|Registered Charity]] and, along with advantages, this also imposes certain constraints on what the Society can and cannot do. For example, it cannot campaign on issues which are seen as party political. The BPS is not the statutory regulation body for Practitioner Psychologists in the UK which is the [[Health and Care Professions Council]].\n\nIn 2012 the BPS had 49,678 members and subscribers, in all fields of psychology, 18,342 of whom were Chartered Members. The Society publishes details of its membership size through its Annual Reports and Annual Review. According to the Annual Review of 2017, total membership stands at over 70,000,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bps.org.uk/how-we-work/membership-and-standards-board-2017|title=BPS Membership and Standards Board}}</ref> and according to the Annual Report,  'Membership and subscribership has continued to grow in 2017, with an overall increase of 8,407 (13.6 per cent). Growth in Graduate and Chartered membership is less at 1,689 (3.9 per cent).'<ref>[https://www.bps.org.uk/sites/bps.org.uk/files/Annual%20Reports/Reviews/Annual%20Report%202017-2018.pdf BPS Annual Report, 2017]</ref>\n\n==Chartership==\nFollowing the receipt of a [[royal charter]] in 1965, the society became the keeper of the Register of Chartered Psychologists. The register was the means by which the Society could regulate the professional practice of psychology. Regulation included the awarding of practising certificates and the conduct of disciplinary proceedings. The register ceased to be when statutory regulation of psychologists began on 1 July 2009. The profession is now regulated by the [[Health and Care Professions Council]].\n\nA member of the British Psychological Society (MBPS) who has achieved chartered status has the right to the letters \"C.Psychol.\" after his or her name. The BPS is also licensed by the Science Council<ref>[http://www.sciencecouncil.org Science Council]</ref> to award Chartered Scientist<ref>[http://www.charteredscientist.org Chartered Scientist]</ref> status. The highest designation the Society can bestow is a [[Fellow (society)|Fellow]] of the British Psychological Society (FBPsS), showing a significant contribution to and understanding of the discipline.\n\n== Presidents ==\n{{Hidden begin\n | showhide = left\n | titlestyle = font-size:110%\n | title = BPS Presidents from 1920 to the present<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hopc.bps.org.uk/histres/bpshistory/presidents$.cfm |title=Presidents of the BPS |publisher=Hopc.bps.org.uk |accessdate=2012-02-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316183914/http://hopc.bps.org.uk/histres/bpshistory/presidents%24.cfm |archivedate=2012-03-16 }}</ref><ref>https://www.bps.org.uk/about-us/history-psychology/founders-fellows-presidents-members</ref>\n}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=18em|\n* 1920\u20131923 [[Charles Samuel Myers]]\n* 1923\u20131926 [[Charles Edward Spearman]]\n* 1926\u20131929 [[Francis Aveling]]\n* 1929\u20131932 [[Beatrice Edgell]]\n* 1932\u20131935 [[John Carl Fl\u00fcgel]]\n* 1935\u20131938 [[James Drever (1873)|James Drever Sr.]]\n* 1938\u20131941 [[Albert William Wolters]]\n* 1941\u20131943 [[Cyril Burt]]\n* 1943\u20131944 [[Tom Hatherley Pear]]\n* 1944\u20131945 [[Millais Culpin]]\n* 1945\u20131946 [[Godfrey Thomson]]\n* 1946\u20131947 [[Robert John Bartlett]]\n* 1947\u20131948 [[Charles Wilfred Valentine]]\n* 1948\u20131949 [[Stanley J.F.

Activities include an Annual Conference, usually held in September started in 1984, one or more specialist events in the year and symposia at the main Society Conference in March/April. An award scheme started in 1992 with first award winner in 1993 Neil Burgess and Graham Hitch.\n|-\n| Community Psychology || Established in 2010, it aims to bring together psychologists and others who work to dismantle disabling societal barriers and construct psychologically enabling contexts and practices, address people's strengths and competencies as well as problems and difficulties, challenge the dominance of individually-focused models of psychosocial adjustment and psychological intervention \npromote preventative interventions for health and well-being, raise awareness of socio-political and organisational issues affecting education, development and well-being and strive for social justice. Its members work in solidarity and mutual respect alongside people experiencing marginalisation, disempowerment and oppression. \n|-\n| Consciousness and Experiential Psychology || Initiated in 1994 by Jane Henry, [[Max Velmans]], John Pickering, Elizabeth Valentine and Richard Stevens, the section promoted and supported the reincorporation of consciousness studies into mainstream psychology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issuu.com/thepsychologist/docs/bpsannualreview2009 |title=The British Psychological Society Annual Review 2009 |publisher=Issuu.com |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}</ref> Official approval was announced in 1997.

It has a mission to promote high quality research into Developmental Psychology and generally to raise the profile of British developmental research in an international arena. These aims are pursued in various ways, including through the [[British Journal of Developmental Psychology]]. The Journal has a history covering seminal work on children's drawing, imagination, communication, attachment, reasoning, theory of mind, developmental disorders (including autism). The annual conference for the section is usually held in early September.\n|-\n| Cyberpsychology || The section exists to pursue and formalise a scientific understanding of the impact, dynamic processes and outcomes that democratised digital technologies have enabled in individuals, groups and the wider society. It promotes research into issues around gaming, social media, virtual reality, online learning and virtual interest groups, we hope to raise (and answer) questions about the motivations, experiences, and effects surrounding the interactions between humanity and technology.\n|-\n| Defence and Security Psychology || \n|-\n| History and Philosophy of Psychology || This is an interdisciplinary section that brings together psychologists, historians and philosophers. It is interested in both the history of psychology and the philosophy of psychology.  It is in the dialogue between the two that the most is to be gained in terms of looking back, assessing the present and moving forward.\n|-\n| Male Psychology || The Section aims to expand our understanding of the full diversity of the human condition on an inclusive basis by enriching our knowledge of men and boys alongside women and girls, both in their differences and in their common humanity.\n|-\n| Mathematical, Statistical and Computing || The primary aim of the Section is to provide an opportunity for those interested in mathematical (including computational), statistical (including quantitative and mixed methods approaches) and computing (including algorithmic, HCI and cyber-psych) related issues in psychology to exchange ideas and promote the discussion of these interests.\n|- \n| Political Psychology || \n|-\n| Psychobiology || The Psychobiology Section provides a forum for the discussion and professional issues for people with interests in the more biological aspects of psychology.\n|-\n| Psychology of Education || Its aims are to offer advice to the Society on matters related to psychological aspects of education and the training of teachers; to promote the study and discussion of psychology in education; to provide a forum for the discussion and exchange of ideas among those interested in the psychological aspects of education; and to stimulate research into matters related to the psychological aspects of education\n|-\n| Psychology of Sexualities || Established in 1998, as the [[Homosexuality and psychology|Lesbian & Gay Psychology]] section, after nearly a decade of campaigning and three rejected proposals (two for a Psychology of Lesbianism Section and one for a Lesbian & Gay Psychology Section).<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = The struggle to found the lesbian and gay psychology section|last = Wilkinson|first = S|date = 1999|journal = Lesbian & Gay Psychology Section Newsletter|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref> Founding members of the section include [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson]].

The main aims of the Psychology of Women and Equalities Section are to address gender issues and inequalities in the psychology curriculum; to facilitate and develop feminist and emancipatory research, theory and practice; and to influence public policy in areas such as equal rights, parenting, and employment.\n|-\n| Psychotherapy ||The aims of the Section are to further psychological understanding of the personal, social and cultural issues involved in psychotherapy and to examine critically and elaborate their meanings for the psychology of human experience and conduct;to promote scientific investigation of psychotherapy which employs research paradigms appropriate to its subject matter; and to provide a forum for the discussion and exchange of ideas in relation to the above which avoids aligning itself with any school within the broad discipline of psychotherapy\n|-\n| Qualitative Methods in Psychology || The Section aims to act as a network of qualified psychologists, extending collaboration possibilities, sharing expertise and offering training opportunities to members; to champion and develop qualitative methods in psychology and to raise the profile of teaching and research of qualitative methods in psychology.\n|-\n| Social Psychology || The Section  aims to encourage and promote social psychological research,facilitate contact and communication between social psychologists and impact positively upon social psychology globally\n|-\n| Transpersonal Psychology || The Section acts as a forum for those interested in spiritual practices and experiences, researching their value and their relationship to the models and concepts of psychology\n|}\n\nNote: The term 'division' in the [[American Psychological Association]] does not have the same meaning as it does in the British Psychological Society, coming closer to what the British Psychological Society refers to as 'sections'. Branches are for members in the same geographical region.\n\n=== Special Groups ===\nBPS currently has the following special groups to provide a forum for members working in particular specialist fields, with a particular focus on training, practice, and professional development<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologists/member-networks|title=Member Networks {{!}} BPS|website=bps.org.uk|access-date=2019-07-16}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#adf;\"\n!Special Groups!!\n|-\n| Special Group in Coaching Psychology ||\n|-\n| Special Group for Independent Practitioners ||\n|-\n| Special Group for Psychology and Social Care ||\n|}\n\n== Statutory regulation ==\n\nBPS has been concerned with the question of statutory registration of psychologists since the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Claire|date=September 2018|title=A History of Psychology in the United Kingdom Meeting of Minds\u2013the road to professional practice|url=https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/pb-assets/assets/20448295/bjop_001b_Rev_Print-1551107433357.pdf|journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> It received its charter in 1965 and an amendment in 1987 which allowed it to maintain a register of psychologists. The UK government announced its intention to widen statutory regulation, to include ''inter alia'' psychologists, following a number of scandals arising in the 1990s in the [[psychotherapy]] field.  The BPS was in favour of statutory regulation, but opposed the proposed regulator, the [[Health Professions Council]] (HPC), preferring the idea of a new Psychological Professions Council which would map quite closely onto its own responsibilities. The government resisted this, however, and in June 2009, under the Health Care and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order, regulation of most of the psychology professions passed to the HCPC, the renamed [[Health and Care Professions Council]].\n\n== Society offices ==\nThe Society's main office is currently in [[Leicester]] in the United Kingdom. According to BPS HR department, as of April 2019 there are 113 staff members at the Leicester office, 9 in London. There are also smaller regional offices in [[Belfast]], [[Cardiff]], [[Glasgow]]. The archives are deposited at the [[Wellcome Library]] in the [[Euston Road]], [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|title=British Psychological Society Archive|url=http://search.wellcomelibrary.org/iii/encore/record/C__Rb1972610__SCharles%20Myers__Orightresult__U__X3?lang=eng&suite=cobalt|website=Catalogue|publisher=Wellcome Library|accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Logo ==\nThe British Psychological Society's logo is an image of the Greek mythical figure [[Psyche (mythology)|Psyche]], personification of the soul, holding a Victorian [[oil lamp]]. The use of her image is a reference to the origins of the word [[psychology]]. The lamp symbolises learning and is also a reference to the story of Psyche. [[Eros]] was in love with Psyche and would visit her at night, but had forbidden her from finding out his identity. She was persuaded by her jealous sisters to discover his identity by holding a lamp to his face as he slept. Psyche accidentally burnt him with oil from the lamp, and he awoke and flew away.<ref>Steinberg, H. (2001). A brief history of the Society logo. ''The Psychologist'', 14, 236\u2013237.

The Senate seats for the twenty-five odd-numbered districts were up for election.  Senate terms are staggered such that half the membership is elected every two years.  Senators serve four-year terms.  Prior to the election, the Senate was evenly divided between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].  Following the election, the Democrats were in the majority - this marked the first time in 42 years that the Democrats had controlled both branches of the [[Iowa General Assembly]] and the [[Governor of Iowa|Governor]]'s Office.<ref>{{cite web|title=State of Iowa -

The Senate seats for the twenty-five odd-numbered districts were up for election.  Senate terms are staggered such that half the membership is elected every two years.  Senators serve four-year terms.  Prior to the election, the Senate was evenly divided between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].  Following the election, the Democrats were in the majority - this marked the first time in 42 years that the Democrats had controlled both branches of the [[Iowa General Assembly]] and the [[Governor of Iowa|Governor]]'s Office.<ref>{{cite web|title=State of Iowa -

The program is classified in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and the team competes in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Kansas is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 5 overall National Championships (3 NCAA Tournament championships, 2 Helms National Championships), as well being a National Runner-Up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation. Kansas is the all-time consecutive conference titles record holder with 14 consecutive titles, a streak that ran from 2005 through 2018. The Jayhawks also own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with an active streak of 30 consecutive appearances. The Jayhawks have been ranked in the AP poll for 220 consecutive polls, a streak that has stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009 poll through the poll released on March 18, 2020, which is the longest active streak in the nation. That streak is 1 behind UCLA's record run of 221 straight from 1966-1980. Of the 24 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 19 Regular Season Conference titles.\n\nThe Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of the game of basketball, [[James Naismith]].

This record includes a 765\u2013110 (.874) mark at historic [[Allen Fieldhouse]]<!-- Needs to sync with prior sentence season's data. -->. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas has the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has been around 100 years, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]], more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019\u201320 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the [[Big 12 Conference#Men's basketball|Big 12]]'s existence.

Naismith died in 1939, and his remains are buried in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. The basketball court in Allen Fieldhouse is named James Naismith Court. Beyond inventing the game, his next greatest basketball legacy may be his coaching tree, whose two trunks are the well-known Phog Allen and Kansas native [[John McLendon]]. (McLendon attended KU in the 1930s when Allen was head coach.  Although McLendon tried out for the team, he never played for Allen. Naismith mentored McLendon from his arrival at Kansas through degree completion and beyond.)\n\nOn December 10, 2010, the [[David G. Booth|David Booth]] family purchased [[Rules of basketball|Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of the game]] at a Sotheby's auction in New York City for the sum of $4.3 million.

Hamilton era (1907\u20131956)===\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, [[Phog Allen|Dr. Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen]] as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|title=McGill grad James Naismith, inventor of basketball|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207055905/http://athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|archivedate=December 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Dutch Lonborg]] and [[Ralph Miller]] (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas).\nAllen coached the team from 1907\u201309, but William O. Hamilton coached from 1909\u20131919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125\u201359 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\n\nAllen coached KU for 39 seasons and amassed a record of 590\u2013219, with two retroactively-awarded [[Helms Foundation]] national titles and one NCAA Tournament championship in 1952. Numerous basketball greats would play at Kansas during Allen's era, including [[Dean Smith]], [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dutch Lonborg]], and [[Ralph Miller]] (all future Hall of Fame coaches), [[Paul Endacott]], [[Skinny Johnson|Bill Johnson]], and [[Clyde Lovellette]] (Hall of Fame players), two-time Olympic Gold Medalist [[Bill Hougland]], and even former United States [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bob Dole]].\n\nIn 1952, the Jayhawks won the national title with an 80\u201363 victory in the final game over [[St. John's University (Jamaica, New York)|St. John's]], coached by [[Frank McGuire]]. Clyde Lovellette of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and is still the only player to lead the nation in scoring and lead his team to a national title in the same year. This tournament was the first to have a true \"Final Four\" format. Seven members of the championship team represented the United States in the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and brought home a gold medal for the national basketball team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/stories/2008/aug/14/good_gold/|title=Good as gold  / LJWorld.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> This was especially poignant for Allen, as he had been the driving force for having basketball added to the Olympics in 1936.\nAllen was forced to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because he was getting too \"old\". Allen had recruited legendary [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956.\n\n===Dick Harp era (1956\u20131964)===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilt Chamberlain]] was one of the top centers to ever play for the Jayhawks.]]\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, [[Dick Harp]]. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121\u201382 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\n\n[[Wilt Chamberlain]] played his varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather easy one for the first two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time college records in an 87\u201369 win against [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54\u201353 in triple overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].\n\n===Ted Owens era (1964\u20131983)===\n[[Ted Owens (basketball)|Ted Owens]] took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348\u2013128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\n\nThe team advanced to NCAA postseason play seven times under Owens. The 1971 team went 27\u20133 and advanced to the Final Four before losing to UCLA. In 1974 the team went 23\u20137 and again advanced to the Final Four before losing to Marquette.\n\nDuring this era the program produced All-Americans such as [[Jo Jo White]], [[Walt Wesley]], [[Bud Stallworth]], [[Darnell Valentine]], and [[Dave Robisch]].\n\nAfter 19 years of coaching at [[University of Kansas]], Owens was fired following the 1982\u201383 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons.\n\n===Larry Brown era (1983\u20131988)===\n[[File:1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament - National Semifinals (ticket).jpg|thumb|150px|Brown helped lead Kansas to the school's second-ever NCAA Tournament championship in 1988.]]\nIn 1983, [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12\u20138 start, including 1\u20134 in the Big 8.  The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose 2 more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of [[Danny Manning]], KU finished 21\u201311 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed.  Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance.  The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season.  They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83\u201379 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since.  The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas' chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\n\nDuring Brown's tenure, Kansas had five NCAA Tournament appearances, which included two second round appearances, one Sweet 16 appearance, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship. He also compiled a 135\u201344 (.754) overall record. Brown left under a cloud, as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988\u20131989 season as a result of recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure. The major violation was a plane ticket home for potential transfer [[Vincent Askew]] to see his sick grandmother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|title=Vincent Askew|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203032014/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|archivedate=December 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Prior to the investigation, Askew had already decided not to transfer to Kansas.\n\n===Roy Williams era (1988\u20132003)===\nShortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] as head coach.\n\nFrom 1988\u20132003, under the direction of Williams, the Jayhawks had a record of 418\u2013101, a .805 winning percentage. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286\u201360 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2009/D1.pdf|title=Division I Records|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref> From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 ([[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Billy Thomas (basketball)|Billy Thomas]], and [[C.B. McGrath]]) went 58\u20130 at home during their KU careers.\n\nKansas won nine regular-season conference championships over Williams' last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94\u201318, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001\u201302, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16\u20130) in Big 12 play.

Kansas was a regular in the Associated Press Top 25 from 1991 to 1999, placing in the poll for 145 consecutive weeks.

The team shot better than 50 percent from the floor for seven different seasons under Williams, and led the country in field goal percentage in 1990 (53.3) and 2002 (50.6). Williams' teams shot a combined 49.4 percent from the floor during his tenure. Williams-coached teams led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and were seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game over his 15 seasons as coach; and averaged 90 or more points per game in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002).<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe Jayhawks were in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls, reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons, and reached at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of William's 15 seasons as head coach at Kansas.\n\nUnder Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. Amidst the tournament successes, there were plenty of woes. The 1996\u201397 team was said by many to be one of the greatest teams in history, featuring future NBA players such as [[Paul Pierce]], [[Jacque Vaughn]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], and [[Scot Pollard]].

Following the national championship loss in 2003, Williams left Kansas and returned to coach at his [[alma mater]], North Carolina.\n\n===Bill Self era (2003\u2013present)===\n[[Bill Self]] was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003\u201304 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] his first year.\n\nThe next two seasons did not end on such a high note. Big things were expected of an experienced KU in 2004\u201305, led by seniors [[Wayne Simien]], [[Keith Langford]], [[Michael Lee (basketball, born 1983)|Michael Lee]], and [[Aaron Miles (basketball)|Aaron Miles]]. They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20\u20131, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to [[Bucknell Bison men's basketball|Bucknell]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23\u20137 and settled for a Big 12 co-championship with [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]].\n\n[[File:Kansas-Basketball-Staff-Nov-15-07-Washburn.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Coach [[Bill Self]] (third from left) with his national champion 2007\u201308 squad]]\nIn [[2005\u201306 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005\u201306]], little was expected of the freshman/sophomore-dominated Jayhawks, and they began the season 10\u20136, including 1\u20132 in the Big 12. Although they did post a 73\u201346 win over [[2005\u201306 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], they also saw the end of their 31-game winning streak over rival [[Kansas State Wildcats|Kansas State]] with a 59\u201355 loss at Allen Fieldhouse, and two nights later blew a seven-point lead in the final 45 seconds of regulation en route to an 89\u201386 overtime loss at [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]]. But afterward, the Jayhawks matured rapidly, winning 15 of their final 17 games and avenging the losses to both Kansas State and Missouri. KU played as the #2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament [[American Airlines Arena|in Dallas]], and avenged an earlier loss to Texas with an 80\u201368 victory over the Longhorns in the final to clinch the tournament championship and the highlight win of the season. KU was handed a #4 seed for the NCAA Tournament but stumbled again in the first round with a loss to the [[Bradley University|Bradley Braves]].\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006\u201307 season]], Self led [[2006\u201307 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] to the 2007 Big 12 regular-season championship with a 14\u20132 record, highlighted by beating the [[Kevin Durant]]-led Texas Longhorns in come-from-behind victories in the last game of the regular season and in the Big 12 Championship game. At the end of the regular season, Kansas stood at 27\u20134 and ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and coaches' polls. Kansas received a number 1 seed in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], but their tournament run ended in the Elite Eight with a loss to 2-seed [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]].\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007\u201308 season]], Self's [[2007\u201308 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] team began the season 20\u20130 until they suffered their first loss at rival [[2007\u201308 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team|Kansas State]], their first loss at Kansas State since 1983. The 2008 Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and the [[2008 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament|Big 12 conference tourney]]. They received a number-one seeding in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] in the Midwest region. On March 30, 2008, Self led Kansas to a win in an Elite Eight game over upstart [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson College]]. KU won by two, 59\u201357. The Jayhawks played overall number 1 tournament seed [[2007\u201308 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in the semifinals, a team coached by former KU head man Roy Williams.  The Jayhawks opened the game with a 40\u201312 run over the first 12\u00bd minutes before finally defeating them 84\u201366.  On April 7, 2008, the Jayhawks triumphed over a one-loss [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] team to claim the national title.  With only seconds on the clock, Sherron Collins drove the ball the length of the court and threaded a pass to Mario Chalmers, who connected on a deep three-pointer to force overtime. This shot would later come to be known as \"Mario's Miracle\" in a nod to 1988 championship nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  Kansas then outplayed Memphis in the overtime to win the NCAA Championship game, 75\u201368.  The Jayhawks finished the season with a 37\u20133 record, the winningest season in Kansas history.\n[[File:Championshipcrowd.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Championshipcrowd| Kansas fans celebrate in Downtown [[Lawrence, Kansas]] after the Jayhawks win the 2008 National Championship]]\nIn the [[2008\u201309 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008\u201309 season]], despite losing 7 of their top 9 scorers and the entire starting line-up, the Jayhawks earned their 20th consecutive [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] bid after going 25\u20137 (14\u20132), winning the conference regular season title and extending their home winning streak to 41 straight at Allen Fieldhouse. On March 22, 2009, Kansas defeated [[Dayton Flyers men's basketball|Dayton]], advancing to their 3rd consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. But the Jayhawks' season ended on March 27 when [[Michigan State]] came from behind in the final minute to defeat Kansas 67\u201362, ending their year at 27\u20138. Coach Self's record, after 6 seasons with the Jayhawks, was 169\u201340, an .809 percentage. After the season, Self was named National Coach of the Year by the [[Associated Press]], [[CBS Sports]]' [[Chevrolet]] Award, [[USBWA]] ([[Henry Iba Award]]), and [[Sporting News]].\n\nOn April 13, [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]] announced their intent to return for the [[2009\u201310 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2009\u201310]] season. On April 23, top high school recruit [[Xavier Henry]] made his commitment to play at Kansas in the fall, prompting [[ESPN]] to name the Jayhawks as \"the team to beat in 2009\u201310.\"  By the time the fall of 2009 arrived, Kansas was the unanimous preseason #1 team in all major publications.  The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 29\u20132 record and continue to hold the Division I record for the current consecutive home winning streak at 59 straight games in Allen Fieldhouse.  Kansas passed 2,000 all-time wins in the 2009\u201310 season, only the third school to do so (finishing the season with a total of 2,003 all-time victories).  They won the Big 12 tournament on March 13, clinching their 21st consecutive [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearance, an active NCAA record. However, despite being named the overall #1 seed in the tournament, the Jayhawks fell in the second round to #9-seeded Northern Iowa, finishing the season at 33\u20133.\n\nRecruiting began immediately for the [[2010\u201311 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2010\u201311]] season, as Kansas landed the nation's top recruit [[Josh Selby]] in April.  By September 2010, both The [[Sporting News]] and Athlon Sports had ranked Kansas in their pre-season outlook as #4 overall and, along with ESPN's Joe Lunardi, were projected to become a #1 seed again in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, which they would again do.  Blue Ribbon and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls both placed Kansas at #7 in the pre-season poll. [[Josh Selby]], became eligible and joined the Jayhawk line-up on December 18. On March 5, the Jayhawks beat Missouri 70\u201366 to clinch the Big 12 regular-season title for the 7th consecutive time and later went on to finish 29\u20132 during the regular season, ranked #2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll. Bill Self was named Big 12 Coach of the Year and [[Marcus Morris (basketball)|Marcus Morris]] was named Big 12 Player of the Year.  The Jayhawks defeated 16 seed Boston University, 9 seed Illinois and 12 seed Richmond to reach their 3rd Elite Eight in the past 5 seasons before falling to 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth University in the quarterfinal game. During the season, Kansas moved past North Carolina as the 2nd winningest basketball program in history.\n\nAfter being considered the top team but falling short in both of the previous two seasons, Kansas lost six of their top 8 scorers for the [[2011\u201312 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2011\u201312]] season. The Jayhawks had to rebuild after winning seven straight Big 12 titles. Prior to the season, the NCAA declared that three of the Jayhawks top recruits were ineligible for the season, which included games against perennial powerhouse programs such as Kentucky, Duke, Ohio State, and Georgetown. Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26\u20135, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks would face another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals. Kansas would come back from a 13-point first half deficit to win the game, 64\u201362. They then would face the Kentucky Wildcats, who had beaten the Louisville Cardinals on the other side of the bracket, in the championship game. Kansas would fall to the Wildcats, 67\u201359.\n\nKansas entered the [[2012\u201313 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2012\u201313]] season with eight straight Big 12 titles in tow.  They continued to have the greatest home court advantage in all of sports, ending the season having won 107 of their last 109 games at home.  After scoring their ninth consecutive title and winning the Big 12 tournament championship by defeating rival Kansas State for the third time that season, KU set its sights on a sixth national title.  They were seeded #1 in the South bracket, defeating Western Kentucky and North Carolina before losing in overtime to Michigan 87\u201385 in the Sweet 16.\n\nWith star freshmen Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid on the roster, Kansas entered the [[2013\u201314 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2013\u201314]] season as the #5 team in the country. They started off well with five straight wins, including a victory over Duke in the Champions' Classic. However, the team went 4\u20134 over its next eight games, including back-to-back losses to Colorado and Florida and an ugly home loss to San Diego State. The team recovered from this rough stretch and began Big 12 play with seven straight wins, ultimately finishing 14\u20134 to win its 10th consecutive Big 12 title. A back injury to Joel Embiid, however, left the Jayhawks vulnerable on their interior defense, and they fizzled out at season's end with four losses in their final seven games, including a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals in Kansas City and an NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Stanford to end the year. Kansas concluded the year 25\u201310, the first ten-loss season for Kansas since Roy Williams' 1999\u20132000 Jayhawks went 24\u201310.\n\nAfter the exodus of Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid to the NBA draft, the Jayhawks reloaded with freshmen [[Kelly Oubre Jr.]] and [[Cliff Alexander]], the Jayhawks looked poised for another Big 12 season title, which would be their 11th straight. After a disappointing loss in the Champions Classic to Kentucky, the Jayhawks finished 11\u20132 in the non-conference. In what many regarded as the toughest conference in the nation (Big 12) the Jayhawks won their 11th straight title outright with a record of 13\u20135, having lost their arguably strongest post presence in Cliff Alexander due to an investigation by the NCAA of improper benefits being given to Alexander. Evidence never clearly materialized, but Alexander was held out and played his last game as a Jayhawk at Kansas State, where they lost by 7. They then lost in the Big 12 Championship game to Iowa State 70\u201366, and had a final record going into the tournament of 26\u20138. The Jayhawks were given a two seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they ousted 15 seed New Mexico State by 19 points, but exited the tournament early at the hands of Wichita State by 13 points. Both Oubre Jr. and Alexander declared for the draft shortly after the conclusion of the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe 2015-16 Jayhawks, led by Perry Ellis and Frank Mason, won a 12th consecutive Big 12 title and won the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA South Region, the Jayhawks reached the Elite Eight, where they stumbled against #2 seed Villanova, the eventual national champions.\n\nIn 2016-17, behind the leadership of national player of the year Frank Mason, the Jayhawks won a 13th consecutive Big 12 title, tying UCLA's record for most consecutive conference titles. Although the team made an early exit from the Big 12 Tournament with a quarterfinal loss to TCU, the Jayhawks got the #1 seed in the NCAA Midwest Region. They dominated UC-Davis, Michigan State, and Purdue in their first three games, but ran into a buzzsaw against Oregon in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe 2017-18 Jayhawks lost a number of players to graduation, the NBA Draft, and transfer; but appeared to be poised for another spectacular season. Star freshman Billy Preston was sidelined by an NCAA inquiry into the financial picture surrounding his car, and ultimately left the team to play professional basketball in Europe. Kansas won its first seven games before losing in Kansas City to Washington and at home to Arizona State. Kansas would lose a total of three home games during the season, the most for any Bill Self-coached Kansas team, and the most since losing three home games in the 1998-99 season. The season bottomed out in early February with an ugly home loss to Oklahoma State and a 16-point loss at Baylor. But Kansas rallied to win a 14th straight Big 12 title, breaking UCLA's record. Then they defeated West Virginia to win the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA Midwest Region, the Jayhawks defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to reach Bill Self's third Final Four appearance and the program's 15th overall.\n\nKansas played in the 2015 World University Games in South Korea as the United States representatives in July 2015. The Jayhawks went undefeated in the World University Games, winning the championship to give the United States its first gold medal in World University Games men's basketball since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2015/7/13/8948825/kansas-basketball-world-university-games|title=KU-led team wins gold at World University Games|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> In August 2017, Self and the Jayhawks traveled to Italy to play four exhibition matches against local professional Italian teams.\n\nShortly before the [[2019\u201320 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2019-20 season]] began the NCAA announced they had major NCAA violations stemming from their involvement in the [[2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal]] putting their NCAA record consecutive tournament appearance streak in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kansas basketball hit with major NCAA violation charges stemming from FBI probe |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/kansas-basketball-hit-with-major-ncaa-violation-charges-stemming-from-fbi-probe/ |website=CBSSports.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Jayhawks finished the 2019\u201320 regular season 28\u20133 and were unanimously ranked number one in the final regular season AP poll. The Jayhawks went undefeated against unranked teams and their 3 losses came to ranked teams. The Jayhawks were a favorite to win the NCAA Tournament, however, the NCAA Tournament was cancelled due to [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] without a national champion being named.\n\n==Rank in notable areas==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Texas Western got a controversial double overtime victory, 81\u201380. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, at the buzzer was made by [[All-American]] [[Jo Jo White]] at the end of the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated.  This has always been highly contested and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120215/http://www.fanbase.com/photo/355160 photograph] of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor.  Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo.  Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee is not looking at his foot.  This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot.  The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game was going to a 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four.  The game is immortalized in the 2006 film ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'' which is based on that season's Texas Western team.\n* On February 26, 1972, near the end of a disappointing 11\u201315 season for the Jayhawks, senior forward [[Bud Stallworth]] scored 50 points against archrival Missouri, who were in the running for the Big 8 Conference championship.  Behind Stallworth's mammoth effort, the second-highest number of points in a game in KU history (Wilt Chamberlain scored 52 in his first game as a Jayhawk), KU defeated Missouri 93\u201380 on Senior Day at Allen Fieldhouse.  Stallworth averaged 25.3 points per game for the 1971\u201372 season.\n* On April 4, 1988, in the 50th NCAA Tournament National Championship game, Kansas defeated the heavily favored Oklahoma Sooners 83\u201379 to win its second NCAA Men's Basketball championship. Led by senior forward and Player of the Year [[Danny Manning]], Kevin Pritchard, Milt Newton, Chris Piper and a roster of players who came to be known as \"The Miracles\" raced the Sooners to a 50\u201350 halftime tie that had the referees shaking their heads and smiling as they left the court.  Upon their return for the second half, Larry Brown convinced his Jayhawks that now that they proved they could run with the Sooners, they needed to slow the game down and take the Sooners out of their fast break offense.  The Sooners built a 5-point second half lead until the Kansas defense finally clamped down.  The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark.  The rest of the game was neck and neck, until Manning finally sealed the victory from the free throw line.<ref>Woodling, Chuck (1988).

The longest tenured coach was [[Phog Allen]] at 39 seasons, while the shortest tenured coach was [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]], who coached for 5 seasons. Allen also has the most wins in Kansas basketball history with 590. The next closest coach is current head coach [[Bill Self]], who has won 500 games in his 17 seasons with the Jayhawks. [[Ted Owens (basketball)|Ted Owens]] is the only coach in program history to have been fired.\n\nOf programs who have been around for at least 100 years, Kansas has had the fewest coaches, yet they have been led to the Final Four by more coaches than any other program.  Every coach that has coached Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament in 1939 has led the team to a Final Four.  Phog Allen, [[Dick Harp]], [[Ted Owens (basketball)|Ted Owens]], Larry Brown,  Roy Williams, and  [[Bill Self]] have all led Kansas to NCAA Final Four appearances.   Of those coaches, Allen, Brown, and [[Bill Self]] have led the Jayhawks to [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Championships]] (in 1952, 1988, and 2008, respectively). In addition to an NCAA Tournament National Championship, Allen won two [[Helms Athletic Foundation]] National Championships, in 1922 and 1923.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#{{NCAA color|Kansas Jayhawks|1}}; color: #{{NCAA color|UCLA Bruins|2}}\"|'''Years'''\n| Duration of head coaching career at Kansas\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#{{NCAA color|Kansas Jayhawks|1}}; color: #{{NCAA color|UCLA Bruins|2}}\"|'''Record'''\n| Number of career games won-lost at Kansas\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#{{NCAA color|Kansas Jayhawks|1}}; color: #{{NCAA color|UCLA Bruins|2}}\"|'''Percent'''\n| Percentage of games won at Kansas\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:3em\"| *\n|Elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was home to the University of Kansas Jayhawks basketball teams until Allen Fieldhouse opened in 1955.\n\nMany of Hoch's nicknames during the basketball years were \"Horrible Hoch\" and \"The House of Horrors.\" Such nicknames were in reference to the difficulty opposing teams had in dealing with the tight area surrounding the court and the curved walls and decorative lattice work directly behind the backboards. The curvature of the walls made the backboards appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws.\n\nOn June 15, 1991, Hoch Auditorium was struck by lightning. The auditorium and stage area were completely destroyed. Only the limestone facade and lobby area were spared. When reconstruction of the building was complete, the rear half of the building was named Budig Hall, for then KU Chancellor [[Gene Budig]]. The name on the facade was altered to reflect the presence of three large auditorium-style lecture halls within the building: Hoch Auditoria.\n{{multiple image\n | align     = center\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = Former KU Basketball Facilities\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width     =\n | image1    = SnowHallKU.jpg\n | width1    = 220\n | caption1  = Snow Hall\n | image2    = Robinson gym ku.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | caption2  = Robinson Gymnasium\n | image3    = KUHochDec07.jpg\n | width3    = 220\n | caption3  = The remaining facade of what was Hoch Auditorium\n}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Allen Fieldhouse (1955\u2013present)===\n[[File:Allen Fieldhouse.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Inside of Allen Fieldhouse]]\n{{main|Allen Fieldhouse}}\nAllen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955 when the Jayhawks defeated in-state rival, [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]] 77\u201367.\n\nSince February 20, 1994, the Jayhawks have lost only 14 regular season games in Allen Fieldhouse, a 263\u201314 record (.951). Since February 3, 2007, the Jayhawks have gone 140\u20133 (.979) at Allen Fieldhouse, as of April 2, 2015, the best home record in all of basketball.\n\nAllen Fieldhouse is also notorious for its noise level as well. On November 4, 2010, ''ESPN The Magazine'' named Allen Fieldhouse the loudest college basketball arena in the country, reaching sustained decibel levels over 120.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/preview2010/insider/news/story?id=5761254 |title=NCAA Basketball - Kansas Jayhawks own the loudest arena in the nation |accessdate=November 19, 2010}}</ref> On February 13, 2017 in a game against Big 12 opponent [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]], fans at Allen Fieldhouse broke the [[Guinness World Record]] for loudest crowd roar at an indoor sporting event with a roar of 130.4 [[decibels]], which had been broken by [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]] on January 28 against Kansas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kansas-West Virginia: Allen Fieldhouse breaks record for loudest crowd roar at indoor sporting event |url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2017-02-13/kansas-west-virginia-allen-fieldhouse-breaks-record-loudest |website=NCAA.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Booth Family Hall of Athletics is the future home of [[Rules of basketball|Dr. Naismith's Original 13 Rules Of Basketball]], purchased at auction by the Booth family for $4.3 million on December 10, 2010.  Plans for the document's enshrinement there are in the early stages.\n\nKansas won 69 consecutive games at the Fieldhouse between February 3, 2007 and January 17, 2011 until Texas ended the longest streak in NCAA Division I since 1992 with a 74\u201363 win against Kansas on January 22, 2011. This streak broke Kansas' previous school record of 62, which lasted from February 26, 1994 through December 18, 1998 (during which time, the Jayhawks, along with the remaining members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] merged with the remaining members of the [[Southwest Conference]] to become charter members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]). The Jayhawks also completed a 55-game streak between February 22, 1984 through January 30, 1988, which is a Big 8 record.\n\n==Home game traditions==\nBefore the start of every Jayhawks home game, before the singing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", it is a tradition to sing the [[alma mater]], \"Crimson and the Blue\". While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung. The song is concluded by the [[Rock Chalk, Jayhawk|Rock Chalk Chant]].\n\nPost-game, the band will play a rendition of the state of Kansas anthem \"Home on the Range\", which the crowd will stand up for similar to the national anthem.\n\nAfter singing [[The Star-Spangled Banner]], while the opposing team is being introduced, members of the student section take out a copy of the student-run newspaper, The ''[[University Daily Kansan]]'', and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in the opposing team. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.\n\nIf an opposing player fouls out of the game, the fans will \"wave the wheat\", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic good-bye to the disqualified player, to the tune of \"You Didn't Have Your Wheaties\", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting [[Wheaties|Wheaties breakfast cereal.]] The same waving motion to the tune of \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\" follows a Jayhawk victory.\n\nIf the Jayhawks are leading comfortably near the end of the game, the crowd begins a slow version of the Rock Chalk Chant, which has become the signature tradition of Allen Fieldhouse. The chant can also occasionally be heard at neutral sites, such as arenas for the NCAA tournament and the nearby [[Sprint Center]] on the Missouri side of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] which during the regular season serves as an alternate home arena.\n\nFans and students will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, which is the first practice of the season. The practice is viewable to the public and includes skits with past players as the hosts.\n\n==Year-by-year Results==\n{{:Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball seasons}}\n\n==Record vs. Big 12 opponents==\n{{See also|Sunflower Showdown|}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!| Opponent !!| Overall Record !!| Home !!| Road !!| Neutral !!| Last 5 Meetings !!| Last 10 Meetings !!| Current Streak !!| Since Beginning<br>of Big 12\n|-\n| [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]]|| '''KU''', 32\u20135||'''KU''', 17\u20130||'''KU''', 13\u20133|| Tied, 2\u20132||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 2||'''KU''', 28-5\n|-\n| [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]]|| '''KU''', 182\u201366||'''KU''', 94\u201316||'''KU''', 70\u201340||'''KU''', 18\u201310||'''KU''', 3-2|| Tied, 5\u20135||L 1||'''KU''', 37\u201315\n|-\n| [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]]|| '''KU''', 197\u201394||'''KU''', 90\u201335||'''KU''', 78\u201348||'''KU''', 29\u201311||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 1|| '''KU''', 56\u201313\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]]|| '''KU''', 148\u201368||'''KU''', 76\u201316||'''KU''', 52\u201344||'''KU''', 20\u20138||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 7\u20133|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 27\u20138\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]]|| '''KU''', 116\u201359||'''KU''', 63\u201312||'''KU''', 37\u201335||'''KU''', 16\u201312||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 6\u20134|| '''W''' 3 || '''KU''', 27\u201312\n|-\n| [[TCU Horned Frogs men's basketball|TCU]]|| '''KU''', 18\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20130|| '''KU''', 7\u20131|| '''KU''', 3\u20131|| '''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 4|| '''KU''', 14-2\n|-\n| [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]]|| '''KU''', 33\u20139|| '''KU''', 17\u20131|| '''KU''', 10\u20137||'''KU''', 6\u20131||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20138\n|-\n| [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech]]|| '''KU''', 35\u20136||'''KU''', 18\u20131||'''KU''', 14\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''',8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20136\n|-\n| [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]]|| '''KU''', 12\u20135||'''KU''', 7-0||WVU, 2\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 4\u20131||'''KU''', 8\u20132||'''W''' 2||'''KU''', 12\u20135\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" | <small>*As of March 16, 2017.</small><ref>http://www.big12sports.com//pdf4/133449.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&ATCLID=1522666 |title=2004\u201305 Men's Basketball Media Guide \u2013 Big 12 Conference \u2013 Official Athletic Site |publisher=Big12sports.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/kuathletics/docs/kumbb-2017-guide|title=2016\u201317 Kansas Basketball Media Guide|newspaper=issuu|access-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Post-season results==\n\n===Regular season conference championships===\nThe Jayhawks have won 61 conference championships since their inception, including an NCAA record 14 consecutive from 2005 through 2018.

The Big Six and Big Seven conferences were actually the more often used names of the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which existed under that official name until 1964, when it was changed to the Big Eight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kuathletics.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/kan/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/mbaskbl-0708-mg-eight |title=2007\u201308 Media Guide |publisher=Kansas Jayhawks |accessdate=April 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220164321/http://kuathletics.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/kan/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/mbaskbl-0708-mg-eight |archivedate=February 20, 2008}}</ref>\n\n'''Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association/Big Eight Conference (43)'''\n* 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1914, 1915, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1931, 1932, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1938, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1946, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1960, 1966, 1967, 1971, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1986, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996\n\n'''Big 12 Conference (18)'''\n* 1997, 1998, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020\n\n===Conference tournament championships===\nThe Big Eight Conference did not regularly have a post-season tournament until after the 1977 season.

The program is classified in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and the team competes in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Kansas is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 5 overall National Championships (3 NCAA Tournament championships, 2 Helms National Championships), as well being a National Runner-Up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation. Kansas is the all-time consecutive conference titles record holder with 14 consecutive titles, a streak that ran from 2005 through 2018. The Jayhawks also own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with an active streak of 30 consecutive appearances. The Jayhawks have been ranked in the AP poll for 220 consecutive polls, a streak that has stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009 poll through the poll released on March 18, 2020, which is the longest active streak in the nation. That streak is 1 behind UCLA's record run of 221 straight from 1966-1980. Of the 24 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 19 Regular Season Conference titles.\n\nThe Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of the game of basketball, [[James Naismith]]. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Nick Collison]], [[Kirk Hinrich]], [[Mario Chalmers]], [[Andrew Wiggins]] and [[Joel Embiid]]. Politician [[Bob Dole]] also played basketball at Kansas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dole Institute to display letters between Phog Allen, Bob Dole|url=https://news.ku.edu/2016/02/08/dole-institute-display-letters-between-phog-allen-bob-dole|website=KU.edu}}</ref> Former players that have gone on to be coaches include [[Phog Allen]], [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Dutch Lonborg]], and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include [[John Calipari]], [[Gregg Popovich]], and [[Bill Self]].

Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two streaks that have reached over 50 games. In addition to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks will frequently play games at the nearby [[Sprint Center]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. These games, while technically a neutral site, are officially considered home games when they are not a part of a tournament.\n\n==History==\n<!-- Stats in this section need to be kept in sync with \"Rank in notable areas.\" -->\nKansas ranks second all-time in NCAA Division I wins with 2,302 wins (as of the last [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|complete season]]), against 862 losses (.728 all time winning %, 3rd all-time). This record includes a 765\u2013110 (.874) mark at historic [[Allen Fieldhouse]]<!-- Needs to sync with prior sentence season's data. -->. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas has the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has been around 100 years, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]], more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019\u201320 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the [[Big 12 Conference#Men's basketball|Big 12]]'s existence. The program also owns the best [[Big 12 Conference#Men's basketball|Big 12]] records in both those areas with a 412\u2013102<!-- Source?

Naismith died in 1939, and his remains are buried in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. The basketball court in Allen Fieldhouse is named James Naismith Court. Beyond inventing the game, his next greatest basketball legacy may be his coaching tree, whose two trunks are the well-known Phog Allen and Kansas native [[John McLendon]]. (McLendon attended KU in the 1930s when Allen was head coach.  Although McLendon tried out for the team, he never played for Allen. Naismith mentored McLendon from his arrival at Kansas through degree completion and beyond.)\n\nOn December 10, 2010, the [[David G. Booth|David Booth]] family purchased [[Rules of basketball|Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of the game]] at a Sotheby's auction in New York City for the sum of $4.3 million. They brought the founding document of basketball back to KU's Lawrence campus, where it is currently housed at the DeBruce Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://debrucecenter.ku.edu/rules |title=The Rules &#124; The DeBruce Center |publisher=Debrucecenter.ku.edu |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Phog Allen/William O. Hamilton era (1907\u20131956)===\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, [[Phog Allen|Dr. Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen]] as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|title=McGill grad James Naismith, inventor of basketball|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207055905/http://athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|archivedate=December 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Dutch Lonborg]] and [[Ralph Miller]] (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas).\nAllen coached the team from 1907\u201309, but William O. Hamilton coached from 1909\u20131919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125\u201359 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\n\nAllen coached KU for 39 seasons and amassed a record of 590\u2013219, with two retroactively-awarded [[Helms Foundation]] national titles and one NCAA Tournament championship in 1952. Numerous basketball greats would play at Kansas during Allen's era, including [[Dean Smith]], [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dutch Lonborg]], and [[Ralph Miller]] (all future Hall of Fame coaches), [[Paul Endacott]], [[Skinny Johnson|Bill Johnson]], and [[Clyde Lovellette]] (Hall of Fame players), two-time Olympic Gold Medalist [[Bill Hougland]], and even former United States [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bob Dole]].\n\nIn 1952, the Jayhawks won the national title with an 80\u201363 victory in the final game over [[St. John's University (Jamaica, New York)|St. John's]], coached by [[Frank McGuire]]. Clyde Lovellette of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and is still the only player to lead the nation in scoring and lead his team to a national title in the same year. This tournament was the first to have a true \"Final Four\" format. Seven members of the championship team represented the United States in the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and brought home a gold medal for the national basketball team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/stories/2008/aug/14/good_gold/|title=Good as gold  / LJWorld.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> This was especially poignant for Allen, as he had been the driving force for having basketball added to the Olympics in 1936.\nAllen was forced to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because he was getting too \"old\". Allen had recruited legendary [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956.\n\n===Dick Harp era (1956\u20131964)===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilt Chamberlain]] was one of the top centers to ever play for the Jayhawks.]]\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, [[Dick Harp]]. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121\u201382 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\n\n[[Wilt Chamberlain]] played his varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather easy one for the first two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time college records in an 87\u201369 win against [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54\u201353 in triple overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].\n\n===Ted Owens era (1964\u20131983)===\n[[Ted Owens (basketball)|Ted Owens]] took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348\u2013128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\n\nThe team advanced to NCAA postseason play seven times under Owens. The 1971 team went 27\u20133 and advanced to the Final Four before losing to UCLA. In 1974 the team went 23\u20137 and again advanced to the Final Four before losing to Marquette.\n\nDuring this era the program produced All-Americans such as [[Jo Jo White]], [[Walt Wesley]], [[Bud Stallworth]], [[Darnell Valentine]], and [[Dave Robisch]].\n\nAfter 19 years of coaching at [[University of Kansas]], Owens was fired following the 1982\u201383 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons.\n\n===Larry Brown era (1983\u20131988)===\n[[File:1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament - National Semifinals (ticket).jpg|thumb|150px|Brown helped lead Kansas to the school's second-ever NCAA Tournament championship in 1988.]]\nIn 1983, [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12\u20138 start, including 1\u20134 in the Big 8.  The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose 2 more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of [[Danny Manning]], KU finished 21\u201311 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed.  Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance.  The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season.  They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83\u201379 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since.  The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas' chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\n\nDuring Brown's tenure, Kansas had five NCAA Tournament appearances, which included two second round appearances, one Sweet 16 appearance, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship. He also compiled a 135\u201344 (.754) overall record. Brown left under a cloud, as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988\u20131989 season as a result of recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure. The major violation was a plane ticket home for potential transfer [[Vincent Askew]] to see his sick grandmother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|title=Vincent Askew|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203032014/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|archivedate=December 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Prior to the investigation, Askew had already decided not to transfer to Kansas.\n\n===Roy Williams era (1988\u20132003)===\nShortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] as head coach.\n\nFrom 1988\u20132003, under the direction of Williams, the Jayhawks had a record of 418\u2013101, a .805 winning percentage. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286\u201360 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2009/D1.pdf|title=Division I Records|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref> From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 ([[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Billy Thomas (basketball)|Billy Thomas]], and [[C.B. McGrath]]) went 58\u20130 at home during their KU careers.\n\nKansas won nine regular-season conference championships over Williams' last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94\u201318, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001\u201302, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16\u20130) in Big 12 play.

Williams-coached teams led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and were seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game over his 15 seasons as coach; and averaged 90 or more points per game in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002).<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe Jayhawks were in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls, reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons, and reached at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of William's 15 seasons as head coach at Kansas.\n\nUnder Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. Amidst the tournament successes, there were plenty of woes. The 1996\u201397 team was said by many to be one of the greatest teams in history, featuring future NBA players such as [[Paul Pierce]], [[Jacque Vaughn]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], and [[Scot Pollard]]. The team was upset in the Sweet Sixteen by the eventual champion, Arizona Wildcats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/sports/blogpost/2644876/|title=Roy, ACC Have Mixed NCAA History As No. 1|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210022429/http://www.wral.com/sports/blogpost/2644876/|archivedate=February 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Jayhawks advanced to the Final Four in 2002 & 2003. Following the national championship loss in 2003, Williams left Kansas and returned to coach at his [[alma mater]], North Carolina.\n\n===Bill Self era (2003\u2013present)===\n[[Bill Self]] was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003\u201304 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] his first year.\n\nThe next two seasons did not end on such a high note. Big things were expected of an experienced KU in 2004\u201305, led by seniors [[Wayne Simien]], [[Keith Langford]], [[Michael Lee (basketball, born 1983)|Michael Lee]], and [[Aaron Miles (basketball)|Aaron Miles]]. They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20\u20131, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to [[Bucknell Bison men's basketball|Bucknell]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23\u20137 and settled for a Big 12 co-championship with [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]].\n\n[[File:Kansas-Basketball-Staff-Nov-15-07-Washburn.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Coach [[Bill Self]] (third from left) with his national champion 2007\u201308 squad]]\nIn [[2005\u201306 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005\u201306]], little was expected of the freshman/sophomore-dominated Jayhawks, and they began the season 10\u20136, including 1\u20132 in the Big 12. Although they did post a 73\u201346 win over [[2005\u201306 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], they also saw the end of their 31-game winning streak over rival [[Kansas State Wildcats|Kansas State]] with a 59\u201355 loss at Allen Fieldhouse, and two nights later blew a seven-point lead in the final 45 seconds of regulation en route to an 89\u201386 overtime loss at [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]]. But afterward, the Jayhawks matured rapidly, winning 15 of their final 17 games and avenging the losses to both Kansas State and Missouri. KU played as the #2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament [[American Airlines Arena|in Dallas]], and avenged an earlier loss to Texas with an 80\u201368 victory over the Longhorns in the final to clinch the tournament championship and the highlight win of the season. KU was handed a #4 seed for the NCAA Tournament but stumbled again in the first round with a loss to the [[Bradley University|Bradley Braves]].\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006\u201307 season]], Self led [[2006\u201307 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] to the 2007 Big 12 regular-season championship with a 14\u20132 record, highlighted by beating the [[Kevin Durant]]-led Texas Longhorns in come-from-behind victories in the last game of the regular season and in the Big 12 Championship game. At the end of the regular season, Kansas stood at 27\u20134 and ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and coaches' polls. Kansas received a number 1 seed in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], but their tournament run ended in the Elite Eight with a loss to 2-seed [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]].\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007\u201308 season]], Self's [[2007\u201308 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] team began the season 20\u20130 until they suffered their first loss at rival [[2007\u201308 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team|Kansas State]], their first loss at Kansas State since 1983. The 2008 Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and the [[2008 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament|Big 12 conference tourney]]. They received a number-one seeding in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] in the Midwest region. On March 30, 2008, Self led Kansas to a win in an Elite Eight game over upstart [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson College]]. KU won by two, 59\u201357. The Jayhawks played overall number 1 tournament seed [[2007\u201308 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in the semifinals, a team coached by former KU head man Roy Williams.  The Jayhawks opened the game with a 40\u201312 run over the first 12\u00bd minutes before finally defeating them 84\u201366.  On April 7, 2008, the Jayhawks triumphed over a one-loss [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] team to claim the national title.  With only seconds on the clock, Sherron Collins drove the ball the length of the court and threaded a pass to Mario Chalmers, who connected on a deep three-pointer to force overtime. This shot would later come to be known as \"Mario's Miracle\" in a nod to 1988 championship nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  Kansas then outplayed Memphis in the overtime to win the NCAA Championship game, 75\u201368.  The Jayhawks finished the season with a 37\u20133 record, the winningest season in Kansas history.\n[[File:Championshipcrowd.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Championshipcrowd| Kansas fans celebrate in Downtown [[Lawrence, Kansas]] after the Jayhawks win the 2008 National Championship]]\nIn the [[2008\u201309 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008\u201309 season]], despite losing 7 of their top 9 scorers and the entire starting line-up, the Jayhawks earned their 20th consecutive [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] bid after going 25\u20137 (14\u20132), winning the conference regular season title and extending their home winning streak to 41 straight at Allen Fieldhouse. On March 22, 2009, Kansas defeated [[Dayton Flyers men's basketball|Dayton]], advancing to their 3rd consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. But the Jayhawks' season ended on March 27 when [[Michigan State]] came from behind in the final minute to defeat Kansas 67\u201362, ending their year at 27\u20138. Coach Self's record, after 6 seasons with the Jayhawks, was 169\u201340, an .809 percentage. After the season, Self was named National Coach of the Year by the [[Associated Press]], [[CBS Sports]]' [[Chevrolet]] Award, [[USBWA]] ([[Henry Iba Award]]), and [[Sporting News]].\n\nOn April 13, [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]] announced their intent to return for the [[2009\u201310 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2009\u201310]] season. On April 23, top high school recruit [[Xavier Henry]] made his commitment to play at Kansas in the fall, prompting [[ESPN]] to name the Jayhawks as \"the team to beat in 2009\u201310.\"  By the time the fall of 2009 arrived, Kansas was the unanimous preseason #1 team in all major publications.  The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 29\u20132 record and continue to hold the Division I record for the current consecutive home winning streak at 59 straight games in Allen Fieldhouse.  Kansas passed 2,000 all-time wins in the 2009\u201310 season, only the third school to do so (finishing the season with a total of 2,003 all-time victories).  They won the Big 12 tournament on March 13, clinching their 21st consecutive [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearance, an active NCAA record. However, despite being named the overall #1 seed in the tournament, the Jayhawks fell in the second round to #9-seeded Northern Iowa, finishing the season at 33\u20133.\n\nRecruiting began immediately for the [[2010\u201311 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2010\u201311]] season, as Kansas landed the nation's top recruit [[Josh Selby]] in April.  By September 2010, both The [[Sporting News]] and Athlon Sports had ranked Kansas in their pre-season outlook as #4 overall and, along with ESPN's Joe Lunardi, were projected to become a #1 seed again in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, which they would again do.  Blue Ribbon and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls both placed Kansas at #7 in the pre-season poll. [[Josh Selby]], became eligible and joined the Jayhawk line-up on December 18. On March 5, the Jayhawks beat Missouri 70\u201366 to clinch the Big 12 regular-season title for the 7th consecutive time and later went on to finish 29\u20132 during the regular season, ranked #2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll. Bill Self was named Big 12 Coach of the Year and [[Marcus Morris (basketball)|Marcus Morris]] was named Big 12 Player of the Year.  The Jayhawks defeated 16 seed Boston University, 9 seed Illinois and 12 seed Richmond to reach their 3rd Elite Eight in the past 5 seasons before falling to 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth University in the quarterfinal game. During the season, Kansas moved past North Carolina as the 2nd winningest basketball program in history.\n\nAfter being considered the top team but falling short in both of the previous two seasons, Kansas lost six of their top 8 scorers for the [[2011\u201312 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2011\u201312]] season. The Jayhawks had to rebuild after winning seven straight Big 12 titles. Prior to the season, the NCAA declared that three of the Jayhawks top recruits were ineligible for the season, which included games against perennial powerhouse programs such as Kentucky, Duke, Ohio State, and Georgetown. Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26\u20135, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks would face another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals. Kansas would come back from a 13-point first half deficit to win the game, 64\u201362. They then would face the Kentucky Wildcats, who had beaten the Louisville Cardinals on the other side of the bracket, in the championship game. Kansas would fall to the Wildcats, 67\u201359.\n\nKansas entered the [[2012\u201313 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2012\u201313]] season with eight straight Big 12 titles in tow.  They continued to have the greatest home court advantage in all of sports, ending the season having won 107 of their last 109 games at home.  After scoring their ninth consecutive title and winning the Big 12 tournament championship by defeating rival Kansas State for the third time that season, KU set its sights on a sixth national title.  They were seeded #1 in the South bracket, defeating Western Kentucky and North Carolina before losing in overtime to Michigan 87\u201385 in the Sweet 16.\n\nWith star freshmen Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid on the roster, Kansas entered the [[2013\u201314 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2013\u201314]] season as the #5 team in the country. They started off well with five straight wins, including a victory over Duke in the Champions' Classic. However, the team went 4\u20134 over its next eight games, including back-to-back losses to Colorado and Florida and an ugly home loss to San Diego State. The team recovered from this rough stretch and began Big 12 play with seven straight wins, ultimately finishing 14\u20134 to win its 10th consecutive Big 12 title. A back injury to Joel Embiid, however, left the Jayhawks vulnerable on their interior defense, and they fizzled out at season's end with four losses in their final seven games, including a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals in Kansas City and an NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Stanford to end the year. Kansas concluded the year 25\u201310, the first ten-loss season for Kansas since Roy Williams' 1999\u20132000 Jayhawks went 24\u201310.\n\nAfter the exodus of Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid to the NBA draft, the Jayhawks reloaded with freshmen [[Kelly Oubre Jr.]] and [[Cliff Alexander]], the Jayhawks looked poised for another Big 12 season title, which would be their 11th straight. After a disappointing loss in the Champions Classic to Kentucky, the Jayhawks finished 11\u20132 in the non-conference. In what many regarded as the toughest conference in the nation (Big 12) the Jayhawks won their 11th straight title outright with a record of 13\u20135, having lost their arguably strongest post presence in Cliff Alexander due to an investigation by the NCAA of improper benefits being given to Alexander. Evidence never clearly materialized, but Alexander was held out and played his last game as a Jayhawk at Kansas State, where they lost by 7. They then lost in the Big 12 Championship game to Iowa State 70\u201366, and had a final record going into the tournament of 26\u20138. The Jayhawks were given a two seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they ousted 15 seed New Mexico State by 19 points, but exited the tournament early at the hands of Wichita State by 13 points. Both Oubre Jr. and Alexander declared for the draft shortly after the conclusion of the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe 2015-16 Jayhawks, led by Perry Ellis and Frank Mason, won a 12th consecutive Big 12 title and won the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA South Region, the Jayhawks reached the Elite Eight, where they stumbled against #2 seed Villanova, the eventual national champions.\n\nIn 2016-17, behind the leadership of national player of the year Frank Mason, the Jayhawks won a 13th consecutive Big 12 title, tying UCLA's record for most consecutive conference titles. Although the team made an early exit from the Big 12 Tournament with a quarterfinal loss to TCU, the Jayhawks got the #1 seed in the NCAA Midwest Region. They dominated UC-Davis, Michigan State, and Purdue in their first three games, but ran into a buzzsaw against Oregon in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe 2017-18 Jayhawks lost a number of players to graduation, the NBA Draft, and transfer; but appeared to be poised for another spectacular season. Star freshman Billy Preston was sidelined by an NCAA inquiry into the financial picture surrounding his car, and ultimately left the team to play professional basketball in Europe. Kansas won its first seven games before losing in Kansas City to Washington and at home to Arizona State. Kansas would lose a total of three home games during the season, the most for any Bill Self-coached Kansas team, and the most since losing three home games in the 1998-99 season. The season bottomed out in early February with an ugly home loss to Oklahoma State and a 16-point loss at Baylor. But Kansas rallied to win a 14th straight Big 12 title, breaking UCLA's record. Then they defeated West Virginia to win the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA Midwest Region, the Jayhawks defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to reach Bill Self's third Final Four appearance and the program's 15th overall.\n\nKansas played in the 2015 World University Games in South Korea as the United States representatives in July 2015. The Jayhawks went undefeated in the World University Games, winning the championship to give the United States its first gold medal in World University Games men's basketball since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2015/7/13/8948825/kansas-basketball-world-university-games|title=KU-led team wins gold at World University Games|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> In August 2017, Self and the Jayhawks traveled to Italy to play four exhibition matches against local professional Italian teams.\n\nShortly before the [[2019\u201320 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2019-20 season]] began the NCAA announced they had major NCAA violations stemming from their involvement in the [[2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal]] putting their NCAA record consecutive tournament appearance streak in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kansas basketball hit with major NCAA violation charges stemming from FBI probe |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/kansas-basketball-hit-with-major-ncaa-violation-charges-stemming-from-fbi-probe/ |website=CBSSports.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Jayhawks finished the 2019\u201320 regular season 28\u20133 and were unanimously ranked number one in the final regular season AP poll. The Jayhawks went undefeated against unranked teams and their 3 losses came to ranked teams. The Jayhawks were a favorite to win the NCAA Tournament, however, the NCAA Tournament was cancelled due to [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] without a national champion being named.\n\n==Rank in notable areas==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Texas Western got a controversial double overtime victory, 81\u201380. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, at the buzzer was made by [[All-American]] [[Jo Jo White]] at the end of the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated.  This has always been highly contested and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120215/http://www.fanbase.com/photo/355160 photograph] of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor.  Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo.  Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee is not looking at his foot.  This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot.  The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game was going to a 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four.  The game is immortalized in the 2006 film ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'' which is based on that season's Texas Western team.\n* On February 26, 1972, near the end of a disappointing 11\u201315 season for the Jayhawks, senior forward [[Bud Stallworth]] scored 50 points against archrival Missouri, who were in the running for the Big 8 Conference championship.  Behind Stallworth's mammoth effort, the second-highest number of points in a game in KU history (Wilt Chamberlain scored 52 in his first game as a Jayhawk), KU defeated Missouri 93\u201380 on Senior Day at Allen Fieldhouse.  Stallworth averaged 25.3 points per game for the 1971\u201372 season.\n* On April 4, 1988, in the 50th NCAA Tournament National Championship game, Kansas defeated the heavily favored Oklahoma Sooners 83\u201379 to win its second NCAA Men's Basketball championship. Led by senior forward and Player of the Year [[Danny Manning]], Kevin Pritchard, Milt Newton, Chris Piper and a roster of players who came to be known as \"The Miracles\" raced the Sooners to a 50\u201350 halftime tie that had the referees shaking their heads and smiling as they left the court.  Upon their return for the second half, Larry Brown convinced his Jayhawks that now that they proved they could run with the Sooners, they needed to slow the game down and take the Sooners out of their fast break offense.  The Sooners built a 5-point second half lead until the Kansas defense finally clamped down.  The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark.

The curvature of the walls made the backboards appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws.\n\nOn June 15, 1991, Hoch Auditorium was struck by lightning. The auditorium and stage area were completely destroyed. Only the limestone facade and lobby area were spared. When reconstruction of the building was complete, the rear half of the building was named Budig Hall, for then KU Chancellor [[Gene Budig]].

Plans for the document's enshrinement there are in the early stages.\n\nKansas won 69 consecutive games at the Fieldhouse between February 3, 2007 and January 17, 2011 until Texas ended the longest streak in NCAA Division I since 1992 with a 74\u201363 win against Kansas on January 22, 2011. This streak broke Kansas' previous school record of 62, which lasted from February 26, 1994 through December 18, 1998 (during which time, the Jayhawks, along with the remaining members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] merged with the remaining members of the [[Southwest Conference]] to become charter members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]). The Jayhawks also completed a 55-game streak between February 22, 1984 through January 30, 1988, which is a Big 8 record.\n\n==Home game traditions==\nBefore the start of every Jayhawks home game, before the singing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", it is a tradition to sing the [[alma mater]], \"Crimson and the Blue\". While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung. The song is concluded by the [[Rock Chalk, Jayhawk|Rock Chalk Chant]].\n\nPost-game, the band will play a rendition of the state of Kansas anthem \"Home on the Range\", which the crowd will stand up for similar to the national anthem.\n\nAfter singing [[The Star-Spangled Banner]], while the opposing team is being introduced, members of the student section take out a copy of the student-run newspaper, The ''[[University Daily Kansan]]'', and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in the opposing team. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.\n\nIf an opposing player fouls out of the game, the fans will \"wave the wheat\", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic good-bye to the disqualified player, to the tune of \"You Didn't Have Your Wheaties\", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting [[Wheaties|Wheaties breakfast cereal.]] The same waving motion to the tune of \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\" follows a Jayhawk victory.\n\nIf the Jayhawks are leading comfortably near the end of the game, the crowd begins a slow version of the Rock Chalk Chant, which has become the signature tradition of Allen Fieldhouse. The chant can also occasionally be heard at neutral sites, such as arenas for the NCAA tournament and the nearby [[Sprint Center]] on the Missouri side of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] which during the regular season serves as an alternate home arena.\n\nFans and students will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, which is the first practice of the season. The practice is viewable to the public and includes skits with past players as the hosts.\n\n==Year-by-year Results==\n{{:Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball seasons}}\n\n==Record vs. Big 12 opponents==\n{{See also|Sunflower Showdown|}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!| Opponent !!| Overall Record !!| Home !!| Road !!| Neutral !!| Last 5 Meetings !!| Last 10 Meetings !!| Current Streak !!| Since Beginning<br>of Big 12\n|-\n| [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]]|| '''KU''', 32\u20135||'''KU''', 17\u20130||'''KU''', 13\u20133|| Tied, 2\u20132||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 2||'''KU''', 28-5\n|-\n| [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]]|| '''KU''', 182\u201366||'''KU''', 94\u201316||'''KU''', 70\u201340||'''KU''', 18\u201310||'''KU''', 3-2|| Tied, 5\u20135||L 1||'''KU''', 37\u201315\n|-\n| [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]]|| '''KU''', 197\u201394||'''KU''', 90\u201335||'''KU''', 78\u201348||'''KU''', 29\u201311||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 1|| '''KU''', 56\u201313\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]]|| '''KU''', 148\u201368||'''KU''', 76\u201316||'''KU''', 52\u201344||'''KU''', 20\u20138||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 7\u20133|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 27\u20138\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]]|| '''KU''', 116\u201359||'''KU''', 63\u201312||'''KU''', 37\u201335||'''KU''', 16\u201312||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 6\u20134|| '''W''' 3 || '''KU''', 27\u201312\n|-\n| [[TCU Horned Frogs men's basketball|TCU]]|| '''KU''', 18\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20130|| '''KU''', 7\u20131|| '''KU''', 3\u20131|| '''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 4|| '''KU''', 14-2\n|-\n| [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]]|| '''KU''', 33\u20139|| '''KU''', 17\u20131|| '''KU''', 10\u20137||'''KU''', 6\u20131||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20138\n|-\n| [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech]]|| '''KU''', 35\u20136||'''KU''', 18\u20131||'''KU''', 14\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''',8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20136\n|-\n| [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]]|| '''KU''', 12\u20135||'''KU''', 7-0||WVU, 2\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 4\u20131||'''KU''', 8\u20132||'''W''' 2||'''KU''', 12\u20135\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" | <small>*As of March 16, 2017.</small><ref>http://www.big12sports.com//pdf4/133449.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&ATCLID=1522666 |title=2004\u201305 Men's Basketball Media Guide \u2013 Big 12 Conference \u2013 Official Athletic Site |publisher=Big12sports.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/kuathletics/docs/kumbb-2017-guide|title=2016\u201317 Kansas Basketball Media Guide|newspaper=issuu|access-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Post-season results==\n\n===Regular season conference championships===\nThe Jayhawks have won 61 conference championships since their inception, including an NCAA record 14 consecutive from 2005 through 2018.

A theme and variations based on a theme from Schubert's [[Rosamunde]].\n|format      = [[Ogg]]}}\n|}\n\nIn [[music]], '''variation''' is a [[musical form|formal]] technique where material is [[musical repetition|repeated]] in an altered form. The changes may involve [[melody]], [[rhythm]], [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]], [[timbre]], [[orchestration]] or any combination of these.\n\n==Variation techniques==\n[[Mozart]]'s [[Twelve Variations on \"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman\"]] (1785), known in the English-speaking world as \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\" exemplifies a number of common variation techniques. Here are the first eight bars of the theme:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman theme.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman theme]][[File:Ah je vous dirai maman theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman theme, bars 1-8]]\n\n===Melodic variation===\nMozart's first variation decorates and elaborates the plain melodic line:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1]][[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1]]\n\n===Rhythmic variation===\nThe fifth variation breaks up the steady pulse and creates [[syncopated]] off-beats:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5]]\n[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5]]\n\n===Harmonic variation===\nThe seventh variation introduces powerful new [[Chord (music)|chords]], which replace the simple [[Harmony|harmonies]] originally implied by the theme with a prolongational series of descending fifths:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7]]\n[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7]]\n\n===Minor mode===\nIn the elaborate eighth variation, Mozart changes from the major to the parallel [[Mode (music)|minor mode]], while combining three techniques: [[counterpoint]], [[non-chord tone|suspensions]] and [[imitation (music)|imitation]]:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8]][[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8]] A complete performance can be heard by following this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyhxeo6zLAM Listen.]\n\n===Other examples===\nVariation techniques are frequently used within pieces that are not themselves in the form of theme and variations.  For example, when the opening two-bar phrase of Chopin's [[Nocturnes, Op. 55 (Chopin)|Nocturne in F minor]] returns later in the piece, it is instantly repeated as an elegant melodic re-working:[[File:Chopin Nocturne in F minor.wav|thumb|Chopin Nocturne in F minor]][[Image:Chopin - Nocturne in F Minor variation.png|325px|thumb|center|500px|Phrase and variation from [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Nocturnes, Op. 55 (Chopin)|Nocturne in F minor]].<ref>White (1976), p.63.</ref> ]]\n\n[[Depussy]]'s piano piece \"Reflets dans l\u2019Eau\" (1905) opens with a sequence of chords:[[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau opening 2 bars.wav|thumb|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau opening 2 bars]] [[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, opening bars.png|thumb|center| 450px|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, opening bars]] These chords open out into arpeggios when they return later in the piece:[[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau varied recapitulation of the opening.wav|thumb|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau varied recapitulation of the opening]][[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, varied recapitulation of the opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, varied recapitulation of the opening]]Follow this link for a complete performance of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCkM2a4daZU \u201cReflets dans l\u2019Eau\u201d].\n\nSometimes melodic variation occurs simultaneously with the original. In [[Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|\"Waldstein\"]] piano sonata, the main second-subject theme of the opening movement, which is in [[sonata form]], is heard in the pianist's left hand, while the right hand plays a decorated version. (See also [[heterophony]].)[[File:Beethoven Waldstein sonata 1st movement second subject.wav|thumb|Beethoven Waldstein sonata 1st movement second subject]][[File:Beethoven Waldstein 1st movement, bars 204-8.png|thumb|center|500px|Beethoven Waldstein 1st movement, bars 204-8]]\n\nWhile most variations tend to elaborate on the given theme or idea, there are exceptions. In 1819, [[Anton Diabelli]] commissioned Viennese composers to create variations on a waltz that he had composed:[[File:Theme by Anton Diabelli.wav|thumb|Theme by Anton Diabelli]][[File:Theme by Anton Diabelli.png|thumb|center|600px|Theme by Anton Diabelli]]\n\n[[Beethoven]] contributed a mighty set of [[Diabelli Variations|33 variations]] on this theme.  The thirteenth of these stands out in its seemingly wilful eccentricity and determination to reduce the given material to its bare bones:[[File:Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13.wav|thumb|Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13]][[File:Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13.png|thumb|center|600px|Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13]]\n\n[[Wilfrid Mellers]] describes this variation as \"comically disruptive... The original tonal sequence is telescoped, the two-bar sequences being absorbed into the [[silence|silences]].\" <ref>Mellers, W. (1983, p. 386) ''Beethoven and the Voice of God''.  London, Faber.</ref>\n\n===Variations on material originally by other composers===\n{{main|List of variations on a theme by another composer}}\nMany composers have taken pieces composed by others as a basis for elaboration. [[John Dowland]]'s ''[[Lachrimae]]'' was frequently used by other composers as a basis for sets of variations during the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm0aE6siZOM 17th century]. Composed in 1700, the final movement of [[Arcangelo Corelli]]'s Violin Sonata Op. 5 No. 9 opens with this rather sparse melodic line:[[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9.wav|thumb|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9]] [[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9.png|thumb|center|500px|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9]]\n\nCorelli's fellow-composer and former student [[Francesco Geminiani]] produced a \u201cplaying version\u201d<ref>Cook, N. (1990, p.189) ''Music, Imagination and Culture''.  Oxford, Clarendon Press.</ref> as follows:[[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani.wav|thumb|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani]][[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani.png|thumb|center|500px|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani]]\n\nAccording to [[Nicholas Cook]], in Geminiani's version \"all the notes of Corelli's violin line ... are absorbed into a quite new melodic organization. With its characteristic rhythmic pattern, Geminiani's opening is a tune in a way that Corelli's is not... whereas in the original version the first four bars consist of an undifferentiated stream of quarter-notes and make up a single phrase, Geminiani's version has three sequential repetitions of a distinctive one\u2014bar phrase and a contrasted closing phrase, producing a strongly accented down-beat quality.\"<ref>Cook, N. (1990, p.190) ''Music, Imagination and Culture''.  Oxford, Clarendon Press.</ref>\n\nJazz arrangers frequently develop variations on themes by other composers. For example, [[Gil Evans]]\u2019 1959 arrangement of [[George Gershwin]]'s song \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" from the opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' is an example of variation through changing orchestral [[timbre]]. At the outset, Evans presents a single variation that repeats five times in subtly differing instrumental combinations. These create a compelling background, a constantly-changing sonic tapestry over which trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] freely improvises his own set of  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgmEY41baKM variations]. Wilfrid Mellers (1964) wrote that \"[i]t called for an improviser of Davis's kind and quality to explore, through Gil Evans' arrangement, the tender frailty inherent in the 'Summer-time' tune... Between them, solo line and harmonic colour create a music that is at once innocent and tense with apprehension\".<ref>Mellers 1964, 356.</ref>\n\n==Variation form==\nVariation forms include [[ground bass]], [[passacaglia]], [[chaconne]], and theme and variations.<ref>Copland 2002, 115.</ref> Ground bass, passacaglia and chaconne are typically based on brief [[ostinato]] motifs providing a repetitive harmonic basis and are also typically continuous evolving structures. Theme-and-variation forms are, however, based specifically on melodic variation, in which the fundamental musical idea, or [[Theme (music)|theme]], is repeated in altered form or accompanied in a different manner. Theme-and-variation structure generally begins with a theme (which is itself sometimes preceded by an introduction), typically between eight and thirty-two bars in length; each variation, particularly in music of the eighteenth century and earlier, will be of the same length and structure as the theme.<ref name=\"Sisman 2001\">Sisman 2001.</ref> This form may in part have derived from the practical inventiveness of musicians; \"Court dances were long; the tunes which accompanied them were short. Their repetition became intolerably wearisome, and inevitably led the player to indulge in extempore variation and ornament\";<ref>Raymar 1931, 5.</ref> however, the format of the dance required these variations to maintain the same duration and shape of the tune.\n\nVariation forms can be written as free-standing pieces for solo instruments or ensembles, or can constitute a [[movement (music)|movement]] of a larger piece. Most jazz music is structured on a basic pattern of theme and variations.<ref name=hodeir>Hodeir and Pautrot 2006, 8.</ref>\n\nExamples include [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]]'s ''[[Salvator Mundi]]'', [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her]]'', ''[[Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582|Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor]]'', [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)#The Chaconne in D minor|Violin ''Chaconne'']], and ([[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|D minor solo violin suite]]), [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]]'s ''[[La Folia]] Variations'', Beethoven's ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the Finale of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn|Variations on a Theme of Haydn]]'', Op. 56, [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', [[C\u00e9sar Franck|Franck]]'s ''[[Symphonic Variations (Franck)|Variations Symphoniques]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]''.<ref name=\"White\">White 1976, 64\u201365.</ref> Both [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|''Death and the Maiden'' Quartet]] and [[Trout Quintet|''Trout'' Quintet]] take their titles from his songs used as variation movements.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\nChopin's ''[[Berceuse (Chopin)|Berceuse]]'' for piano, Op. 57, was first called ''Variantes'', and consists of 16 continuous variations on a ground bass.\n\n==History of variations==<!--[[Division (music)]] links directly here-->\nAlthough the first isolated example emerged in the 14th century, works in theme-and-variation form first emerge in the early sixteenth century.<ref name=\"Apel62p784\">Apel, Willi (1962) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JVYVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA784 ''Harvard dictionary of music''], p. 784</ref> Possibly the earliest published example is the ''diferencias'' for [[vihuela]] by [[Luis de Narv\u00e1ez]] (1538).<ref name=\"Sisman 2001\"/>  A favorite form of variations in [[Renaissance music]] was ''[[division (music)|divisions]]'', a type in which the basic rhythmic beat is successively divided into smaller and smaller values.  The basic principle of beginning with simple variations and moving on to more elaborate ones has always been present in the history of the variation form, since it provides a way of giving an overall shape to a variation set, rather than letting it just form an arbitrary sequence.\n\nKeyboard works in variation form were written by a number of 16th-century English composers, including [[William Byrd]], [[Hugh Aston]] and [[Giles Farnaby]]. Outstanding examples of early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] variations are the \"ciaccone\" of [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]].<ref>Gerald Drebes: ''Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \"Vollkommenheit der Musik\" \u2013 \"Es steh Gott auf\" aus den \"Symphoniae sacrae\" II (1647)''.

[[Joseph Haydn]] specialized in sets of [[double variation]]s, in which two related themes, usually minor and major, are presented and then varied in alternation; outstanding examples are the slow movement of his [[Symphony No. 103 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 103]], the ''Drumroll'', and the [[Variations in F minor]] for piano, H XVII:6.<ref name=\"Sisman 2001\"/>\n\n[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] wrote many variation sets in his career. Some were independent sets, for instance the ''Diabelli'' Variations, Op. 120, and the [[Eroica Variations|''Eroica'' Variations in E{{Music|flat}} major, Op. 35]]. Others form single movements or parts of movements in larger works, such as first movement of the [[Piano Sonata No. 12 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 12, Op. 26]], or the variations in the final movement of the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony (''Eroica'')]]. Variation sets also occur in several of his late works, such as the slow movement of his [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|String Quartet No. 12, Op. 127]], the second movement of his final [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 32, Op. 111]], and the slow third movement of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony, Op.125]].\n\n[[Franz Schubert]] wrote five variation sets using his own [[lied]]er as themes.  Amongst them is the slow movement of his string quartet ''[[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|Death and the Maiden]]'' D. 810, an intense set of variations on his somber lied (D. 531) of the same title.  Schubert's [[Piano Quintet in A (Schubert)|Piano Quintet in A]] (''The Trout'', D. 667) likewise includes variations on his song ''[[Die Forelle|The Trout]]'' D. 550. The second movement of the [[Wanderer Fantasy|Fantasie in C major]] comprises a set of variations on ''[[Der Wanderer]]''; indeed the work as a whole takes its popular name from the lied.\n\nIn the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era, the variation form was developed further. In 1824, [[Carl Czerny]] premiered his Variations for piano and orchestra on the Austrian National Hymn ''Gott erhalte Franz der Kaiser'', Op. 73.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americansymphony.org/dialogue.php?id=126&season=2004-2005 |title=American Symphony Orchestra: Dialogues and Extensions |access-date=2008-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305155254/http://www.americansymphony.org/dialogue.php?id=126&season=2004-2005 |archive-date=2009-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]] wrote four sets for solo piano, and also the [[Variations on \"L\u00e0 ci darem la mano\" (Chopin)|Variations on \"La ci darem la mano\"]] from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', Op. 2, for piano and orchestra (1827). A further example of the form is [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s  ''[[Variations s\u00e9rieuses]]''.\n\n[[Johannes Brahms]] wrote a number of sets of variations; some of them rely on themes by older composers, for example the [[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]] (1861; piano), and the [[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]] (1873; orchestra). The latter work is believed to be the first set of variations for orchestra alone that was a work in its own right, rather than part of a symphony, suite or other larger work.<ref>See Donald M.

This was commonplace in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era, when the [[da capo aria]], particularly when in slow tempo, required the singer to be able to improvise a variation during the return of the main material.  During this period, according to Nicholas Cook, it was often the case that \"responsibility for the most highly elaborated stage in the compositional process fell not upon the composer but upon the executant. In their instrumental sonatas composers like Corelli, Geminiani, and Handel sometimes supplied the performer with only the skeleton of the music that was to be played; the ornamentation, which contributes crucially to the music\u2019s effect, had to be provided by the performer.\" Cook cites Geminiani's elaboration of Corelli (see above) as an example of an instance \"in which the composer, or a performer, wrote down a version of one of these movements as it was meant to be played.\"<ref>Cook, N. (1990, p.189) Music, Imagination and Culture.  Oxford, Clarendon Press.</ref>\n\nMusicians of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era also could improvise variations; both Mozart (see [[Mozart's compositional method]]) and Beethoven made powerful impressions on their audiences when they improvised. Modern listeners can get a sense of what these improvised variations sounded like by listening to published works that evidently are written transcriptions of improvised performances, in particular Beethoven's ''Fantasia in G Minor'', Op. 77,<ref>Irmer 1985, 4.</ref> and Mozart's ''Variations on an Aria by [[Christophe Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'', K. 455.<ref>Braunbehrens 1990, 198.</ref>\n\nImprovisation of elaborate variations on a popular theme is one of the core genres of [[jazz]]. According to William Austin, the practice of jazz musicians \"resembles the variations on popular songs composed for the keyboard at the end of the 16th century by Byrd, Bull, Sweelinck and Frescobaldi, more than the cumulative variations of Beethoven and Brahms.\"<ref>Austin 1966, 185.</ref> Generally, the theme used is stated quite explicitly at the outset. However, some jazz musicians employ a more oblique approach. According to Gamble (1984, p13) \u201c[[Charlie Parker]]'s performance of ''[[Embraceable You]]'' can be appreciated fully only if we are familiar with the tune, for unlike many jazz performances in which the theme is stated at the beginning, followed by improvisations on the theme, Parker launches almost immediately into [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha4mgxN_E5w improvisation], stating only a fragment of the tune at the end of the piece.\u201d<ref>Gamble, T. (1984, p13) \"Imagination and Understanding in the Music Curriculum\", ''British Journal of Music Education'', Vol. 1, No. 1.  Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Coleman Hawkins]]' famous interpretation of [[Body and Soul (1930 song)|\u201cBody and Soul\u201d]] shows a similar approach. \u201cOn 11 October 1939, Coleman Hawkins went into New York's RCA studios with an eight-piece band to record the 1930 composition Body and Soul. It was already a favourite among jazz musicians, but nobody had ever played it like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOX0eA-NlZ0 this]. Pianist Gene Rodgers plays a straight four-bar introduction before Hawkins swoops in, soloing for three minutes without playing a single note of the tune, gliding over the chord changes with such harmonic logic that he ends up inventing [[bebop]].\" <ref>Lewis, J.

The changes may involve [[melody]], [[rhythm]], [[harmony]], [[counterpoint]], [[timbre]], [[orchestration]] or any combination of these.\n\n==Variation techniques==\n[[Mozart]]'s [[Twelve Variations on \"Ah vous dirai-je, Maman\"]] (1785), known in the English-speaking world as \"[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]\" exemplifies a number of common variation techniques. Here are the first eight bars of the theme:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman theme.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman theme]][[File:Ah je vous dirai maman theme.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman theme, bars 1-8]]\n\n===Melodic variation===\nMozart's first variation decorates and elaborates the plain melodic line:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1]][[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 1]]\n\n===Rhythmic variation===\nThe fifth variation breaks up the steady pulse and creates [[syncopated]] off-beats:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5]]\n[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 5]]\n\n===Harmonic variation===\nThe seventh variation introduces powerful new [[Chord (music)|chords]], which replace the simple [[Harmony|harmonies]] originally implied by the theme with a prolongational series of descending fifths:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7]]\n[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 7]]\n\n===Minor mode===\nIn the elaborate eighth variation, Mozart changes from the major to the parallel [[Mode (music)|minor mode]], while combining three techniques: [[counterpoint]], [[non-chord tone|suspensions]] and [[imitation (music)|imitation]]:[[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8.wav|thumb|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8]][[File:Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8.png|thumb|center|500px|Ah je vous dirai maman Var 8]] A complete performance can be heard by following this link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyhxeo6zLAM Listen.]\n\n===Other examples===\nVariation techniques are frequently used within pieces that are not themselves in the form of theme and variations.  For example, when the opening two-bar phrase of Chopin's [[Nocturnes, Op. 55 (Chopin)|Nocturne in F minor]] returns later in the piece, it is instantly repeated as an elegant melodic re-working:[[File:Chopin Nocturne in F minor.wav|thumb|Chopin Nocturne in F minor]][[Image:Chopin - Nocturne in F Minor variation.png|325px|thumb|center|500px|Phrase and variation from [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Nocturnes, Op. 55 (Chopin)|Nocturne in F minor]].<ref>White (1976), p.63.</ref> ]]\n\n[[Debussy]]'s piano piece \"Reflets dans l\u2019Eau\" (1905) opens with a sequence of chords:[[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau opening 2 bars.wav|thumb|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau opening 2 bars]] [[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, opening bars.png|thumb|center| 450px|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, opening bars]] These chords open out into arpeggios when they return later in the piece:[[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau varied recapitulation of the opening.wav|thumb|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau varied recapitulation of the opening]][[File:Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, varied recapitulation of the opening.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy Reflets dans l'Eau, varied recapitulation of the opening]]Follow this link for a complete performance of [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCkM2a4daZU \u201cReflets dans l\u2019Eau\u201d].\n\nSometimes melodic variation occurs simultaneously with the original. In [[Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 21 (Beethoven)|\"Waldstein\"]] piano sonata, the main second-subject theme of the opening movement, which is in [[sonata form]], is heard in the pianist's left hand, while the right hand plays a decorated version. (See also [[heterophony]].)[[File:Beethoven Waldstein sonata 1st movement second subject.wav|thumb|Beethoven Waldstein sonata 1st movement second subject]][[File:Beethoven Waldstein 1st movement, bars 204-8.png|thumb|center|500px|Beethoven Waldstein 1st movement, bars 204-8]]\n\nWhile most variations tend to elaborate on the given theme or idea, there are exceptions. In 1819, [[Anton Diabelli]] commissioned Viennese composers to create variations on a waltz that he had composed:[[File:Theme by Anton Diabelli.wav|thumb|Theme by Anton Diabelli]][[File:Theme by Anton Diabelli.png|thumb|center|600px|Theme by Anton Diabelli]]\n\n[[Beethoven]] contributed a mighty set of [[Diabelli Variations|33 variations]] on this theme.  The thirteenth of these stands out in its seemingly wilful eccentricity and determination to reduce the given material to its bare bones:[[File:Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13.wav|thumb|Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13]][[File:Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13.png|thumb|center|600px|Beethoven, Diabelli Variation No. 13]]\n\n[[Wilfrid Mellers]] describes this variation as \"comically disruptive... The original tonal sequence is telescoped, the two-bar sequences being absorbed into the [[silence|silences]].\" <ref>Mellers, W. (1983, p. 386) ''Beethoven and the Voice of God''.  London, Faber.</ref>\n\n===Variations on material originally by other composers===\n{{main|List of variations on a theme by another composer}}\nMany composers have taken pieces composed by others as a basis for elaboration. [[John Dowland]]'s ''[[Lachrimae]]'' was frequently used by other composers as a basis for sets of variations during the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xm0aE6siZOM 17th century]. Composed in 1700, the final movement of [[Arcangelo Corelli]]'s Violin Sonata Op. 5 No. 9 opens with this rather sparse melodic line:[[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9.wav|thumb|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9]] [[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9.png|thumb|center|500px|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9]]\n\nCorelli's fellow-composer and former student [[Francesco Geminiani]] produced a \u201cplaying version\u201d<ref>Cook, N. (1990, p.189) ''Music, Imagination and Culture''.  Oxford, Clarendon Press.</ref> as follows:[[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani.wav|thumb|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani]][[File:Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani.png|thumb|center|500px|Corelli Violin Sonata Op 5 No 9, performing version by Geminiani]]\n\nAccording to [[Nicholas Cook]], in Geminiani's version \"all the notes of Corelli's violin line ... are absorbed into a quite new melodic organization. With its characteristic rhythmic pattern, Geminiani's opening is a tune in a way that Corelli's is not... whereas in the original version the first four bars consist of an undifferentiated stream of quarter-notes and make up a single phrase, Geminiani's version has three sequential repetitions of a distinctive one\u2014bar phrase and a contrasted closing phrase, producing a strongly accented down-beat quality.\"<ref>Cook, N. (1990, p.190) ''Music, Imagination and Culture''.  Oxford, Clarendon Press.</ref>\n\nJazz arrangers frequently develop variations on themes by other composers. For example, [[Gil Evans]]\u2019 1959 arrangement of [[George Gershwin]]'s song \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" from the opera ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' is an example of variation through changing orchestral [[timbre]]. At the outset, Evans presents a single variation that repeats five times in subtly differing instrumental combinations. These create a compelling background, a constantly-changing sonic tapestry over which trumpeter [[Miles Davis]] freely improvises his own set of  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgmEY41baKM variations]. Wilfrid Mellers (1964) wrote that \"[i]t called for an improviser of Davis's kind and quality to explore, through Gil Evans' arrangement, the tender frailty inherent in the 'Summer-time' tune... Between them, solo line and harmonic colour create a music that is at once innocent and tense with apprehension\".<ref>Mellers 1964, 356.</ref>\n\n==Variation form==\nVariation forms include [[ground bass]], [[passacaglia]], [[chaconne]], and theme and variations.<ref>Copland 2002, 115.</ref> Ground bass, passacaglia and chaconne are typically based on brief [[ostinato]] motifs providing a repetitive harmonic basis and are also typically continuous evolving structures. Theme-and-variation forms are, however, based specifically on melodic variation, in which the fundamental musical idea, or [[Theme (music)|theme]], is repeated in altered form or accompanied in a different manner. Theme-and-variation structure generally begins with a theme (which is itself sometimes preceded by an introduction), typically between eight and thirty-two bars in length; each variation, particularly in music of the eighteenth century and earlier, will be of the same length and structure as the theme.<ref name=\"Sisman 2001\">Sisman 2001.</ref> This form may in part have derived from the practical inventiveness of musicians; \"Court dances were long; the tunes which accompanied them were short. Their repetition became intolerably wearisome, and inevitably led the player to indulge in extempore variation and ornament\";<ref>Raymar 1931, 5.</ref> however, the format of the dance required these variations to maintain the same duration and shape of the tune.\n\nVariation forms can be written as free-standing pieces for solo instruments or ensembles, or can constitute a [[movement (music)|movement]] of a larger piece. Most jazz music is structured on a basic pattern of theme and variations.<ref name=hodeir>Hodeir and Pautrot 2006, 8.</ref>\n\nExamples include [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]]'s ''[[Salvator Mundi]]'', [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''[[Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her\"|Canonic Variations on \"Vom Himmel hoch da komm' ich her]]'', ''[[Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582|Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor]]'', [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)#The Chaconne in D minor|Violin ''Chaconne'']], and ([[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin (Bach)|D minor solo violin suite]]), [[Arcangelo Corelli|Corelli]]'s ''[[La Folia]] Variations'', Beethoven's ''[[Diabelli Variations]]'', the Finale of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Brahms)|Fourth Symphony]], ''[[Variations on a Theme by Haydn|Variations on a Theme of Haydn]]'', Op. 56, [[Edward Elgar|Elgar]]'s ''[[Enigma Variations]]'', [[C\u00e9sar Franck|Franck]]'s ''[[Symphonic Variations (Franck)|Variations Symphoniques]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Don Quixote (Strauss)|Don Quixote]]''.<ref name=\"White\">White 1976, 64\u201365.</ref> Both [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]]'s [[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|''Death and the Maiden'' Quartet]] and [[Trout Quintet|''Trout'' Quintet]] take their titles from his songs used as variation movements.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\nChopin's ''[[Berceuse (Chopin)|Berceuse]]'' for piano, Op. 57, was first called ''Variantes'', and consists of 16 continuous variations on a ground bass.\n\n==History of variations==<!--[[Division (music)]] links directly here-->\nAlthough the first isolated example emerged in the 14th century, works in theme-and-variation form first emerge in the early sixteenth century.<ref name=\"Apel62p784\">Apel, Willi (1962) [https://books.google.com/books?id=JVYVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA784 ''Harvard dictionary of music''], p. 784</ref> Possibly the earliest published example is the ''diferencias'' for [[vihuela]] by [[Luis de Narv\u00e1ez]] (1538).<ref name=\"Sisman 2001\"/>  A favorite form of variations in [[Renaissance music]] was ''[[division (music)|divisions]]'', a type in which the basic rhythmic beat is successively divided into smaller and smaller values.  The basic principle of beginning with simple variations and moving on to more elaborate ones has always been present in the history of the variation form, since it provides a way of giving an overall shape to a variation set, rather than letting it just form an arbitrary sequence.\n\nKeyboard works in variation form were written by a number of 16th-century English composers, including [[William Byrd]], [[Hugh Aston]] and [[Giles Farnaby]]. Outstanding examples of early [[Baroque music|Baroque]] variations are the \"ciaccone\" of [[Claudio Monteverdi]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]].<ref>Gerald Drebes: ''Sch\u00fctz, Monteverdi und die \"Vollkommenheit der Musik\" \u2013 \"Es steh Gott auf\" aus den \"Symphoniae sacrae\" II (1647)''.

[[Joseph Haydn]] specialized in sets of [[double variation]]s, in which two related themes, usually minor and major, are presented and then varied in alternation; outstanding examples are the slow movement of his [[Symphony No. 103 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 103]], the ''Drumroll'', and the [[Variations in F minor]] for piano, H XVII:6.<ref name=\"Sisman 2001\"/>\n\n[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] wrote many variation sets in his career. Some were independent sets, for instance the ''Diabelli'' Variations, Op. 120, and the [[Eroica Variations|''Eroica'' Variations in E{{Music|flat}} major, Op. 35]]. Others form single movements or parts of movements in larger works, such as first movement of the [[Piano Sonata No. 12 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 12, Op. 26]], or the variations in the final movement of the [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Third Symphony (''Eroica'')]]. Variation sets also occur in several of his late works, such as the slow movement of his [[String Quartet No. 12 (Beethoven)|String Quartet No. 12, Op. 127]], the second movement of his final [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Piano Sonata No. 32, Op. 111]], and the slow third movement of the [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony, Op.125]].\n\n[[Franz Schubert]] wrote five variation sets using his own [[lied]]er as themes.  Amongst them is the slow movement of his string quartet ''[[String Quartet No. 14 (Schubert)|Death and the Maiden]]'' D. 810, an intense set of variations on his somber lied (D. 531) of the same title.  Schubert's [[Piano Quintet in A (Schubert)|Piano Quintet in A]] (''The Trout'', D. 667) likewise includes variations on his song ''[[Die Forelle|The Trout]]'' D. 550. The second movement of the [[Wanderer Fantasy|Fantasie in C major]] comprises a set of variations on ''[[Der Wanderer]]''; indeed the work as a whole takes its popular name from the lied.\n\nIn the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] era, the variation form was developed further.

A further example of the form is [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s  ''[[Variations s\u00e9rieuses]]''.\n\n[[Johannes Brahms]] wrote a number of sets of variations; some of them rely on themes by older composers, for example the [[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]] (1861; piano), and the [[Variations on a Theme by Haydn]] (1873; orchestra). The latter work is believed to be the first set of variations for orchestra alone that was a work in its own right, rather than part of a symphony, suite or other larger work.<ref>See Donald M. McCorkle, p. 5 in the Norton Scores edition of the Variations ({{ISBN|0-393-09206-2}}).</ref> [[Karl Goldmark]]'s ''[[Rustic Wedding Symphony]]'' (1875) starts out with a set of variations as its first movement.

This was commonplace in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era, when the [[da capo aria]], particularly when in slow tempo, required the singer to be able to improvise a variation during the return of the main material.  During this period, according to Nicholas Cook, it was often the case that \"responsibility for the most highly elaborated stage in the compositional process fell not upon the composer but upon the executant. In their instrumental sonatas composers like Corelli, Geminiani, and Handel sometimes supplied the performer with only the skeleton of the music that was to be played; the ornamentation, which contributes crucially to the music\u2019s effect, had to be provided by the performer.\" Cook cites Geminiani's elaboration of Corelli (see above) as an example of an instance \"in which the composer, or a performer, wrote down a version of one of these movements as it was meant to be played.\"<ref>Cook, N. (1990, p.189) Music, Imagination and Culture.  Oxford, Clarendon Press.</ref>\n\nMusicians of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era also could improvise variations; both Mozart (see [[Mozart's compositional method]]) and Beethoven made powerful impressions on their audiences when they improvised. Modern listeners can get a sense of what these improvised variations sounded like by listening to published works that evidently are written transcriptions of improvised performances, in particular Beethoven's ''Fantasia in G Minor'', Op. 77,<ref>Irmer 1985, 4.</ref> and Mozart's ''Variations on an Aria by [[Christophe Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]'', K. 455.<ref>Braunbehrens 1990, 198.</ref>\n\nImprovisation of elaborate variations on a popular theme is one of the core genres of [[jazz]]. According to William Austin, the practice of jazz musicians \"resembles the variations on popular songs composed for the keyboard at the end of the 16th century by Byrd, Bull, Sweelinck and Frescobaldi, more than the cumulative variations of Beethoven and Brahms.\"<ref>Austin 1966, 185.</ref> Generally, the theme used is stated quite explicitly at the outset. However, some jazz musicians employ a more oblique approach. According to Gamble (1984, p13) \u201c[[Charlie Parker]]'s performance of ''[[Embraceable You]]'' can be appreciated fully only if we are familiar with the tune, for unlike many jazz performances in which the theme is stated at the beginning, followed by improvisations on the theme, Parker launches almost immediately into [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha4mgxN_E5w improvisation], stating only a fragment of the tune at the end of the piece.\u201d<ref>Gamble, T. (1984, p13) \"Imagination and Understanding in the Music Curriculum\", ''British Journal of Music Education'', Vol. 1, No. 1.  Cambridge University Press.</ref> [[Coleman Hawkins]]' famous interpretation of [[Body and Soul (1930 song)|\u201cBody and Soul\u201d]] shows a similar approach. \u201cOn 11 October 1939, Coleman Hawkins went into New York's RCA studios with an eight-piece band to record the 1930 composition Body and Soul. It was already a favourite among jazz musicians, but nobody had ever played it like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOX0eA-NlZ0 this]. Pianist Gene Rodgers plays a straight four-bar introduction before Hawkins swoops in, soloing for three minutes without playing a single note of the tune, gliding over the chord changes with such harmonic logic that he ends up inventing [[bebop]].\" <ref>Lewis, J. (2011) \u201cColeman Hawkins records Body and Soul: Number 14 in our series of the 50 key events in the history of jazz music.\u201d Guardian, 17 June.</ref>\n\nImprovisation by means of spontaneous variations, ornaments, embellishments and/or alterations to a melody is the basis of most sub-Saharan African music (traditional and pop) extending from melody and [[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony|harmony]] to form and rhythmic embellishments.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Music}}\n*[[Composer tributes (classical music)]]\n*[[Developing variation]]\n*[[Inversion (music)|Inversion]]\n*[[Matrix (music)]]\n*[[Strophic form]]\n*[[Traditional sub-Saharan African harmony]]\n*[[Tune-family]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Austin, William. 1966.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions.

When stereotypical representations are taken as factual information, they contribute to the development of cultural biases and prejudices, (clearly a contradiction to the educational mission of the University.)

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \"noble savage\" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).

Many have made the argument that Native American mascots focus on bravery, courage and fighting skills rather than anything derogatory. Karl Swanson, then vice-president of the Washington Redskins professional football team, declared in the magazine ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that his team's name \"symbolizes courage, dignity, and leadership\", and that the \"Redskins symbolize the greatness and strength of a grand people\".<ref name=\"bar\">{{cite journal| last=Emert| first=Phyllis Raybin| year=2003| url=http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| title=Native American Mascots: Racial Slur or Cherished Tradition?| journal=Respect (Newsletter)| publisher=New Jersey State Bar Foundation| volume=2| issue=2 (Winter 2003)|  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103052217/http://www.njsbf.org/images/content/1/1/11134/Respect%20Winter%202003.pdf| archivedate=2011-01-03| df=}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many note that the behavior of fans at games is not respectful. [[Richard Lapchick]], director emeritus of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, in an article: \"Could you imagine people mocking African Americans in [[Blackface|black face]] at a game?

Salamanca may be unique in having a mixed but not fully integrated community, with the Warrior identity combining elements negotiated between the Seneca and non-Seneca population.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a \"red\" identifier while retaining the Braves \"Indian Head\" logo.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process.

Government forces have broken up migrant caravans heading through Mexico to the U.S.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/americas/migrant-caravan-mexico.html \u201cMexico Stops Migrant Caravan, Pleasing the White House\u201d New York Times 2020/01/24.] accessed 12 March 2020</ref>  At the northern border, Mexico is now the stopping point for migrants sent back to Mexico by U.S. immigration authorities awaiting adjudication of their claims for asylum.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/opinion/international-world/mexico-migrants.html Jorge Ramos. \"Trump Got his Wish: Mexico is the Now the Wall.\" New York Times Op-Ed, 2020/02/07] accessed 13 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Crime and the drug war===\nRates of crime remain high in Mexico and conflict and violence of drug mafias has not been stemmed.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/americas/mexico-drug-war-death-toll.html \"A New Toll in Mexico's Drug War\" New York Times 2020/01/06] accessed 13 March 2020</ref> The number of murders nationwide in 2019 was over 34,000. Although the rate of women\u2019s murders is only about 10% of that number, [[femicide]] (murders of women specifically because they are women), has risen and has resulted in major demonstrations in early 2020.  \n\nAMLO had initially backed away from the policy of taking out mafia heads.  A high-profile situation developed in [[Sinaloa]] in October 2019 when the son of imprisoned drug mafia head \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n was captured by a small government force. The mafia responded there with a shootout on the [[Culiac\u00e1n]] city streets, resulting in the government freeing Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/10/24/lessons-from-a-shootout-in-sinaloa \u201cThe AMLO Doctrine: Lessons from a Shootout in Sinaloa\u201d.

Its largest trading partner, the U.S., is expected to be in recession or depression due to the pandemic, which will have an impact on Mexico.  In 2009, Mexico's economy shrank as it dealt with the swine flu epidemic.  The coronavirus pandemic is expected to be worse, but as of now, the government has been slow to act, even as the peso has fallen to historic low levels.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-19/as-mexican-peso-collapses-over-coronavirus-threat-criticism-falls-on-president-lopez-obrador \"As Mexican peso collapses over coronavirus threat, criticism falls on president Lopez Obrador\" Los Angeles Times 2020/03/20] accessed 20 March 2020</ref>\n\nThe trade deal with the U.S. and Canada is on hold as of March 2020, pending Canada signing it.

The president has continued to hold rallies, be tactile with crowds, and downplay the threat of coronavirus to Mexicans' health and to the Mexican economy.  When COVID-19 arrived in Mexico, the government has taken few steps to ramp up preparedness. The healthcare system is undergoing reforms to  lessen the possibility of corruption and to shift the existing insurance system to a universal one.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-19/as-mexican-peso-collapses-over-coronavirus-threat-criticism-falls-on-president-lopez-obrador \"As Mexican peso collapses over coronavirus threat, criticism falls on president Lopez Obrador\" Los Angeles Times 2020/03/20] accessed 20 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Immigration and U.S. pressure===\nThe Trump administration in the U.S. has continued to press for building a wall on Mexico\u2019s northern border, but it has also implemented measures attempting to stem the flow of migrants from Central America and other regions of the world.  Although AMLO expressed sympathy with migrants during his campaign, since taking office his stance has changed. When the number of migrants surged, the U.S. pressured his government with trade sanctions, and he has hardened the southern border. Government forces have broken up migrant caravans heading through Mexico to the U.S.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/world/americas/migrant-caravan-mexico.html \u201cMexico Stops Migrant Caravan, Pleasing the White House\u201d New York Times 2020/01/24.] accessed 12 March 2020</ref>  At the northern border, Mexico is now the stopping point for migrants sent back to Mexico by U.S. immigration authorities awaiting adjudication of their claims for asylum.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/opinion/international-world/mexico-migrants.html Jorge Ramos. \"Trump Got his Wish: Mexico is the Now the Wall.\" New York Times Op-Ed, 2020/02/07] accessed 13 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Crime and the drug war===\nRates of crime remain high in Mexico and conflict and violence of drug mafias has not been stemmed.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/world/americas/mexico-drug-war-death-toll.html \"A New Toll in Mexico's Drug War\" New York Times 2020/01/06] accessed 13 March 2020</ref> The number of murders nationwide in 2019 was over 34,000. Although the rate of women\u2019s murders is only about 10% of that number, [[femicide]] (murders of women specifically because they are women), has risen and has resulted in major demonstrations in early 2020.  \n\nAMLO had initially backed away from the policy of taking out mafia heads.  A high-profile situation developed in [[Sinaloa]] in October 2019 when the son of imprisoned drug mafia head \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n was captured by a small government force.
