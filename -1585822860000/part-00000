He was born in [[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]], [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]], Spain in 1474. Though little is known about his family, he was of noble birth and served in the Spanish military from a young age. He first came to the Americas as a \"gentleman volunteer\" with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s second expedition in 1493.\n\nBy the early 1500s, Ponce de Le\u00f3n was a top military official in the colonial government of [[Hispaniola]], where he helped crush a rebellion of the native [[Ta\u00edno]] people. He was authorized to explore the neighboring island of [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508 and for serving as the first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] by appointment of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] in 1509. While Ponce de Le\u00f3n grew quite wealthy from his plantations and mines, he faced an ongoing legal conflict with [[Diego Columbus]], the late Christopher Columbus's son, over the right to govern Puerto Rico. After a long court battle, Columbus replaced Ponce de Le\u00f3n as governor in 1511. Ponce de Le\u00f3n decided to follow the advice of the sympathetic [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and explore more of the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nIn 1513, Ponce de Le\u00f3n led the first known European expedition to [[Spanish Florida|La Florida]], which he named during his first voyage to the area. He landed somewhere along Florida's east coast, then charted the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast down to the [[Florida Keys]] and north along the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] coast, perhaps as far as [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]]. Though in popular culture he was supposedly searching for the [[Fountain of Youth]], there is no contemporary evidence to support the story, which all modern historians call a myth.<ref name=history_com>{{cite news|last1=Greenspan|first1=Jesse|title=The Myth of Ponce de Le\u00f3n and the Fountain of Youth|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-myth-of-ponce-de-leon-and-the-fountain-of-youth|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=History|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC.|date=2 April 2013|ref=history_com}}</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n returned to Spain in 1514 and was knighted by King Ferdinand, who also re-instated him as the governor of Puerto Rico and authorized him to settle Florida. He returned to the Caribbean in 1515, but plans to organize an expedition to Florida were delayed by the death of King Ferdinand in 1516, after which Ponce de Le\u00f3n again traveled to Spain to defend his grants and titles. He would not return to Puerto Rico for two years.\n\nIn 1521, Ponce de Le\u00f3n finally returned to [[southwest Florida]] with the first large-scale attempt to establish a Spanish colony in what is now the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. However, the native [[Calusa]] people fiercely resisted the incursion, and he was seriously wounded in a skirmish. The colonization attempt was abandoned, and its leader died from his wounds soon after returning to Cuba. Ponce de Le\u00f3n was [[interred]] in [[Puerto Rico]], and his tomb is located inside of the [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]] in San Juan.\nAccording to John J. Browne Ayes, 30% of the modern population of [[Puerto Rico]] descend from Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n and his wife.<ref>John J. Browne Ayes, \"Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, the new and revised genealogy\",2012 (take into account that, even though this book is backed by 15 years of research with documents and DNA, and is detailed, the author is not a geneticist)</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nJuan Ponce de Le\u00f3n was born in the village of [[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]] in the northern part of what is now the Spanish [[Provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]. Although early historians placed his birth in 1460, and this date has been used traditionally, more recent evidence shows he was likely born in 1474.<ref>Morison 1974, p. 502, 529.</ref> The surname Ponce de Le\u00f3n dates from the 13th century. The Ponce de Le\u00f3n lineage began with [[Ponce Vela de Cabrera|Ponce V\u00e9laz de Cabrera]], descendant of count [[Bermudo N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], and [[Sancha Ponce de Cabrera]],{{Sfn|Torres Sevilla-Qui\u00f1ones de Le\u00f3n|1999|p=188}} daughter of [[Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera]]. Before October 1235, a son of Ponce Vela de Cabrera and his wife Teresa Rodr\u00edguez Gir\u00f3n named [[Pedro Ponce de Cabrera]]{{Sfn|Torres Sevilla-Qui\u00f1ones de Le\u00f3n|1999|p=191}} married [[Aldonza Alfonso]], an illegitimate daughter of King [[Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n]].{{Sfn|Torres Sevilla-Qui\u00f1ones de Le\u00f3n|1999|p=191}} The descendants of this marriage added the \"de Le\u00f3n\" to their patronymic and were known henceforth as the Ponce de Le\u00f3n.\n\nThe identity of his parents is still unknown, but he appears to have been a member of a distinguished and influential noble family. His relatives included [[Rodrigo Ponce de Le\u00f3n, Marquis of C\u00e1diz]], a celebrated figure in the [[Moors|Moorish]] wars.<ref>Arnade, pp. 35\u201344</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n was related to another notable family, the N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Guzm\u00e1ns, and as a young man he served as squire to Pedro N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Guzm\u00e1n, Knight Commander of the [[Order of Calatrava]].<ref name=VMidd2008>Van Middeldyk, p. 11</ref> A contemporary chronicler, [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]], states that Ponce de Le\u00f3n gained his experience as a soldier fighting in the Spanish campaigns that defeated the Moors in [[Emirate of Granada|Granada]] and [[Battle of Granada|completed]] the [[reconquista|re-conquest]] of Spain in 1492.<ref>Morison 1974, p. 502</ref>\nHe married a distant relative of his, Leonor Ponce de Le\u00f3n, with whom he would form the first European family living in Puerto Rico.\n\n==Arrival in the New World==\nOnce [[Granada War|the war]] against the [[Emirate of Granada]] [[Battle of Granada|ended]], there was no apparent need for his military services at home, so, like many of his contemporaries, Ponce de Le\u00f3n looked abroad for his next opportunity.<ref name=VMidd2008/> In September 1493, some 1,200 sailors, colonists, and soldiers joined [[Christopher Columbus]] for his [[Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|second voyage]] to the New World.<ref name=Kessel2003>{{cite book|title=Spain in the Southwest: A Narrative History of Colonial New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and California |series=University of Oklahoma Press|first=John|last=L.

Thus, Ovando authorized the [[Jaragua massacre]] in November 1503. In 1504, when Tainos overran a small Spanish garrison in [[Hig\u00fcey (city)|Hig\u00fcey]] on the island's eastern side, Ovando assigned Ponce de Le\u00f3n to crush the rebellion.<ref name=\"Marley2008\" /> Ponce de Le\u00f3n was actively involved in the Hig\u00fcey massacre, about which friar [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] attempted to notify Spanish authorities. Ovando rewarded his victorious commander by appointing him frontier governor of the newly conquered province, then named [[La Altagracia Province|Hig\u00fcey]] also. Ponce de Le\u00f3n received a substantial land grant which authorized sufficient Indian slave labor to farm his new estate.<ref>Fuson, pp. 63\u201365.</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n prospered in this new role. He found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby [[Boca de Yuma]] where Spanish ships stocked supplies before the long voyage back to Spain. In 1505 Ovando authorized Ponce de Le\u00f3n to establish a new town in Hig\u00fcey, which he named [[Salvale\u00f3n de Hig\u00fcey|Salvale\u00f3n]]. In 1508 King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] (Queen Isabella having opposed the exploitation of natives but dying in 1504) authorized Ponce de Le\u00f3n to conquer the remaining Ta\u00ednos and exploit them in gold mining.<ref name=\"The Tainos\">{{cite book|title=The Tainos- Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus pg. 155|series=Yale University Press|first=Irving|last=Rouse|isbn=0-300-05181-6|url=https://archive.org/details/tainosrisedeclin00rous|publisher=New Haven : Yale University Press|year=1992}}</ref>\n\nAround this time, Ponce de Le\u00f3n married Leonora, an innkeeper's daughter. They had three daughters (Juana, Isabel and Maria) and one son (Luis). The large stone house Ponce de Le\u00f3n ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of Salvale\u00f3n de Hig\u00fcey.<ref>Fuson, pp. 66\u201367.</ref>\n\n==Puerto Rico==\n[[Image:Ponce de Leon house.JPG|left|thumb|Ruins of Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n's residence at [[Caparra Archaeological Site|Caparra]]]]\nAs provincial governor, Ponce de Le\u00f3n had occasion to meet with the [[Ta\u00ednos]] who visited his province from neighboring [[Puerto Rico]]. They told him stories of a fertile land with much gold to be found in the many rivers. Inspired by the possibility of riches, Ponce de Le\u00f3n requested and received permission from [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando|Ovando]] to explore the island.<ref>Van Middeldyk, pp. 17\u201319.</ref>\n\nHis first reconnaissance of the island is usually dated to 1508 but there is evidence that he had made a previous exploration as early as 1506. This earlier trip was done quietly because the Spanish crown had commissioned [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] to settle the island in 1505. Pinz\u00f3n did not fulfill his commission and it expired in 1507, leaving the way clear for Ponce de Le\u00f3n.<ref>Fuson, pp. 72\u201375</ref>\n\nHis earlier exploration had confirmed the presence of gold and gave him a good understanding of the geography of the island. In 1508, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] gave permission to Ponce de Le\u00f3n for the first ''official'' expedition to the island, which the Spanish then called San Juan Bautista. This expedition, consisting of about 50 men in one ship, left Hispaniola on 12 July, 1508 and eventually anchored in [[San Juan Bay]], near today's city of San Juan.<ref>Marley 2008, pp. 12\u201313</ref> Ponce de Le\u00f3n searched inland until he found a suitable site about two miles from the bay. Here he erected a storehouse and a fortified house, creating the first settlement in Puerto Rico, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico#History|Caparra]].<ref>Lawson, p. 3.</ref> Although a few crops were planted, the settlers spent most of their time and energy searching for [[gold]]. By early 1509 Ponce de Le\u00f3n decided to return to Hispaniola. His expedition had collected a good quantity of the precious metal but was running low on food and supplies.<ref>Fuson, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nThe expedition was deemed a great success and Ovando appointed Ponce de Le\u00f3n governor of San Juan Bautista. This appointment was later confirmed by Ferdinand II on 14 August, 1509. He was instructed to extend the settlement of the island and continue mining for gold. The new governor returned to the island as instructed, bringing with him his wife and children.<ref>Lawson, pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nBack on his island, Ponce de Le\u00f3n parceled out the native Ta\u00ednos amongst himself and other settlers using a system of forced labor known as [[encomienda]].<ref>Van Middeldyk, pp. 27\u201329</ref> The Indians were put to work growing food crops and mining for gold.  Many of the [[Spaniards]] treated the Ta\u00ednos very harshly and newly introduced diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]] took a severe toll on the local population. By June 1511 the Ta\u00ednos were pushed to a short-lived rebellion, which was forcibly put down by Ponce de Le\u00f3n and a small force of troops armed with [[crossbow]]s and [[arquebus]]es.<ref>Van Middeldyk, pp. 36\u201341</ref><ref name=\"Floyd\">{{cite book|last1=Floyd|first1=Troy|title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492\u20131526|date=1973|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=135}}</ref>\n\nEven as Ponce de Le\u00f3n was settling the island of San Juan, significant changes were taking place in the politics and government of the [[Spanish West Indies]]. On 10 July, 1509, [[Diego Col\u00f3n]], the son of [[Christopher Columbus]], arrived in Hispaniola as acting [[Viceroy#Spanish Empire|Viceroy]], replacing Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando.<ref>Lawson, p. 4</ref> For several years Diego Col\u00f3n had been waging a legal battle over his rights to inherit the titles and privileges granted to his father. The Crown regretted the sweeping powers that had been granted to Columbus and his heirs and sought to establish more direct control in the New World. In spite of the Crown's opposition, Col\u00f3n prevailed in court and Ferdinand was required to appoint him Viceroy.<ref>Kessel 2003, p. 10</ref>\nAlthough the courts had ordered that Ponce de Le\u00f3n should remain in office, Col\u00f3n circumvented this directive on 28 October, 1509 by appointing Juan Ceron chief justice and Miguel Diaz chief constable of the island, effectively overriding the authority of the governor.<ref name=VMidd08/> This situation prevailed until 2 March, 1510, when Ferdinand issued orders reaffirming Ponce de Le\u00f3n's position as governor. Ponce de Le\u00f3n then had Ceron and Diaz arrested and sent back to Spain.<ref name=VMidd08>Van Middeldyk, p. 18</ref>\n\nThe political struggle between Col\u00f3n and Ponce de Le\u00f3n continued in this manner for the next few years. Ponce de Le\u00f3n had influential supporters in Spain and Ferdinand regarded him as a loyal servant. However, Col\u00f3n's position as Viceroy made him a powerful opponent and eventually it became clear that Ponce de Le\u00f3n's position on San Juan was not tenable.<ref>Lawson, pp. 5\u20137</ref> Finally, on 28 November, 1511, Ceron returned from Spain and was officially reinstated as governor.<ref>Fuson, p. 95.</ref>\n\n==First voyage to Florida==\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas|boxwidth=100px}}\nRumors of undiscovered islands to the northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511, and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] was interested in forestalling further exploration and discovery by Col\u00f3n. In an effort to reward Ponce de Le\u00f3n for his services, Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands outside the authority of Col\u00f3n. Ponce de Le\u00f3n readily agreed to a new venture, and in February 1512 a royal contract was dispatched outlining his rights and authorities to search for \"the Islands of Benimy\".<ref>Fuson, pp. 88\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe contract stipulated that Ponce de Le\u00f3n held exclusive rights to the discovery of Benimy and neighboring islands for the next three years. He would be governor for life of any lands he discovered, but he was expected to finance for himself all costs of exploration and settlement. In addition, the contract gave specific instructions for the distribution of gold, Native Americans, and other profits extracted from the new lands. Notably, there was no mention of a rejuvenating fountain.<ref>Weddle, p. 40.</ref><ref>See contract translated by Fuson, pp. 92\u201395 or Lawson, pp. 84\u201388.</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n equipped three ships with at least 200 men at his own expense and set out from Puerto Rico on 4 March, 1513. The only near contemporary description known for this expedition comes from [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]], a Spanish historian who apparently had access to the original ships' logs or related secondary sources from which he created a summary of the voyage published in 1601.<ref>Fuson, pp. 99\u2013103 and Weddle, p. 51.</ref><ref>See Fuson, pp. 103\u2013115 for complete Herrera account.</ref> The brevity of the account and occasional gaps in the record have led historians to speculate and dispute many details of the voyage.\n\nThe three ships in this small fleet were the ''Santiago'', the ''San Cristobal'' and the ''Santa Maria de la Consolacion''. Anton de Alaminos was their chief pilot. He was already an experienced sailor, and would become one of the most respected pilots in the region. After leaving Puerto Rico, they sailed northwest along the great chain of Bahama Islands, known then as the Lucayos. On 27 March, Easter Sunday, they sighted an island that was unfamiliar to the sailors on the expedition. Because many Spanish seamen were acquainted with the Bahamas, which had been depopulated by slaving ventures, some scholars believe that this \"island\" was actually Florida, as it was thought to be an island for several years after its formal discovery.<ref name=\"Turner 2012, p. 5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturallylaflorida.org/papers/Turner_CaribbeanWorld.pdf|title=Turner 2012, p. 5|publisher=}}</ref> Other scholars have speculated that this island was one of the northern Bahama islands, perhaps [[Great Abaco]].<ref>Weddle, p. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nFor the next several days the fleet crossed open water until [[Timeline of Florida History|2 April, 1513]], when they sighted land which Ponce de Le\u00f3n believed was another island. He named it ''[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]'' in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the [[Easter]] season, which the Spaniards called ''[[Pascua Florida]]'' (Festival of Flowers).

On 8 April they encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards and forced them to seek anchorage. The tiniest ship, the ''San Cristobal'', was carried out of sight and lost for two days. This was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] where it reaches maximum force between the Florida coast and the Bahamas. Because of the powerful boost provided by the current, it would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.<ref name=\"Weddle, p. 42\">Weddle, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThey continued down the coast hugging the shore to avoid the strong head current. By 4 May the fleet reached and named [[Biscayne Bay]] and took on water at an island they named Santa Marta (now [[Key Biscayne]]) and explored the Tequesta Miami mound town at the mouth of the Miami River. The [[Tequesta]] did not engage the Spanish, they evacuated into the coastal woodlands. On 15 May they left Biscayne Bay and sailed along the [[Florida Keys]], looking for a passage to head north and explore the west coast of the Florida peninsula. From a distance the Keys reminded Ponce de Le\u00f3n of men who were suffering, so he named them ''Los Martires'' (the Martyrs).<ref name=\"Weddle, p. 42\"/> Eventually they found a gap in the reefs and sailed \"to the north and other times to the northeast\" until they reached the Florida mainland on 23 May, where they encountered the [[Calusa]], who refused to trade and drove off the Spanish ships by surrounding them with warriors in sea canoes armed with long bows.<ref>Weddle, pp. 43\u201344.</ref><ref>Douglas, The Everglades, River of Grass.</ref>\n\n[[File:PR-Statue of Juan Ponce de Leon.jpg|thumb|upright|Back of Ponce de Le\u00f3n's statue in the [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico|Old San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] The statue was made in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1882 using the bronze from English cannons seized after the [[Battle of San Juan (1797)|English attacked San Juan in 1797]].<ref>[http://www.lmsj.org/sitios.htm San Juan municipality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902090750/http://lmsj.org/sitios.htm |date=2 September 2010 }}</ref>]]\nAgain, the exact site of their landfall is controversial.  The vicinity of [[Charlotte Harbor, Florida|Charlotte Harbor]] is the most commonly identified spot, while some assert a landing further north at [[Tampa Bay]] or even [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].<ref name=Allen97>Allen, pp.215\u2013216.</ref> Other historians have argued the distances were too great to cover in the available time and the more likely location was [[Cape Romano]] or [[Cape Sable]].<ref name=Allen97/> Here Ponce de Le\u00f3n anchored for several days to take on water and repair the ships. They were approached by [[Calusa]], who might have been initially interested in trading but relations soon turned hostile. Several skirmishes followed with casualties on both sides and the Spaniards took eight Indians captive,<ref>Weddle, pp. 43\u201345.</ref> including one to become a translator.<ref name=\"Marley2008\" /> On 4 June, there was another encounter with natives near [[Sanibel Island]] and the Calusa in war canoes, with the Spanish sinking a fourth of them. An unsubstantiated claim to justify Spanish retreat.<ref>Marley2008, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 14 June they set sail again looking for a chain of islands in the west that had been described by their captives. They reached the [[Dry Tortugas]] on 21 June.<ref name=\"Marley2008\" /> There they captured giant [[sea turtle]]s, [[Caribbean monk seal]]s, and thousands of [[seabird]]s. From these islands they sailed southwest in an apparent attempt to circle around Cuba and return home to Puerto Rico. Failing to take into account the powerful currents pushing them eastward, they struck the northeast shore of Cuba and were initially confused about their location.<ref>Weddle, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOnce they regained their bearings, the fleet retraced their route east along the Florida Keys and around the Florida peninsula, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on 8 July. They were surprised to come across another Spanish ship, piloted by [[Diego Miruelo]], who was either on a slaving voyage or had been sent by [[Diego Col\u00f3n]] to spy on Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Shortly thereafter Miruelo's ship was wrecked in a storm and Ponce de Le\u00f3n rescued the stranded crew.\n\nFrom here the little fleet disbanded. Ponce de Le\u00f3n tasked the ''Santa Maria'' with further exploration while he returned home with the rest of crew. Ponce de Le\u00f3n reached Puerto Rico on 19 October after having been away for almost eight months. The other ship, after further explorations returned safely on 20 February, 1514.<ref>Weddle, pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nAlthough Ponce de Le\u00f3n is widely credited with the discovery of Florida, he almost certainly was not the first European to reach the peninsula. Spanish slave expeditions had been regularly raiding the Bahamas since 1494 and there is some evidence that one or more of these slavers made it as far as the shores of Florida.<ref>Fuson, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\nAnother piece of evidence that others came before Ponce de Le\u00f3n is the [[Cantino planisphere|Cantino Map]] from 1502, which shows a peninsula near Cuba that looks like Florida's and includes characteristic place names.\n\n===Fountain of Youth===\n\n{{main|Fountain of Youth}}\n\n[[Image:Bahamian Love Vine.JPG|left|thumb|Bahamian love vine (''[[Cassytha filiformis]]''), Bahamas]]\nAccording to a popular legend, Ponce de Le\u00f3n discovered Florida while searching for the Fountain of Youth. Though stories of vitality-restoring waters were known on both sides of the Atlantic long before Ponce de Le\u00f3n, the story of his searching for them was not attached to him until after his death. In his ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]] wrote that Ponce de Le\u00f3n was looking for the waters of [[Bimini]] to cure his aging.<ref>Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.</ref> A similar account appears in [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.<ref>Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara. ''Historia General de las Indias'', second part.</ref> Then in 1575, [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], a shipwreck survivor who had lived with the Native Americans of Florida for 17 years, published his memoir in which he locates the waters in Florida, and says that Ponce de Le\u00f3n was supposed to have looked for them there.<ref>[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html \"Fontaneda's Memoir\"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved 28 March 2007.</ref> Though Fontaneda doubted that Ponce de Le\u00f3n had really gone to Florida looking for the waters, the account was included in the ''Historia general de los hechos de los castellanos'' of [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]] of 1615. Most historians hold that the search for [[gold]] and the expansion of the [[Spanish Empire]] were far more imperative than any potential search for such a fountain.<ref name=\"Douglas\">{{cite book|author=Douglas, Marjory Stoneman|year=1947|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sPjDLXqemQ0C&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=Did+Juan+Ponce+de+Le%C3%B3n+actually+land+in+Florida%3F|title=The Everglades: River of Grass|publisher=Pineapple Press|accessdate=30 March 2008|isbn=9781561641352}}</ref><ref name=\"Sauer1975\">{{cite book|author=Carl Ortwin Sauer|title=Sixteenth Century North America: The Land and the People as Seen by the Europeans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWXU6sjN9ZUC&pg=PA26|date=1 January 1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02777-0|page=26}}</ref><!-- Although many believe that his main reason for going to the New World was to discover the Fountain of Youth, it is not.  His main reason for traveling there was to find gold, and the Fountain was a secondary goal and it was not imperative to find it. -- Although this is likely more or less true, it needs to have a source. -->\n\nThere is a possibility that the Fountain of Youth was an allegory for the [[Cassytha filiformis|Bahamian love vine]], which locals brew today as an aphrodisiac.  Ponce de Le\u00f3n could have been seeking it as a potential entrepreneurial venture.  [[Woodrow Wilson]] believed Indian servants brewing a \"brown tea\" in [[Puerto Rico]] may have inspired Ponce de Le\u00f3n's search for the Fountain of Youth.<ref>Woodrow Wilson, \"History of the American People, New York and Amsterdam: Harper and Brothers, 1917, Vol 1, p. 13</ref>  Arne Molander has speculated that the adventurous conquistador mistook the natives' \"vid\" (vine) for \"vida\" (life) \u2013 transforming their \"fountain vine\" into an imagined \"fountain of life\".\n\n==Between voyages==\nUpon his return to Puerto Rico, Ponce de Le\u00f3n found the island in turmoil. A party of [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] from a neighboring island had attacked the settlement of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico#History|Caparra]], killed several Spaniards and burned it to the ground.  Ponce de Le\u00f3n's own [[Caparra Archaeological Site|house]] was destroyed and his family narrowly escaped. [[Diego Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n]] used the attack as a pretext for renewing hostilities against the local [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribes. The explorer suspected that Col\u00f3n was working to further undermine his position on the island and perhaps even to take his claims for the newly discovered Florida.<ref>Fuson, p. 121\u2013124.</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n decided he should return to Spain and personally report the results of his recent expedition. He left Puerto Rico in April 1514 and was warmly received by Ferdinand when he arrived at court in [[Valladolid]]. There he was knighted,<ref name=\"Marley2008\" /> and given a personal [[coat of arms]], becoming the first conquistador to receive these honors. He also visited [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]] in [[Seville]], which was the central bureaucracy and clearinghouse for all of Spain's activities in the New World. The Casa took detailed notes of his discoveries and added them to the [[Padr\u00f3n Real]], a master map which served as the basis for official navigation charts provided to Spanish captains and pilots.<ref>Fuson, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nDuring his stay in Spain, a new contract<ref>See Fuson, pp. 129\u2013131 for complete translation.</ref> was drawn up for Ponce de Le\u00f3n confirming his rights to settle and govern [[Bimini]] and Florida,<ref name=\"Shepherd1907\">{{cite book|author=William Robert Shepherd|title=Guide to the Materials for the History of the United States in Spanish Archives|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetomaterial01shepgoog|year=1907|publisher=Carnegie institution of Washington|page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetomaterial01shepgoog/page/n76 68]}}</ref> which was then presumed to be an island. In addition to the usual directions for sharing gold and other valuables with the king, the contract was one of the first to stipulate that the [[Requerimiento]] was to be read to the inhabitants of the islands prior to their conquest.  Ponce de Le\u00f3n was also ordered to organize an armada for the purpose of attacking and subduing the Caribs, who continued to attack Spanish settlements in the Caribbean.<ref>Fuson, pp. 128\u2013132.</ref>\n[[File:Tomb of Ponce de Leon.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of Ponce de Le\u00f3n in [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]\nThree ships were purchased for his armada and after repairs and provisioning Ponce de Le\u00f3n left Spain on 14 May, 1515 with his little fleet. The record of his activities against the Caribs is vague. There was one engagement in [[Guadeloupe]] on his return to the area and possibly two or three other encounters.<ref>Fuson, pp. 136\u2013138.</ref> The campaign came to an abrupt end in 1516 when Ferdinand died. The king had been a strong supporter and Ponce de Le\u00f3n felt it was imperative he return to Spain and defend his privileges and titles. He did receive assurances of support from Cardinal [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]], the regent appointed to govern Castile, but it was nearly two years before he was able to return home to Puerto Rico.\n\nMeanwhile, there had been at least two unauthorized voyages to \"his\" Florida both ending in repulsion by the native Calusa Tequesta warriors. Ponce de Le\u00f3n realized he had to act soon if he was to maintain his claim.\n\n==Last voyage to Florida==\nIn early 1521, Ponce de Le\u00f3n organized a colonizing expedition consisting of some 200 men, including priests, farmers and artisans, 50 horses and other domestic animals, and farming implements carried on two ships. The expedition landed somewhere on the coast of [[southwest Florida]], likely in the vicinity of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] or the [[Caloosahatchee River]], areas which Ponce de Le\u00f3n had visited in his earlier voyage to Florida.\n\nBefore the settlement could be established, the colonists were attacked by the [[Calusa]], the [[Indigenous peoples of Florida|indigenous]] people who dominated southern Florida and whose principal town was nearby. Ponce de Le\u00f3n was mortally wounded in the skirmish when, historians believe, an arrow [[Arrow poison|poisoned]] with the [[sap]] of the [[manchineel tree]] struck his thigh.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Swamp |first=Michael |last=Grunwald |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7432-5107-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olHjhlx0Em8C&pg=PA25 |page=25}}</ref> The expedition immediately abandoned the colonization attempt and sailed to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], where Ponce de Le\u00f3n soon died of his wounds. He was buried in [[Puerto Rico]], in the crypt of [[San Jos\u00e9 Church]] from 1559 to 1836, when his remains were exhumed and transferred to the [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]].<ref>Fuson, pp. 173\u2013176.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*The [[World War II]] [[Liberty Ship]] {{SS|Ponce De Leon}} was named in his honor.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico}}\n* [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n II]]\n* [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n y Loayza]]\n* [[Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 (The Great Sun)]]\n* [[Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II]]\n* [[Hayuya]]\n* [[Jumacao]]\n* [[Discoverer of the Americas]]\n* [[Tequesta]]\n* [[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|viaf=27867698}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Allen, John Logan (1997).

He was born in [[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]], [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]], Spain in 1474. Though little is known about his family, he was of noble birth and served in the Spanish military from a young age. He first came to the Americas as a \"gentleman volunteer\" with [[Christopher Columbus]]'s second expedition in 1493.\n\nBy the early 1500s, Ponce de Le\u00f3n was a top military official in the colonial government of [[Hispaniola]], where he helped crush a rebellion of the native [[Ta\u00edno]] people. He was authorized to explore the neighboring island of [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508 and for serving as the first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] by appointment of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] in 1509. While Ponce de Le\u00f3n grew quite wealthy from his plantations and mines, he faced an ongoing legal conflict with [[Diego Columbus]], the late Christopher Columbus's son, over the right to govern Puerto Rico. After a long court battle, Columbus replaced Ponce de Le\u00f3n as governor in 1511. Ponce de Le\u00f3n decided to follow the advice of the sympathetic [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] and explore more of the [[Caribbean Sea]].\n\nIn 1513, Ponce de Le\u00f3n led the first known European expedition to [[Spanish Florida|La Florida]], which he named during his first voyage to the area. He landed somewhere along Florida's east coast, then charted the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast down to the [[Florida Keys]] and north along the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf]] coast, perhaps as far as [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]]. Though in popular culture he was supposedly searching for the [[Fountain of Youth]], there is no contemporary evidence to support the story, which all modern historians call a myth.<ref name=history_com>{{cite news|last1=Greenspan|first1=Jesse|title=The Myth of Ponce de Le\u00f3n and the Fountain of Youth|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-myth-of-ponce-de-leon-and-the-fountain-of-youth|accessdate=10 November 2015|work=History|publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC.|date=2 April 2013|ref=history_com}}</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n returned to Spain in 1514 and was knighted by King Ferdinand, who also re-instated him as the governor of Puerto Rico and authorized him to settle Florida. He returned to the Caribbean in 1515, but plans to organize an expedition to Florida were delayed by the death of King Ferdinand in 1516, after which Ponce de Le\u00f3n again traveled to Spain to defend his grants and titles. He would not return to Puerto Rico for two years.\n\nIn 1521, Ponce de Le\u00f3n finally returned to [[southwest Florida]] with the first large-scale attempt to establish a Spanish colony in what is now the [[Contiguous United States|continental United States]]. However, the native [[Calusa]] people fiercely resisted the incursion, and he was seriously wounded in a skirmish. The colonization attempt was abandoned, and its leader died from his wounds soon after returning to Cuba. Ponce de Le\u00f3n was [[interred]] in [[Puerto Rico]], and his tomb is located inside of the [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]] in San Juan.\nAccording to John J. Browne Ayes, 30% of the modern population of [[Puerto Rico]] descend from Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n and his wife.<ref>John J. Browne Ayes, \"Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, the new and revised genealogy\",2012 (take into account that, even though this book is backed by 15 years of research with documents and DNA, and is detailed, the author is not a geneticist)</ref>\n\n==Spain==\nJuan Ponce de Le\u00f3n was born in the village of [[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]] in the northern part of what is now the Spanish [[Provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]].

They told him stories of a fertile land with much gold to be found in the many rivers. Inspired by the possibility of riches, Ponce de Le\u00f3n requested and received permission from [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando|Ovando]] to explore the island.<ref>Van Middeldyk, pp. 17\u201319.</ref>\n\nHis first reconnaissance of the island is usually dated to 1508 but there is evidence that he had made a previous exploration as early as 1506. This earlier trip was done quietly because the Spanish crown had commissioned [[Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n]] to settle the island in 1505. Pinz\u00f3n did not fulfill his commission and it expired in 1507, leaving the way clear for Ponce de Le\u00f3n.<ref>Fuson, pp. 72\u201375</ref>\n\nHis earlier exploration had confirmed the presence of gold and gave him a good understanding of the geography of the island. In 1508, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] gave permission to Ponce de Le\u00f3n for the first ''official'' expedition to the island, which the Spanish then called San Juan Bautista. This expedition, consisting of about 50 men in one ship, left Hispaniola on July 12, 1508 and eventually anchored in [[San Juan Bay]], near today's city of San Juan.<ref>Marley 2008, pp. 12\u201313</ref> Ponce de Le\u00f3n searched inland until he found a suitable site about two miles from the bay. Here he erected a storehouse and a fortified house, creating the first settlement in Puerto Rico, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico#History|Caparra]].<ref>Lawson, p. 3.</ref> Although a few crops were planted, the settlers spent most of their time and energy searching for [[gold]]. By early 1509 Ponce de Le\u00f3n decided to return to Hispaniola. His expedition had collected a good quantity of the precious metal but was running low on food and supplies.<ref>Fuson, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nThe expedition was deemed a great success and Ovando appointed Ponce de Le\u00f3n governor of San Juan Bautista. This appointment was later confirmed by Ferdinand II on August 14, 1509. He was instructed to extend the settlement of the island and continue mining for gold. The new governor returned to the island as instructed, bringing with him his wife and children.<ref>Lawson, pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nBack on his island, Ponce de Le\u00f3n parceled out the native Ta\u00ednos amongst himself and other settlers using a system of forced labor known as [[encomienda]].<ref>Van Middeldyk, pp. 27\u201329</ref> The Indians were put to work growing food crops and mining for gold.  Many of the [[Spaniards]] treated the Ta\u00ednos very harshly and newly introduced diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]] took a severe toll on the local population. By June 1511 the Ta\u00ednos were pushed to a short-lived rebellion, which was forcibly put down by Ponce de Le\u00f3n and a small force of troops armed with [[crossbow]]s and [[arquebus]]es.<ref>Van Middeldyk, pp. 36\u201341</ref><ref name=\"Floyd\">{{cite book|last1=Floyd|first1=Troy|title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492\u20131526|date=1973|publisher=University of New Mexico Press|location=Albuquerque|pages=135}}</ref>\n\nEven as Ponce de Le\u00f3n was settling the island of San Juan, significant changes were taking place in the politics and government of the [[Spanish West Indies]]. On July 10, 1509, [[Diego Col\u00f3n]], the son of [[Christopher Columbus]], arrived in Hispaniola as acting [[Viceroy#Spanish Empire|Viceroy]], replacing Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando.<ref>Lawson, p. 4</ref> For several years Diego Col\u00f3n had been waging a legal battle over his rights to inherit the titles and privileges granted to his father. The Crown regretted the sweeping powers that had been granted to Columbus and his heirs and sought to establish more direct control in the New World. In spite of the Crown's opposition, Col\u00f3n prevailed in court and Ferdinand was required to appoint him Viceroy.<ref>Kessel 2003, p. 10</ref>\nAlthough the courts had ordered that Ponce de Le\u00f3n should remain in office, Col\u00f3n circumvented this directive on October 28, 1509 by appointing Juan Ceron chief justice and Miguel Diaz chief constable of the island, effectively overriding the authority of the governor.<ref name=VMidd08/> This situation prevailed until March 2, 1510, when Ferdinand issued orders reaffirming Ponce de Le\u00f3n's position as governor. Ponce de Le\u00f3n then had Ceron and Diaz arrested and sent back to Spain.<ref name=VMidd08>Van Middeldyk, p. 18</ref>\n\nThe political struggle between Col\u00f3n and Ponce de Le\u00f3n continued in this manner for the next few years. Ponce de Le\u00f3n had influential supporters in Spain and Ferdinand regarded him as a loyal servant. However, Col\u00f3n's position as Viceroy made him a powerful opponent and eventually it became clear that Ponce de Le\u00f3n's position on San Juan was not tenable.<ref>Lawson, pp. 5\u20137</ref> Finally, on November 28, 1511, Ceron returned from Spain and was officially reinstated as governor.<ref>Fuson, p. 95.</ref>\n\n==First voyage to Florida==\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas|boxwidth=100px}}\nRumors of undiscovered islands to the northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511, and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] was interested in forestalling further exploration and discovery by Col\u00f3n. In an effort to reward Ponce de Le\u00f3n for his services, Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands outside the authority of Col\u00f3n. Ponce de Le\u00f3n readily agreed to a new venture, and in February 1512 a royal contract was dispatched outlining his rights and authorities to search for \"the Islands of Benimy\".<ref>Fuson, pp. 88\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe contract stipulated that Ponce de Le\u00f3n held exclusive rights to the discovery of Benimy and neighboring islands for the next three years. He would be governor for life of any lands he discovered, but he was expected to finance for himself all costs of exploration and settlement. In addition, the contract gave specific instructions for the distribution of gold, Native Americans, and other profits extracted from the new lands. Notably, there was no mention of a rejuvenating fountain.<ref>Weddle, p. 40.</ref><ref>See contract translated by Fuson, pp. 92\u201395 or Lawson, pp. 84\u201388.</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n equipped three ships with at least 200 men at his own expense and set out from Puerto Rico on March 4, 1513. The only near contemporary description known for this expedition comes from [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]], a Spanish historian who apparently had access to the original ships' logs or related secondary sources from which he created a summary of the voyage published in 1601.<ref>Fuson, pp. 99\u2013103 and Weddle, p. 51.</ref><ref>See Fuson, pp. 103\u2013115 for complete Herrera account.</ref> The brevity of the account and occasional gaps in the record have led historians to speculate and dispute many details of the voyage.\n\nThe three ships in this small fleet were the ''Santiago'', the ''San Cristobal'' and the ''Santa Maria de la Consolacion''. Anton de Alaminos was their chief pilot. He was already an experienced sailor, and would become one of the most respected pilots in the region. After leaving Puerto Rico, they sailed northwest along the great chain of Bahama Islands, known then as the Lucayos. On March 27, Easter Sunday, they sighted an island that was unfamiliar to the sailors on the expedition. Because many Spanish seamen were acquainted with the Bahamas, which had been depopulated by slaving ventures, some scholars believe that this \"island\" was actually Florida, as it was thought to be an island for several years after its formal discovery.<ref name=\"Turner 2012, p. 5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culturallylaflorida.org/papers/Turner_CaribbeanWorld.pdf|title=Turner 2012, p. 5|publisher=}}</ref> Other scholars have speculated that this island was one of the northern Bahama islands, perhaps [[Great Abaco]].<ref>Weddle, p. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nFor the next several days the fleet crossed open water until [[Timeline of Florida History|April 2, 1513]], when they sighted land which Ponce de Le\u00f3n believed was another island. He named it ''[[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]'' in recognition of the verdant landscape and because it was the [[Easter]] season, which the Spaniards called ''[[Pascua Florida]]'' (Festival of Flowers).

On April 8 they encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards and forced them to seek anchorage. The tiniest ship, the ''San Cristobal'', was carried out of sight and lost for two days. This was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] where it reaches maximum force between the Florida coast and the Bahamas. Because of the powerful boost provided by the current, it would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.<ref name=\"Weddle, p. 42\">Weddle, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThey continued down the coast hugging the shore to avoid the strong head current. By May 4 the fleet reached and named [[Biscayne Bay]] and took on water at an island they named Santa Marta (now [[Key Biscayne]]) and explored the Tequesta Miami mound town at the mouth of the Miami River. The [[Tequesta]] did not engage the Spanish, they evacuated into the coastal woodlands. On May 15 they left Biscayne Bay and sailed along the [[Florida Keys]], looking for a passage to head north and explore the west coast of the Florida peninsula. From a distance the Keys reminded Ponce de Le\u00f3n of men who were suffering, so he named them ''Los Martires'' (the Martyrs).<ref name=\"Weddle, p. 42\"/> Eventually they found a gap in the reefs and sailed \"to the north and other times to the northeast\" until they reached the Florida mainland on May 23, where they encountered the [[Calusa]], who refused to trade and drove off the Spanish ships by surrounding them with warriors in sea canoes armed with long bows.<ref>Weddle, pp. 43\u201344.</ref><ref>Douglas, The Everglades, River of Grass.</ref>\n\n[[File:PR-Statue of Juan Ponce de Leon.jpg|thumb|upright|Back of Ponce de Le\u00f3n's statue in the [[Old San Juan, Puerto Rico|Old San Juan]], [[Puerto Rico]] The statue was made in [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1882 using the bronze from English cannons seized after the [[Battle of San Juan (1797)|English attacked San Juan in 1797]].<ref>[http://www.lmsj.org/sitios.htm San Juan municipality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902090750/http://lmsj.org/sitios.htm |date=2010-09-02 }}</ref>]]\nAgain, the exact site of their landfall is controversial.  The vicinity of [[Charlotte Harbor, Florida|Charlotte Harbor]] is the most commonly identified spot, while some assert a landing further north at [[Tampa Bay]] or even [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]].<ref name=Allen97>Allen, pp.215\u2013216.</ref> Other historians have argued the distances were too great to cover in the available time and the more likely location was [[Cape Romano]] or [[Cape Sable]].<ref name=Allen97/> Here Ponce de Le\u00f3n anchored for several days to take on water and repair the ships. They were approached by [[Calusa]], who might have been initially interested in trading but relations soon turned hostile. Several skirmishes followed with casualties on both sides and the Spaniards took eight Indians captive,<ref>Weddle, pp. 43\u201345.</ref> including one to become a translator.<ref name=\"Marley2008\" /> On June 4, there was another encounter with natives near [[Sanibel Island]] and the Calusa in war canoes, with the Spanish sinking a fourth of them. An unsubstantiated claim to justify Spanish retreat.<ref>Marley2008, p. 17</ref>\n\nOn June 14 they set sail again looking for a chain of islands in the west that had been described by their captives. They reached the [[Dry Tortugas]] on June 21.<ref name=\"Marley2008\" /> There they captured giant [[sea turtle]]s, [[Caribbean monk seal]]s, and thousands of [[seabird]]s. From these islands they sailed southwest in an apparent attempt to circle around Cuba and return home to Puerto Rico. Failing to take into account the powerful currents pushing them eastward, they struck the northeast shore of Cuba and were initially confused about their location.<ref>Weddle, p. 45.</ref>\n\nOnce they regained their bearings, the fleet retraced their route east along the Florida Keys and around the Florida peninsula, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July 8. They were surprised to come across another Spanish ship, piloted by [[Diego Miruelo]], who was either on a slaving voyage or had been sent by [[Diego Col\u00f3n]] to spy on Ponce de Le\u00f3n. Shortly thereafter Miruelo's ship was wrecked in a storm and Ponce de Le\u00f3n rescued the stranded crew.\n\nFrom here the little fleet disbanded. Ponce de Le\u00f3n tasked the ''Santa Maria'' with further exploration while he returned home with the rest of crew. Ponce de Le\u00f3n reached Puerto Rico on October 19 after having been away for almost eight months. The other ship, after further explorations returned safely on February 20, 1514.<ref>Weddle, pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nAlthough Ponce de Le\u00f3n is widely credited with the discovery of Florida, he almost certainly was not the first European to reach the peninsula. Spanish slave expeditions had been regularly raiding the Bahamas since 1494 and there is some evidence that one or more of these slavers made it as far as the shores of Florida.<ref>Fuson, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>\nAnother piece of evidence that others came before Ponce de Le\u00f3n is the [[Cantino planisphere|Cantino Map]] from 1502, which shows a peninsula near Cuba that looks like Florida's and includes characteristic place names.\n\n===Fountain of Youth===\n\n{{main|Fountain of Youth}}\n\n[[Image:Bahamian Love Vine.JPG|left|thumb|Bahamian love vine (''[[Cassytha filiformis]]''), Bahamas]]\nAccording to a popular legend, Ponce de Le\u00f3n discovered Florida while searching for the Fountain of Youth. Though stories of vitality-restoring waters were known on both sides of the Atlantic long before Ponce de Le\u00f3n, the story of his searching for them was not attached to him until after his death. In his ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s]] wrote that Ponce de Le\u00f3n was looking for the waters of [[Bimini]] to cure his aging.<ref>Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo.

''Historia General de las Indias'', second part.</ref> Then in 1575, [[Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda]], a shipwreck survivor who had lived with the Native Americans of Florida for 17 years, published his memoir in which he locates the waters in Florida, and says that Ponce de Le\u00f3n was supposed to have looked for them there.<ref>[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html \"Fontaneda's Memoir\"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org.

Most historians hold that the search for [[gold]] and the expansion of the [[Spanish Empire]] were far more imperative than any potential search for such a fountain.<ref name=\"Douglas\">{{cite book|author=Douglas, Marjory Stoneman|year=1947|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sPjDLXqemQ0C&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=Did+Juan+Ponce+de+Le%C3%B3n+actually+land+in+Florida%3F|title=The Everglades: River of Grass|publisher=Pineapple Press|accessdate=2008-03-30|isbn=9781561641352}}</ref><ref name=\"Sauer1975\">{{cite book|author=Carl Ortwin Sauer|title=Sixteenth Century North America: The Land and the People as Seen by the Europeans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWXU6sjN9ZUC&pg=PA26|date=1 January 1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02777-0|page=26}}</ref><!-- Although many believe that his main reason for going to the New World was to discover the Fountain of Youth, it is not.

Ponce de Le\u00f3n could have been seeking it as a potential entrepreneurial venture.  [[Woodrow Wilson]] believed Indian servants brewing a \"brown tea\" in [[Puerto Rico]] may have inspired Ponce de Le\u00f3n's search for the Fountain of Youth.<ref>Woodrow Wilson, \"History of the American People, New York and Amsterdam: Harper and Brothers, 1917, Vol 1, p. 13</ref>  Arne Molander has speculated that the adventurous conquistador mistook the natives' \"vid\" (vine) for \"vida\" (life) \u2013 transforming their \"fountain vine\" into an imagined \"fountain of life\".\n\n==Between voyages==\nUpon his return to Puerto Rico, Ponce de Le\u00f3n found the island in turmoil. A party of [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] from a neighboring island had attacked the settlement of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico#History|Caparra]], killed several Spaniards and burned it to the ground.  Ponce de Le\u00f3n's own [[Caparra Archaeological Site|house]] was destroyed and his family narrowly escaped. [[Diego Col\u00f3n|Col\u00f3n]] used the attack as a pretext for renewing hostilities against the local [[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] tribes. The explorer suspected that Col\u00f3n was working to further undermine his position on the island and perhaps even to take his claims for the newly discovered Florida.<ref>Fuson, p. 121\u2013124.</ref>\n\nPonce de Le\u00f3n decided he should return to Spain and personally report the results of his recent expedition. He left Puerto Rico in April 1514 and was warmly received by Ferdinand when he arrived at court in [[Valladolid]]. There he was knighted,<ref name=\"Marley2008\" /> and given a personal [[coat of arms]], becoming the first conquistador to receive these honors. He also visited [[Casa de Contrataci\u00f3n]] in [[Seville]], which was the central bureaucracy and clearinghouse for all of Spain's activities in the New World. The Casa took detailed notes of his discoveries and added them to the [[Padr\u00f3n Real]], a master map which served as the basis for official navigation charts provided to Spanish captains and pilots.<ref>Fuson, pp. 125\u2013127.</ref>\n\nDuring his stay in Spain, a new contract<ref>See Fuson, pp. 129\u2013131 for complete translation.</ref> was drawn up for Ponce de Le\u00f3n confirming his rights to settle and govern [[Bimini]] and Florida,<ref name=\"Shepherd1907\">{{cite book|author=William Robert Shepherd|title=Guide to the Materials for the History of the United States in Spanish Archives|url=https://archive.org/details/guidetomaterial01shepgoog|year=1907|publisher=Carnegie institution of Washington|page=[https://archive.org/details/guidetomaterial01shepgoog/page/n76 68]}}</ref> which was then presumed to be an island. In addition to the usual directions for sharing gold and other valuables with the king, the contract was one of the first to stipulate that the [[Requerimiento]] was to be read to the inhabitants of the islands prior to their conquest.  Ponce de Le\u00f3n was also ordered to organize an armada for the purpose of attacking and subduing the Caribs, who continued to attack Spanish settlements in the Caribbean.<ref>Fuson, pp. 128\u2013132.</ref>\n[[File:Tomb of Ponce de Leon.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of Ponce de Le\u00f3n in [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]] in San Juan, Puerto Rico]]\nThree ships were purchased for his armada and after repairs and provisioning Ponce de Le\u00f3n left Spain on May 14, 1515 with his little fleet. The record of his activities against the Caribs is vague. There was one engagement in [[Guadeloupe]] on his return to the area and possibly two or three other encounters.<ref>Fuson, pp. 136\u2013138.</ref> The campaign came to an abrupt end in 1516 when Ferdinand died. The king had been a strong supporter and Ponce de Le\u00f3n felt it was imperative he return to Spain and defend his privileges and titles. He did receive assurances of support from Cardinal [[Francisco Jim\u00e9nez de Cisneros]], the regent appointed to govern Castile, but it was nearly two years before he was able to return home to Puerto Rico.\n\nMeanwhile, there had been at least two unauthorized voyages to \"his\" Florida both ending in repulsion by the native Calusa Tequesta warriors. Ponce de Le\u00f3n realized he had to act soon if he was to maintain his claim.\n\n==Last voyage to Florida==\nIn early 1521, Ponce de Le\u00f3n organized a colonizing expedition consisting of some 200 men, including priests, farmers and artisans, 50 horses and other domestic animals, and farming implements carried on two ships. The expedition landed somewhere on the coast of [[southwest Florida]], likely in the vicinity of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]] or the [[Caloosahatchee River]], areas which Ponce de Le\u00f3n had visited in his earlier voyage to Florida.\n\nBefore the settlement could be established, the colonists were attacked by the [[Calusa]], the [[Indigenous peoples of Florida|indigenous]] people who dominated southern Florida and whose principal town was nearby. Ponce de Le\u00f3n was mortally wounded in the skirmish when, historians believe, an arrow [[Arrow poison|poisoned]] with the [[sap]] of the [[manchineel tree]] struck his thigh.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Swamp |first=Michael |last=Grunwald |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7432-5107-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olHjhlx0Em8C&pg=PA25 |page=25}}</ref> The expedition immediately abandoned the colonization attempt and sailed to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], where Ponce de Le\u00f3n soon died of his wounds. He was buried in [[Puerto Rico]], in the crypt of [[San Jos\u00e9 Church]] from 1559 to 1836, when his remains were exhumed and transferred to the [[Cathedral of San Juan Bautista]].<ref>Fuson, pp. 173\u2013176.</ref>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n*The [[World War II]] [[Liberty Ship]] {{SS|Ponce De Leon}} was named in his honor.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Puerto Rico}}\n* [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n II]]\n* [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n y Loayza]]\n* [[Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 (The Great Sun)]]\n* [[Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II]]\n* [[Hayuya]]\n* [[Jumacao]]\n* [[Discoverer of the Americas]]\n* [[Tequesta]]\n* [[Spanish Florida|La Florida]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Library resources box|by=no|viaf=27867698}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Allen, John Logan (1997).

Dr. Kumar and his wife have a different outlook towards life, with him preferring books and philosophy, while his wife Padma prefers social gatherings and society clubs.

Dr. Kumar and his wife have a different outlook towards life, with him preferring books and philosophy, while his wife Padma prefers social gatherings and society clubs. Padma never considered Jyoti her son, who works as a mill designer, a profession she considers too poor to acknowledge. Chitra is encouraged by her mother to mingle freely in high society, much to the disappointment of her worried father.\n\nRekha prefers tending to her father at home, apart from studying. Prakash (Biswajeet), who lives with his blind mother (Sulochana) joins university as a lecturer, and takes lessons from Dr. Kumar to work on his PhD. Rekha and Prakash like each other. Meanwhile, Jyoti, who had taken to drinking to avoid loneliness of being neglected and insulted by his mother, is thrown out of the house by her. Chitra is attracted to judge Kailash Nath's son Ramesh, a philanderer, who promised to marry her, got her pregnant and then moved on to another girl.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a9kcAQAAMAAJ&dq=nai+roshni+mala+sinha+film&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=nai+roshni|title=Shankar's Weekly|last=|first=|date=1 January 1967|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=86|language=en}}</ref>\n\nJyoti and Professor Kumar try to get Chitra and Ramesh married, to avoid humiliation for Chitra. But it is too late as Chitra consumes poison.\n\nIt is also revealed that Prakash's father, who had left his blind and pregnant mother, is none other than Professor Kumar. Prakash always hated his father for leaving his mother, and struggles to believe that the teacher he reveres led a deceitful life.

The single \"Apparently\" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]] at the 58th Grammy Awards. \n\n==Background==\nThe album's title is the address of a home in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], where Cole lived from his early youth, until 2003. Cole lived at the property with his mother, his brother and his stepfather, and was the location where Cole wrote some of his earliest songs, and decided to pursue a career as a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2007961/j-cole-tour-2014-forest-hills-drive/|title=Take A Tour Of J.

Cole soon put the home up for an \"extremely cheap\" renting price, in the hope that any struggling residents could use it to progress their lives, without having to worry about frequent moving, an experience Cole underwent due to frequent financial struggles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboombox.com/j-cole-gives-tour-of-childhood-home-covers-complex-video/|title=J.

Cole]]. It was released on December 9, 2014, by ByStorm Entertainment, [[Columbia Records]], [[Dreamville Records]] and [[Roc Nation]]. \n\nRecording sessions took place over the whole year, while the [[hip hop production|production]] on the album was primarily handled by Cole himself, along with several others such as [[Illmind]], [[Vinylz]], Phonix Beats and [[Willie B (producer)|Willie B]]. It was announced three weeks before its release and had very little marketing, with no singles or promotion taking place prior to its release. The album was supported by four singles: \"[[Apparently]]\", \"[[Wet Dreamz]]\", \"[[No Role Modelz]]\" and \"[[Love Yourz]]\".\n\n''2014 Forest Hills Drive'' received generally positive reviews from critics who admired its ambitious concept, production and lyrics. The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 353,000 copies in its first week. As of September 2015, the album has sold one million <!--This is the latest updated from a Reliable source --->copies in the United States. The album was certified [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in May 2019.\n\nThe album won Album of the Year at the [[2015 BET Hip Hop Awards]], and Top Rap Album at the [[2015 Billboard Music Awards|2015 ''Billboard'' Music Awards]].  It was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[58th Annual Grammy Awards|2016 Grammy Awards]].  The single \"Apparently\" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]] at the 58th Grammy Awards. \n\n==Background==\nThe album's title is the address of a home in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], where Cole lived from his early youth, until 2003. Cole lived at the property with his mother, his brother and his stepfather, and was the location where Cole wrote some of his earliest songs, and decided to pursue a career as a musician.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2007961/j-cole-tour-2014-forest-hills-drive/|title=Take A Tour Of J.

Cole soon put the home up for an \"extremely cheap\" renting price, in the hope that any struggling residents could use it to progress their lives, without having to worry about frequent moving, an experience Cole underwent due to frequent financial struggles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboombox.com/j-cole-gives-tour-of-childhood-home-covers-complex-video/|title=J.

''Slashing Reginleiv''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]]. The story, based on [[Norse mythology]], follows the divine warriors Freyr and Freyja in their war against the [[J\u00f6tunn]], which heralds the coming of [[Ragnarok]]. Gameplay is mission-based, following one of the two protagonists as they fight hoards of enemies. Missions can be completed either in single-playing or in four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]]. Along with standard controls, the game supported the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion.\n\nDevelopment of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' began in 2006, though the concept was pitched before the Wii's launch. The world and characters' Norse origins were chosen due to that system's uncertain visual identity. The last year of production was turbulent due to requests from Nintendo about the controls and inclusion of co-op. It was the first Nintendo-published game given the \"D\" rating by Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] rating system. As of 2020, the game remains exclusive to Japan. The game saw a mixed reception, and low sales in Japan.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Zangeki no Reginleiv gameplay.png|thumb|left|A mission in ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', featuring four players in the online co-op mode.]]\n''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] set in a world inspired by [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Players take on the role of sibling deities Freyr and Freyja, completing missions that involve defeating waves of enemy troops with the aid of either non-playable characters, or up to four players via online [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]].<ref name=\"SilOpinion\"/><ref name=\"ReginleivSystem\"/> The game has two control options; the Classic Controller, and the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].

Despite their best efforts, Freyr and Freyja cannot stop the J\u00f6tunn's advance. The situation is worsened by the emerging armies of [[Niflheim]] and [[Muspelheim]], and the release of three demonic weapons created by [[Loki]] during an earlier war with the giants. Asgard itself is eventually assaulted leading to the death of all the gods except Freyr and Freyja, followed by the final emergence of the Fire J\u00f6tunn [[Surtr]]. The world is left in ruin after Surt's defeat, but Freyja uses her powers to restore the world and humanity. The post-credits scene shows a modern world, where the gods have reincarnated as humans.\n\n==Development and release==\n[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]], best known for their work on the ''[[Earth Defense Force]]'' series, first pitched the concept of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' to [[Nintendo]] in 2004 alongside a project for the [[Nintendo DS]] called ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG''. Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami was wary of such a large pitch, so agreed that the developer would make ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' and then go on to ''Zangeki no Reginleiv''. When production of ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' finished in 2006, the team were given the go-ahead to work on ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', though both sides were wary of its scale. Originally the plan was for only 100 weapons to feature, but as the team got to grips with the Wii hardware, the number tripled. In 2009, a year before the planned release, Nintendo asked Sandlot to include co-op\u2014which the team had never tried before\u2014then control options for the Classic Controller and the Wii MotionPlus. These additional elements put a lot of strain on the team, with Yamagami describing it as a \"dark year\" for the team. A point of contention with Nintendo during the final six months was allowing a player to dismember enemies. Instead of cutting it altogether, Sandlot and Nintendo rationalised that since the violence was against hostile supernatural beings, it did not go against Nintendo's policy of not showing excessive violence against people.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u793e\u9577\u304c\u8a0a\u304f\u300e\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\u300f|language=Japanese|website=[[Nintendo]]|date=2010|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310073743/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe early concept focused simply on making a fun game where players could slash at enemies, with the setting being a secondary consideration. Writer and director Takehiro Homma initially considered ancient Japan and a modern-day setting, but settled on a mythological setting to better explain the fantastic feats on display. Norse mythology was chosen as the world's base due to lacking a distinct visual identity when compared to [[Greek mythology]]. With this in mind, levels were designed to reflect the topography of the mythos as much as possible. Illustrator Haccan, who designed the main characters, was brought in as art director Masatsugu Igarashi liked his human character designs.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/> Character model design was assisted by Optimo Graphico, an outsourcing company also working on ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Zangeki no Reginleiv|developer=[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|platform=[[Wii]]|date=2010-02-11|scene=Credits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30aa\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30b3\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e - Works|language=Japanese|website=Optimo Graphico website|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031145853/http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|archivedate=2010-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music was composed by [[Masafumi Takada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5408\u540c\u4f1a\u793e|website=Masafumi Takada website|accessdate=2016-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213116/http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|archivedate=2016-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Different voice clips were recorded for different battle situations, with the number and harshness causing the actors' voices to become hoarse by the end of recording.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was first announced at a special Nintendo press event in 2008 under the provisional title ''Dynamic Zan'', with a planned release for the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|script-title=ja:\u6012\u6fe4\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 \u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306eWii\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u5927\u5145\u5b9f|language=Japanese|website=[[Famitsu]]|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213014436/https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|archivedate=2010-02-13|url-status=live}}</ref> It was re-introduced under its official title in November 2009.

''Slashing Reginleiv''|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a 2010 [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] developed by [[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]] and published by [[Nintendo]] for the [[Wii]]. The story, based on [[Norse mythology]], follows the divine warriors Freyr and Freyja in their war against the [[J\u00f6tunn]], which heralds the coming of [[Ragnarok]]. Gameplay is mission-based, following one of the two protagonists as they fight hoards of enemies. Missions can be completed either in single-playing or in four-player [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]]. Along with standard controls, the game supported the [[Wii MotionPlus]] expansion.\n\nDevelopment of ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' began in 2006, though the concept was pitched before the Wii's launch. The world and characters' Norse origins were chosen due to that system's uncertain visual identity. The last year of production was turbulent due to requests from Nintendo about the controls and inclusion of co-op. It was the first Nintendo-published game given the \"D\" rating by Japan's [[Computer Entertainment Rating Organization|CERO]] rating system. As of 2020, the game remains exclusive to Japan. The game saw a mixed reception, and low sales in Japan.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Zangeki no Reginleiv gameplay.png|thumb|left|A mission in ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', featuring four players in the online co-op mode.]]\n''Zangeki no Reginleiv'' is an [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] set in a world inspired by [[Norse mythology]].<ref name=\"1UP\"/> Players take on the role of sibling deities Freyr and Freyja, completing missions that involve defeating waves of enemy troops with the aid of either non-playable characters, or up to four players via online [[Cooperative gameplay|co-op]].<ref name=\"SilOpinion\"/><ref name=\"ReginleivSystem\"/> The game has two control options; the Classic Controller, and the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]].

Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami was wary of such a large pitch, so agreed that the developer would make ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' and then go on to ''Zangeki no Reginleiv''. When production of ''Ch\u014ds\u014dj\u016b Mecha MG'' finished in 2006, the team were given the go-ahead to work on ''Zangeki no Reginleiv'', though both sides were wary of its scale. Originally the plan was for only 100 weapons to feature, but as the team got to grips with the Wii hardware, the number tripled. In 2009, a year before the planned release, Nintendo asked Sandlot to include co-op\u2014which the team had never tried before\u2014then control options for the Classic Controller and the Wii MotionPlus. These additional elements put a lot of strain on the team, with Yamagami describing it as a \"dark year\" for the team. A point of contention with Nintendo during the final six months was allowing a player to dismember enemies. Instead of cutting it altogether, Sandlot and Nintendo rationalised that since the violence was against hostile supernatural beings, it did not go against Nintendo's policy of not showing excessive violence against people.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|script-title=ja:\u793e\u9577\u304c\u8a0a\u304f\u300e\u65ac\u6483\u306eREGINLEIV\u300f|language=Japanese|website=[[Nintendo]]|date=2010|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310073743/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/interview/rznj/vol1/index.html|archivedate=2013-03-10|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe early concept focused simply on making a fun game where players could slash at enemies, with the setting being a secondary consideration. Writer and director Takehiro Homma initially considered ancient Japan and a modern-day setting, but settled on a mythological setting to better explain the fantastic feats on display. Norse mythology was chosen as the world's base due to lacking a distinct visual identity when compared to [[Greek mythology]]. With this in mind, levels were designed to reflect the topography of the mythos as much as possible. Illustrator Haccan, who designed the main characters, was brought in as art director Masatsugu Igarashi liked his human character designs.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/> Character model design was assisted by Optimo Graphico, an outsourcing company also working on ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles (video game)|Xenoblade Chronicles]]''.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Zangeki no Reginleiv|developer=[[Sandlot (company)|Sandlot]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|platform=[[Wii]]|date=2010-02-11|scene=Credits}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30aa\u30d7\u30c6\u30a3\u30e2\u30b0\u30e9\u30d5\u30a3\u30b3\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e - Works|language=Japanese|website=Optimo Graphico website|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031145853/http://www.opgra.co.jp/works.html|archivedate=2010-10-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> The music was composed by [[Masafumi Takada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|script-title=ja:\u30b5\u30a6\u30f3\u30c9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8\u5408\u540c\u4f1a\u793e|website=Masafumi Takada website|accessdate=2016-07-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324213116/http://www.soundprestige.jp/works.html|archivedate=2016-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref> Different voice clips were recorded for different battle situations, with the number and harshness causing the actors' voices to become hoarse by the end of recording.<ref name=\"NintendoInterview\"/>\n\nThe game was first announced at a special Nintendo press event in 2008 under the provisional title ''Dynamic Zan'', with a planned release for the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|script-title=ja:\u6012\u6fe4\u306e\u65b0\u4f5c\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 \u4efb\u5929\u5802\u306eWii\u7528\u30bd\u30d5\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\u306f\u307e\u3059\u307e\u3059\u5927\u5145\u5b9f|language=Japanese|website=[[Famitsu]]|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2020-02-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213014436/https://www.famitsu.com/game/news/1218549_1124.html|archivedate=2010-02-13|url-status=live}}</ref> It was re-introduced under its official title in November 2009.

He instituted a sweeping reorganization of the WAA.{{sfn|Somerset Publishers|2000|p=39}} In one sale, the WAA sold 20,960 war planes, accepting bids of $6,582,156 for the lot, which had originally cost $3,900,000,000.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=Sad Sale |date=9 September 1946 |url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,855453,00.html |access-date=1 March 2020 |url-access=subscription }}</ref> He left the WAA in 1948.<ref name=\"WaPo\"/>\n\nIn retirement, Littlejohn felt that his work was under-appreciated. He disliked the series of monographs written on Quartermaster operations in the ETO by historians at [[Fort Lee, Virginia]], and attacked Roland Ruppenthal's magisterial two-volume ''Logistic Support of the Armies'' (1953 and 1959) in the ''[[United States Army in World War II]]'' series as a slanderous attack on his reputation.{{sfn|Anders|1993|p=35}}\n\nLittlejohn died from [[cardiorespiratory failure]] at a nursing home in [[Wisconsin Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., on 6 May 1982.<ref name=\"WaPo\"/> His wife had predeceased him on 9 December 1978.

It has been suggested that and believed by many local citizens to be an area with a long history of battling environmental injustice.\n\n==History==\nSince the mid-19th century, the Rogers-Eubanks Community has been home to many African-American families. A great deal of the black-owned family farmland in this area has been passed down throughout the generations. Rogers Road was originally a wagon-track in the late 19th century, and Eubanks Road contained a small school founded by a former slave. The school provided an education for the neighborhood's black children in a time when they had no such opportunities.  In current times, the Rogers-Eubanks Community has maintained its rich culture despite being the host to mainly low-income households.<ref name=CoalitionWebsite>{{cite web|url=http://rogersroad.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/roger-eubanks-summary.pdf |title=The Rogers-Eubanks \"Coalition to End Environmental Racism |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305205939/https://rogersroad.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/roger-eubanks-summary.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref> The social bonds among the families that formed their roots over 100 years ago have been crucial to the ability of the residents to battle the county and achieve [[Environmental justice|environmental equality]].\n\nAn organization called [[Play Street Soccer]], an affiliate of the Chapel Hill and Carrboro Human Rights Center, also hosts pick up soccer games for the youth of the area once each week. The organization began hosting games in the spring of 2011 with the hope of empowering children and building community through soccer.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rocha |first=Ana |title=Abbey Court children, UNC students find common bond in soccer |newspaper=The Daily Tar Heel |date=3 March 2011 |url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2011/03/unc_sociology_class_brings_kids_together_through_soccer}}</ref>\n\n==Dumping disputes==\n\n===Orange County's growing problem===\nFrom 1939 to 1979, many new families moved into this historically small neighborhood, buying houses and land and establishing themselves in the area surrounding Rogers Road.  Just like most of Orange County at the time, the Rogers-Eubanks Community was moving away from being a small group of tight-knit families and moving toward rapid expansion. Aside from changing the nature of the community, there was one other problem that the county was not well-prepared to solve: garbage. More people equals more garbage, but in the 1970s, the political scene was active and a lot of change was beginning to happen. Along with the formation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in December 1970, the American people were becoming concerned with inflation, racial tensions, [[Conservation movement|conservation]], and pollution. This new-found national interest in preserving the environment \"called into question the common practice of burning household waste and disposing of waste into\u2026waterways.\" All of these national concerns were equally existent in Orange County. The issue of race was prominent in [[Orange High School (North Carolina)|Orange High School]] where many black students were accused of \"carrying weapons, insulting white female students, and passing out literature\" at school. The school emblem was changed from the \"black panther\" and [[Dixie (song)|' 'Dixie' ']] was no longer allowed to be played at the school's football games due to its racial associations.<ref name=Pearce2009>{{cite book | last = Pearce | first = Emily Eidenier | title = Rogers Road | publisher=E. E. Pearce | year = 2009}}</ref>\n\n===The promises of Howard Lee and Orange County, 1970===\nThe racially charged area was still in need of a place to put its rapidly growing volume of [[Waste|refuse]]. The mayor at the time was a man named [[Howard Nathaniel Lee|Howard Lee]]. Howard Lee was elected in 1969 and was the first African-American to be elected as mayor in a southern, mostly white area since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]].  In 1970, the Orange County Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) discussed a solution to the growing waste problem as the county's existing [[landfill]]s were nearing capacity more and more each day. The search for a piece of land on which to locate the new landfill began in 1971. Various sites were considered and the initial decision had been to locate the landfill in Chestnut Ridge, but at some point between June 8 and June 29, 1972, the site was dropped and changed to a site on Eubanks Road (then State Road 1727) where it still remains. Despite his plans and promises to \"prevent zoning decisions from being influenced by considerations of wealth, race, or political influence\", Lee was under the pressures of time, progress, and space, making it difficult to ensure such equality.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nThere was a great deal of protest before the landfill was built on the Eubanks Road site by both individual citizens and community groups. One such group was the New Hope Improvement Association, an organization led by John L. Kline that consisted of roughly 500 members living in the area surrounding the proposed site.  Lawyer B.B. Olive from [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] aided the group in their struggle, and although the team failed to prevent the construction of the landfill, Olive is remembered as one of the biggest advocates against the landfill.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nThe County Commissioners were at a loss after losing Chestnut Ridge as an option and now facing opposition and protest from the residents living near the site on Eubanks Road. After a denial of the [[Zoning|rezoning]] of the site from \"residential\" to \"rural industrial\", the New Hope Improvement Association was excited and tried to boost the force against the landfill's creation on Eubanks Road by filing a legal complaint against the county, Right before this legal battle was to be fought, Mayor [[Howard Nathaniel Lee|Howard Lee]] visited the community and said: \"We want to put a landfill out here. To do it, we're going to pave your road. When the landfill is full, we're going to turn it into a recreation center for you.\"<ref name=Pearce2009/> Having convinced the families that this may be beneficial, Lee singlehandedly weakened his opposition and eventually, despite the community being one that was \"strongly opposed to having a landfill near them\", the unlined landfill was built on {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of land on Eubanks Road in 1972.<ref name=CoalitionWebsite/>\n\n===Widening the divide===\nIn late 1980s, the county announced that there would be an expansion of the landfill rather than the promised shutdown and recreational facilities. David Caldwell, Judy Nunn Snipes, and B.B. Olive led a new activist group in the 90s in response to the proposed actions and demanded a shutdown of the landfill and compensation for having hosted the facility for the promised number of years. The county had known almost a decade earlier in the late 70s that the need to expand would be an issue in future years. Once the citizens were informed, there was internal debate among citizens and officials within the county. Many arguments of the injustice were made, and the residents of the Rogers Road coalition believed that the areas creating the waste were not the ones hosting the facilities for that waste, a fact that they hoped would change.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n\n===What now?===\nMany of the black residents felt as though they had been completely neglected by the government and betrayed and fooled by their mayor, the person who was supposed to be their advocate, not their enemy. One of the main reasons the dump hadn't been located in Chestnut Ridge was to avoid creating dangers for the children who attended a nearby year-round camp, yet so many families in the Rogers-Eubanks community feel that their neighborhood is family-oriented aside from the landfill and that their children's health is being negatively affected.<ref name=Pearce2009/> Upon hearing that the government was planning on placing a new facility in the same area, the citizens were outraged. In March 2006, the county's Solid Waste Advisory Board officially recommended the Eubanks Road site as the location of the new solid waste [[Transfer station (waste management)|transfer station]].<ref name=CoalitionWebsite/>\n<br />\nHaving already temporarily expanded the existing landfill and ignored the people's requests for amenities, the local town governments proceeded to go behind the backs of the citizens in the Rogers Road community and give the county both control of the landfill and 60 more acres of land for the siting of a solid waste transfer station. The families in this area had already been dealing with increased truck traffic, landfill odor, deteriorating water quality, and unwanted visits from buzzards, rats, and stray dogs searching for food in the county's trash for many years, and feel that it is unfair to bear it any longer.<ref name=Pearce2009/> The commissioners in [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]] have responded to the uproar from the Rogers Road residents  and promised to reconsider the site, but they have yet to promise to completely wipe the Eubanks Road site off the list of possibilities.<ref name=CarrboroCitizen>{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Dickson | title=County board reviews transfer site complaint | date=January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.carrborocitizen.com/main/2008/01/24/county-board-reviews-transfer-site-complaint/#more-1719 | work=Carrboro Citizen}}</ref> Many people in the area worry about their ancestral property.<ref name=Pearce2009/>  The planned facility is expected to cost $4.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=DailyTarHeel,Gunst>{{cite news | first=Robert C. | last=Gunst, Jr. | title=Candidates debate Rogers Road waste-transfer site | date=October 16, 2007 | url =http://www.dailytarheel.com/content/candidates-debate-rogers-road-waste-transfer-site | work=The Daily Tar Heel}}</ref>\n\n==Water shortage==\nThe landfill, although modern for the time, was not constructed in a way that kept the area safe from the toxins and [[toxic waste|waste]] that leached into the ground of the surrounding area.  Tests conducted in the early months of 2010 showed that only two of the eleven [[Water well|wells]] in the Rogers Road area are supplying the area's residents with water \"within the EPA recommended limits\".<ref name=Herald-Sun,Velliquette>{{cite news | first=Beth | last=Velliquette | title=9 of 11 wells below EPA standard | date=March 17, 2010 | url =http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/6722300/article-9-of-11-wells-below-EPA-standards | work=The Herald-Sun}}</ref>\n<br />\nWater lines were eventually laid in the area but did not reach all the way down Rogers Road, and for many families, the hook-up fees that ran up costs of about $2,000 were out of the price range for many citizens in the area. The sewer hook-up fees were even more expensive, reaching about $3,000 per household. Despite the program set up by the county to give assistance to homeowners unable to afford these costs, many either could not afford the water bills that followed or did not fall low enough on the income bracket to be considered in need.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nIn February 2010, Orange County Board of Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution that is expected to plan a way to provide safe and clean water options for households located within {{convert|3000|ft|m}} of the landfill. If the plan comes to fruition, possible solutions include fixing and replacing existing wells or give the residents access to the county's public water supply by extending the lines. The residents seem hopeful that the government will choose to extend the water supply rather than simply repair the wells.<ref name=DailyTarHeel,Rinderman>{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Rinderman | title=County takes steps to fix Rogers-Eubanks water problem | date=February 3, 2010 | url =http://www.dailytarheel.com/content/rogers-eubanks-residents-receive-healthy-water-options | work=The Daily Tar Heel}}</ref>\n\n===Possible health hazards===\nPeople in the neighborhood have questioned the safety of the water since shortly after the landfill was first built in the 70s. Many noticed their loved ones coming down with cancer among other sicknesses and a change of the color of the water in which their families drank, cooked with, and bathed in. The government denied any allegations from the start that it was a result of the landfill and as a result felt no obligation to give them the amenities which they lacked.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nContaminants have been found in tests done on some of the wells in the area around the Orange County Regional Landfill. [[Vinyl Chloride]], [[tetrachloroethylene]],dichloroethene, and [[benzene]] are all chemicals that could cause health problems in high doses. The concentration of vinyl chloride was found to be 16&nbsp;mg/l when the regulations state the acceptable range to be 0.002&nbsp;mg/l-0.015&nbsp;mg/l. Dichloroethene also exceeds the standards, found at a concentration of 232&nbsp;mg/l when the accepted level falls at 70&nbsp;mg/l. Additionally, the benzene was discovered to exist at a level of 7&nbsp;mg/l when it should not be any greater than 1&nbsp;mg/l. The health effects of these chemicals are said to be dangerous if long-term exposure occurs. Lack of data to prove that the chemicals have affected the health is what maintains the rift between the beliefs of the citizens and those of the local government.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n\n==Government involvement==\nThe government has been trying to make amends in recent years, but many residents of the area see these changes as superficial attempts at \"patching\" the problem and not really fixing the source of all of the issues that the area faces. \n<br />\nA huge problem with the legislation is that Rogers Road has only some parts within city limits but other parts are transition areas between [[Carrboro, North Carolina|Carrboro]] and [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] known as \"extraterritorial planning jurisdiction.\"<ref name=Pearce2009/> This has allowed for a great deal of neglect as no one wants to take responsibility for the area that is not within the drawn city lines. \n<br />\nIn December 2006, the town of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] began developing the Rogers Road Small Area Plan. This plan is designed to provide a \"more detailed look at the impacts of providing public services in the area, especially the extension of sanitary sewer, and the impacts of developing an affordable housing site.\" It also serves as an outlet to analyze \"desirable land uses and revision to the land use plan water and sewer extension plan, roadway network, bicycle and pedestrian facilities plan, transit service plan, zoning ordinance and map amendment.\" This plan affects the Greene Tract, an area containing [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[Carrboro, North Carolina|Carrboro]], and other parts of [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townofchapelhill.org/index.aspx?page=620 |title=Rogers Road Plan |publisher=Town of Chapel Hill }}</ref> Many residents fear the loss of ancestral property in relation to this plan as well.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nRelated government action has started to be taken to aid communities like the Rogers-Eubanks Community. In September 2007, Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] introduced a bill titled the [http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_5132.html Environmental Justice Renewal Act]. Despite the efforts to aid poverty-struck areas, some advocates, like [[African American Environmentalist Association|African American Environmentalist Association (AAEA)]] president Norris McDonald, feel that bills like the EJRA are insufficient and just strategic political moves to gain votes.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news | first=Amanda Griscom | last=Little | title=Not in Whose Backyard? | date=September 2, 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02wwln-essay-t.html | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n<br />\nThe idea that this was an instance of racial discrimination really started to flourish in the first decade of the 21st century.<ref name=Pearce2009/> In Oct 2007, Reverend Robert Campbell, \"one of the town's leading activists for environmental justice in the Rogers Road community\"<ref name=Herald-Sun,Way>{{cite news | first=Dan E. | last=Way | title=Rogers Road activist invited to White House | date=December 2009 | url =http://www.heraldsun.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Rogers+Road+activist+invited+to+White+House%20&id=4483961-Rogers+Road+activist+invited+to+White+House | work=The Herald-Sun }}</ref> filed a complaint with the EPA in reference to the Rogers-Eubanks Community claiming that county officials had \"violated Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]\" and the regulations set by the EPA that prohibited discrimination.

The county's commissioner Barry Jacobs said that the decision was in no way a matter of racial or socioeconomic discrimination and that he is \"thinking about\" considering other sites.

He traveled to the White House and spoke to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about the issues facing the Rogers-Eubanks Community. Hoping to influence policy change, discuss a national campaign for reducing, reusing, and recycling, and the suggest the expansion of testing and forming infrastructure, Rev.

It has been suggested that and believed by many local citizens to be an area with a long history of battling environmental injustice.\n\n==History==\nSince the mid-19th century, the Rogers-Eubanks Community has been home to many African-American families. A great deal of the black-owned family farmland in this area has been passed down throughout the generations. Rogers Road was originally a wagon-track in the late 19th century, and Eubanks Road contained a small school founded by a former slave. The school provided an education for the neighborhood's black children in a time when they had no such opportunities.  In current times, the Rogers-Eubanks Community has maintained its rich culture despite being the host to mainly low-income households.<ref name=CoalitionWebsite>{{cite web|url=http://rogersroad.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/roger-eubanks-summary.pdf |title=The Rogers-Eubanks \"Coalition to End Environmental Racism }}</ref> The social bonds among the families that formed their roots over 100 years ago have been crucial to the ability of the residents to battle the county and achieve [[Environmental justice|environmental equality]].\n\nAn organization called [[Play Street Soccer]], an affiliate of the Chapel Hill and Carrboro Human Rights Center, also hosts pick up soccer games for the youth of the area once each week. The organization began hosting games in the spring of 2011 with the hope of empowering children and building community through soccer.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rocha |first=Ana |title=Abbey Court children, UNC students find common bond in soccer |newspaper=The Daily Tar Heel |date=3 March 2011 |url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/index.php/article/2011/03/unc_sociology_class_brings_kids_together_through_soccer}}</ref>\n\n==Dumping disputes==\n\n===Orange County's growing problem===\nFrom 1939 to 1979, many new families moved into this historically small neighborhood, buying houses and land and establishing themselves in the area surrounding Rogers Road.  Just like most of Orange County at the time, the Rogers-Eubanks Community was moving away from being a small group of tight-knit families and moving toward rapid expansion. Aside from changing the nature of the community, there was one other problem that the county was not well-prepared to solve: garbage. More people equals more garbage, but in the 1970s, the political scene was active and a lot of change was beginning to happen. Along with the formation of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in December 1970, the American people were becoming concerned with inflation, racial tensions, [[Conservation movement|conservation]], and pollution. This new-found national interest in preserving the environment \"called into question the common practice of burning household waste and disposing of waste into\u2026waterways.\" All of these national concerns were equally existent in Orange County. The issue of race was prominent in [[Orange High School (North Carolina)|Orange High School]] where many black students were accused of \"carrying weapons, insulting white female students, and passing out literature\" at school. The school emblem was changed from the \"black panther\" and [[Dixie (song)|' 'Dixie' ']] was no longer allowed to be played at the school's football games due to its racial associations.<ref name=Pearce2009>{{cite book | last = Pearce | first = Emily Eidenier | title = Rogers Road | publisher=E. E. Pearce | year = 2009}}</ref>\n\n===The promises of Howard Lee and Orange County, 1970===\nThe racially charged area was still in need of a place to put its rapidly growing volume of [[Waste|refuse]]. The mayor at the time was a man named [[Howard Nathaniel Lee|Howard Lee]]. Howard Lee was elected in 1969 and was the first African-American to be elected as mayor in a southern, mostly white area since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstruction]].  In 1970, the Orange County Board of County Commissioners (BOCC) discussed a solution to the growing waste problem as the county's existing [[landfill]]s were nearing capacity more and more each day. The search for a piece of land on which to locate the new landfill began in 1971. Various sites were considered and the initial decision had been to locate the landfill in Chestnut Ridge, but at some point between June 8 and June 29, 1972, the site was dropped and changed to a site on Eubanks Road (then State Road 1727) where it still remains. Despite his plans and promises to \"prevent zoning decisions from being influenced by considerations of wealth, race, or political influence\", Lee was under the pressures of time, progress, and space, making it difficult to ensure such equality.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nThere was a great deal of protest before the landfill was built on the Eubanks Road site by both individual citizens and community groups. One such group was the New Hope Improvement Association, an organization led by John L. Kline that consisted of roughly 500 members living in the area surrounding the proposed site.  Lawyer B.B. Olive from [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]] aided the group in their struggle, and although the team failed to prevent the construction of the landfill, Olive is remembered as one of the biggest advocates against the landfill.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nThe County Commissioners were at a loss after losing Chestnut Ridge as an option and now facing opposition and protest from the residents living near the site on Eubanks Road. After a denial of the [[Zoning|rezoning]] of the site from \"residential\" to \"rural industrial\", the New Hope Improvement Association was excited and tried to boost the force against the landfill's creation on Eubanks Road by filing a legal complaint against the county, Right before this legal battle was to be fought, Mayor [[Howard Nathaniel Lee|Howard Lee]] visited the community and said: \"We want to put a landfill out here. To do it, we're going to pave your road. When the landfill is full, we're going to turn it into a recreation center for you.\"<ref name=Pearce2009/> Having convinced the families that this may be beneficial, Lee singlehandedly weakened his opposition and eventually, despite the community being one that was \"strongly opposed to having a landfill near them\", the unlined landfill was built on {{convert|80|acre|m2}} of land on Eubanks Road in 1972.<ref name=CoalitionWebsite/>\n\n===Widening the divide===\nIn late 1980s, the county announced that there would be an expansion of the landfill rather than the promised shutdown and recreational facilities. David Caldwell, Judy Nunn Snipes, and B.B. Olive led a new activist group in the 90s in response to the proposed actions and demanded a shutdown of the landfill and compensation for having hosted the facility for the promised number of years. The county had known almost a decade earlier in the late 70s that the need to expand would be an issue in future years. Once the citizens were informed, there was internal debate among citizens and officials within the county. Many arguments of the injustice were made, and the residents of the Rogers Road coalition believed that the areas creating the waste were not the ones hosting the facilities for that waste, a fact that they hoped would change.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n\n===What now?===\nMany of the black residents felt as though they had been completely neglected by the government and betrayed and fooled by their mayor, the person who was supposed to be their advocate, not their enemy. One of the main reasons the dump hadn't been located in Chestnut Ridge was to avoid creating dangers for the children who attended a nearby year-round camp, yet so many families in the Rogers-Eubanks community feel that their neighborhood is family-oriented aside from the landfill and that their children's health is being negatively affected.<ref name=Pearce2009/> Upon hearing that the government was planning on placing a new facility in the same area, the citizens were outraged. In March 2006, the county's Solid Waste Advisory Board officially recommended the Eubanks Road site as the location of the new solid waste [[Transfer station (waste management)|transfer station]].<ref name=CoalitionWebsite/>\n<br />\nHaving already temporarily expanded the existing landfill and ignored the people's requests for amenities, the local town governments proceeded to go behind the backs of the citizens in the Rogers Road community and give the county both control of the landfill and 60 more acres of land for the siting of a solid waste transfer station. The families in this area had already been dealing with increased truck traffic, landfill odor, deteriorating water quality, and unwanted visits from buzzards, rats, and stray dogs searching for food in the county's trash for many years, and feel that it is unfair to bear it any longer.<ref name=Pearce2009/> The commissioners in [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]] have responded to the uproar from the Rogers Road residents  and promised to reconsider the site, but they have yet to promise to completely wipe the Eubanks Road site off the list of possibilities.<ref name=CarrboroCitizen>{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Dickson | title=County board reviews transfer site complaint | date=January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.carrborocitizen.com/main/2008/01/24/county-board-reviews-transfer-site-complaint/#more-1719 | work=Carrboro Citizen}}</ref> Many people in the area worry about their ancestral property.<ref name=Pearce2009/>  The planned facility is expected to cost $4.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=DailyTarHeel,Gunst>{{cite news | first=Robert C. | last=Gunst, Jr. | title=Candidates debate Rogers Road waste-transfer site | date=October 16, 2007 | url =http://www.dailytarheel.com/content/candidates-debate-rogers-road-waste-transfer-site | work=The Daily Tar Heel}}</ref>\n\n==Water shortage==\nThe landfill, although modern for the time, was not constructed in a way that kept the area safe from the toxins and [[toxic waste|waste]] that leached into the ground of the surrounding area.  Tests conducted in the early months of 2010 showed that only two of the eleven [[Water well|wells]] in the Rogers Road area are supplying the area's residents with water \"within the EPA recommended limits\".<ref name=Herald-Sun,Velliquette>{{cite news | first=Beth | last=Velliquette | title=9 of 11 wells below EPA standard | date=March 17, 2010 | url =http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/6722300/article-9-of-11-wells-below-EPA-standards | work=The Herald-Sun}}</ref>\n<br />\nWater lines were eventually laid in the area but did not reach all the way down Rogers Road, and for many families, the hook-up fees that ran up costs of about $2,000 were out of the price range for many citizens in the area. The sewer hook-up fees were even more expensive, reaching about $3,000 per household. Despite the program set up by the county to give assistance to homeowners unable to afford these costs, many either could not afford the water bills that followed or did not fall low enough on the income bracket to be considered in need.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nIn February 2010, Orange County Board of Commissioners unanimously passed a resolution that is expected to plan a way to provide safe and clean water options for households located within {{convert|3000|ft|m}} of the landfill. If the plan comes to fruition, possible solutions include fixing and replacing existing wells or give the residents access to the county's public water supply by extending the lines. The residents seem hopeful that the government will choose to extend the water supply rather than simply repair the wells.<ref name=DailyTarHeel,Rinderman>{{cite news | first=Sam | last=Rinderman | title=County takes steps to fix Rogers-Eubanks water problem | date=February 3, 2010 | url =http://www.dailytarheel.com/content/rogers-eubanks-residents-receive-healthy-water-options | work=The Daily Tar Heel}}</ref>\n\n===Possible health hazards===\nPeople in the neighborhood have questioned the safety of the water since shortly after the landfill was first built in the 70s. Many noticed their loved ones coming down with cancer among other sicknesses and a change of the color of the water in which their families drank, cooked with, and bathed in. The government denied any allegations from the start that it was a result of the landfill and as a result felt no obligation to give them the amenities which they lacked.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nContaminants have been found in tests done on some of the wells in the area around the Orange County Regional Landfill. [[Vinyl Chloride]], [[tetrachloroethylene]],dichloroethene, and [[benzene]] are all chemicals that could cause health problems in high doses. The concentration of vinyl chloride was found to be 16&nbsp;mg/l when the regulations state the acceptable range to be 0.002&nbsp;mg/l-0.015&nbsp;mg/l. Dichloroethene also exceeds the standards, found at a concentration of 232&nbsp;mg/l when the accepted level falls at 70&nbsp;mg/l. Additionally, the benzene was discovered to exist at a level of 7&nbsp;mg/l when it should not be any greater than 1&nbsp;mg/l. The health effects of these chemicals are said to be dangerous if long-term exposure occurs. Lack of data to prove that the chemicals have affected the health is what maintains the rift between the beliefs of the citizens and those of the local government.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n\n==Government involvement==\nThe government has been trying to make amends in recent years, but many residents of the area see these changes as superficial attempts at \"patching\" the problem and not really fixing the source of all of the issues that the area faces. \n<br />\nA huge problem with the legislation is that Rogers Road has only some parts within city limits but other parts are transition areas between [[Carrboro, North Carolina|Carrboro]] and [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] known as \"extraterritorial planning jurisdiction.\"<ref name=Pearce2009/> This has allowed for a great deal of neglect as no one wants to take responsibility for the area that is not within the drawn city lines. \n<br />\nIn December 2006, the town of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] began developing the Rogers Road Small Area Plan. This plan is designed to provide a \"more detailed look at the impacts of providing public services in the area, especially the extension of sanitary sewer, and the impacts of developing an affordable housing site.\" It also serves as an outlet to analyze \"desirable land uses and revision to the land use plan water and sewer extension plan, roadway network, bicycle and pedestrian facilities plan, transit service plan, zoning ordinance and map amendment.\" This plan affects the Greene Tract, an area containing [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[Carrboro, North Carolina|Carrboro]], and other parts of [[Orange County, North Carolina|Orange County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townofchapelhill.org/index.aspx?page=620 |title=Rogers Road Plan |publisher=Town of Chapel Hill }}</ref> Many residents fear the loss of ancestral property in relation to this plan as well.<ref name=Pearce2009/>\n<br />\nRelated government action has started to be taken to aid communities like the Rogers-Eubanks Community. In September 2007, Senator [[Hillary Clinton]] introduced a bill titled the [http://www.washingtonwatch.com/bills/show/110_HR_5132.html Environmental Justice Renewal Act]. Despite the efforts to aid poverty-struck areas, some advocates, like [[African American Environmentalist Association|African American Environmentalist Association (AAEA)]] president Norris McDonald, feel that bills like the EJRA are insufficient and just strategic political moves to gain votes.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news | first=Amanda Griscom | last=Little | title=Not in Whose Backyard? | date=September 2, 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/02/magazine/02wwln-essay-t.html | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n<br />\nThe idea that this was an instance of racial discrimination really started to flourish in the first decade of the 21st century.<ref name=Pearce2009/> In Oct 2007, Reverend Robert Campbell, \"one of the town's leading activists for environmental justice in the Rogers Road community\"<ref name=Herald-Sun,Way>{{cite news | first=Dan E. | last=Way | title=Rogers Road activist invited to White House | date=December 2009 | url =http://www.heraldsun.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Rogers+Road+activist+invited+to+White+House%20&id=4483961-Rogers+Road+activist+invited+to+White+House | work=The Herald-Sun }}</ref> filed a complaint with the EPA in reference to the Rogers-Eubanks Community claiming that county officials had \"violated Title VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]\" and the regulations set by the EPA that prohibited discrimination. The mention of the lengthy history of such behavior, groundwater contamination, and the lack of sewer and water lines were also discussed. \n<br />\nReverend Campbell's complaint that he filed \"with the Department of Justice about the siting of the transfer station\" is not agreed upon by local government officials. The county's commissioner Barry Jacobs said that the decision was in no way a matter of racial or socioeconomic discrimination and that he is \"thinking about\" considering other sites. Having gained a great deal of national attention, the Rogers-Eubanks community coalition ensure that it became an issue in the 2007 elections, hoping that incoming politicians will see it as an issue needing repair.<ref name=CHNews>{{cite news | first=Jesse | last=Deconto |author2=Samuel Spies  |title=Transfer station is an election issue | date=October 17, 2007 | url =http://rogersroad.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/chapelhillnews101807com.pdf | work=The Chapel Hill News }}</ref>\n<br />\nReverend Robert Campbell was invited to the \"[[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]]'s green energy table\" and went in hopes of gaining a commitment for federal stimulus money to improve the water and air quality of his neighborhood. He traveled to the White House and spoke to EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius about the issues facing the Rogers-Eubanks Community. Hoping to influence policy change, discuss a national campaign for reducing, reusing, and recycling, and the suggest the expansion of testing and forming infrastructure, Rev. Campbell had great hopes for the meeting after the great response to the grant he had submitted to the EPA. The Reverend feels that if money were available, the issues of air, sewage, and water could be dealt with properly.<ref name=Herald-Sun,Way/>\n\n==Rogers-Eubanks \"Coalition to End Environmental Racism\" (CEER)==\nFounded in 2007, the Rogers-Eubanks Coalition to End Environmental Racism, often abbreviated as CEER, has a three part mission.  The first part is to undo the recent decision of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] to locate a new waste transfer center in their community.

He was initially worried that many of the players, such as [[Norman Whiteside]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]] and [[Bryan Robson]] were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.\n\nHis first game in charge was a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and then his first win (1\u20130 at home to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]) on 22 November. Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and deadly rivals Liverpool on [[Boxing Day]], it was clear that United were on the road to recovery. 1987 began on a high note with a 4\u20131 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.\n\nIn the 1987\u201388 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including [[Steve Bruce]], [[Viv Anderson]], [[Brian McClair]] and [[Jim Leighton]]. The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly still some way to go before United could be a match for their north western rivals.\n\nDuring the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda national team]] and the Somerset Cricket Club.<ref name = \"bermuda\"/> In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United first team.<ref name = \"bermuda\">{{cite web |url=http://footysphere.com/post/13169778853/alex-ferguson-bermuda-man-utd |title=Manchester United Tour of Bermuda 1987 |work=footysphere.com |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnited were expected to do well when [[Mark Hughes]] returned to the club two years after leaving for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but the [[1988\u201389 Manchester United F.C. season|1988\u201389 season]] was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1\u20130 at home to Nottingham Forest in the [[1988\u201389 FA Cup#Sixth Round Proper|FA Cup sixth round]]. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.\n\nFor the [[1989\u201390 Manchester United F.C. season|1989\u201390 season]], Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders [[Neil Webb]], [[Mike Phelan]], and [[Paul Ince]], as well as defender [[Gary Pallister]] and winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]]. The season began well with a 4\u20131 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5\u20131 away defeat against [[Manchester derby|fierce rivals]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, \"Three years of excuses and it's still crap&nbsp;... ta-ra Fergie.\" was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked.<ref name=\"3years\">{{cite news|title=Arise Sir Alex?|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354282.stm|accessdate=3 December 2005|date=27 May 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Alex Ferguson's 20 years at Manchester United|work=BBC Sport|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6113634.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=6 November 2006}}</ref> Ferguson later described December 1989 as \"the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game\", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferguson hungry for more success|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8062015.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=22 May 2009|first=David|last=Ornstein}}</ref><ref name=\"jc27\">{{cite book|first=Alex|last=Ferguson|author2=Peter Fitton|title=Just Champion!|publisher=Manchester United Football Club plc|year=1993|isbn=0-9520509-1-9|page=27}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup.

United's defensive frailties in the first match were unilaterally blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton, forcing Ferguson to drop his former Aberdeen player and bring in [[Les Sealey]].\n\n====United's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds====\n{{blp sources|section|date=March 2019}}\nAlthough United's league form improved greatly in [[1990\u201391 Manchester United F.C. season|1990\u201391]], they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6\u20132 demolition of Arsenal at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]], but results like an early 2\u20131 loss at newly promoted [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a 4\u20130 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2\u20130 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect [[Ryan Giggs]] made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.\n\nEven after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed where all the other managers since [[Matt Busby]] had failed&nbsp;\u2013 to win the league title.<ref name=\"Pressure\"/> They were runners-up in the [[1991 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. However, they won the [[1991 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]], beating that season's Spanish champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] 2\u20131. It would be United's only Cup Winners' Cup title. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.<ref name=\"mml302\">Ferguson, p. 302</ref>\n\nDuring the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to [[Walter Smith]], and Ferguson promoted youth team coach [[Brian Kidd]] to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings \u2013 goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] and defender [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]] \u2013 to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990\u201391 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of [[Lee Sharpe]], who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders [[Mike Phelan]] and Bryan Robson.\n\nThe [[1991\u201392 Manchester United F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]] did not live up to Ferguson's expectations and, in Ferguson's words, \"many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery\".<ref name=\"mml311\">Ferguson, p. 311</ref> United won the [[1992 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] and [[1991 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]]; both for the first time, but lost out on the [[1991\u201392 Football League#First Division 2|league title]] to rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of [[Mick Harford]] from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] had cost United the league, and that he needed \"an extra dimension\" to the team if they were to win the league the following season.<ref name=\"mml320\">Ferguson, p. 320</ref>\n\nDuring the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign [[Alan Shearer]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but lost out to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]], but manager [[Trevor Francis]] rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid \u00a31&nbsp;million for 23-year-old [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] striker [[Dion Dublin]] \u2013 his only major signing of the summer.\n\nAfter a slow start to the [[1992\u201393 Manchester United F.C. season|1992\u201393 season]] by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|league]] title yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker [[Eric Cantona]] from Leeds for \u00a31.2&nbsp;million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson's position as manager, began to look bright. Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before [[Steve Bruce]] equalised. After 7 minutes of injury time \u2013 which was subsequently dubbed \u201cFergie Time\u201d, alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson\u2019s teams to get a goal \u2013 Bruce scored the 97th minute winner, with Ferguson [[goal celebration|celebrating the goal]] by running from his dugout on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran on to the field.<ref name=\"Fergie Time\">{{cite news |title=From the Vault: Manchester United, 'Fergie Time' and Steve Bruce's headers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/10/vault-steve-bruce-headers-manchester-united |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Seen as being a decisive victory, it put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United's 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first [[List of English football champions#Premier League (1992\u2013present)|Premier League champions]]. United finished with a ten-point margin over runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], whose 1\u20130 defeat at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on 2 May 1993 had given United the title.

Ferguson was the very first winner of the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] award, introduced for the start of the 1993\u201394 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being [[Foul (association football)|sent off]] twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3\u20131 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4\u20130 scoreline against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning Ferguson his second [[Double (association football)#England|League and Cup Double]], following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984\u201385, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.\n\nFerguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn \u00a31.2&nbsp;million for [[David May (footballer)|David May]]. There were newspaper reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker [[Chris Sutton]] from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn instead. [[1994\u201395 Manchester United F.C. season|1994\u201395]] was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a Crystal Palace supporter in a game at [[Selhurst Park]], and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. On the brighter side, United paid a British record fee of \u00a37&nbsp;million for Newcastle United's prolific striker [[Andy Cole]], with young winger [[Keith Gillespie]] heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players [[Gary Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1\u20131 with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1\u20130 defeat by Everton.\n\n====1995\u201398====\nFerguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] of Italy for \u00a37.5&nbsp;million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a \u00a31.5&nbsp;million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton. Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would be known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\", included Gary Neville, [[Phil Neville]], [[David Beckham]], Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the [[1995\u201396 Manchester United F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]] began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA youthful United team lost 3\u20131 in their opening league game of the 1995\u201396 season, against Aston Villa.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferguson watches seeds of doubt grow |first=Keith |last=Pike |page=23 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=21 August 1995}}</ref> On ''[[Match of the Day]]'', pundit [[Alan Hansen]] criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, \"You can't win anything with kids.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15527986 |work=BBC Sport |first=Alan |last=Hansen |title=Sir Alex Ferguson 25 years: 'You can't win anything with kids' |date=2 November 2011|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995.

A second-round exit from the European Cup at the hands of Milan and a semi-final exit from the League Cup at the hands of eventual winners Chelsea (who also clinched the Premier League title) meant that 2004\u201305 was a rare instance of a trophyless season for United.

In spite of this, United looked to solve their goalkeeping and midfield problems. For this, they signed the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] goalkeeper [[Edwin van der Sar]] from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[South Korea national football team|Korean]] star [[Park Ji-sung]] from PSV.\n\nThe season was one of transition. On 18 November, Roy Keane officially left the club, his contract ended by mutual consent. United failed to qualify for the knock-out phase of the UEFA Champions' League. In the January transfer window, Serbian defender [[Nemanja Vidi\u0107]] and French full-back [[Patrice Evra]] were signed, and the side finished in second place in the league, behind runaway leaders Chelsea.

He briefly managed [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] following the death of [[Jock Stein]], taking the team to the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].\n\nFerguson was appointed manager of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in November 1986.

[[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]] signed him the following summer (1964), and Ferguson became a full-time professional footballer.\n\nThe following season ([[1964\u201365 in Scottish football|1964\u201365]]), Dunfermline were strong challengers for the Scottish League and reached the [[1965 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup Final]], but Ferguson was dropped for the final after a poor performance in a league game against St Johnstone. Dunfermline lost the final 3\u20132 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], then failed to win the League by one point. The [[1965\u201366 in Scottish football|1965\u201366]] season saw Ferguson notch up 45 goals in 51 games for Dunfermline.

He remained at Brockville for four years gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere; in light of his experience he was promoted to player-coach, but when [[John Prentice (footballer born 1926)|John Prentice]] became manager he removed Ferguson's coaching responsibilities.

He did not speak to her for six weeks, confiscated her keys and communicated only through a 17-year-old assistant.

Todd explained that the fundamental reason for the dismissal was a breach of contract relating to Ferguson having agreed to join Aberdeen. Ferguson told journalist Jim Rodger of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' that he had asked at least one member of the squad to go to Aberdeen with him. He told the St Mirren staff he was leaving.

Although Aberdeen were one of Scotland's major clubs they had won the league only once, in [[1954\u201355 in Scottish football|1955]] under [[Dave Halliday]]. The team had been playing well, however, and had not lost a league match since the previous December, having finished second in the league the previous season.<ref name=\"boss159\">Crick, p. 159</ref> Ferguson had now been a manager for four years, but was still not much older than some of the players and had trouble winning the respect of some of the older ones such as [[Joe Harper]].<ref name=\"boss171\">Crick, p. 171</ref> The season did not go especially well, with Aberdeen reaching the semi-final of the [[Scottish Cup]] and the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (March)|Scottish League Cup Final]], but losing both matches and [[1978\u201379 Scottish Premier Division|finishing fourth in the league]].\n\nAberdeen lost the [[1979 Scottish League Cup Final (December)|1979\u201380 Scottish League Cup Final]], this time to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] after a replay. Ferguson took the blame for the defeat, saying he should have made changes to the team for the replay.<ref name=\"boss174\">Crick, p. 174</ref>\n\n====1980s and silverware====\nAberdeen had started the [[1979\u201380 Scottish Football League|1979\u201380 season]] poorly but their form improved dramatically in the new year and they won the Scottish league that season with a 5\u20130 win on the final day. It was the first time in 15 years that the league had not been won by either Rangers or Celtic. Ferguson now felt that he had the respect of his players, later saying \"That was the achievement which united us. I finally had the players believing in me\".<ref name=\"boss175\">Crick, p. 175</ref>\n\nHe was still a strict disciplinarian, though, and his players nicknamed him \"Furious Fergie\". He fined one of his players, [[John Hewitt (footballer)|John Hewitt]], for overtaking him on a public road,<ref name=\"boss179\">Crick, p. 179</ref> and kicked a tea urn at the players at half time after a poor first half.<ref name=\"boss180\">Crick, p. 180</ref> He was dissatisfied with the atmosphere at Aberdeen matches, and deliberately created a \"[[siege mentality]]\" by accusing the Scottish media of being biased towards the Glasgow clubs, to motivate the team.<ref name=\"boss191\">Crick, p. 191</ref> The team continued their success with a Scottish Cup win in [[1982 Scottish Cup Final|1982]].

Ferguson had been appointed to the club's board of directors early in 1986, but that April he told [[Dick Donald]], their chairman, that he intended to leave that summer.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nFerguson had been part of coaching staff for the [[Scotland national football team|Scottish national side]] during qualifying for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]], but manager [[Jock Stein]] had [[1985 Wales vs Scotland football match|collapsed and died on 10 September 1985]] \u2013 at the end of the game in which Scotland qualified from their group for a play-off against [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]]. Ferguson promptly agreed to take charge of the Scottish national side against the Australians and subsequently at the World Cup. To allow him to fulfil his international duties he appointed [[Archie Knox]] as his co-manager at Aberdeen. However, after Scotland failed to progress past the group stages of the World Cup, Ferguson stepped down as national team manager on 15 June 1986.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YNJAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1aYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6630,3393659&dq=manchester-united+ferguson|title=Fergie Steps Down|date=16 June 1986|work=Evening Times|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nAround this time, Tottenham Hotspur offered Ferguson the chance to take over from [[Peter Shreeves]] as manager, but he rejected this offer and the job went to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town's]] [[David Pleat]] instead.

He was initially worried that many of the players, such as [[Norman Whiteside]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]] and [[Bryan Robson]] were drinking too much and was \"depressed\" by their level of fitness, but he managed to increase the players' discipline and United climbed up the table to finish the season in 11th place, having been 21st (second from bottom) when he took over.\n\nHis first game in charge was a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] on 8 November, followed seven days later by a goalless draw at newly promoted [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], and then his first win (1\u20130 at home to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]) on 22 November. Results steadily improved as the season went on, and by the time they recorded what would be their only away win of the league campaign at title challengers and deadly rivals Liverpool on [[Boxing Day]], it was clear that United were on the road to recovery. 1987 began on a high note with a 4\u20131 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and United gradually pulled together in the second half of the season, with relatively occasional defeats on the way, and finished 11th in the final table. Ferguson's mother Elizabeth died of lung cancer, aged 64, three weeks after his appointment. Ferguson hired Archie Knox, his assistant at Aberdeen, in the same role at Manchester United in 1986.\n\nIn the 1987\u201388 season, Ferguson made several major signings, including [[Steve Bruce]], [[Viv Anderson]], [[Brian McClair]] and [[Jim Leighton]]. The new players made a great contribution to a United team who finished in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Liverpool's points lead, however, had been in double digits for most of the season and while United had lost only five league games all season, they drew 12 games and there was clearly still some way to go before United could be a match for their north western rivals.\n\nDuring the season, United played two friendly matches in Bermuda against the [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda national team]] and the Somerset Cricket Club.<ref name = \"bermuda\"/> In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant Archie Knox took to the field, with Knox even getting on the scoresheet. The match was Ferguson's only appearance for the Manchester United first team.<ref name = \"bermuda\">{{cite web |url=http://footysphere.com/post/13169778853/alex-ferguson-bermuda-man-utd |title=Manchester United Tour of Bermuda 1987 |work=footysphere.com |accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nUnited were expected to do well when [[Mark Hughes]] returned to the club two years after leaving for [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but the [[1988\u201389 Manchester United F.C. season|1988\u201389 season]] was a disappointment for them, finishing 11th in the league and losing 1\u20130 at home to Nottingham Forest in the [[1988\u201389 FA Cup#Sixth Round Proper|FA Cup sixth round]]. They had begun the season slowly, going on a nine-match winless run throughout October and November (with one defeat and eight draws) before a run of generally good results took them to third place and the fringes of the title challenge by mid February. However, another run of disappointing results in the final quarter of the season saw them fall down to mid-table.\n\nFor the [[1989\u201390 Manchester United F.C. season|1989\u201390 season]], Ferguson further boosted his squad by paying large sums of money for midfielders [[Neil Webb]], [[Mike Phelan]], and [[Paul Ince]], as well as defender [[Gary Pallister]] and winger [[Danny Wallace (footballer)|Danny Wallace]]. The season began well with a 4\u20131 win over defending champions Arsenal on the opening day, but United's league form quickly turned sour. In September, United suffered a humiliating 5\u20131 away defeat against [[Manchester derby|fierce rivals]] [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Following this and an early season run of six defeats and two draws in eight games, a banner declaring, \"Three years of excuses and it's still crap&nbsp;... ta-ra Fergie.\" was displayed at Old Trafford, and many journalists and supporters called for Ferguson to be sacked.<ref name=\"3years\">{{cite news|title=Arise Sir Alex?|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/05/99/uniteds_treble_triumph/354282.stm|accessdate=3 December 2005|date=27 May 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Sir Alex Ferguson's 20 years at Manchester United|work=BBC Sport|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6113634.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=6 November 2006}}</ref> Ferguson later described December 1989 as \"the darkest period [he had] ever suffered in the game\", as United ended the decade just outside the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferguson hungry for more success|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/8062015.stm|accessdate=11 August 2011|date=22 May 2009|first=David|last=Ornstein}}</ref><ref name=\"jc27\">{{cite book|first=Alex|last=Ferguson|author2=Peter Fitton|title=Just Champion!|publisher=Manchester United Football Club plc|year=1993|isbn=0-9520509-1-9|page=27}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a run of seven games without a win, Manchester United were drawn away to Nottingham Forest in the third round of the FA Cup.

United's defensive frailties in the first match were unilaterally blamed on goalkeeper Jim Leighton, forcing Ferguson to drop his former Aberdeen player and bring in [[Les Sealey]].\n\n====United's European firsts and Ferguson's seconds====\n{{blp sources|section|date=March 2019}}\nAlthough United's league form improved greatly in [[1990\u201391 Manchester United F.C. season|1990\u201391]], they were still inconsistent and finished sixth. There were some excellent performances that season, including a 6\u20132 demolition of Arsenal at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]], but results like an early 2\u20131 loss at newly promoted [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], a 4\u20130 September hammering by Liverpool at Anfield, and a 2\u20130 home defeat by [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in early March (the game where 17-year-old talented prospect [[Ryan Giggs]] made his senior debut) showed that United still had some way to go.\n\nEven after the FA Cup victory in the previous season, some still had doubts about Ferguson's ability to succeed where all the other managers since [[Matt Busby]] had failed&nbsp;\u2013 to win the league title.<ref name=\"Pressure\"/> They were runners-up in the [[1991 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]], losing 1\u20130 to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. However, they won the [[1991 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|European Cup Winners' Cup]], beating that season's Spanish champions [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] 2\u20131. It would be United's only Cup Winners' Cup title. After the match, Ferguson vowed that United would win the league the following season, and at long last he seemed to have won over the last of his sceptics after nearly five years in the job.<ref name=\"mml302\">Ferguson, p. 302</ref>\n\nDuring the 1991 close season, Ferguson's assistant Archie Knox departed to Rangers to become assistant to [[Walter Smith]], and Ferguson promoted youth team coach [[Brian Kidd]] to the role of assistant manager in Knox's place. He also made two major signings \u2013 goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] and defender [[Paul Parker (footballer)|Paul Parker]] \u2013 to bolster his side. There was much anticipation about the breakthrough of the young Ryan Giggs, who had played twice and scored once in the 1990\u201391 campaign, and the earlier emergence of another impressive young winger in the shape of [[Lee Sharpe]], who despite their youth had made Ferguson feel able to resist plunging into the transfer market and buying a new player to take over from the disappointing Danny Wallace on the left wing. He had also added Soviet midfielder [[Andrei Kanchelskis]] to the right wing, giving him a more attacking alternative to older midfielders [[Mike Phelan]] and Bryan Robson.\n\nThe [[1991\u201392 Manchester United F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]] did not live up to Ferguson's expectations and, in Ferguson's words, \"many in the media felt that [his] mistakes had contributed to the misery\".<ref name=\"mml311\">Ferguson, p. 311</ref> United won the [[1992 Football League Cup Final|League Cup]] and [[1991 European Super Cup|European Super Cup]]; both for the first time, but lost out on the [[1991\u201392 Football League#First Division 2|league title]] to rivals [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] after leading the table for much of the season. A shortage of goals and being held to draws by teams they had been expected to beat in the second half of the campaign had proved to be the undoing of a United side who had performed so well in the first half of the season. Ferguson felt that his failure to secure the signing of [[Mick Harford]] from [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] had cost United the league, and that he needed \"an extra dimension\" to the team if they were to win the league the following season.<ref name=\"mml320\">Ferguson, p. 320</ref>\n\nDuring the 1992 close season, Ferguson went on the hunt for a new striker. He first attempted to sign [[Alan Shearer]] from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but lost out to [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. He also made at least one approach for the Sheffield Wednesday striker [[David Hirst (footballer)|David Hirst]], but manager [[Trevor Francis]] rejected all offers and the player stayed put. In the end, he paid \u00a31&nbsp;million for 23-year-old [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] striker [[Dion Dublin]] \u2013 his only major signing of the summer.\n\nAfter a slow start to the [[1992\u201393 Manchester United F.C. season|1992\u201393 season]] by sitting 10th at the beginning of November, it looked as though United would miss out on the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|league]] title yet again. However, after the purchase of French striker [[Eric Cantona]] from Leeds for \u00a31.2&nbsp;million, the future of Manchester United, and Ferguson's position as manager, began to look bright. Cantona formed a strong partnership with Mark Hughes. On 10 April 1993, United were second in the league when they faced Sheffield Wednesday at home. United were losing with four minutes to go before [[Steve Bruce]] equalised. After 7 minutes of injury time \u2013 which was subsequently dubbed \u201cFergie Time\u201d, alluding to extra minutes allegedly being granted to Ferguson\u2019s teams to get a goal \u2013 Bruce scored the 97th minute winner, with Ferguson [[goal celebration|celebrating the goal]] by running from his dugout on to the touch line, while assistant Brian Kidd ran on to the field.<ref name=\"Fergie Time\">{{cite news |title=From the Vault: Manchester United, 'Fergie Time' and Steve Bruce's headers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/10/vault-steve-bruce-headers-manchester-united |accessdate=15 October 2018 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Seen as being a decisive victory, it put United top of the league, where they remained. Winning the title ended United's 26-year wait for a league title, and also made them the first [[List of English football champions#Premier League (1992\u2013present)|Premier League champions]]. United finished with a ten-point margin over runners-up [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], whose 1\u20130 defeat at [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on 2 May 1993 had given United the title. Ferguson was later voted [[LMA Manager of the Year|Manager of the Year]] by the [[League Managers' Association]].\n\n====1993\u201395: Double win and loss====\n{{blp unsourced section|date=March 2019}}\nThe [[1993\u201394 Manchester United F.C. season|1993\u201394 season]] brought more success. Ferguson added Nottingham Forest's 22-year-old midfielder [[Roy Keane]] to the ranks for a British record fee of \u00a33.75&nbsp;million as a long term replacement for Bryan Robson, who was nearing the end of his career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/23/roy-keane-career-highs-lows |title=The highs and lows of Roy Keane's career |date=23 April 2009 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |work=The Guardian |location=London }}</ref> United led the [[1993\u201394 Premier League]] table virtually from start to finish. Ferguson was the very first winner of the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] award, introduced for the start of the 1993\u201394 season, when he collected the accolade for August 1993. Cantona was top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions despite being [[Foul (association football)|sent off]] twice in the space of five days in March 1994. United also reached the League Cup final but lost 3\u20131 to Aston Villa, managed by Ferguson's predecessor, Ron Atkinson. In the FA Cup final, Manchester United achieved an impressive 4\u20130 scoreline against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning Ferguson his second [[Double (association football)#England|League and Cup Double]], following his Scottish Premier Division and Scottish Cup titles with Aberdeen in 1984\u201385, though the League Cup final defeat meant that he had not yet achieved a repeat of the treble that he had achieved with Aberdeen in 1983.\n\nFerguson made only one close-season signing, paying Blackburn \u00a31.2&nbsp;million for [[David May (footballer)|David May]]. There were newspaper reports that Ferguson was also going to sign highly rated 21-year-old striker [[Chris Sutton]] from Norwich City, but the player headed for Blackburn instead. [[1994\u201395 Manchester United F.C. season|1994\u201395]] was a harder season for Ferguson. Cantona assaulted a Crystal Palace supporter in a game at [[Selhurst Park]], and it seemed likely he would leave English football. An eight-month ban saw Cantona miss the final four months of the season. He also received a 14-day prison sentence for the offence but the sentence was quashed on appeal and replaced by a 120-hour community service order. On the brighter side, United paid a British record fee of \u00a37&nbsp;million for Newcastle United's prolific striker [[Andy Cole]], with young winger [[Keith Gillespie]] heading to the north-east in exchange. The season also saw the breakthrough of young players [[Gary Neville]], [[Nicky Butt]] and [[Paul Scholes]], who provided excellent cover for the long periods that United were left without some of their more experienced stars. However, the championship slipped out of Manchester United's grasp as they drew 1\u20131 with [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on the final day of the season, when a win would have given them a third successive league title. United also lost the FA Cup final in a 1\u20130 defeat by Everton.\n\n====1995\u201398====\nFerguson was heavily criticised in the summer of 1995 when three of United's star players were allowed to leave and replacements were not bought. First Paul Ince moved to [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] of Italy for \u00a37.5&nbsp;million, long-serving striker Mark Hughes was sold to Chelsea in a \u00a31.5&nbsp;million deal, and Andrei Kanchelskis was sold to Everton. Ferguson felt that United had a number of young players who were ready to play in the first team. The youngsters, who would be known as \"Fergie's Fledglings\", included Gary Neville, [[Phil Neville]], [[David Beckham]], Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, who would all go on to be important members of the team. And so the [[1995\u201396 Manchester United F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]] began without a major signing, at a time when the likes of Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle were making the headlines with big-money signings.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA youthful United team lost 3\u20131 in their opening league game of the 1995\u201396 season, against Aston Villa.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ferguson watches seeds of doubt grow |first=Keith |last=Pike |page=23 |newspaper=The Times |location=London |date=21 August 1995}}</ref> On ''[[Match of the Day]]'', pundit [[Alan Hansen]] criticised their performance, ending his analysis with the words, \"You can't win anything with kids.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15527986 |work=BBC Sport |first=Alan |last=Hansen |title=Sir Alex Ferguson 25 years: 'You can't win anything with kids' |date=2 November 2011|accessdate=9 May 2013}}</ref> United won their next five matches and were boosted by the return of Cantona, who made his comeback against Liverpool in October 1995.

The gap increased to 12 points, but a series of wins, coupled with Newcastle dropping points, meant by late March, United moved to the top of the table.

It has a gray color with a greenish tint in reflected [[light]]. W\u00fcstite crystallizes in the [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric-hexoctahedral]] crystal system in opaque to translucent metallic grains. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 5 to 5.5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 5.88. W\u00fcstite is a typical example of a [[non-stoichiometric compound]].\n\nW\u00fcstite was named for [[Fritz W\u00fcst]] (1860\u20131938), a German [[metallurgist]] and founding director of the ''Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut f\u00fcr Eisenforschung'' (presently [[Max Planck Institute for Iron Research GmbH]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schenck|first1=Rudolf|last2=Dingmann|first2=Thomas|date=1927|title=Gleichgewichtsuntersuchungen \u00fcber die Reduktions-, Oxydations- und Kohlungsvorg\u00e4nge beim Eisen III|trans-title=Stoichiometric studies on the reduction, oxidation and carbonation processes in iron III|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr anorganische und allgemeine Chemie|volume=166|page=113\u2013154}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the type locality in Germany, it has been reported from [[Disko Island]], Greenland; the [[Jharia]] coalfield, [[Jharkhand]], India and as inclusions in [[diamond]]s in a number of [[kimberlite]] pipes. It also is reported from deep sea [[manganese nodule]]s.\n\nIts presence indicates a highly [[Redox|reducing]] environment.\n\n== W\u00fcstite redox buffer ==\n{{main article|Mineral redox buffer}}\n\nW\u00fcstite, in geochemistry, defines a ''redox buffer'' of oxidation within rocks at which point the rock is so reduced that Fe<sup>3+</sup>,and thus [[hematite]], is absent.\n\nAs the redox state of a rock is further reduced, [[magnetite]] is converted to w\u00fcstite. This occurs by conversion of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions in magnetite to Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions. An example reaction is presented below:\n:<chem>\\underset{magnetite}{FeO.Fe2O3} + \\underset{graphite/diamond}{C} -> {3FeO} + \\underset{carbon\\ monoxide}{CO}</chem>\n\nThe formula for magnetite is more accurately written as FeO\u00b7Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> than as Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. Magnetite is one part FeO and one part Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, rather than a [[solid solution]] of w\u00fcstite and hematite. The magnetite is termed a ''redox buffer'' because until all Fe<sup>3+</sup> magnetite is converted to Fe<sup>2+</sup> the oxide mineral assemblage of [[iron]] remains w\u00fcstite-magnetite, and furthermore the redox state of the rock remains at the same level of [[oxygen]] [[fugacity]]. This is similar to buffering in the H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>\u2212</sup> acid\u2013base system of water.\n\nOnce the Fe<sup>3+</sup> is consumed, then oxygen must be stripped from the system to further reduce it and w\u00fcstite is converted to native iron. The oxide mineral equilibrium assemblage of the rock becomes w\u00fcstite\u2013magnetite\u2013iron.\n\nIn nature, the only natural systems which are chemically reduced enough to even attain a w\u00fcstite\u2013magnetite composition are rare, including carbonate-rich [[skarn]]s, meteorites, [[fulgurite]]s and lightning-affected rock, and perhaps the mantle where reduced carbon is present, exemplified by the presence of [[diamond]] or [[graphite]].\n\n=== Effects upon silicate minerals ===\n{{main|Normative mineralogy}}\n\nThe ratio of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup> within a rock determines, in part, the silicate mineral assemblage of the rock. Within a rock of a given chemical composition, iron enters minerals based on the bulk chemical composition and the mineral phases which are stable at that temperature and pressure. Iron may only enter minerals such as [[pyroxene]] and [[olivine]] if it is present as Fe<sup>2+</sup>; Fe<sup>3+</sup> cannot enter the lattice of [[fayalite]] olivine and thus for every two Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions, one Fe<sup>2+</sup> is used and one molecule of magnetite is created.\n\nIn chemically-reduced rocks, magnetite may be absent due to the propensity of iron to enter olivine, and w\u00fcstite may only be present if there is an excess of iron above what can be used by silica. Thus, w\u00fcstite may only be found in silica-undersaturated compositions which are also heavily chemically reduced, satisfying both the need to remove all Fe<sup>3+</sup> and to maintain iron outside of silicate minerals.\n\nIn nature, carbonate rocks, potentially [[carbonatite]], [[kimberlite]]s, carbonate-bearing melilitic rocks and other rare alkaline rocks may satisfy these criteria. However, w\u00fcstite is not reported in most of these rocks in nature, potentially because the redox state necessary to drive magnetite to w\u00fcstite is so rare.\n\n==Role in nitrogen fixation==\nApproximately 2-3% of the world's energy budget is allocated to the [[Haber Process]] for nitrogen fixation, which relies on w\u00fcstite-derived catalysts. The industrial catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, which is usually obtained by reduction of high-purity [[magnetite]] (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite or w\u00fcstite of a defined particle size. The magnetite (or w\u00fcstite) particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the [[oxygen]] in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of w\u00fcstite, which in turn is surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high-surface-area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst.<ref name=\"jozwiak\">{{cite journal | last1 = Jozwiak | first1 = W.
