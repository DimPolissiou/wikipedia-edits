This group had spent weeks traversing difficult terrain and brush, cutting a road through the [[Wasatch Mountains]], coming through Emigration canyon into the Salt Lake Valley on August 12, 1846.  This same path would be used by the vanguard company of [[Mormon pioneers]], and for many years after that by those following them to Salt Lake.<ref>[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/donnerparty.html \"The Donner Party\"] by Dale Beecher, Utah History Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[Image:salt lake city 1850.jpg|thumb|400px|Salt Lake City in 1850.]]\nOn July 24, 1847 143 men, three women and two children founded Great Salt Lake City several miles to the east of the [[Great Salt Lake]], nestled in the northern most reaches of the Salt Lake Valley.  At the time of its founding there were no Native Americans present in the Salt Lake valley. The first two in this company to enter the Salt Lake valley were [[Orson Pratt]] and [[Erastus Snow]].  These members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (\"LDS Church\") sought to establish an autonomous religious community and were the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the area now known as [[Utah]]. Thousands of [[Mormon pioneers]] would arrive in Salt Lake in the coming months and years.\n\n[[Brigham Young]] led the Saints west after the [[death of Joseph Smith]].  Upon arrival to the Salt Lake valley, Young had a vision by saying, \"It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on.\"  (This is commonly shortened to, \"This is the place\"). There is a state park in Salt Lake City known as [[This Is The Place Heritage Park]] commemorating the spot where Young made the famous statement.\n\nSalt Lake City was originally settled by Latter-day Saint Pioneers to be the New Zion according to church President and leader Brigham Young. Young originally governed both the territory and church by a [[High council (Latter-day Saints)|High council]] which enacted the original municipal orders in 1848. This system was later replaced with a [[city council]] and mayor style government.\n\nAfter a very difficult winter and a miraculous crop retrieval, in which Pioneers reported to have been saved from cricket infestation by seagulls (see [[Miracle of the Gulls]]), the \"Desert Blossomed as the Rose\" in the Salt Lake Valley. Early Pioneers survived by maintaining a very tight-knit community. Under Young's leadership Pioneers worked out a system of communal crop sharing within the various ward houses established throughout the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nThe [[California Gold Rush]] brought many people through the city on their way to seek fortunes. Salt Lake, which was at the cross-roads of the westward trek, became a vital trading point for [[speculator]]s and [[Prospecting|prospectors]] traveling through. They came with goods from the [[East Coast of the United States|East]], such as [[clothing]] and other [[manufacturing|manufactured]] items, trading with the local [[farmers]] for fresh [[livestock]] and [[agriculture|crops]].\n\nThe [[United States Congress|Congress]] organized the [[Utah Territory]] out of the \"[[State of Deseret]]\" in 1850, and a few months later on January 6, 1851 the city was formally organized as \"The City of the Great Salt Lake\". Originally, [[Fillmore, Utah]] was the [[Utah Territory|territorial]] [[Capital (political)|capital]], but in 1856 it was moved to Salt Lake City, where it has stayed ever since. The city's name was officially changed to \"Salt Lake City\" at the same time.\n\nIn 1857, when the Mormon practice of [[polygamy]] came to national awareness, President [[James Buchanan]] responded to public outcry by sending an army of 2500 soldiers, called the Utah Expedition, to investigate the LDS Church and install a non-LDS governor to replace [[Brigham Young]]. In response, Brigham Young imposed [[martial law]], sending the Utah militia to harass the soldiers, a conflict called the [[Utah War]]. Young eventually surrendered to federal control when the new territorial governor, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]], arrived in Salt Lake City on April 12, 1858. Most troops pulled out at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].\n\nIn order to secure the road to California during the Civil War, more troops arrived under the command of Colonel [[Patrick Edward Connor]] in 1862. They settled in the [[Fort Douglas (Utah)|Fort Douglas]] area east of the city. Thoroughly anti-LDS, Connor viewed the people with disdain, calling them, \"a community of traitors, murderers, fanatics, and whores.\" To dilute their influence he worked with non-LDS business and bank owners, and also encouraged mining. In 1863 some of his troops discovered rich veins of [[gold]] and [[silver]] in the Wasatch Mountains.\n\nIn 1868 Brigham Young founded the [[Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution]] (ZCMI) as a way to ward off dependency on outside goods and arguably to hinder ex-LDS retailers. Although ZCMI is sometimes credited with being the nation's first department store, a decade earlier New York City's \"Marble Palace\" and [[Macy's]] vied for that title.\n\nChange was inevitable. The world started to come to Salt Lake City in 1869 with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad (North America)|First Transcontinental Railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit]], north of the city. By 1870 Salt Lake had been linked to it via the [[Utah Central Rail Road (1869-1881)|Utah Central Rail Road]]. People began to pour into Salt Lake seeking opportunities in mining and other industries.\n\n[[Image:Salt Lake City 1869 WH Jackson.jpg|thumb|Street view, Salt Lake City, 1869]]\nCity government was dominated by the [[People's Party (Utah)|People's Party]] until 1890. The non-national People's Party was an LDS-controlled political organization, and each of the early mayors of Salt Lake City was LDS. Sparks often flew between LDS city government and non-LDS federal authorities stationed just outside Salt Lake. A dramatic example occurred in 1874 when city police were arrested by [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]], who took control of the national election being held in Salt Lake City. Mayor [[Daniel H. Wells]], a member of the LDS Church [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], declared [[martial law]] from the balcony of the [[Salt Lake City Council Hall|Old Salt Lake City Hall]]. Federal troops arrested the mayor, but he was soon released.\n\nIn the 1880s, the anti-[[Plural marriage|polygamy]] [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]] systematically denied many prominent LDS Church members the right to vote or hold office. Polygamists were detained in a Federal prison just outside Salt Lake in the [[Sugar House (Salt Lake City)|Sugar House]] area. Consequentially, the non-LDS [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]] took control of City government in the 1890 election. Three years later the Liberal Party and People's Party dissolved into national parties anticipating Utah statehood, but both LDS and non-LDS leaders would govern Salt Lake City from that point onward.\n\nThe city became Utah's state capital on January 4, 1896, when Utah entered the union upon [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]]'s decree after the LDS Church agreed to ban polygamy in 1890.\n\n==The 20th Century==\nIn 1907, Salt Lake City was home to [[Industrial Workers of the World]] Industrial Union No. 202.<ref name=\"IUB V1 N26\">{{cite news |author=<!-- No author listed. --> |publication-date=24 August 1907 |title=Statement of Receipts and Expenditures |volume=1 |issue=26 |page=3 |newspaper=[[Industrial Union Bulletin]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v1n26-aug-24-1907-iub }}</ref>\n\nThe city adopted a non-partisan city council in 1911. As LDS/non-LDS tensions eased people began to work together for the common good, improving roads, utilities and public healthcare.\n\n[[Image:Salt Lake City 1913 panorama.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Downtown Salt Lake City circa 1913]]\n[[Image:SLC,1909.jpg|thumb|right|Salt Lake City suburb, 1909]]\n[[Image:SLCBeer.jpg|thumb|right|Armed delivery of liquor & beer, 1917]]\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] hit Salt Lake City especially hard. At its peak, the [[unemployment rate]] reached 61,500 people, about 36%. The annual [[per capita income]] in 1932 was $276, half of what it was in 1929, $537 annually. Jobs were scarce. Although boosted by federal [[New Deal]] programs as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the economy did not fully recover until [[World War II]].\n\nAfter suffering through the depression Salt Lake's economy was boosted during World War II due to the influx of [[defense industry|defense industries]] to the Wasatch Front. Demands for raw materials increased Utah's [[mining]] industry, and several military installations such as Fort Douglas and [[Hill Air Force Base]] were added.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Salt Lake City grew rapidly. It began to suffer some of the same problems other cities face. [[Urban sprawl]] became a growing problem due to a combination of rapid growth and an abundance of available land. Military and [[aerospace]] also became dominant industries.\n\nSalt Lake began its bid for the Winter Olympics as early as the 1930s, when the Utah Ski Club tried to bring the games to the valley. At the time, however, the [[Summer Olympic]] host city had the option of hosting the winter games, and all attempts failed. Salt Lake tried again throughout the decades until 1995, when the [[International Olympic Committee]] announced Salt Lake City as the site of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].\n\nAfter 132 years in business, ZCMI was sold to the [[May Department Stores Company]] in 1999. Remaining ZCMI stores, including one in downtown Salt Lake City, were converted into [[Meier & Frank]] stores, although the facade still reads \"1868 ZCMI 1999\".\n\nIn April 1999, the Salt Lake City council voted 5 to 2 along LDS membership lines to sell to the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] the segment of Main Street that lay between [[Temple Square]] and the LDS Church office buildings for $8.1 million. The Church planned to build a large plaza on the land as well as a parking structure below. There was much public outcry about the sale of public lands to a private organization, but a Church representative assured residents that the plaza would be a \"little bit of Paris\", a characterization that would be used against the LDS Church later. Concerns also lay in plans to ban such activities as demonstrations, skateboarding, sunbathing, smoking, and other activities it considered \"vulgar\". The Utah [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] believed that these restrictions were incompatible with the pedestrian [[easement]] that the city retained over the plaza. ACLU attorneys claimed this made the plaza into a public free speech forum. Nonetheless, the property was sold to become the [[Main Street Plaza (Salt Lake City)|Main Street Plaza]]. After the Utah [[United States district court|District Court]] ruled against the ACLU, they were vindicated by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court]] in the Fall of 2002. Scrambling to satisfy residents, [[Rocky Anderson]] offered a plan for \"time and place\" restrictions on speech as suggested by the court. However, the LDS Church held firm to get the easement rescinded. Although ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' backed the mayor's initial plan, the city council disliked it. In its place, Anderson offered to waive the easement in exchange for west side property from the LDS Church to build a community and a commitment of donations for it. All parties agreed to the arrangement, and the Main Street Plaza is now wholly owned by the LDS Church. Some suppose Anderson's compromise was an effort to strengthen his 2003 re-election campaign among [[Latter-day Saint]]s and west side residents. Both groups tended to have less favorable impressions of the former mayor.\n\n==Today==\n\n{{wide image|Rainstorm over Salt Lake City.jpg|1500px|A panoramic view of Salt Lake City, June 2009.}}\n\n===2002 Winter Olympics and their legacy===\nMuch change occurred in the [[Wasatch Front]] due to the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. [[Scandal]] rocked the city when it was discovered that millions of dollars had been funneled into [[bribe]]s to [[International Olympic Committee]] members. {{Further|2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal}}\n\n====The Games====\nThe games opened with the 1980 US hockey team lighting the torch and President [[George W. Bush]] officially opening the games.\n\nControversy erupted when in the first week the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games/Figure skating|pairs figure skating]] competition resulted in the French judge's scores being thrown out and the Canadian team of [[Jamie Sal\u00e9]] and [[David Pelletier]] being awarded a second gold medal. Athletes in short-track speed skating and cross-country skiing were disqualified for various reasons as well (including [[doping (sport)|doping]]), leading Russia and South Korea to file protests and threaten to withdraw from competition.\n\nHeightened fear of terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]] turned out to be unfounded, and the games proved safe.\n\nThe 2002 games ended with a dazzling closing ceremony, including bands such as [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] (who shared the stage with [[figure skating|figure skater]] [[Katarina Witt]]).\n\nMost of the 2,500 athletes paraded into [[Rice-Eccles Stadium]], watching from the stands. [[Bobsledding]] bronze medalist [[Brian Shimer]] carried the American flag. Russia and South Korean both threatened to boycott the ceremony to protest what they felt was unfair judging, but showed up anyway.\n\n====Legacy====\nMany improvements were made to the area's infrastructure. $1.59 billion were spent on highway improvements, including improvements of [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]] through the city and new interchanges near [[Park City, Utah|Park City]]. A [[light rail]] system was constructed from downtown to the suburb of [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]] and later to the [[University of Utah]].\n\nThe Athlete's Village is now student housing at the University of Utah. Many venues in and around the city still stand even after the games.\n\nMany [[hotels]], [[motels]] and [[restaurants]] were built for the games and still exist today.\n\n==Future==\nSalt Lake City still struggles with its identity, trying to strike a balance between capitol of a major religion and modern secular city. Efforts are being made to revitalize the [[Downtown Salt Lake City|downtown]] and to adjust to the phenomenal growth of the area. The LDS Church recently bought the Crossroads and ZCMI malls and rebuilt them into the new [[City Creek Center]] mall, which is connected by walkways, and with new apartment and office buildings nearby. The [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] ''[[FrontRunner]]'' is in place along the northern [[Wasatch Front]], with extensions planned for the southern portion of the region.

This group had spent weeks traversing difficult terrain and brush, cutting a road through the [[Wasatch Mountains]], coming through Emigration canyon into the Salt Lake Valley on August 12, 1846.  This same path would be used by the vanguard company of [[Mormon pioneers]], and for many years after that by those following them to Salt Lake.<ref>[http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/pioneers_and_cowboys/donnerparty.html \"The Donner Party\"] by Dale Beecher, Utah History Encyclopedia</ref>\n\n==Early years==\n[[Image:salt lake city 1850.jpg|thumb|400px|Salt Lake City in 1850.]]\nOn July 24, 1847 143 men, three women and two children founded Great Salt Lake City several miles to the east of the [[Great Salt Lake]], nestled in the northern most reaches of the Salt Lake Valley.  At the time of its founding there were no native americans present in the Salt Lake valley. The first two in this company to enter the Salt Lake valley were [[Orson Pratt]] and [[Erastus Snow]].  These members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (\"LDS Church\") sought to establish an autonomous religious community and were the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the area now known as [[Utah]]. Thousands of [[Mormon pioneers]] would arrive in Salt Lake in the coming months and years.\n\n[[Brigham Young]] led the Saints west after the [[death of Joseph Smith]].  Upon arrival to the Salt Lake valley, Young had a vision by saying, \"It is enough. This is the right place. Drive on.\"  (This is commonly shortened to, \"This is the place\"). There is a state park in Salt Lake City known as [[This Is The Place Heritage Park]] commemorating the spot where Young made the famous statement.\n\nSalt Lake City was originally settled by Latter-day Saint Pioneers to be the New Zion according to church President and leader Brigham Young. Young originally governed both the territory and church by a [[High council (Latter-day Saints)|High council]] which enacted the original municipal orders in 1848. This system was later replaced with a [[city council]] and mayor style government.\n\nAfter a very difficult winter and a miraculous crop retrieval, in which Pioneers reported to have been saved from cricket infestation by seagulls (see [[Miracle of the Gulls]]), the \"Desert Blossomed as the Rose\" in the Salt Lake Valley. Early Pioneers survived by maintaining a very tight-knit community. Under Young's leadership Pioneers worked out a system of communal crop sharing within the various ward houses established throughout the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nThe [[California Gold Rush]] brought many people through the city on their way to seek fortunes. Salt Lake, which was at the cross-roads of the westward trek, became a vital trading point for [[speculator]]s and [[Prospecting|prospectors]] traveling through. They came with goods from the [[East Coast of the United States|East]], such as [[clothing]] and other [[manufacturing|manufactured]] items, trading with the local [[farmers]] for fresh [[livestock]] and [[agriculture|crops]].\n\nThe [[United States Congress|Congress]] organized the [[Utah Territory]] out of the \"[[State of Deseret]]\" in 1850, and a few months later on January 6, 1851 the city was formally organized as \"The City of the Great Salt Lake\". Originally, [[Fillmore, Utah]] was the [[Utah Territory|territorial]] [[Capital (political)|capital]], but in 1856 it was moved to Salt Lake City, where it has stayed ever since. The city's name was officially changed to \"Salt Lake City\" at the same time.\n\nIn 1857, when the Mormon practice of [[polygamy]] came to national awareness, President [[James Buchanan]] responded to public outcry by sending an army of 2500 soldiers, called the Utah Expedition, to investigate the LDS Church and install a non-LDS governor to replace [[Brigham Young]]. In response, Brigham Young imposed [[martial law]], sending the Utah militia to harass the soldiers, a conflict called the [[Utah War]]. Young eventually surrendered to federal control when the new territorial governor, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]], arrived in Salt Lake City on April 12, 1858. Most troops pulled out at the beginning of the [[American Civil War]].\n\nIn order to secure the road to California during the Civil War, more troops arrived under the command of Colonel [[Patrick Edward Connor]] in 1862. They settled in the [[Fort Douglas (Utah)|Fort Douglas]] area east of the city. Thoroughly anti-LDS, Connor viewed the people with disdain, calling them, \"a community of traitors, murderers, fanatics, and whores.\" To dilute their influence he worked with non-LDS business and bank owners, and also encouraged mining. In 1863 some of his troops discovered rich veins of [[gold]] and [[silver]] in the Wasatch Mountains.\n\nIn 1868 Brigham Young founded the [[Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution]] (ZCMI) as a way to ward off dependency on outside goods and arguably to hinder ex-LDS retailers. Although ZCMI is sometimes credited with being the nation's first department store, a decade earlier New York City's \"Marble Palace\" and [[Macy's]] vied for that title.\n\nChange was inevitable. The world started to come to Salt Lake City in 1869 with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad (North America)|First Transcontinental Railroad]] at [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit]], north of the city. By 1870 Salt Lake had been linked to it via the [[Utah Central Rail Road (1869-1881)|Utah Central Rail Road]]. People began to pour into Salt Lake seeking opportunities in mining and other industries.\n\n[[Image:Salt Lake City 1869 WH Jackson.jpg|thumb|Street view, Salt Lake City, 1869]]\nCity government was dominated by the [[People's Party (Utah)|People's Party]] until 1890. The non-national People's Party was an LDS-controlled political organization, and each of the early mayors of Salt Lake City was LDS. Sparks often flew between LDS city government and non-LDS federal authorities stationed just outside Salt Lake. A dramatic example occurred in 1874 when city police were arrested by [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]], who took control of the national election being held in Salt Lake City. Mayor [[Daniel H. Wells]], a member of the LDS Church [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], declared [[martial law]] from the balcony of the [[Salt Lake City Council Hall|Old Salt Lake City Hall]]. Federal troops arrested the mayor, but he was soon released.\n\nIn the 1880s, the anti-[[Plural marriage|polygamy]] [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]] systematically denied many prominent LDS Church members the right to vote or hold office. Polygamists were detained in a Federal prison just outside Salt Lake in the [[Sugar House (Salt Lake City)|Sugar House]] area. Consequentially, the non-LDS [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]] took control of City government in the 1890 election. Three years later the Liberal Party and People's Party dissolved into national parties anticipating Utah statehood, but both LDS and non-LDS leaders would govern Salt Lake City from that point onward.\n\nThe city became Utah's state capital on January 4, 1896, when Utah entered the union upon [[President of the United States|President]] [[Grover Cleveland]]'s decree after the LDS Church agreed to ban polygamy in 1890.\n\n==The 20th Century==\nIn 1907, Salt Lake City was home to [[Industrial Workers of the World]] Industrial Union No. 202.<ref name=\"IUB V1 N26\">{{cite news |author=<!-- No author listed. --> |publication-date=24 August 1907 |title=Statement of Receipts and Expenditures |volume=1 |issue=26 |page=3 |newspaper=[[Industrial Union Bulletin]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v1n26-aug-24-1907-iub }}</ref>\n\nThe city adopted a non-partisan city council in 1911. As LDS/non-LDS tensions eased people began to work together for the common good, improving roads, utilities and public healthcare.\n\n[[Image:Salt Lake City 1913 panorama.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Downtown Salt Lake City circa 1913]]\n[[Image:SLC,1909.jpg|thumb|right|Salt Lake City suburb, 1909]]\n[[Image:SLCBeer.jpg|thumb|right|Armed delivery of liquor & beer, 1917]]\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] hit Salt Lake City especially hard. At its peak, the [[unemployment rate]] reached 61,500 people, about 36%. The annual [[per capita income]] in 1932 was $276, half of what it was in 1929, $537 annually. Jobs were scarce. Although boosted by federal [[New Deal]] programs as well as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the economy did not fully recover until [[World War II]].\n\nAfter suffering through the depression Salt Lake's economy was boosted during World War II due to the influx of [[defense industry|defense industries]] to the Wasatch Front. Demands for raw materials increased Utah's [[mining]] industry, and several military installations such as Fort Douglas and [[Hill Air Force Base]] were added.\n\nAfter the Second World War, Salt Lake City grew rapidly. It began to suffer some of the same problems other cities face. [[Urban sprawl]] became a growing problem due to a combination of rapid growth and an abundance of available land. Military and [[aerospace]] also became dominant industries.\n\nSalt Lake began its bid for the Winter Olympics as early as the 1930s, when the Utah Ski Club tried to bring the games to the valley. At the time, however, the [[Summer Olympic]] host city had the option of hosting the winter games, and all attempts failed. Salt Lake tried again throughout the decades until 1995, when the [[International Olympic Committee]] announced Salt Lake City as the site of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].\n\nAfter 132 years in business, ZCMI was sold to the [[May Department Stores Company]] in 1999. Remaining ZCMI stores, including one in downtown Salt Lake City, were converted into [[Meier & Frank]] stores, although the facade still reads \"1868 ZCMI 1999\".\n\nIn April 1999, the Salt Lake City council voted 5 to 2 along LDS membership lines to sell to the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]] the segment of Main Street that lay between [[Temple Square]] and the LDS Church office buildings for $8.1 million. The Church planned to build a large plaza on the land as well as a parking structure below. There was much public outcry about the sale of public lands to a private organization, but a Church representative assured residents that the plaza would be a \"little bit of Paris\", a characterization that would be used against the LDS Church later. Concerns also lay in plans to ban such activities as demonstrations, skateboarding, sunbathing, smoking, and other activities it considered \"vulgar\". The Utah [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] believed that these restrictions were incompatible with the pedestrian [[easement]] that the city retained over the plaza. ACLU attorneys claimed this made the plaza into a public free speech forum. Nonetheless, the property was sold to become the [[Main Street Plaza (Salt Lake City)|Main Street Plaza]]. After the Utah [[United States district court|District Court]] ruled against the ACLU, they were vindicated by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|10th Circuit Court]] in the Fall of 2002. Scrambling to satisfy residents, [[Rocky Anderson]] offered a plan for \"time and place\" restrictions on speech as suggested by the court. However, the LDS Church held firm to get the easement rescinded. Although ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' backed the mayor's initial plan, the city council disliked it. In its place, Anderson offered to waive the easement in exchange for west side property from the LDS Church to build a community and a commitment of donations for it. All parties agreed to the arrangement, and the Main Street Plaza is now wholly owned by the LDS Church. Some suppose Anderson's compromise was an effort to strengthen his 2003 re-election campaign among [[Latter-day Saint]]s and west side residents. Both groups tended to have less favorable impressions of the former mayor.\n\n==Today==\n\n{{wide image|Rainstorm over Salt Lake City.jpg|1500px|A panoramic view of Salt Lake City, June 2009.}}\n\n===2002 Winter Olympics and their legacy===\nMuch change occurred in the [[Wasatch Front]] due to the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. [[Scandal]] rocked the city when it was discovered that millions of dollars had been funneled into [[bribe]]s to [[International Olympic Committee]] members. {{Further|2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal}}\n\n====The Games====\nThe games opened with the 1980 US hockey team lighting the torch and President [[George W. Bush]] officially opening the games.\n\nControversy erupted when in the first week the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games/Figure skating|pairs figure skating]] competition resulted in the French judge's scores being thrown out and the Canadian team of [[Jamie Sal\u00e9]] and [[David Pelletier]] being awarded a second gold medal. Athletes in short-track speed skating and cross-country skiing were disqualified for various reasons as well (including [[doping (sport)|doping]]), leading Russia and South Korea to file protests and threaten to withdraw from competition.\n\nHeightened fear of terrorism following the [[September 11 attacks]] turned out to be unfounded, and the games proved safe.\n\nThe 2002 games ended with a dazzling closing ceremony, including bands such as [[Bon Jovi]] and [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] (who shared the stage with [[figure skating|figure skater]] [[Katarina Witt]]).\n\nMost of the 2,500 athletes paraded into [[Rice-Eccles Stadium]], watching from the stands. [[Bobsledding]] bronze medalist [[Brian Shimer]] carried the American flag. Russia and South Korean both threatened to boycott the ceremony to protest what they felt was unfair judging, but showed up anyway.\n\n====Legacy====\nMany improvements were made to the area's infrastructure. $1.59 billion were spent on highway improvements, including improvements of [[Interstate 15 in Utah|Interstate 15]] through the city and new interchanges near [[Park City, Utah|Park City]]. A [[light rail]] system was constructed from downtown to the suburb of [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]] and later to the [[University of Utah]].\n\nThe Athlete's Village is now student housing at the University of Utah. Many venues in and around the city still stand even after the games.\n\nMany [[hotels]], [[motels]] and [[restaurants]] were built for the games and still exist today.\n\n==Future==\nSalt Lake City still struggles with its identity, trying to strike a balance between capitol of a major religion and modern secular city. Efforts are being made to revitalize the [[Downtown Salt Lake City|downtown]] and to adjust to the phenomenal growth of the area. The LDS Church recently bought the Crossroads and ZCMI malls and rebuilt them into the new [[City Creek Center]] mall, which is connected by walkways, and with new apartment and office buildings nearby. The [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] ''[[FrontRunner]]'' is in place along the northern [[Wasatch Front]], with extensions planned for the southern portion of the region. Light rail extensions are planned to provide service to the western and southern suburbs, as well as to [[Salt Lake City International Airport]]. The controversial Legacy Highway has one segment completed (the [[Legacy Parkway]]), with the construction of the early phase of the next segment (the [[Mountain View Corridor]]) completed through the west side of the [[Salt Lake Valley]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dolly Dimples (Utah)]]\n*[[No-Ni-Shee Arch]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Bagley, Will (2004) ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'', Volume S-Sn, pp.&nbsp;76\u201376a.

While Jai Singh halted there with the intention of building a town, the god Kedareshwar appeared in his dream and told him that his temple was just below the hill on which Jesnagar stood, and the sewage of the new town would flow over the temple and defile it and he must therefore move east, selecting the spot on which he should kill and bury game. The god promised him that the town founded there would be healthy and prosperous. Accordingly, Raja Jai Singh rode out eastwards until he found a hare which he pierced with his spear and buried on the spot where the great Palace gate called Suraj Pole now stands. Raja Jai Singh named his new capital \"Sailana\" from its location at the foot of the hills (in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], ''anana'' means mouth and ''shaila'' means hills).<ref name=\"igi\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/imperialgazettee015643mbp#page/n391/mode/2up|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume=Vol.21|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=385}}</ref><ref>Central India State Gazetteer Series Malwa Vol-v Part-a pg.370</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Sailana State]] was founded by Raja Jai Singh Rathore ({{reign|1736|1757}}), great-grandson of Maharaja Ratan Singh Rathore, founder of [[Ratlam State]].

The culinary culture dating back from three generations of master culinary expert Raja Sir Dilip Singh Ji [[K.C.I.E]] of Sailana excelled in the culinary arts and collected recipes of bygone era from the Nizam of Hyderabad, Maharaja of Kashmir and Begum of Bhopal amongst others, from where emanated the most exotic culinary recipes. He took pains to translate ancient recipe books in Sanskrit, Urdu and Persian to ensure that these recipes were preserved for posterity. The current head of the family, Vikram Singh Ji, has a collection of more than 2,000 ancient recipes out of which only 164 have been made public through the cookbook, \"Cooking Delights of the Maharajas\" written by the former ruler of Sailana, Digvijay Singh Ji.<ref>Cooking Delights of the Maharajas</ref><ref>Dining with the Maharajas pg. 194</ref>\n\n==Cactus Garden==\nThe Sailana Cactus garden was built by Raja Digvijay Singh Ji.

The temples are situated in man made caves carved out from a cliff of igneous rocks. The initial structure of Bada Kedareshwar was built by Raja Jai Singh (r.1736 \u2013 1757), Raja Duleh Singh (r.1850 \u2013 1895) later spent Rs.150,000 on the temple and built several structures in and around the temple including a man-made lake that flows over the temple. Chota Kedareshwar is built on a cliff which is surrounded by a small valley. From the top of the cliff, a small stream of monsoon rain water forms a waterfall and joins a small pond of water in the valley. From here a river originates and flows down into the plains of Rajasthan.\n\n==Sailana Kharmour Bird Sanctuary==\n{{Main|Sailana Kharmour Bird Sanctuary}}\n{{See also|Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary|Thattekad Bird Sanctuary}}\n\nThe Kharmour Bird Sanctuary, also known as Sailana Bird Sanctuary, is situated in Sailana Village of the Ratlam District.

While Jai Singh halted there with the intention of building a town, the god Kedareshwar appeared in his dream and told him that his temple was just below the hill on which Jesnagar stood, and the sewage of the new town would flow over the temple and defile it and he must therefore move east, selecting the spot on which he should kill and bury game. The god promised him that the town founded there would be healthy and prosperous. Accordingly Raja Jai Singh rode out eastwards until he found a hare which he pierced with his spear and burried on the spot where the great Palace gate called Suraj Pole now stands. Raja Jai Singh named his new capital \"Sailana\" from its location at the foot of the hills (in [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], ''anana'' means mouth and ''shaila'' means hills).<ref name=\"igi\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/imperialgazettee015643mbp#page/n391/mode/2up|title=Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume=Vol.21|year=1908|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|page=385}}</ref><ref>Central India State Gazetteer Series Malwa Vol-v Part-a pg.370</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Sailana State]] was founded by Raja Jai Singh Rathore ({{reign|1736|1757}}), great-grandson of Maharaja Ratan Singh Rathore, founder of [[Ratlam State]].

With this creation, the city now neighbors the city of [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] (in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]]).\n\nOn October 1, 2007 the towns of [[Higashiyoka, Saga|Higashiyoka]], [[Kawasoe, Saga|Kawasoe]], and [[Kubota, Saga|Kubota]] (all from [[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]) were also incorporated into Saga, further expanding its borders.\n\nAlthough Saga is the capital of Saga Prefecture, it can also be said to be within the Greater Fukuoka metropolitan area, and by extension, [[Fukuoka-Kitakyushu]] Metropolitan Area.\n\n==History==\n\n===Municipal timeline===\n*April 1, 1889 - The modern [[Municipalities of Japan|municipal system]] was established and the city of Saga is founded. At the same time, the current city region is occupied by 21 [[Villages of Japan|villages]] from three districts. \n**[[Kanzaki District, Saga|Kanzaki District]]: Hasuike and Mitsuse.\n**[[Ogi District, Saga|Ogi District]]: Kitayama and Nanzan.\n**[[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]: Higashikawasoe, Honj\u014d, Hy\u014dgo, Kamino, Kase, Kasuga, Kawakami, Kinry\u016b, Kitakawasoe, Kose, Kuboizumi, Matsuume, Nabeshima, Nikita, Nishiyoka, Oseki and Takakise.\n*June 6, 1899 - Kose changed the ''[[kanji]]'' of its name.\n*October 1, 1922 - Kamino was incorporated into Saga.\n*November 3, 1935 - Hasuike was elevated to town status.\n*March 31, 1954 - Hy\u014dgo, Kase, Kose, Nishiyoka and Takakise were all incorporated into Saga.\n*October 1, 1954 - Honj\u014d, Kinry\u016b, Kitakawasoe, Kuboizumi and Nabeshima were all incorporated into Saga.\n*March 1, 1955 - Higashikawasoe and Nikita were merged to create the town of Morodomi.\n*October 1, 2005 - The towns of [[Fuji, Saga|Fuji]], [[Morodomi, Saga|Morodomi]] and [[Yamato, Saga|Yamato]] (all from [[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]) and the village of [[Mitsuse, Saga|Mitsuse]] (from [[Kanzaki District, Saga|Kanzaki District]]) merged with Saga. (population: 206,967 ; area: 355.15&nbsp;km\u00b2)\n*October 1, 2007 - The towns of [[Higashiyoka, Saga|Higashiyoka]], [[Kawasoe, Saga|Kawasoe]], and [[Kubota, Saga|Kubota]] (all from [[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]) were all incorporated into Saga. (population: roughly 240,000 ; area: 431.42&nbsp;km\u00b2)  Saga District was dissolved as a result of this merger.\n\n===Saga Castle===\nStanding out from many cultural assets is the plains castle within the city, [[Saga Castle]]. It is one of the rare castles in Japan surrounded by a wall rather than built on one. First built between 1591 and 1593, there was a fire in 1726. Renovated in 1728, there was yet another fire in 1835. [[Nabeshima Naomasa]], ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of the [[Nabeshima clan]], renovated it within two years and moved in. In 1874 it was a court building and a prefectural office. 1883 saw it become a junior school. The buildings were eventually replaced by modern school buildings.\n\n==Geography==\nSaga City is located in the southeast portion of [[Saga Prefecture]]. After the 2005 merger the city became very long north to south. It now borders the [[Ariake Sea]] to the south and [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] to the southeast and north. The northern half of the city contains the Sefuri Mountains.\n\n===Climate===\nSaga has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'').The annual average precipitation ranges from about 1800&nbsp;mm (71&nbsp;in) in the city center to about 2400&nbsp;mm (94&nbsp;in) in [[Mitsuse, Saga|Mitsuse]]. The annual average temperature ranges from about 13&nbsp;\u00b0C (55&nbsp;\u00b0F) in Mitsuse to 17&nbsp;\u00b0C (63&nbsp;\u00b0F) in the city center.\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Saga, Saga\n|single line = Y\n|metric first = Y\n|Jan high C = 9.5\n|Feb high C = 10.6\n|Mar high C = 14.6\n|Apr high C = 20.3\n|May high C = 24.8\n|Jun high C = 27.4\n|Jul high C = 30.9\n|Aug high C = 32.4\n|Sep high C = 28.6\n|Oct high C = 23.5\n|Nov high C = 17.7\n|Dec high C = 12.1\n|Jan mean C = 5.0\n|Feb mean C = 6.0\n|Mar mean C = 9.3\n|Apr mean C = 14.8\n|May mean C = 19.2\n|Jun mean C = 22.8\n|Jul mean C = 26.8\n|Aug mean C = 27.6\n|Sep mean C = 23.7\n|Oct mean C = 17.9\n|Nov mean C = 12.4\n|Dec mean C = 7.2\n|Jan low C = 1.2\n|Feb low C = 2.0\n|Mar low C = 4.7\n|Apr low C = 10.0\n|May low C = 14.3\n|Jun low C = 18.9\n|Jul low C = 23.6\n|Aug low C = 23.9\n|Sep low C = 19.9\n|Oct low C = 13.3\n|Nov low C = 7.9\n|Dec low C = 3.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 62.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 73.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 113.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 171.3\n|May precipitation mm = 190.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 321.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 341.4\n|Aug precipitation mm = 178.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 175.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 96.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 68.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 44.4\n|Jan snow cm = 6\n|Feb snow cm = 5\n|Mar snow cm = 0\n|Apr snow cm = 0\n|May snow cm = 0\n|Jun snow cm = 0\n|Jul snow cm = 0\n|Aug snow cm = 0\n|Sep snow cm = 0\n|Oct snow cm = 0\n|Nov snow cm = 0\n|Dec snow cm = 1\n|Jan humidity = 71\n|Feb humidity = 70\n|Mar humidity = 68\n|Apr humidity = 70\n|May humidity = 71\n|Jun humidity = 76\n|Jul humidity = 80\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 72\n|Nov humidity = 72\n|Dec humidity = 73\n|Jan sun = 117.5\n|Feb sun = 120.6\n|Mar sun = 160.9\n|Apr sun = 161.7\n|May sun = 182.5\n|Jun sun = 143.7\n|Jul sun = 169.4\n|Aug sun = 210.1\n|Sep sun = 164.4\n|Oct sun = 174.2\n|Nov sun = 141.4\n|Dec sun = 123.1\n|source 1 = NOAA (1961-1990)<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n  |url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-II/JP/47813.TXT\n  |title = Saga Climate Normals 1961-1990\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = January 6, 2013}}</ref> \n|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Adjoining municipalities===\n[[File:Saga city center 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Saga city center]]\n*[[Saga Prefecture]]\n**[[Kanzaki, Saga|Kanzaki]]\n**[[Karatsu, Saga|Karatsu]]\n**[[Ogi, Saga|Ogi]]\n**[[Taku, Saga|Taku]]  \n*[[Fukuoka Prefecture]]\n**[[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]]\n***[[Sawara-ku, Fukuoka]]\n**[[Itoshima, Fukuoka|Itoshima]]\n**[[\u014ckawa, Fukuoka|\u014ckawa]]\n**[[Yanagawa, Fukuoka|Yanagawa]]\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Saga city office.JPG|thumb|Saga city office]]\n\n===Universities===\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n:;National\n*[[Saga University]]\n{{col-break}}\n:;Private\n*Saga Junior College\n*Saga Women's Junior College\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Senior High Schools===\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n:;Prefectural\n*[[Saga Prefectural Chienkan Junior & Senior High School|Chienkan High School]] \n*[[Koshikan Senior High School]]\n*Saga [[Commercial high school (Japan)|Commercial High School]]\n*[[Saga Higashi High School]]\n*Saga Kita High School\n*Saga Nishi High School\n*[[Saga Prefectural Saga Technical High School|Saga Technical High School]]\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n:;Private\n*Hokuryo High School\n*K\u014dgakukan High School\n*Saga Gakuen High School\n*Saga Ryukoku\n*Saga Seiwa High School\n*Saga Girls' High School\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Air===\nThere is one [[airport]] inside the city of Saga, [[Saga Airport]], located in the former town of [[Kawasoe, Saga|Kawasoe]].

With this creation, the city now neighbors the city of [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]] (in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]]).\n\nOn October 1, 2007 the towns of [[Higashiyoka, Saga|Higashiyoka]], [[Kawasoe, Saga|Kawasoe]], and [[Kubota, Saga|Kubota]] (all from [[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]) were also incorporated into Saga, further expanding its borders.\n\nAlthough Saga is the capital of Saga Prefecture, it can also be said to be within the Greater Fukuoka metropolitan area, and by extension, [[Fukuoka-Kitakyushu]] Metropolitan Area.\n\n==History==\n\n===Municipal timeline===\n*April 1, 1889 - The modern [[Municipalities of Japan|municipal system]] was established and the city of Saga is founded. At the same time, the current city region is occupied by 21 [[Villages of Japan|villages]] from three districts. \n**[[Kanzaki District, Saga|Kanzaki District]]: Hasuike and Mitsuse.\n**[[Ogi District, Saga|Ogi District]]: Kitayama and Nanzan.\n**[[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]: Higashikawasoe, Honj\u014d, Hy\u014dgo, Kamino, Kase, Kasuga, Kawakami, Kinry\u016b, Kitakawasoe, Kose, Kuboizumi, Matsuume, Nabeshima, Nikita, Nishiyoka, Oseki and Takakise.\n*June 6, 1899 - Kose changed the ''[[kanji]]'' of its name.\n*October 1, 1922 - Kamino was incorporated into Saga.\n*November 3, 1935 - Hasuike was elevated to town status.\n*March 31, 1954 - Hy\u014dgo, Kase, Kose, Nishiyoka and Takakise were all incorporated into Saga.\n*October 1, 1954 - Honj\u014d, Kinry\u016b, Kitakawasoe, Kuboizumi and Nabeshima were all incorporated into Saga.\n*March 1, 1955 - Higashikawasoe and Nikita were merged to create the town of Morodomi.\n*October 1, 2005 - The towns of [[Fuji, Saga|Fuji]], [[Morodomi, Saga|Morodomi]] and [[Yamato, Saga|Yamato]] (all from [[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]) and the village of [[Mitsuse, Saga|Mitsuse]] (from [[Kanzaki District, Saga|Kanzaki District]]) merged with Saga. (population: 206,967 ; area: 355.15&nbsp;km\u00b2)\n*October 1, 2007 - The towns of [[Higashiyoka, Saga|Higashiyoka]], [[Kawasoe, Saga|Kawasoe]], and [[Kubota, Saga|Kubota]] (all from [[Saga District, Saga|Saga District]]) were all incorporated into Saga. (population: roughly 240,000 ; area: 431.42&nbsp;km\u00b2)  Saga District was dissolved as a result of this merger.\n\n===Saga Castle===\nStanding out from many cultural assets is the plains castle within the city, [[Saga Castle]]. It is one of the rare castles in Japan surrounded by a wall rather than built on one. First built between 1591 and 1593, there was a fire in 1726. Renovated in 1728, there was yet another fire in 1835. [[Nabeshima Naomasa]], ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' of the [[Nabeshima clan]], renovated it within two years and moved in. In 1874 it was a court building and a prefectural office. 1883 saw it become a junior school. The buildings were eventually replaced by modern school buildings.\n\n==Geography==\nSaga City is located in the southeast portion of [[Saga Prefecture]]. After the 2005 merger the city became very long north to south. It now borders the [[Ariake Sea]] to the south and [[Fukuoka Prefecture]] to the southeast and north. The northern half of the city contains the Sefuri Mountains.\n\n===Climate===\nSaga has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'').The annual average precipitation ranges from about 1800&nbsp;mm (71&nbsp;in) in the city center to about 2400&nbsp;mm (94&nbsp;in) in [[Mitsuse, Saga|Mitsuse]]. The annual average temperature ranges from about 13&nbsp;\u00b0C (55&nbsp;\u00b0F) in Mitsuse to 17&nbsp;\u00b0C (63&nbsp;\u00b0F) in the city center.\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Saga, Saga\n|single line = Y\n|metric first = Y\n|Jan high C = 9.5\n|Feb high C = 10.6\n|Mar high C = 14.6\n|Apr high C = 20.3\n|May high C = 24.8\n|Jun high C = 27.4\n|Jul high C = 30.9\n|Aug high C = 32.4\n|Sep high C = 28.6\n|Oct high C = 23.5\n|Nov high C = 17.7\n|Dec high C = 12.1\n|Jan mean C = 5.0\n|Feb mean C = 6.0\n|Mar mean C = 9.3\n|Apr mean C = 14.8\n|May mean C = 19.2\n|Jun mean C = 22.8\n|Jul mean C = 26.8\n|Aug mean C = 27.6\n|Sep mean C = 23.7\n|Oct mean C = 17.9\n|Nov mean C = 12.4\n|Dec mean C = 7.2\n|Jan low C = 1.2\n|Feb low C = 2.0\n|Mar low C = 4.7\n|Apr low C = 10.0\n|May low C = 14.3\n|Jun low C = 18.9\n|Jul low C = 23.6\n|Aug low C = 23.9\n|Sep low C = 19.9\n|Oct low C = 13.3\n|Nov low C = 7.9\n|Dec low C = 3.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 62.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 73.5\n|Mar precipitation mm = 113.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 171.3\n|May precipitation mm = 190.0\n|Jun precipitation mm = 321.6\n|Jul precipitation mm = 341.4\n|Aug precipitation mm = 178.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 175.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 96.8\n|Nov precipitation mm = 68.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 44.4\n|Jan snow cm = 6\n|Feb snow cm = 5\n|Mar snow cm = 0\n|Apr snow cm = 0\n|May snow cm = 0\n|Jun snow cm = 0\n|Jul snow cm = 0\n|Aug snow cm = 0\n|Sep snow cm = 0\n|Oct snow cm = 0\n|Nov snow cm = 0\n|Dec snow cm = 1\n|Jan humidity = 71\n|Feb humidity = 70\n|Mar humidity = 68\n|Apr humidity = 70\n|May humidity = 71\n|Jun humidity = 76\n|Jul humidity = 80\n|Aug humidity = 77\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 72\n|Nov humidity = 72\n|Dec humidity = 73\n|Jan sun = 117.5\n|Feb sun = 120.6\n|Mar sun = 160.9\n|Apr sun = 161.7\n|May sun = 182.5\n|Jun sun = 143.7\n|Jul sun = 169.4\n|Aug sun = 210.1\n|Sep sun = 164.4\n|Oct sun = 174.2\n|Nov sun = 141.4\n|Dec sun = 123.1\n|source 1 = NOAA (1961-1990)<ref name= NOAA>{{cite web\n  |url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/RA-II/JP/47813.TXT\n  |title = Saga Climate Normals 1961-1990\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = January 6, 2013}}</ref> \n|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Adjoining municipalities===\n[[File:Saga city center 1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Saga city center]]\n*[[Saga Prefecture]]\n**[[Kanzaki, Saga|Kanzaki]]\n**[[Karatsu, Saga|Karatsu]]\n**[[Ogi, Saga|Ogi]]\n**[[Taku, Saga|Taku]]  \n*[[Fukuoka Prefecture]]\n**[[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]]\n***[[Sawara-ku, Fukuoka]]\n**[[Itoshima, Fukuoka|Itoshima]]\n**[[\u014ckawa, Fukuoka|\u014ckawa]]\n**[[Yanagawa, Fukuoka|Yanagawa]]\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Saga city office.JPG|thumb|Saga city office]]\n\n===Universities===\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n:;National\n*[[Saga University]]\n{{col-break}}\n:;Private\n*Saga Junior College\n*Saga Women's Junior College\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Senior High Schools===\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n:;Prefectural\n*[[Saga Prefectural Chienkan Junior & Senior High School|Chienkan High School]] \n*[[Koshikan Senior High School]]\n*Saga [[Commercial high school (Japan)|Commercial High School]]\n*[[Saga Higashi High School]]\n*Saga Kita High School\n*Saga Nishi High School\n*[[Saga Prefectural Saga Technical High School|Saga Technical High School]]\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n:;Private\n*Hokuryo High School\n*K\u014dgakukan High School\n*Saga Gakuen High School\n*Saga Ryukoku\n*Saga Seiwa High School\n*Saga Girls' High School\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Transportation==\n\n===Air===\nThere is one [[airport]] inside the city of Saga, [[Saga Airport]], located in the former town of [[Kawasoe, Saga|Kawasoe]].
