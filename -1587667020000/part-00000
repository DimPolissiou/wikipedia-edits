The standard form of the table consists of a grid with rows called [[Periodic table period|periods]] and columns called [[Periodic table group|groups]].\n\nThe '''history of the periodic table''' reflects over two centuries of growth in the understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the elements, with major contributions made by [[Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier]], [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]], [[John Alexander Reina Newlands|John Newlands]], [[Julius Lothar Meyer]], [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], [[Glenn T.

R. (2006). ''The Periodic Table: Its Story ad Its Significance''; New York City, New York; Oxford University Press.</ref> Around 330 BCE, the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] proposed that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more ''roots'', an idea that had originally been suggested by the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] philosopher [[Empedocles]]. The four roots, which were later renamed as ''elements'' by [[Plato]], were ''[[earth (classical element)|earth]]'', ''[[water (classical element)|water]]'', ''[[air (classical element)|air]]'' and ''[[fire (classical element)|fire]]''. Similar ideas about these four elements also existed in other ancient traditions, such as [[Indian philosophy]].\n\n== First categorizations ==\n\nThe history of the periodic table is also a history of the [[Timeline of chemical elements discoveries|discovery of the chemical elements]]. The first person in history to discover a new element was [[Hennig Brand]], a [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]] [[Germans|German]] merchant. Brand tried to discover the [[Philosopher's Stone]]\u2014a mythical object that was supposed to turn inexpensive base [[metal]]s into gold. In 1669 (or later), his experiments with [[Distillation|distilled]] human [[urine]] resulted in the production of a glowing white substance, which he called \"cold fire\" (''kaltes Feuer'').<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/discoveryoftheel002045mbp#page/n135/mode/2up|title=Discovery of the Elements|last1=Weeks|first1=Mary|date=1956|publisher=Journal of Chemical Education|edition=6th|location=Easton, Pennsylvania, USA|page=122}}</ref> He kept his discovery secret until 1680, when Irish chemist [[Robert Boyle]] rediscovered phosphorus and published his findings. The discovery of phosphorus helped to raise the question of what it meant for a substance to be an element.\n\n[[File:Joseph Wright of Derby The Alchemist.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Hennig Brand |[[Hennig Brand]], as shown in ''[[The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus]]'']]\n\nIn 1661, Boyle defined an element as \"those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/scepticalchymis00BoylA#page/16/mode/2up|title=The Skeptical Chymist|last1=Boyle|first1=Robert|date=1661|publisher=J.

Lavoisier defined an element as a substance that cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by a chemical reaction.<ref>Lavoisier with Robert Kerr, trans. (1790) ''Elements of Chemistry''. Edinburgh, Scotland: William Creech. [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=gri.ark:/13960/t5v735k9h;view=1up;seq=30 From p. xxiv:] \"I shall therefore only add upon this subject, that if, by the term ''elements'', we mean to express those simple and indivisible atoms of which matter is composed, it is extremely probable we know nothing at all about them; but, if we apply the term ''elements'', or ''principles of bodies'', to express our idea of the last point which analysis is capable of reaching, we must admit, as elements, all substances into which we are capable, by any means, to reduce bodies by decomposition. Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation. However, Lavoisier's descriptions of his elements lack completeness, as he only classified them as metals and non-metals.\n\n[[File:Dalton's symbols of the elements. 1806 Wellcome M0004592.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[John Dalton|Dalton]] (1806): listing the known elements by atomic weight]]\n\nIn 1815, British physician and chemist [[William Prout]] noticed that atomic weights seemed to be multiples of that of hydrogen.<ref>See:\n\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=November 1815|title=On the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744812;view=1up;seq=351|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=6|pages=321\u2013330}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Prout|first1=William|date=February 1816|title=Correction of a mistake in the essay on the relation between the specific gravities of bodies in their gaseous state and the weights of their atoms|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433062744820;view=1up;seq=135|journal=Annals of Philosophy|volume=7|pages=111\u2013113}}</ref>\n\nIn 1817, German physicist [[Johann Wolfgang D\u00f6bereiner]] began to formulate one of the earliest attempts to classify the elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wurzer|first1=Ferdinand|title=Auszug eines Briefes vom Hofrath Wurzer, Prof. der Chemie zu Marburg|journal=Annalen der Physik|date=1817|volume=56|issue=7|pages=331\u2013334|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=chi.096071138;view=1up;seq=351|trans-title=Excerpt of a letter from Court Advisor Wurzer, Professor of Chemistry at Marburg|language=German|doi=10.1002/andp.18170560709|bibcode=1817AnP....56..331.}} Here, D\u00f6bereiner found that strontium's properties were intermediate to those of calcium and barium.</ref> In 1829, he found that he could form some of the elements into groups of three, with the members of each group having related properties.

In 1864, a book of his was published; it contained an early version of the periodic table containing 28 elements, and classified elements into six families by their [[valence (chemistry)|valence]]\u2014for the first time, elements had been grouped according to their valence. Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death. In a paper dated December 1869 which appeared early in 1870, Meyer published a new periodic table of 55 elements, in which the series of periods are ended by an element of the alkaline earth metal group. The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed ''eka-boron'', ''eka-aluminium'', and ''eka-silicium'',{{sfn|Mendeleev|1870|pp=90\u201398}} as well as more briefly noted a few other expectations.{{sfn|Mendeleev|1870|pp=98\u2013101}} In 1871, he expanded his predictions further.\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earth metals\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium, and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

However, the higher valency for didymium had not been established, and Mendeleev tried to do that himself.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=177}} Having had no success in that, he abandoned his attempts to incorporate the rare earth metals in late 1871 and embarked on his grand idea of [[luminiferous ether]]. His idea was carried on by Austrian-Hungarian chemist [[Bohuslav Brauner]], who sought to find a place in the periodic table for the rare earth metals;{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=179\u2013181}} Mendeleev later referred to him as to \"one of the true consolidators of the periodic law\".{{Efn|Mendeleev referred to Brauner in this manner after Brauner measured the atomic weight of tellurium and obtained the value 125. Mendeleev had thought that due to the properties tellurium and iodine display, the latter should be the heavier one while the contemporary data pointed otherwise (tellurium was assessed with the value of 128, and iodine 127). Later measurements by Brauner himself, however, showed the correctness of the original measurement; Mendeleev doubted it for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Scerri|2019|pp=130-131}}}}\n\n=== Recognition of Mendeleev's table ===\nEventually, the periodic table was appreciated for its descriptive power and for finally systematizing the relationship between the elements,<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Scerri|first=Eric R.|date=1998|title=The Evolution of the Periodic System|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/26057945|journal=Scientific American|volume=279|issue=3|pages=78\u201383|issn=0036-8733}}</ref> although such appreciation was not universal.{{Sfn|Scerri|2019|pp=170\u2013172}} In 1882, the [[Royal Society]] in London awarded the [[Davy Medal]] to both Mendeleev and Meyer for their work to classify the elements; although two of Mendeleev's predicted elements had been discovered by then, Mendeleev's predictions were not at all mentioned in the prize rationale. \n\nMendeleev's ''eka-aluminium'' was discovered in 1875 and became known as [[gallium]]; ''eka-aluminium'' and ''eka-silicium'' were discovered in 1879 and 1886, respectively, and were named [[scandium]] and [[germanium]].<ref name=\"ley196610\">{{Cite magazine|last=Ley|author=|first=Willy|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|date=October 1966|title=The Delayed Discovery|url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v25n01_1966-10#page/n115/mode/2up|department=For Your Information|magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction|type=|pages=116\u2013127}}</ref> Mendeleev was even able to correct some initial measurements with his predictions, including the first prediction of gallium, which matched ''eka-aluminium'' fairly closely but had a different density. Mendeleev advised the discoverer, French chemist [[Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran]], to measure the density again; de Boisbaudran was initially sceptical (not least because he thought Mendeleev was trying to take credit from him) but eventually admitted correctness the prediction. Mendeleev contacted all three discoverers; all three noted the close similarity of their discovered elements with Mendeleev's predictions, the last of them, German chemist [[Clemens Winkler]], doing so prior to correspondence with Mendeleev. Some contemporary chemists were not convinced by these discoveries, either, noting the dissimilarities with the predictions or claiming those similarities that did exist were coincidential,{{Sfn|Scerri|2019|pp=170\u2013172}} but later chemists used the successes of these Mendeleev's predictions to justify his table.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the three discoveries closely matched Mendeleev's three detailed predictions, his table was widely recognized.

Many new radioactive substances were found, including the noble gas [[radon]], and their chemical properties were investigated.{{r|ley196610}} By 1912, almost 50 different radioactive substances had been found in the decay chains of thorium and uranium. American chemist [[Bertram Boltwood]] proposed several decay chains linking these radioelements between uranium and lead.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Van den Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively.

Not that we are entitled to affirm, that these substances we consider as simple may not be compounded of two, or even of a greater number of principles; but, since these principles cannot be separated, or rather since we have not hitherto discovered means of separating them, they act with regard to us as simple substances, and we ought never to suppose them compounded until experiment and observation has proved them to be so.\"</ref> This simple definition served for a century and lasted until the discovery of [[subatomic particle]]s. Lavoisier's book contained a list of \"simple substances\" that Lavoisier believed could not be broken down further, which included [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]], which formed the basis for the modern list of elements. Lavoisier's list also included '[[light]]' and '[[Caloric theory|caloric]]', which at the time were believed to be material substances. He classified these substances into metals and nonmetals. While many leading [[chemist]]s refused to believe Lavoisier's new revelations, the ''Elementary Treatise'' was written well enough to convince the younger generation.

Works on organizing the elements by atomic weight had until then been stymied by inaccurate measurements of the atomic weights.<ref name=\"Meyer table\" /> In 1868, he revised his table, but this revision was published as a draft only after his death.

The paper also included a line chart of relative atomic volumes, which illustrated periodic relationships of physical characteristics of the elements, and which assisted Meyer in deciding where elements should appear in his periodic table.

In total, he predicted eighteen elements, though only half corresponded to elements that were later discovered.<ref name=\"pastfuture\" />\n\nEven as Mendeleev corrected positions of some elements, he thought that some relationships that he could find in his grand scheme of periodicity could not be found because some elements were still undiscovered, and thus he believed these elements that were still undiscovered would have properties that could be deduced from the expected relationships with other elements. In 1870, he first tried to characterize the yet undiscovered elements, and he gave detailed [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|predictions]] for three elements, which he termed ''eka-boron'', ''eka-aluminium'', and ''eka-silicium'',{{sfn|Mendeleev|1870|pp=90\u201398}} as well as more briefly noted a few other expectations.{{sfn|Mendeleev|1870|pp=98\u2013101}} In 1871, he expanded his predictions further.\n\nCompared to the rest of the work, Mendeleev's 1869 list misplaces seven then-known elements: [[indium]], [[thorium]], and the five rare earth metals\u2014[[yttrium]], [[cerium]], [[lanthanum]], erbium, and [[didymium]] (the latter two were later found to be mixtures of different elements); ignoring those would allow him to restore the logic of increasing atomic weight. These elements (all thought to be divalent at the time) puzzled Mendeleev in that they did not show gradual increase in valency despite their seemingly consequential atomic weights.{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|p=159}} Mendeleev grouped them together, thinking of them as of a particular kind of series.{{Efn|He noted similarity despite sequential atomic weights; he termed such sequences as primary groups (as opposed to regular secondary groups, those in the likes of the halogens or the alkali metals). Other examples of primary groups included set of rhodium, ruthenium, and\npalladium, and the set of iridium, osmium, and platinum.}} In early 1870, he decided the weights for these elements must be wrong and that the rare earth metals should be trivalent (which accordingly increases their weights by half). He measured heat capacity of indium, uranium, and cerium to demonstrate their increase of accounted valency (which was soon confirmed by Prussian chemist [[Robert Bunsen]]).{{sfn|Thyssen|Binnemans|2015|pp=174\u2013175}} Mendeleev considered the change by assessing each element an individual place in his system of the elements. \n\nMendeleev noticed that there was a significant difference in atomic mass between [[cerium]] and [[tantalum]] with no element between them; his consideration was that between them, there was a row of yet undiscovered elements, which would display similar properties to those elements which were to be found above and below them: for instance, an eka-molybdenum would behave as a heavier homolog of molybdenum and a lighter homolog of wolfram (the name under which Mendeleev knew [[tungsten]]).<ref name=\"scimag19\">{{cite journal|last=Cheisson|first=T.|last2=Schelter|first2=E.

He correctly determined the atomic number of all elements up to atomic number 50 ([[tin]]), though he made several errors with heavier elements. However, Van den Broek did not have any method to experimentally verify the atomic numbers of elements; thus, they were still believed to be a consequence of atomic weight, which remained in use in ordering elements.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nMoseley was determined to test Van den Broek's hypothesis.<ref name=moseley2010/> After a year of investigation of the [[Fraunhofer lines]] of various elements, he found a relationship between the X-ray [[wavelength]] of an element and its atomic number.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Moseley|first1=H.G.J.|title=The high-frequency spectra of the elements|journal=Philosophical Magazine|date=1914|volume=27|pages=703\u2013713|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002266051;view=1up;seq=731|series=6th series|doi=10.1080/14786440408635141}}</ref> With this, Moseley obtained the first accurate measurements of atomic numbers and determined an absolute sequence to the elements, allowing him to restructure the periodic table. Moseley's research immediately resolved discrepancies between atomic weight and chemical properties, where sequencing strictly by atomic weight would result in groups with inconsistent chemical properties. For example, his measurements of X-ray wavelengths enabled him to correctly place [[argon]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;18) before [[potassium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;19), [[cobalt]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;27) before [[nickel]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;28), as well as [[tellurium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;52) before [[iodine]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;53), in line with [[periodic trends]]. The determination of atomic numbers also clarified the order of chemically similar rare earth elements; it was also used to confirm that [[Georges Urbain]]'s claimed discovery of a new rare earth element ([[celtium]]) was invalid, earning Moseley acclamation for this technique.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\nSwedish physicist [[Karl Siegbahn]] continued Moseley's work for elements heavier than gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79), and found that the heaviest known element at the time, [[uranium]], had atomic number 92. In determining the largest identified atomic number, gaps in the atomic number sequence were conclusively determined where an atomic number had no known corresponding element; the gaps occurred at atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87.<ref name=moseley2010/>\n\n=== Electron shell and quantum mechanics ===\n<!-- Janet and his table should definitely be mentioned here. Another thing to be mentioned (probably) here is the emergence of the 18=column table -->In 1914, Swedish physicist [[Johannes Rydberg]] noticed that the atomic numbers of the noble gases was equal to doubled sums of squares of simple numbers: 2 = 2\u00b71<sup>2</sup>, 10 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 18 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup>), 36 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 54 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup>), 86 = 2(1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 4<sup>2</sup>).

Many agreed that the next noble gas after radon would most likely have the atomic number 118, from which it followed that the transition series in the [[period 7 element|seventh period]] should resemble those in the [[period 6 element|sixth]]. Although it was thought that these transition series would include a series analogous to the rare earth elements, characterized by filling of the 5f shell, it was unknown where this series began. Predictions ranged from atomic number 90 (thorium) to 99, many of which proposed a beginning beyond the known elements (at or beyond atomic number 93). The elements from [[actinium]] to uranium were instead believed to form part of a fourth series of transition metals because of their high [[oxidation state]]s; accordingly, they were placed in groups 3 through 6.<ref name=seaborg2>{{cite book |last=Seaborg |first=G. |title=Lanthanides/Actinides: Chemistry |chapter=Origin of the Actinide Concept |series=Handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of Rare Earths |volume=18 |edition=1 |date=1994 |isbn=9780444536648 |id=LBL-31179 |chapter-url=https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt7cz371hx/qt7cz371hx.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIn 1940, [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] were the first [[transuranic element]]s to be discovered; they were placed in sequence beneath [[rhenium]] and [[osmium]], respectively. However, preliminary investigations of their chemistry suggested a greater similarity to uranium than to lighter transition metals, challenging their placement in the periodic table.<ref name=clark/> During his [[Manhattan Project]] research in 1943, American chemist [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] experienced unexpected difficulties in isolating the elements [[americium]] and [[curium]], as they were believed to be part of a fourth series of transition metals.

Any newly discovered elements will thus be placed in an eighth period.\n\nDespite the completion of the seventh period, experimental chemistry of some transactinides has been shown to be inconsistent with the periodic law. In the 1990s, Ken Czerwinski at [[University of California, Berkeley]] observed similarities between rutherfordium and plutonium and dubnium and protactinium, rather than a clear continuation of periodicity in groups&nbsp;4 and&nbsp;5. More recent experiments on [[copernicium]] and [[flerovium]] have yielded inconsistent results, some of which suggest that these elements behave more like the noble gas [[radon]] rather than mercury and lead, their respective [[congener (chemistry)|congener]]s.

My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like ''Danny Boy'' from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the day before [[St. Patrick's Day]] 2007, she performed as part of Celtic Woman for President [[George W.

There are various spiritual benefits thought to be obtained by the ceremony. It is believed that the original purpose was to make certain that the person was really dead, since the dog's more acute senses would be able to detect signs of life that a human might miss. A \"four-eyed\" dog, that is one with two spots on its forehead, is preferred for sagdid.<ref>Jivanji Jamshedji Modi, 1928, [http://www.avesta.org/ritual/funeral.htm The Funeral Ceremonies of the Parsees], Anthropological Society of Bombay</ref><ref>The Zoroastrian Faith: Tradition and Modern Research, by Solomon Alexander Nigosian, Published by McGill-Queen's Press \u2013 MQUP, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7735-1144-X}}, 9780773511446 page 102 (page can be viewed via Google books)</ref>\n\nThe traditional rites involving dogs have been under attack by reformist Zoroastrians since the mid-19th century, and they had abandoned them completely by the late 20th century.

{"title_page": "Semi-automatic firearm", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n\nA '''semi-automatic [[firearm]]''', also called '''self-loading firearm''' or '''autoloading firearm''' (though [[automatic firearm|fully automatic]] and [[selective fire]] firearms technically are also self-loading), is one whose [[firearm action|action]] mechanism ''automatically'' loads a following round of [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] into the [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] (self-loading) and prepares it for subsequent firing, but requires the shooter to ''manually'' actuate the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]] in order to discharge each shot.  Typically, this involves the weapon's action utilizing the excess energy released during the preceding shot (in the form of [[recoil]] or high-pressure gas expanding within the [[gun barrel#Bore|bore]]) to unlock and move the [[bolt (firearms)|bolt]], extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from the chamber, re-cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a new cartridge into the firing chamber, all without input from the user.  To fire again, however, the user must exert effort to actively release the trigger, allow it to \"reset\", before pulling the trigger again to fire off the next round.  As a result, each trigger-pull only discharges a single round from a semi-automatic weapon, as opposed to a fully automatic weapon, which will shoot continuously as long as the ammunitions are replete and the trigger is kept depressed.\n\n[[Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher]] produced the first successful design for a semi-automatic rifle in 1885, and by the early 20th century, many manufacturers had introduced [[semi-automatic shotgun]]s, [[semi-automatic rifle|rifle]]s and [[semi-automatic pistol|pistol]]s. \n\nIn military use, self-loading rifles were barely used in [[World War I]], and most armies in World War II also still relied upon the manually loaded [[bolt-action]] rifles, with the exception of the [[United States]], who in 1937 had adopted the [[M1 Garand]] as the standard-issue infantry weapon.\n\n==Early history (1885\u20131945)==\n[[File:FSA-1917-detoured.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Fusil Automatique Modele 1917]] was the first semi-automatic gun that fires [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridges]] to be widely issued in the infantry of any nation's army.|400x400px]]\nThe first successful design for a [[semi-automatic rifle]] is attributed to [[Austria]]-born gunsmith [[Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher]], who unveiled the design in 1885.<ref name=\"Jewison2010\">{{cite web |last1=Jewison |first1=Glenn |last2=Steiner |first2=J\u00f6rg C. |year=2010 |title=Ferdinand Ritter von Mannlicher |url=http://www.austro-hungarian-army.co.uk/biog/mannlicher.htm |website=austro-hungarian-army.co.uk |publisher=Glenn Jewison |access-date= }}</ref> The Model 85 was followed by the equally innovative Mannlicher Models 91, 93 and 95 semi-automatic rifles.<ref name=\"Smith1947\">{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Walter H.B. |year=1947 |title=Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols: Famous Sporting and Military Weapons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfqingEACAAJ& |location= |publisher=Military Service Publishing |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref> Although Mannlicher earned his reputation with his [[bolt-action]] rifle designs, he also produced a few semi-automatic pistols, including the [[Steyr Mannlicher M1894]], which employed an unusual [[Blow forward|blow-forward action]] and held five rounds of 6.5&nbsp;mm ammunition that were fed into the M1894 by a [[stripper clip]].\n\n===Semi-automatic shotgun===\n[[File:Remington 1100 Tactical 8 Rounds.jpg|thumb|right|[[Remington 1100]] Tactical Shotgun in 12 gauge \u2013 an example of a semi-automatic [[shotgun]]]]\n\nA few years later, American gunsmith [[John Browning|John Moses Browning]] developed the first successful [[semi-automatic shotgun]], the [[Browning Auto-5]], which was first manufactured in 1902 by [[Fabrique Nationale de Herstal]] and sold in America under the Browning name. The Auto-5 relied on [[recoil operation|long recoil operation]]; this design remained the dominant form in semi-automatic shotguns for approximately 50 years. Production of the Auto-5 was ended in 1999.\n\n===Blowback semi-automatic===\nIn 1903 and 1905, the [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company]] introduced the first semi-automatic [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] and [[Centerfire ammunition|centerfire]] rifles designed especially for the civilian market. The [[Winchester Model 1903]] and [[Winchester Model 1905]] operated on the principle of [[Blowback (arms)#blowback|blowback]] in order to function semi-automatically. Designed entirely by [[T.C. Johnson]], the Model 1903 achieved commercial success and continued to be manufactured until 1932 when the Winchester Model 63 replaced it.\n\nBy the early 20th century, several manufacturers had introduced semi-automatic .22 sporting rifles, including [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]], [[Remington Arms|Remington]], Fabrique Nationale and [[Savage Arms]], all using the direct blow-back system of operation. Winchester introduced a medium caliber semi-automatic sporting rifle, the [[Winchester Model 1907|Model 1907]] as an upgrade to the Model 1905, utilizing a blowback system of operation, in calibers such as [[.351 Winchester Self-Loading|.351 Winchester]]. Both the Models of 1905 and 1907 saw limited military and police use.\n\n===Notable early semi-automatic rifles===\nIn 1906, [[Remington Arms]] introduced the \"[[Remington Model 8|Remington Auto-loading Repeating Rifle]].\" Remington advertised this rifle, renamed the \"Model 8\" in 1911, as a sporting rifle. This is a locked-breech, [[long recoil]] action designed by [[John Browning]]. The rifle was offered in .25, .30, .32, and .35 caliber models, and gained popularity among civilians as well as some law enforcement officials who appreciated the combination of a semi-automatic action and relatively powerful rifle cartridges. The Model 81 superseded the Model 8 in 1936 and was offered in [[.300 Savage]] as well as the original Remington calibers.\n\nThe first semi-automatic rifle adopted and widely issued by a major military power ([[France]]) was the [[Fusil Automatique Modele 1917]]. This is a locked-breech, gas-operated action which is very similar in its mechanical principles to the future [[M1 Garand]] in the United States. The M1917 was fielded during the latter stages of [[World War I]] but it did not receive a favorable reception. However its shortened and improved version, the Model 1918, was much more favourably received during the Moroccan [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] from 1920 to 1926. The [[Lebel Model 1886 rifle|Lebel]] bolt-action rifle remained the standard French infantry rifle until replaced in 1936 by the [[MAS-36 rifle|MAS-36]] despite the various semi-automatic rifles designed between 1918 and 1935.\n\nOther nations experimented with self-loading rifles between the two World Wars, including the [[United Kingdom]], which had intended to replace the bolt-action [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] with a self-loader, possibly chambered for sub-caliber ammunition, but discarded that plan as the imminence of the Second World War and the emphasis shifted from replacing every rifle with a new design to speeding-up re-armament with existing weapons. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] would both issue successful self-loading and selective-fire rifles on a large scale during the course of the war, but not in sufficient numbers to replace their standard bolt-action rifles.\n\n===Notable gas-operated rifles===\n[[File:SKS Flickr.jpg|thumb|right|The SKS is a semi-automatic Russian rifle]]\n\nIn 1937, the American [[M1 Garand]] was the first semi-automatic rifle to replace its nation's bolt-action rifle as the standard-issue infantry weapon. The [[gas-operated]] M1 Garand was developed by Canadian-born [[John Garand]] for the U.S. government at the [[Springfield Armory]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]]. After years of research and testing, the first production model of the M1 Garand was unveiled in 1937.

[[Selective fire|Selective-fire]] firearms are capable of both full automatic and semi-automatic modes. \n\nSemi-automatic refers to a firearm which uses the force of recoil or gas to eject the empty case and load a fresh cartridge into the firing chamber for the next shot and which allows repeat shots solely through the action of pulling the trigger. A [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action|double-action]] revolver also requires only a trigger pull for each round that is fired but is not considered semi-automatic since the manual action of pulling the trigger is what advances the cylinder, not the energy of the preceding shot.\n\n==Fully automatic compared to semi-automatic==\n[[File:Walther P99 9x19mm.png|thumb|right|[[Walther guns|Walther]] [[Walther P99|P99]], a [[semi-automatic pistol]] from the late 1990s]]\n[[File:Glock 18C.jpg|thumb|[[Glock #Glock 18|Glock 18]], a [[Fully-automatic firearm|fully-automatic]] [[machine pistol]] from the mid 1980s (The picture shown is the Glock 18C)]]\n\nThe usage of the term ''automatic'' may vary according to context. Gun specialists point out that the word ''automatic'' is sometimes misunderstood to mean [[Automatic firearm|fully automatic fire]] when used to refer to a self-loading, semi-automatic firearm not capable of fully automatic fire. In this case, ''automatic'' refers to the loading mechanism, not the firing capability. To avoid confusion, it is common to refer to such firearms as an \"autoloader\" in reference to its loading mechanism. \n\nThe term \"automatic pistol\" almost exclusively refers to a semi-automatic (i.e. not fully automatic) pistol (fully automatic pistols are usually referred to as [[machine pistol|machine pistols]]). With handguns, the term \"automatic\" is commonly used to distinguish semi-automatic pistols from revolvers. The term \"auto-loader\" may also be used to describe a semi-automatic handgun. However, to avoid confusion, the term \"automatic rifle\" is generally, conventionally and best restricted to a rifle capable of fully automatic fire. Both uses of the term \"automatic\" can be found; the exact meaning must be determined from context.\n\n==Auto-loading==\nThe mechanism of semi-automatic (or autoloading) firearms is usually what is known as a [[closed bolt|closed-bolt]] firing system. In a closed-bolt system, a round must first be chambered manually before the weapon can fire. When the trigger is pulled, only the hammer and [[firing pin]] move, striking and firing the cartridge. The bolt then recoils far enough rearward to extract and load a new cartridge from the [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] into the firearm's chamber, ready to fire again once the trigger is pulled.\n\nAn [[open bolt|open-bolt]] mechanism is a common characteristic of fully automatic firearms. With this system, pulling the trigger releases the bolt from a cocked, rearward position, pushing a cartridge from the magazine into the chamber, firing the gun. The bolt retracts to the rearward position, ready to strip the next cartridge from the magazine. The open-bolt system is often used in [[submachine gun]]s and other weapons with a high rate of fire. It is rarely used in semi-automatic-only firearms, which can fire only one shot with each pull of the trigger. The closed-bolt system is generally more accurate, as the [[centre of gravity]] changes relatively little at the moment the trigger is pulled.\n\nWith fully automatic weapons, open-bolt operation allows air to circulate, cooling the barrel; with semi-automatic firearms, the closed-bolt operation is preferred, as overheating is not as critical, and accuracy is preferred. Some select-fire military weapons use an open bolt in fully automatic mode and a closed bolt when semi-automatic is selected.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[M1911 pistol]]\n* [[Borchardt C-93]] pistol\n* [[Dragunov (SVD-63) sniper rifle]]\n* [[FN FAL]]\n* [[Fusil Automatique Modele 1917]]\n* [[Gewehr 43]]\n* [[Luger pistol]]\n* [[M1 Garand]]\n* [[MAS-49 rifle]]\n* [[Mondrag\u00f3n rifle]]\n* [[Meunier rifle]]\n* [[SVT-40]]\n* [[SKS]]\n* [[Glock-17]]\n* [[Smith & Wesson M&P15-22]]}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Main articles\n** [[Semi-automatic pistol]]\n** [[Semi-automatic rifle]]\n** [[Semi-automatic shotgun]]\n* Related subjects\n** [[Single-shot]]\n** [[AR-15 style rifle]]\n** [[Assault weapon]] - certain semi-automatic firearms are classified as assault weapons in some jurisdictions\n** [[Assault rifle]]\n** [[Designated marksman rifle]]\n** [[Personal defense weapon]]\n** [[Repeating rifle|Repeating Rifle]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* NPR Audio Report: [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3913023 The Appeal of Semi-Automatic Weapons]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Semi-Automatic Firearm}}\n[[Category:Firearm actions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n\nA '''semi-automatic [[firearm]]''', also called '''self-loading firearm''' or '''autoloading firearm''' (though [[automatic firearm|fully automatic]] and [[selective fire]] firearms technically are also self-loading), is one whose [[firearm action|action]] mechanism ''automatically'' loads a following round of [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] into the [[chamber (firearms)|chamber]] (self-loading) and prepares it for subsequent firing, but requires the shooter to ''manually'' actuate the [[trigger]] in order to discharge each shot.

It is located in the [[Vale of White Horse]] near the [[River Thames]], across the road from the twelfth-century [[Norman architecture|Norman]] Hall and the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor House]]. The Abbey has been recognised by the [[Historic buildings council|Historic Building Council for England]] (now [[Historic England]]) as a building of outstanding historic and [[architecture|architectural]] interest.<ref name=abbeyarchives>The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay archives.</ref> It is considered to be a \u2018textbook\u2019 example of an English medieval [[manor house]]{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} and has been a [[listed building#Grade I|Grade I-listed]] building since 1952.<ref name=listed />\n\nThe Abbey has its origins in the thirteenth century as a [[clergy house|rectory]] of [[Abingdon Abbey]], a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] up north in [[Abingdon-on-Thames]]. Several construction phases took place during the Middle Ages, carried out by prominent figures like [[Solomon of Rochester]], [[Thomas Beckington]] and [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], but it wasn't until the seventeenth century that the current plan was completed.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}} It was probably during the [[Victorian era]] that the house obtained the name 'The Abbey'.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> From 1495 to 1867, The Abbey was in possession of [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], who leased the estate among others to [[John Fettiplace (politician died 1580)|John Fettiplace]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAfter being inhabited by [[Evelyn St. Croix Fleming]], the estate was bought by [[David Astor]] in 1958, who leased it to the [[Ockenden International|Ockenden Venture]] which offered sanctuary to refugees and displaced children. In the 70s, The Abbey was lent to the exiled Bishop [[Colin Winter]] to house the [[Namibia International Peace Centre]]. In 1978, the [[Astor family]] sold the house and in 1980 it came into possession of The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] led by Dr. [[Fred Blum]] and Bishop [[Stephen Verney]].<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The New Era Centre used The Abbey as a [[retreat (spiritual)|spiritual retreat]] and conference centre, and changed its name to '''The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay''' in the 1990s.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> \n\nThe Abbey, Sutton Courtenay is a residential centre in which a [[spiritualism|spiritual]] community offers hospitality to people who are seeking spiritual refreshment, [[personal development|personal growth]] and [[healing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=278687&subid=0|title=The Abbey Sutton Courtenay Limited|website=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]]|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref> The Abbey also organises public events concerning spirituality, personal development, education, music and the arts.<ref name=abingdon />\n\n== Buildings ==\n[[File:Plan_of_The_Abbey,_Sutton_Courtenay.png|thumb|A plan of the main building (ground floor).]]\nThe Abbey forms a [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with an inner [[courtyard]]. It has 28 rooms and a [[great hall]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The building has two storeys and has clay roof tiles on a structure made with stone and timber. Originally, it had a thatched roof. Four ranges are arranged around the central courtyard. The oldest still surviving parts of The Abbey are the north and west ranges, the frames of which were originally from wood, parts of which were later encased in stone in order to stabilise the structure.\n\nNowadays, there is also a guest house which is used for customers, conference guests and visitors. It is adjacent to the main house and it has its own kitchen with a dining area.

The wing is largely timber-framed. On the ground floor at the southwest end, the wing seems to incorporate a stone wall of an earlier structure, in which lateral chimney stacks have been built with fire places dating from the nineteenth century. The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses accommodation and a [[solitary confinement|meditation room]].<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that a ceiling has never hidden it.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality. The main timbers are made from very large trees carefully sawn to avoid waney edges.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=231}} All four posts have been made from the same tree. The structure has nineteenth- and twentieth-century renovations.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} It has a wooden floor and can accommodate up to sixty people seated.<ref name=abbeystaying />\n\n=== North range ===\n[[File:Library, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay 01.jpg|thumb|The library.]]\nIn the courtyard between the north and west range is a timber-framed staircase outshut, dating from before the stone casing of the early fourteenth century. The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor originally served as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} The roof structure was similar to the open roof of the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the room was separated into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room. These rooms now serve as the library and dining room respectively.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\n[[File:Solar, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The [[solar (room)|solar]].]]\nOn the ground floor of the three eastern bays, the third bay from the east was probably open to the roof and is nowadays part of the same room with the third bay from the west (the room east of the parlour). It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nToday, the east range holds the entrance archway. It was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied wooden frame upper part standing on stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range. The construction of this block completed the courtyard plan.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range extends the service wing and was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and was once used for the kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range now serves as the administration office of The Abbey.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by a [[Tilia|lime tree]] [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house. Although the avenue across the grounds appears to have existed before the enclosure (some trees are older than 1804) the house stood on the eastern edge of its curtilage until 1798. The old boundary wall survives, only circa two meters beyond the east wall of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} Nowadays, The Abbey consists of six acres of grounds which are of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance because the remains of ancillary buildings underlie the gardens.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The [[perimeter]] is indicated by old stone walls, wooden fencing and dead hedging.\n\nSome four and a half acres of the land are used as gardens. On the north lawn, there is a [[Platanus|plane tree]] surrounded by [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodils]]. Here grow [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[beech]], [[bramble]], various [[Pinophyta|conifers]], [[Acer campestre|field maple]], [[Hedera|ivy]], [[oak]], [[Rhododendron|rhododendrons]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]] trees. There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg. Padus|bird cherry]], [[Morus (plant)|mulberry]] and a [[Cedrus libani|cedar of Lebanon]]. In 1991, a project was completed which took care for the trees and [[transplanting|transplanted]] various species around the grounds. Adjacent to the grounds, there is a small secluded [[orchard]] where honey is produced from The Abbey's own [[mason bee|mason]] and [[honey bee]]s. The guest house area contains apple, [[Sambucus|elder]], ivy, [[Euonymus|spindle]], [[Viburnum lantana|wayfarer]] and ywe alongside plants like  [[Rosa setigera|climbing roses]], [[fern]]s and [[Salvia officinalis|sage]].<ref name=abbeygrounds>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/grounds/|title=The Abbey Grounds|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=19 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref>\n\nThe courtyard garden has a [[Ficus|fig tree]], ''[[Magnolia]]'', [[rose]]s and a medieval style flower bed surrounded by a mature ''[[Buxus]]'' hedging. This garden was restored during the 1990s with [[gravel]]led paths and redesigned by B. Vellacot, a local volunteer. Around the main building there are flower beds with plants such as [[catnip]], [[Helichrysum italicum|curry plants]], ''[[Fuchsia]]'', [[Lavandula|lavender]], [[Vinca|periwinkle]], [[rosemary]], sage, [[Brunnera macrophylla|Siberian bugloss]], [[Spiraea|spirea]] and [[Jasminum nudiflorum|winter jasmine]]. Near the kitchen, there is a herb bed underneath a [[Betula pendula|silver birch]]. The walled [[kitchen garden]] has a [[wildflower]] meadow, a cut flower bed, a bed with [[strawberry|strawberries]] and trees including [[damson]], [[Ficus|fig]], [[greengage]], [[Prunus cerasus|morello cherry]], [[olive]], [[pear]], plum and [[quince]].

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory. Colnet was the doctor of King [[Henry V of England]] and was rector until 1420. He left money to the church and poor of Sutton.<ref>[[Berkshire Record Office]], D/EP 7/123.</ref> [[Thomas Beckington]], rector since 1420 and secretary of King [[Henry VI of England]], stayed at Sutton twice in 1442 and perhaps on other occasions.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} The ceiling of the solar is attributed to Beckington.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> In 1442, he was accompanied by [[William Say (priest)|William Say]], who succeeded him as rector when Beckington became [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] in 1443.{{sfn |Fletcher |1990 |p=60-2}} In 1444, Say obtained license to celebrate divine office in the house.

In 1984, after The Abbey was improved to a habitable state, the first two resident community members moved in.

Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers. Volunteers from organisations such as [[WWOOF]] UK and [[HelpX]] still play a vital role in keeping The Abbey alive.

The plastered stone wall on the south side, which is of timber above the first floor, is an underbuilding for an [[overhang (architecture)|overhang]]. The north wall consists of large [[ashlar]] blocks suggesting that that was done between the fifteenth and seventeenth century and it had a three-light [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular]] window. Its timber-framed north wall is also the south wall of the great hall. The [[dormer]] roof between the truss of the great hall and the service wing is done in a thirteenth-century technique. The roof of the service wing itself, however, is post-medieval.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} Today, the service wing houses accommodation and a [[solitary confinement|meditation room]].<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nThe great hall was originally timber-framed and integrated with the contemporary service wing. It was cased in stone between 1320 and 1340 to prevent deforming of the base crucks under [[shear stress]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=232}} The hall has two equal [[bay (architecture)|bays]] and the four two-light windows have been replaced in the twentieth century by three-light Perpendicular windows. The stonework of the northern doorway was largely renewed in the nineteenth century. It has wave-moulded [[jamb]]s, [[voussoir]]s and an [[ogee]]-scroll [[hood mould]]. The original southern doorway was less important and similar in style, but with [[chamfer]]ed jambs. The east wall abuts the north range with a straight joint, while the joint of the north range with the west wall is obscured by plaster. The doorway in the east wall has been rebuilt in brick.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=228}} The west wall of the hall is [[battlement|castellated]] and probably early nineteenth century.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The great hall survives open to the roof, with one cruck truss carrying a [[king post]] which is unique in that it has never been hidden by a ceiling.<ref name=abbeyhistory>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/history/|title=The Abbey - 800 Years of History|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2020}}</ref> The workmanship of the timber structure is of exceptional quality.

The stair is modern and leads to a door on the first floor of the north range. The outshut roof was probably repaired in the seventeenth century with an inserted [[purlin]].{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe northern range is roofed in six bays. The western three bays were originally also built in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, while the eastern three bays of the northern range have timber work in the roof that indicates a fifteenth-century date.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=233}}\n\nThe finish of the timbers of the three western bays in the north range is of inferior quality to that of the hall. On the ground floor was a [[parlour]] now used as a dining room, located under the two most western bays. The walls of this parlour vary in size. The west wall contains a three-light Perpendicular window, the north wall contains three two-light ones. The present fireplace is modern but there must have been a chimney since the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=234}} East of the parlour, the floor level rises and there is a [[cross passage]]. The door at the north end of the passage became blocked and was reopened only in the 1980s. East to the passage, under the third bay from the west, is a lodged floor. Originally, the bay was divided in a room to the north and a narrow room or corridor to the south.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}} The first floor originally served as a [[great chamber]], the second most important room in a medieval English manor house. This chamber was entered through a door from the staircase outshut. It is dominated by two fourteenth-century two-light [[transom (architecture)|transom]] windows in the west [[gable]] and in the north wall. The reveals of a third window also remain in the north wall.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> The present fireplace has [[musician]] [[corbel]]s from the fifteenth century.{{sfn |Wood |1965 |p=XVIIE (plate)}} It had the same open roof structure as the great hall until probably the seventeenth century, when the room was separated into two rooms, with a corridor on the south side of the eastern room.

It has a small [[lancet window]] in the northern wall at the base of the chimney. The two eastern most bays formed one room and has a modern partition from a corridor to the south. The north and east walls are both from stone, and at the east end of the northern wall is a blocked window. The other two windows are modern. An overhang projected northwards to the room. The present timber south wall replaced a stone wall, remains of which were found during [[plumbing]] operations in 1987-8.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=236}} On the first floor there was a [[solar (room)|solar]] in the second and third bay from the east which was to the south divided from the dining room by a timber-framed partition. On the north side, there are two nineteenth- or twentieth-century Gothic windows flanking a large chimney with a fireplace. There may have been a partition in the middle of the room before the fireplace was built. The solar has a partition to the east behind which was a [[chapel]] and a door from the north to the east range.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=235}}\n\n=== East range ===\n[[File:Arch, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|East entrance looking into the courtyard.]]\nToday, the east range holds the entrance archway. It was constructed around 1500 and contains three bays. The modern gatehouse, at the northern end of the east range, has a lancet window in its east wall. It has a jettied timber frame upper on existing stone walls.<ref name=abbeyhistory /> \n\nSouth of the archway, the wall was timber framed but later partially infilled with brick and rubble as far as the chimney, where it abuts the south range. This timber framed wall is on a different alignment than the gatehouse, probably to unite with the south wall of the southeastern block, which may have been a wall around the building rather than part of a building.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\nThe roof of the southern bay of the east range was black-smokened and may have served as a kitchen or [[brewhouse]] at some time into which a chimney was later inserted.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}}\n\n=== South range ===\n[[File:Hearth, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The Hearth, a meeting room in the south range.]]\nThe adjoining southeast corner block appears to have been roofed, probably in the seventeenth century, to connect the east range with the south range. The construction of this block completed the courtyard plan.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=237}} \n\nThe south range extends the service wing and was added during the mid-sixteenth century. The two storey structure consisting of three bays was open to the eaves and was once used for the kitchen.<ref name=abbeyhistory />\n\nNowadays, the southeast corner block contains a meeting room called 'The Hearth', seating up to eighteen people.<ref name=abbeystaying /> The south range now serves as the administration office of The Abbey.\n\n== Grounds ==\n[[File:Avenue1, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The lime tree avenue.]]\n[[File:Courtyard2, The Abbey Sutton Courtenay.jpg|thumb|The courtyard garden.]]\nIn 1804, Francis Justice, who was in possession of the estate at the time, was allotted over two acres on the green north of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=224}} As a result of this enlargement of the [[curtilage]], The Abbey now stands in the midst of extensive grounds and is approached by a [[Tilia|lime tree]] [[avenue (landscape)|avenue]] across the enclosure allotment, leading near to the east of the house. Although the avenue across the grounds appears to have existed before the enclosure (some trees are older than 1804) the house stood on the eastern edge of its curtilage until 1798. The old boundary wall survives, only circa two meters beyond the east wall of the house.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=225}} Nowadays, The Abbey consists of six acres of grounds which are of [[archaeology|archaeological]] importance because the remains of ancillary buildings underlie the gardens.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The [[perimeter]] is indicated by old stone walls, wooden fencing and dead hedging.\n\nSome four and a half acres of the land are used as gardens.

There are also [[Lauraceae|laurels]], winter-flowering ''[[Viburnum]]'', [[Symphoricarpos|snowberry]], a young [[Prunus serrulata|Japanese cherry]] and [[maple]]. A trunk and several branches from an old [[Fagus sylvatica#Cultivation|copper beech]] serve as a place for [[fungus|fungi]] and [[lichen]]s to grow on. Under the trees, there is a purpose built woodstore. On the west lawn, there is a [[Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia|London planetree]]. The south lawn has a [[labyrinth]] in it, where the [[maypole]] is erected. This lawn as young [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and several varieties of [[apple]] and [[plum]] trees. Furthermore, The Abbey has mature [[live oak]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[Prunus subg.

In 1991, a project was completed which took care for the trees and [[transplanting|transplanted]] various species around the grounds. Adjacent to the grounds, there is a small secluded [[orchard]] where honey is produced from The Abbey's own [[mason bee|mason]] and [[honey bee]]s.

In the eleventh century, [[William the Conquerer]] granted the estate of Sutton to the [[House of Courtenay]], and the village became Sutton Courtenay.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> In 1090, King [[William II of England]] granted the [[All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay|church of Sutton]] and its lands and [[tithe]]s to the monks of Abingdon Abbey.{{sfn |Currie |1992 |p=223}}\n\nAbingdon Abbey constructed The Abbey as a [[monastic grange]], used as an administrative centre for the abbey's land and tithe holdings.<ref name=berkshirehistory /> However, the owner of the hide of land, Alwi the priest (whose father owned the land before him according to the [[Domesday Book]]), agreed with the [[abbot]] that he should retain Sutton with reversion first to his son and thereafter to the abbey, on condition of giving in [[Milton, Vale of White Horse|Milton]] chapelry immediately.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=28}} Almost certainly in the late twelfth century, Abingdon Abbey took two thirds of the tithes and the [[rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] the remaining third.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=104-5}} In 1258, following a dispute, the land was formally appropriated to the abbey and a [[clergy house|vicarage]] was ordained.{{sfn |Preston |1919 |p=106}} As it was close to Abingdon Abbey, it was probably run by the monks themselves rather than being left to a steward.<ref name=berkshirehistory>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshirehistory.com/castles/scourtenay_abbey.html|title=The Abbey at Sutton Courtenay|access-date=16 March 2020|date=2004|work=Royal Berkshire History|author=David Nash Ford}}</ref> In 1278, however, [[Hugh de Courtenay]], Lord of the [[Manor House (Sutton Courtenay)|Manor of Sutton]], sued the abbey for [[advowson]].

Many of these men rarely visited Sutton, leaving the running of The Abbey to various underlings. William Steele, rector in 1371, left money to each of his four servants in Sutton. Robert of Walsham, rector from 1372 to 1384 and Dean of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], may have resided intermittently. His successor John Yernemouth was rector from 1384 to 1397 and did not reside but hired a chaplain to perform his duties. John Yernemouth was the [[chaplain]] of Prince [[John of Gaunt]], son of King [[Edward III of England]]. He left the rectory to William Brouns, father of Bishop [[Thomas Brunce|Thomas Brouns]], and two others sometime before 1394. By then, the building had become ruinous and badly roofed. Walter Medford, later [[Archdeacon of Berkshire]], was rector from 1397 to 1413 and may well have used the house. His successor, Nicholas Colnet, also may have resided at the rectory.

After months of torrential rain that hindered work, the house was sold in 1980 to The New Era Centre, a [[foundation (nonprofit)|non-profit charity]] established by Dr [[Fred Blum]] in 1967. During his lifetime, Blum became a member of the [[Quakers]], whilst maintaining his Jewish heritage. In 1963, Blum resigned from his academic posts in the [[United States]] and pursued a future based in the United Kingdom.{{sfn |Mehta |2011 |p=56}} In 1969, he met Bishop [[Stephen Verney]] at a conference in [[Coventry]] where Verney was doing [[reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]] work. They became friends, \u201clike brothers\u201d, and Verney became a [[trustee]] and significant supporter and contributor to the creation and work of The New Era Centre at The Abbey, which became a [[charitable organization|registered charity]] on 20 December 1979. Verney was a well-connected individual, and frequently communicated with the politician [[Roy Jenkins]].<ref name=abbeyarchives /> The residential community of The New Era Centre in The Abbey was dedicated on 4 October 1981 as a space to explore and work towards the synthesis of [[Christianity]] and more contemporary understandings of societal transformation. In 1984, after The Abbey was improved to a habitable state, the first two resident community members moved in. Stephen Verney extensively discussed, and believed in, the role Buddhist practice and philosophy could play in increasing connectivity with a Christian deity, and it was this belief which led many of The New Era Centre\u2019s early pursuits.<ref name=abbeyarchives /> Blum spent decades researching, interviewing and publishing on [[Mahatma Gandhi]]\u2019s life works and legacy. So too did The Abbey welcome [[India]]n thinkers, such as the social activist and spiritual leader [[Vimala Thakar]] who, in the 1980s, led a seminar here. Among the earliest events taking place at The Abbey was the annual [[Gandhi Foundation]] Summer School that continued to be held there. Much of Blum's work can now be found in The Abbey's library. {{sfn |Mehta |2011 |p=58}}\n\n[[File:The Abbey ruinous state.jpg |thumb|The Abbey in a ruinous state, around 1979.]]\nTwentieth-century landowners had to contend with various states of disrepair, and few have had either the capital or the will to sustain the business. Upon the purchase of The Abbey by The New Era Centre in 1980, a monumental effort was required to source volunteer labour, both locally and from abroad. Sourcing funding was difficult, and some potential investors remained unconvinced that the founders high ideals could lead to anything other than a misuse of funds. However, Blum and Verney remained committed to their project, disputing each critical point. Much of the work was carried out in a co-operative form, such as the 'work camp' of 1981, a community of enthusiastic volunteers. Volunteers from organisations such as [[WWOOF]] UK and [[HelpX]] still play a vital role in keeping The Abbey alive. Blum died in January 1990 and Verney continued the work at The Abbey, but retired in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theabbey.uk.com/volunteering/|title=Volunteering|website=www.theabbey.uk.com|date=2020|access-date=20 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1991, the charity was re-named 'The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay'.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226181509}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tebble|first1=Adam|last2=Meadowcroft|first2=John|title=F.A.

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''.

This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years.

This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D.

It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialisation and social equalisation of Arab nations and often were characterised by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialisation development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> [[Economic liberalisation]] in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalisation and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratisation ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]].

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. {{ISBN|9780812004038}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|9780754636571}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. {{ISBN|9780140806229}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1986) [1981].

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialisation and social equalisation of Arab nations and often were characterised by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialisation development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> [[Economic liberalisation]] in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalisation and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratisation ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|year=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries.

However, they did not establish clear social or political parameters for this new liberation.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/>\n\nAfrican leaders consistently viewed socialism as a direct rejection of the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial system]] and in turn dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. They attempted to infuse various forms of socialism\u2014some Marxist\u2013Leninist, others democratic\u2014into tailored ideologies specific to each country.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/> Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a \"focal institutional\" society.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

Although its name may imply otherwise, it is not a part of the City of [[Chicago]]'s local government but is created by [[Illinois]] state government with an elected Board of Commissioners. The MWRD's main purposes are the reclamation and treatment of wastewater and flood water abatement in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] to protect the health and safety of citizens and of area waterways. In 1900, the District notably reversed the flow of the [[Chicago River]], and it is currently involved in the large multi-decade construction of the \"Deep Tunnel\" and/or Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP).\n\n==Organization and Administration==\nThe MWRD is governed by a nine-member Board of Commissioners elected at large from throughout Cook County, Illinois for six-year terms.  Terms are staggered so that three commission chairs are open every two years.  Bi-annually the board elects from its members a President, Vice President, and Chairman of Finance. All of the commissioners receive $70,000 per year, except the Vice President and Chairman of Finance receive $75,000, and the President receives $80,000.\n\nCommissioners act as the MWRD\u2019s legislative branch establishing policies and procedures for meeting the goals of the District.\n\n===Board of Commissioners===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Title\n!Name\n!Political Party\n!Residence\n!Term began\n!Term ends\n|-\n|President\n|Kari K.

The Sanitary District Enabling Act of May 29, 1889, established the District with the purpose of managing [[water supply]] and [[wastewater]] issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1324.html |title=Water |website=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}</ref>  Two important early projects included the reversal of the [[Chicago River]], designed to carry wastewater away from [[Lake Michigan]], and the construction of the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] in 1900 which aided in the flow of water away from Lake Michigan, the source of the region's drinking water.  The [[canal]] also allowed for larger commercial vessels to move from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] by way of the Des Plaines River, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] River and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] River. The Sanitary and Ship Canal was so successful that two more canals were built. In 1910, the North Shore Channel was completed to provide drainage for the marshy areas north of the city and to direct lake water into the North Branch of the Chicago River for dilution. The Cal-Sag Channel was ready for operation in 1922, which also was the year the first treatment plant of the Sanitary District of Chicago was completed. The Cal-Sag Channel reversed the flow of the Calumet Rivers.\n\nAlthough the District\u2019s first assignment in reversing the flow of the river and constructing a vast network of waterways was clear, establishing itself was the first hurdle. There was a sense of urgency creating a sanitary district due to a booming population, the fear of waterborne illness, the quality of the drinking water supply in Lake Michigan and a contaminated river, but two previous attempts at legislation in the Illinois General Assembly had been stalled over concerns of discharging used water downstream. A special commission consisting of Chicago Mayor John Roche, two members of the Illinois House and two members of the Illinois Senate were appointed to gather public opinion and then buy-in for another round of legislation. The committee proposed constructing a canal wide enough to accommodate steamboat traffic, satisfying downstate interests. The chance to promote economic development linking the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico ultimately persuaded the rest of the state to adopt legislation. On May 29, 1889, the General Assembly approved \u201can Act to Create Sanitary Districts and to Remove Obstructions in the Des Plaines and Illinois Rivers.\u201d  The Enabling Act required a referendum establishing the boundaries of the District, roughly covering 185 square miles from the lakefront west to Harlem Avenue and from Devon Avenue on the north to 87th Street on the south. The District\u2019s services were in such demand that the residents living in the proposed area voted in a landslide 70,958 to 242 in favor of its creation. \n\nAs the District established a new Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), new advancements in water treatment technology were made, leading to the creation of treatment plants and interceptor sewers that conveyed water from local collection systems to the plants for treatment. The MWRD constructed 560 miles of intercepting sewers and force mains ranging in size from 6 inches to 27 feet in diameter. The intercepting sewers are fed by approximately 10,000 local sewer system connections and are critical in managing stormwater and preserving the waterways.\n\nFrom 1955 through 1988, the District was called The Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago. In order to provide a more accurate perception of the District\u2019s current functions and responsibilities, the name was changed effective, January 1, 1989, to Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago<ref>Joseph T.

The Powerhouse is located right before the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal connects with the Des Plaines River. The facility is an integral part of the MWRD's task of managing the CAWS and reducing the risk of flooding throughout the MWRD service area.\u00a0 The Lockport Powerhouse enables the MWRD to control the levels of the canal. In addition to its role in managing the waterways, the Lockport Powerhouse also provides financial benefits from hydroelectric power generation.\u00a0 The water flowing through the facility is harnessed by 2 turbines to provide a safe and environmentally friendly hydroelectric energy source that is sold back to Commonwealth Edison. Lockport generates over $1 million worth of electricity annually.

The MWRD operates the largest [[Sewage treatment|water reclamation]] plant in the world, the '''Stickney Water Reclamation Plant''' in [[Stickney, Illinois]], in addition to six other plants and 23 [[pumping station]]s. These seven plants range in capacity from 1.2 billion gallons per day at the Stickney Plant to 2.3 million gallons per day at the Lemont Plant.\n\nA water reclamation facility usually contains two treatment plants. One is for processing the wastewater while the other is for treating the solids captured during the first process.\n\nApproximately 454 billion gallons were treated at the District plants during 2017. These plants have been very successful in meeting the National Pollutant and Discharge Elimination System permit limits. These limits are designed to protect and enhance the quality of our waterways.\n\nThe 2017 average plant flow, effluent values, and permit compliance for each plant are presented below in Table 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous/waterreclamation|title=MWRDGC|website=www.mwrd.org|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Plant\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Flow\n\n(MGD)\n| colspan=\"3\" |Effluent (mg/l)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Permit\n\nViolations\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Permit\n\nCompliance\n|-\n|CBOD\n|SS\n|NH4-N\n|-\n|Stickney WRP\n|677\n|2\n|5\n|0.5\n|1\n|99.94%\n|-\n|Calumet WRP\n|256\n|3\n|6\n|0.4\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|O'Brien WRP\n|232\n|2\n|6\n|0.6\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Kirie WRP\n|41.77\n|2\n|2\n|0.3\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Egan WRP\n|23.9\n|2\n|2\n|0.1\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Hanover Park WRP\n|9.50\n|3\n|5\n|0.3\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Lemont WRP\n|2.56\n|4\n|8\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|0\n|100%\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''CBOD'''\n|Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand\n|-\n|'''SS'''\n|Suspended Solids\n|-\n|'''NH4-N'''\n|Ammonia Nitrogen\n|}\nThe MWRD treats an average {{convert|1.5|e9USgal|m3}} of wastewater each day. It also shares responsibility with the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] for the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), including the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal and approximately {{convert|76|mi|km}} of waterways, part of a national system connecting the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Great Lakes, and the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name=\"CAFR2015\" />{{rp|14}}\n\n===Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP)===\n{{main|Tunnel and Reservoir Plan}}\nThe MWRD oversees one of the largest [[civil engineering]] projects ever undertaken\u2014the [[Tunnel and Reservoir Plan]], better known as the \"Deep Tunnel Project.\" It includes over one hundred miles of tunnels, 9 to {{convert|33|ft|m}} in diameter, each part of an extensive flood mitigation and pollution control project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous/tarp |title=SAP NetWeaver Portal |website=Mwrd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}</ref>  The first phase of TARP was completed in 2006 and consists of 109.4 miles of deep, large diameter tunnels that have a total storage capacity of 2.3 billion gallons; the tunnels have provided millions of dollars in flood protection benefits. TARP\u2019s large tunnels and reservoirs are designed to reduce the amount of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and hold the polluted water until it can be fully treated at MWRD water reclamation plants. Since the TARP tunnels went online, the average annual number of days with CSOs has been reduced to 50 from 100.  The second phase of TARP involves the construction of three reservoirs which, when completed in 2029, will provide more than 18 billion gallons of storage capacity. The Majewski Reservoir was completed in 1998 and provides 350 million gallons of CSO storage. Since it went online, the Majewski Reservoir has provided over $250 million in flood reduction benefits to its service area in Arlington Heights, Des Plaines, and Mount Prospect. Since 1998, when the MWRD executed an agreement with the owner of the Thornton quarry to mine the north lobe of the quarry for use as a component of TARP, over 152 billion pounds of 400 million year old dolomite limestone was blasted and removed. Located along interstate 80 in southern Cook County, the Thornton Composite Reservoir, an important component of the MWRD's TARP, went into operation on December 31, 2015.  The Thornton Composite Reservoir came online at the same time as disinfection facilities at the MWRD\u2019s Calumet Water Reclamation Plant in Chicago, which also serves the southern area of the county. Working in tandem, the combination maximize water quality while minimizing flooding. The third and final piece of TARP is the McCook Reservoir. Stage 1 of McCook Reservoir was completed on Dec. 31, 2017, and adds 3.5 billion gallons of storage capacity. Stage 2 of McCook Reservoir will add 6.5 billion gallons of storage capacity when it comes online in 2029.\n\n===Stormwater Management Authority===\nIn 2004, the Illinois General Assembly granted the MWRD [[stormwater]] management authority for Cook County, and since that time, the MWRD has been working to address regional flooding issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous/stormwateroverview |title=SAP NetWeaver Portal |website=Mwrd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}</ref>  In October 2013, the MWRD Board of Commissioners unanimously approved the Cook County Watershed Management Ordinance (WMO). The WMO provides uniform stormwater management regulations for Cook County in order to prevent future commercial, municipal, and residential development and redevelopment projects from exacerbating flooding.  The WMO can be downloaded at http://wmo.mwrd.org.\n\n===Disinfection ===\nIn June 2011, the MWRD Board of Commissioners voted to implement disinfection technology at the Calumet WRP in Chicago and the North Side (O'Brien) WRP in Skokie. By March, 2012, the MWRD selected the optimal technology for disinfecting the treated water at the Calumet and O'Brien Water Reclamation Plants after a blue ribbon task force evaluated all available disinfection technologies using a triple bottom line approach that considered economic, environmental and social criteria.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014021116/http://www.mwrd.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C10D339F32FF7A420135F8F9911083EC98B50400/filename/12_0301_DisinfectionTechnology.pdf]</ref> The processes selected were chlorination/dechlorination for Calumet and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation with low-pressure high-output lamps for the O'Brien WRP. The estimated capital costs, including engineering design and construction support costs for these two recommended alternatives, totals just over $130 million, approximately 54 percent of the anticipated cost. The internal task force included staff from the departments of Monitoring and Research, Engineering, and Maintenance and Operations. The team systematically evaluated all available disinfection technologies and reviewed academic research and industry practice literature. The task force also performed bench scale studies, monitored existing plant effluent, reviewed site conditions, and contacted industry experts, manufacturers and suppliers, and other large wastewater treatment agencies. In addition, the task force gathered data about design parameters, operational needs, maintenance requirements, and annual and capital costs. Differences in existing infrastructure and hydraulics at the two plants require that a combination of methods be implemented as the basis of final design and construction of the facilities. On Sept. 16, 2013 former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman, former Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Director Lisa Bonnett, State Rep. Robyn Gabel, Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen and other area representatives joined the MWRD Board of Commissioners to break ground on the disinfection facility at the O\u2019Brien WRP.  Significant support for these projects came from local, state and federal leadership. In 2011, U.S. Senators Richard Durbin and Mark Kirk and Congressman Mike Quigley toured the Chicago area waterways and announced their support for the disinfection projects. In April 2012, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, and the U.S. EPA awarded the MWRD $10 million through the Illinois Jobs Now! capital program. That funding supplemented the $21 million in engineering and design costs needed to make the MWRD\u2019s disinfection facilities possible.  In addition to directly improving the water environment, the two disinfection projects created 750 construction, operations and support jobs. Construction was completed by December 2015 and disinfection was in service for the 2016 recreational season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwrd.org |title=SAP NetWeaver Portal |website=Mwrd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}</ref>\n\n===Resource Recovery===\nSince its inception, the MWRD has worked to improve the environment and protect public health, but the way it views its work has evolved since 1889. Sewage is no longer a waste product but instead a collection of resources to be recovered and reused. The MWRD is implementing several innovations in renewable energy, while also recovering and developing reuse opportunities for algae, biosolids, water, phosphorus and other nutrients collected during the water treatment process.\n\n====Nutrient recovery====\nThe MWRD began recovering phosphorus and nitrogen from its Stickney Water Reclamation Plant in the fall of 2015. According to the United Nations Environmental Program, nutrient pollution is among the biggest environmental problems of the 21st century, and the US Environmental Protection Agency has stated that \u201cthe problem of nutrient pollution is nationally significant, expanding, and likely to substantially accelerate.\u201d Excess nutrients promote algae blooms and create dead zones, which can have devastating effects on local ecosystems and economies. The MWRD\u2019s nutrient recovery facility will greatly reduce its nutrient effluent load to the Mississippi river basin, in turn, reducing its impact on hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. The [http://ostara.com/about/ Ostara] technology recovers phosphorus and nitrogen from municipal and industrial wastewater streams and transforms them into an environmentally responsible, enhanced efficiency fertilizer called Crystal Green, which is used by growers in the agriculture, turf and ornamental sectors throughout North America and in Europe. The MWRD partnered with Black & Veatch and Ostara to design and build the nutrient recovery facility at the Stickney Plant.  Once fully operational in 2015, the plant was the largest such facility in the world, with the potential capacity to produce between 10,000 and 15,000 tons of Crystal Green fertilizer annually. \u201cThe MWRD\u2019s decision to install a nutrient recovery facility is at the forefront of a growing trend we\u2019re seeing within the wastewater treatment sector,\u201d said F. Phillip Abrary, president and CEO of Ostara. \u201cIncreasingly, these utilities see themselves as more than simply water treatment plants. Rather, they are resource recovery centers, recycling water, energy and nutrients for beneficial reuse. Our technology helps them fulfill this mandate by recovering phosphorus and nitrogen in a way that is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\u201d Dr. James L. Barnard, Water Global Practice and Technology Leader at Black and Veatch and often referred to as \u201cThe Father of Biological Nutrient Removal,\u201d advised the project team. According to Dr. Barnard, phosphorus is a non-renewable resource that is critical to farming and food production. \u201cNothing grows without it but too much of it can negatively impact water quality,\u201d said Barnard. \u201cBiological nutrient removal enables us to address water quality challenges and recover this precious nutrient for beneficial reuse purposes.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ostara.com/news/news-releases/2013/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-chicago%E2%80%99s-metropolitan-water-reclamation-district-di |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192603/http://www.ostara.com/news/news-releases/2013/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-chicago%E2%80%99s-metropolitan-water-reclamation-district-di |archivedate=2014-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n==== Algae ====\nAlgae naturally uptakes phosphorus and nitrogen from water to support its growth through photosynthesis, utilizing the sun as its energy source. This same approach can be applied to wastewater treatment as a means to remove phosphorus from the waste stream without the use of inorganic chemicals or additional energy, which is the current means of nutrient removal. The MWRD is researching the sustainability of growing algae in a \u201cvertical revolving\u201d fashion; this would reduce the footprint to grow an equivalent algae biomass in a surface pond and simplify the harvesting process. The algae could remove at least 50 percent of phosphorus from wastewater and can be harvested and commoditized for production of bioplastics, biochemicals, biofuels, pharmaceuticals and dyes; or used as fertilizer or as aquaculture feed. The MWRD is also experimenting with algae as a nutrient remover at the O\u2019Brien WRP. It can be used as fertilizer, in a digester, or as aquaculture feed, which returns the phosphorus to the nutrient cycle. The MWRD can produce 24 tons of algae a day. This could potentially stimulate the Chicago regional economy by locating a plastics partner near the treatment plant and reduce reliance on petroleum. The MWRD is supporting leading-edge research in this field to help make algae technology a practical and sustainable approach to nutrient management for urban wastewater treatment plants.  During the water treatment process, the greenhouse research facility at the O\u2019Brien WRP employs a technology called revolving algae biofilm reactors designed by Iowa State University scientists who originally applied it for agricultural applications.\n\n====Biosolids====\nBiosolids are an environmentally friendly product of the water treatment process that supplies organic matter and improves soil structure and porosity to allow plants to more effectively utilize nutrients. Under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, signed into law in 2015, biosolids were formally recognized as a safe, beneficial and renewable resource that should be used locally. Rather than being hauled miles to distant farms and landfills as in years past, the biosolids are now beneficially reused in Cook County. Air-dried biosolids look and feel like dark, fine-textured topsoil, and are used on turfgrass at golf courses, athletic fields, parks and other recreational areas, and for restoration of brownfields and other disturbed lands. To create a value-enhanced product, the MWRD partnered with the city of Chicago to co-compost woodchips from the city's routine tree trimming program and woodchips collected from ash trees lost due to the emerald ash-borer devastation to create a compost ratio of 3:1 woodchips to biosolids. The compost is produced in windrows that are maintained at a temperature of at least 131 degrees for a minimum of 15 days and are turned five times during the period as required in USEPA protocol. The active composting period is followed by four months of curing after which the product is screened through a half-inch screen to remove large pieces of woodchips and tested.\n\n==== Water Reuse ====\nThe MWRD produces 1.2 billion gallons of clean water each day. Draining freshwater resources from Lake Michigan is not always necessary for industrial use. In 2017, the MWRD Board of Commissioners established an introductory price of $1 per thousand gallons for the clean water we produce with the flexibility to adjust the price based on market conditions. We partnered with American Water and set a goal of supplying reused water to the industrial sector at the rate of about 10 million gallons per day. Industrial users pay higher prices for fresh Lake Michigan water.  The MWRD believes water can be used more than once and provide value. Less energy is also used to deliver that water, and more fresh water from the region\u2019s drinking supply in Lake Michigan is also conserved. In addition to being harnessed, water itself is also reused directly through our treatment process. Every day, 15.1 million gallons are reused in pipeline flushing, blower motor cooling, post-centrifuge centrate flushing, and tank cleaning. At the Stickney Water Reclamation Plant, 6 million gallons of treated water per day is used, saving energy and money and reducing demand on drinking water. In addition, the MWRD is pursuing additional reuse applications for the high quality water produced at water reclamation plants. Working with large industrial users in the Calumet and Stickney corridors to find reuse opportunities could provide cost savings to the industrial users and increase fresh water availability for communities.\n\n====Sewerthermal Energy====\nThe MWRD and University of Illinois at Chicago developed a new energy source using an $87,500 grant provided by the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation in 2010; the funding helps to cover the total $175,000 cost. The partnership resulted in significant energy and cost savings at the Kirie Water Reclamation Plant (WRP). Savings include a 25 to 50 percent reduction in electricity usage for heating and cooling needs as well as reductions in maintenance expenses and pollutants associated with separate heating and cooling systems.[http://www.cenews.com/print-news-geothermal_heat_pumps_reduce_e-1313.html University of Illinois news] The Kirie WRP has a daily average flow of 52 million gallons per day (MGD), a capacity of 100 MGD and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year. The Kirie WRP serves 65.2 square miles and approximately 217,000 people. The MWRD originally embarked on the project due to increases in energy costs and the desire to become more environmentally friendly.\n\nThe Kirie system is one of the first to use wastewater for heat recovery and provides the MWRD with the opportunity to evaluate both open and closed loop systems for efficiency and overall performance.  The MWRD and UIC worked to develop a feasibility study for the Kirie WRP, including system design, equipment requirements, historical system data, space requirements and installation.\n\nThe sewerthermal heat and cooling system harnesses energy from treated water and supplies the Kirie WRP with up to 40 percent of its heating and cooling energy needs. This plan provides a model for heating and cooling energy needs at other MWRD facilities. The sewerthermal system will take advantage of relatively constant high temperatures of effluent water and will use only 20 percent or less power than what is needed for a traditional, direct heating system. Rather than extracting heat from the ground as is common for geothermal systems, the MWRD\u2019s system is designed to extract heat from the effluent water, which holds a steady minimum temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref>[http://online.qmags.com/WW0612/default.aspx?fs=2&pg=21&mode=2#pg21&mode2 \"Heat Pump Systems Use Wastewater To Lower HVAC Costs,\"] WaterWorld Magazine, June 2012</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Centennial Fountain]]\n*[[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]\n*[[Jardine Water Purification Plant]]\n*[[Lockport Powerhouse]]\n*[[Chicago 1885 cholera epidemic myth]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mwrd.org/ Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (Official Site)]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Districts of Illinois]]\n[[Category:Public utilities of the United States]]\n[[Category:Water companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:1889 establishments in Illinois]]\n\n{{coord|41|50|N|87|50|W|region:US-IL_scale:500000|display=title}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:Seal MWRD Chicago.JPG|thumb|300px|District Seal]]\nThe '''Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago''' (MWRD), originally known as the '''Sanitary District of Chicago,''' is a [[special-purpose district]] chartered to operate in Cook County, [[Illinois]] since 1889. Although its name may imply otherwise, it is not a part of the City of [[Chicago]]'s local government but is created by [[Illinois]] state government with an elected Board of Commissioners. The MWRD's main purposes are the reclamation and treatment of wastewater and flood water abatement in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] to protect the health and safety of citizens and of area waterways. In 1900, the District notably reversed the flow of the [[Chicago River]], and it is currently involved in the large multi-decade construction of the \"Deep Tunnel\" and/or Tunnel and Reservoir Plan (TARP).\n\n==Organization and Administration==\nThe MWRD is governed by a nine-member Board of Commissioners elected at large from throughout Cook County, Illinois for six-year terms.  Terms are staggered so that three commission chairs are open every two years.  Bi-annually the board elects from its members a President, Vice President, and Chairman of Finance. All of the commissioners receive $70,000 per year, except the Vice President and Chairman of Finance receive $75,000, and the President receives $80,000.\n\nCommissioners act as the MWRD\u2019s legislative branch establishing policies and procedures for meeting the goals of the District.\n\n===Board of Commissioners===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Title\n!Name\n!Political Party\n!Residence\n!Term began\n!Term ends\n|-\n|President\n|Kari K.

The Sanitary District Enabling Act of May 29, 1889, established the District with the purpose of managing [[water supply]] and [[wastewater]] issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1324.html |title=Water |website=Encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}</ref>  Two important early projects included the reversal of the [[Chicago River]], designed to carry wastewater away from [[Lake Michigan]], and the construction of the [[Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal]] in 1900 which aided in the flow of water away from Lake Michigan, the source of the region's drinking water.  The [[canal]] also allowed for larger commercial vessels to move from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] by way of the Des Plaines River, [[Illinois River|Illinois]] River and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] River. The Sanitary and Ship Canal was so successful that two more canals were built. In 1910, the North Shore Channel was completed to provide drainage for the marshy areas north of the city and to direct lake water into the North Branch of the Chicago River for dilution. The Cal-Sag Channel was ready for operation in 1922, which also was the year the first treatment plant of the Sanitary District of Chicago was completed. The Cal-Sag Channel reversed the flow of the Calumet Rivers.\n\nAlthough the District\u2019s first assignment in reversing the flow of the river and constructing a vast network of waterways was clear, establishing itself was the first hurdle. There was a sense of urgency creating a sanitary district due to a booming population, the fear of waterborne illness, the quality of the drinking water supply in Lake Michigan and a contaminated river, but two previous attempts at legislation in the Illinois General Assembly had been stalled over concerns of discharging used water downstream. A special commission consisting of Chicago Mayor John Roche, two members of the Illinois House and two members of the Illinois Senate were appointed to gather public opinion and then buy-in for another round of legislation. The committee proposed constructing a canal wide enough to accommodate steamboat traffic, satisfying downstate interests. The chance to promote economic development linking the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico ultimately persuaded the rest of the state to adopt legislation. On May 29, 1889, the General Assembly approved \u201can Act to Create Sanitary Districts and to Remove Obstructions in the Des Plaines and Illinois Rivers.\u201d  The Enabling Act required a referendum establishing the boundaries of the District, roughly covering 185 square miles from the lakefront west to Harlem Avenue and from Devon Avenue on the north to 87th Street on the south. The District\u2019s services were in such demand that the residents living in the proposed area voted in a landslide 70,958 to 242 in favor of its creation. \n\nAs the District established a new Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS), new advancements in water treatment technology were made, leading to the creation of treatment plants and interceptor sewers that conveyed water from local collection systems to the plants for treatment. The MWRD constructed 560 miles of intercepting sewers and force mains ranging in size from 6 inches to 27 feet in diameter. The intercepting sewers are fed by approximately 10,000 local sewer system connections and are critical in managing stormwater and preserving the waterways.\n\nFrom 1955 through 1988, the District was called The Metropolitan Sanitary District of Greater Chicago. In order to provide a more accurate perception of the District\u2019s current functions and responsibilities, the name was changed effective, January 1, 1989, to Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago<ref>Joseph T.

The Powerhouse is located right before the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal connects with the Des Plaines River. The facility is an integral part of the MWRD's task of managing the CAWS and reducing the risk of flooding throughout the MWRD service area.\u00a0 The Lockport Powerhouse enables the MWRD to control the levels of the canal. In addition to its role in managing the waterways, the Lockport Powerhouse also provides financial benefits from hydroelectric power generation.\u00a0 The water flowing through the facility is harnessed by 2 turbines to provide a safe and environmentally friendly hydroelectric energy source that is sold back to Commonwealth Edison. Lockport generates over $1 million worth of electricity annually.

The MWRD operates the largest [[Sewage treatment|water reclamation]] plant in the world, the '''Stickney Water Reclamation Plant''' in [[Stickney, Illinois]], in addition to six other plants and 23 [[pumping station]]s. These seven plants range in capacity from 1.2 billion gallons per day at the Stickney Plant to 2.3 million gallons per day at the Lemont Plant.\n\nA water reclamation facility usually contains two treatment plants. One is for processing the wastewater while the other is for treating the solids captured during the first process.\n\nApproximately 454 billion gallons were treated at the District plants during 2017. These plants have been very successful in meeting the National Pollutant and Discharge Elimination System permit limits. These limits are designed to protect and enhance the quality of our waterways.\n\nThe 2017 average plant flow, effluent values, and permit compliance for each plant are presented below in Table 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous/waterreclamation|title=MWRDGC|website=www.mwrd.org|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Plant\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Flow\n\n(MGD)\n| colspan=\"3\" |Effluent (mg/l)\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Permit\n\nViolations\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Permit\n\nCompliance\n|-\n|CBOD\n|SS\n|NH4-N\n|-\n|Stickney WRP\n|677\n|2\n|5\n|0.5\n|1\n|99.94%\n|-\n|Calumet WRP\n|256\n|3\n|6\n|0.4\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|O'Brien WRP\n|232\n|2\n|6\n|0.6\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Kirie WRP\n|41.77\n|2\n|2\n|0.3\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Egan WRP\n|23.9\n|2\n|2\n|0.1\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Hanover Park WRP\n|9.50\n|3\n|5\n|0.3\n|0\n|100%\n|-\n|Lemont WRP\n|2.56\n|4\n|8\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>\n|0\n|100%\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''CBOD'''\n|Carbonaceous Biochemical Oxygen Demand\n|-\n|'''SS'''\n|Suspended Solids\n|-\n|'''NH4-N'''\n|Ammonia Nitrogen\n|}\nThe MWRD treats an average {{convert|1.5|e9USgal|m3}} of wastewater each day.

TARP\u2019s large tunnels and reservoirs are designed to reduce the amount of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and hold the polluted water until it can be fully treated at MWRD water reclamation plants. Since the TARP tunnels went online, the average annual number of days with CSOs has been reduced to 50 from 100.  The second phase of TARP involves the construction of three reservoirs which, when completed in 2029, will provide more than 18 billion gallons of storage capacity. The Majewski Reservoir was completed in 1998 and provides 350 million gallons of CSO storage. Since it went online, the Majewski Reservoir has provided over $250 million in flood reduction benefits to its service area in Arlington Heights, Des Plaines, and Mount Prospect. Since 1998, when the MWRD executed an agreement with the owner of the Thornton quarry to mine the north lobe of the quarry for use as a component of TARP, over 152 billion pounds of 400 million year old dolomite limestone was blasted and removed. Located along interstate 80 in southern Cook County, the Thornton Composite Reservoir, an important component of the MWRD's TARP, went into operation on December 31, 2015.  The Thornton Composite Reservoir came online at the same time as disinfection facilities at the MWRD\u2019s Calumet Water Reclamation Plant in Chicago, which also serves the southern area of the county. Working in tandem, the combination maximize water quality while minimizing flooding. The third and final piece of TARP is the McCook Reservoir. Stage 1 of McCook Reservoir was completed on Dec. 31, 2017, and adds 3.5 billion gallons of storage capacity. Stage 2 of McCook Reservoir will add 6.5 billion gallons of storage capacity when it comes online in 2029.\n\n===Stormwater Management Authority===\nIn 2004, the Illinois General Assembly granted the MWRD [[stormwater]] management authority for Cook County, and since that time, the MWRD has been working to address regional flooding issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwrd.org/irj/portal/anonymous/stormwateroverview |title=SAP NetWeaver Portal |website=Mwrd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}</ref>  In October 2013, the MWRD Board of Commissioners unanimously approved the Cook County Watershed Management Ordinance (WMO).

By March, 2012, the MWRD selected the optimal technology for disinfecting the treated water at the Calumet and O'Brien Water Reclamation Plants after a blue ribbon task force evaluated all available disinfection technologies using a triple bottom line approach that considered economic, environmental and social criteria.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141014021116/http://www.mwrd.org/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_C10D339F32FF7A420135F8F9911083EC98B50400/filename/12_0301_DisinfectionTechnology.pdf]</ref> The processes selected were chlorination/dechlorination for Calumet and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation with low-pressure high-output lamps for the O'Brien WRP. The estimated capital costs, including engineering design and construction support costs for these two recommended alternatives, totals just over $130 million, approximately 54 percent of the anticipated cost. The internal task force included staff from the departments of Monitoring and Research, Engineering, and Maintenance and Operations. The team systematically evaluated all available disinfection technologies and reviewed academic research and industry practice literature. The task force also performed bench scale studies, monitored existing plant effluent, reviewed site conditions, and contacted industry experts, manufacturers and suppliers, and other large wastewater treatment agencies. In addition, the task force gathered data about design parameters, operational needs, maintenance requirements, and annual and capital costs. Differences in existing infrastructure and hydraulics at the two plants require that a combination of methods be implemented as the basis of final design and construction of the facilities. On Sept. 16, 2013 former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Region 5 Administrator Susan Hedman, former Illinois Environmental Protection Agency Director Lisa Bonnett, State Rep. Robyn Gabel, Skokie Mayor George Van Dusen and other area representatives joined the MWRD Board of Commissioners to break ground on the disinfection facility at the O\u2019Brien WRP.  Significant support for these projects came from local, state and federal leadership. In 2011, U.S. Senators Richard Durbin and Mark Kirk and Congressman Mike Quigley toured the Chicago area waterways and announced their support for the disinfection projects. In April 2012, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, former Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, and the U.S. EPA awarded the MWRD $10 million through the Illinois Jobs Now! capital program. That funding supplemented the $21 million in engineering and design costs needed to make the MWRD\u2019s disinfection facilities possible.  In addition to directly improving the water environment, the two disinfection projects created 750 construction, operations and support jobs. Construction was completed by December 2015 and disinfection was in service for the 2016 recreational season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwrd.org |title=SAP NetWeaver Portal |website=Mwrd.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-22}}</ref>\n\n===Resource Recovery===\nSince its inception, the MWRD has worked to improve the environment and protect public health, but the way it views its work has evolved since 1889. Sewage is no longer a waste product but instead a collection of resources to be recovered and reused. The MWRD is implementing several innovations in renewable energy, while also recovering and developing reuse opportunities for algae, biosolids, water, phosphorus and other nutrients collected during the water treatment process.\n\n====Nutrient recovery====\nThe MWRD began recovering phosphorus and nitrogen from its Stickney Water Reclamation Plant in the fall of 2015. According to the United Nations Environmental Program, nutrient pollution is among the biggest environmental problems of the 21st century, and the US Environmental Protection Agency has stated that \u201cthe problem of nutrient pollution is nationally significant, expanding, and likely to substantially accelerate.\u201d Excess nutrients promote algae blooms and create dead zones, which can have devastating effects on local ecosystems and economies. The MWRD\u2019s nutrient recovery facility will greatly reduce its nutrient effluent load to the Mississippi river basin, in turn, reducing its impact on hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. The [http://ostara.com/about/ Ostara] technology recovers phosphorus and nitrogen from municipal and industrial wastewater streams and transforms them into an environmentally responsible, enhanced efficiency fertilizer called Crystal Green, which is used by growers in the agriculture, turf and ornamental sectors throughout North America and in Europe. The MWRD partnered with Black & Veatch and Ostara to design and build the nutrient recovery facility at the Stickney Plant.  Once fully operational in 2015, the plant was the largest such facility in the world, with the potential capacity to produce between 10,000 and 15,000 tons of Crystal Green fertilizer annually. \u201cThe MWRD\u2019s decision to install a nutrient recovery facility is at the forefront of a growing trend we\u2019re seeing within the wastewater treatment sector,\u201d said F. Phillip Abrary, president and CEO of Ostara. \u201cIncreasingly, these utilities see themselves as more than simply water treatment plants. Rather, they are resource recovery centers, recycling water, energy and nutrients for beneficial reuse. Our technology helps them fulfill this mandate by recovering phosphorus and nitrogen in a way that is both economically and environmentally sustainable.\u201d Dr. James L. Barnard, Water Global Practice and Technology Leader at Black and Veatch and often referred to as \u201cThe Father of Biological Nutrient Removal,\u201d advised the project team. According to Dr. Barnard, phosphorus is a non-renewable resource that is critical to farming and food production. \u201cNothing grows without it but too much of it can negatively impact water quality,\u201d said Barnard. \u201cBiological nutrient removal enables us to address water quality challenges and recover this precious nutrient for beneficial reuse purposes.\u201d <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ostara.com/news/news-releases/2013/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-chicago%E2%80%99s-metropolitan-water-reclamation-district-di |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192603/http://www.ostara.com/news/news-releases/2013/robert-f-kennedy-jr-and-chicago%E2%80%99s-metropolitan-water-reclamation-district-di |archivedate=2014-01-02 }}</ref>\n\n==== Algae ====\nAlgae naturally uptakes phosphorus and nitrogen from water to support its growth through photosynthesis, utilizing the sun as its energy source. This same approach can be applied to wastewater treatment as a means to remove phosphorus from the waste stream without the use of inorganic chemicals or additional energy, which is the current means of nutrient removal. The MWRD is researching the sustainability of growing algae in a \u201cvertical revolving\u201d fashion; this would reduce the footprint to grow an equivalent algae biomass in a surface pond and simplify the harvesting process. The algae could remove at least 50 percent of phosphorus from wastewater and can be harvested and commoditized for production of bioplastics, biochemicals, biofuels, pharmaceuticals and dyes; or used as fertilizer or as aquaculture feed. The MWRD is also experimenting with algae as a nutrient remover at the O\u2019Brien WRP. It can be used as fertilizer, in a digester, or as aquaculture feed, which returns the phosphorus to the nutrient cycle. The MWRD can produce 24 tons of algae a day. This could potentially stimulate the Chicago regional economy by locating a plastics partner near the treatment plant and reduce reliance on petroleum. The MWRD is supporting leading-edge research in this field to help make algae technology a practical and sustainable approach to nutrient management for urban wastewater treatment plants.  During the water treatment process, the greenhouse research facility at the O\u2019Brien WRP employs a technology called revolving algae biofilm reactors designed by Iowa State University scientists who originally applied it for agricultural applications.\n\n====Biosolids====\nBiosolids are an environmentally friendly product of the water treatment process that supplies organic matter and improves soil structure and porosity to allow plants to more effectively utilize nutrients. Under the Illinois Environmental Protection Act, signed into law in 2015, biosolids were formally recognized as a safe, beneficial and renewable resource that should be used locally. Rather than being hauled miles to distant farms and landfills as in years past, the biosolids are now beneficially reused in Cook County. Air-dried biosolids look and feel like dark, fine-textured topsoil, and are used on turfgrass at golf courses, athletic fields, parks and other recreational areas, and for restoration of brownfields and other disturbed lands. To create a value-enhanced product, the MWRD partnered with the city of Chicago to co-compost woodchips from the city's routine tree trimming program and woodchips collected from ash trees lost due to the emerald ash-borer devastation to create a compost ratio of 3:1 woodchips to biosolids. The compost is produced in windrows that are maintained at a temperature of at least 131 degrees for a minimum of 15 days and are turned five times during the period as required in USEPA protocol. The active composting period is followed by four months of curing after which the product is screened through a half-inch screen to remove large pieces of woodchips and tested.\n\n==== Water Reuse ====\nThe MWRD produces 1.2 billion gallons of clean water each day. Draining freshwater resources from Lake Michigan is not always necessary for industrial use. In 2017, the MWRD Board of Commissioners established an introductory price of $1 per thousand gallons for the clean water we produce with the flexibility to adjust the price based on market conditions. We partnered with American Water and set a goal of supplying reused water to the industrial sector at the rate of about 10 million gallons per day. Industrial users pay higher prices for fresh Lake Michigan water.  The MWRD believes water can be used more than once and provide value. Less energy is also used to deliver that water, and more fresh water from the region\u2019s drinking supply in Lake Michigan is also conserved. In addition to being harnessed, water itself is also reused directly through our treatment process. Every day, 15.1 million gallons are reused in pipeline flushing, blower motor cooling, post-centrifuge centrate flushing, and tank cleaning. At the Stickney Water Reclamation Plant, 6 million gallons of treated water per day is used, saving energy and money and reducing demand on drinking water. In addition, the MWRD is pursuing additional reuse applications for the high quality water produced at water reclamation plants. Working with large industrial users in the Calumet and Stickney corridors to find reuse opportunities could provide cost savings to the industrial users and increase fresh water availability for communities.\n\n====Sewerthermal Energy====\nThe MWRD and University of Illinois at Chicago developed a new energy source using an $87,500 grant provided by the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation in 2010; the funding helps to cover the total $175,000 cost. The partnership resulted in significant energy and cost savings at the Kirie Water Reclamation Plant (WRP). Savings include a 25 to 50 percent reduction in electricity usage for heating and cooling needs as well as reductions in maintenance expenses and pollutants associated with separate heating and cooling systems.[http://www.cenews.com/print-news-geothermal_heat_pumps_reduce_e-1313.html University of Illinois news] The Kirie WRP has a daily average flow of 52 million gallons per day (MGD), a capacity of 100 MGD and operates 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, 52 weeks per year. The Kirie WRP serves 65.2 square miles and approximately 217,000 people. The MWRD originally embarked on the project due to increases in energy costs and the desire to become more environmentally friendly.\n\nThe Kirie system is one of the first to use wastewater for heat recovery and provides the MWRD with the opportunity to evaluate both open and closed loop systems for efficiency and overall performance.  The MWRD and UIC worked to develop a feasibility study for the Kirie WRP, including system design, equipment requirements, historical system data, space requirements and installation.\n\nThe sewerthermal heat and cooling system harnesses energy from treated water and supplies the Kirie WRP with up to 40 percent of its heating and cooling energy needs. This plan provides a model for heating and cooling energy needs at other MWRD facilities. The sewerthermal system will take advantage of relatively constant high temperatures of effluent water and will use only 20 percent or less power than what is needed for a traditional, direct heating system. Rather than extracting heat from the ground as is common for geothermal systems, the MWRD\u2019s system is designed to extract heat from the effluent water, which holds a steady minimum temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit.<ref>[http://online.qmags.com/WW0612/default.aspx?fs=2&pg=21&mode=2#pg21&mode2 \"Heat Pump Systems Use Wastewater To Lower HVAC Costs,\"] WaterWorld Magazine, June 2012</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Centennial Fountain]]\n*[[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]\n*[[Jardine Water Purification Plant]]\n*[[Lockport Powerhouse]]\n*[[Chicago 1885 cholera epidemic myth]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mwrd.org/ Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago (Official Site)]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Districts of Illinois]]\n[[Category:Public utilities of the United States]]\n[[Category:Water companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:1889 establishments in Illinois]]\n\n{{coord|41|50|N|87|50|W|region:US-IL_scale:500000|display=title}}\n", "name_user": "Allisonfore", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLockport Powerhouse:updated energy generated and amount sold to the grid", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Water_Reclamation_District_of_Greater_Chicago"}
