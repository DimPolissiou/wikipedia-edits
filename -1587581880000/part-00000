Bengtsson]]. \nThe narrative is set in the late 10th century and follows the adventures of the Viking R\u00f6de Orm - called \"Red\" for his hair and his temper, a native of [[Scania]]. The book portrays the political situation of Europe in the later [[Viking Age]], [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba|Andalusia under Almansur]], Denmark under [[Harald Bluetooth]], followed by the struggle between [[Eric the Victorious]] and [[Sweyn I of Denmark|Sven Forkbeard]], Ireland under [[Brian Boru]], [[Anglo-Saxon England|England]] under [[Ethelred the Unready]], and the [[Battle of Maldon]], and then the [[Byzantine Empire]] and its [[Varangian Guard]], [[Kievan Rus]] and its neighbors the [[Pechenegs|Patzinaks]] - all before the backdrop of the gradual [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], contrasting the pragmatic [[Norse paganism|Norse pagan]] outlook with the exclusiveness of [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].<ref>[http://blog.theparisreview.org/2010/06/28/the-fly-leaf-the-long-ships/ The Paris Review]</ref>\n\nThe novel is divided into two parts, published in 1941 and 1945, with two books each. It used to be one of the most widely read books in Sweden.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The first part was translated into English by [[Barrows Mussey]] as ''Red Orm'' in 1943, but later editions and newer translations by [[Michael Meyer (translator)|Michael Meyer]] use the title ''The Long Ships''. The book has been translated into at least 23 languages.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n*Orm Tostesson: The son of a Scanian chieftain.\n*Asa: Orm's mother. The family matriarch.\n*Toke Grey-Gullsson: An adventurer from [[Blekinge]] who joined Krok's company.

Later Orm's wife.\n\n===Secondary characters===\n*Krok: The leader of the campaign to Spain.\n*Rapp: A Scandinavian galley slave. Later a retainer of Orm.\n*Gudmund: A landowner maintaining tense relations with Orm.\n*Olof Styrsson: An experienced chieftain from [[Finnveden]].\n*Ludmilla Ormsdotter: Orm's restless daughter. Betrothed to Olof.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n*Solomon the Jew: A [[Sephardi]] silversmith rescued by Krok's company.\n*Lady Subaida: The young daughter of a [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Leonese]] [[margrave]]. This is the name given to her after she becomes a concubine of Almanzor.\n*The [[Erin]] Masters: Two jester brothers (Felimid and Ferdiad) from Ireland.\n*Rainald: A [[Lotharingia]]n priest sent to Scandinavia to replace a priest held as a [[thrall]].\n*Mirah: An `[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] slave-girl at King Harald's court.\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Map Almanzor campaigns-en.svg|thumb|200px|Orm and his Viking companions follow Almansur in his campaigns against the Christian kingdoms of the North.]]\nThe first book covers the years 982 to 990. While still a youth, Orm is abducted by a [[Viking]] party led by Krok and they sail south. They fall captive to Andalusian Muslims and serve as [[galley]] [[saqaliba|slaves]] for more than two years, later becoming members of [[Almanzor|Almansur]]'s bodyguard for four years, raiding [[Santiago de Compostela]] under his command. They return to Denmark to King Harald Bluetooth's court where Orm meets Ylva. Orm later returns to Scania with Rapp. Orm and Rapp join a Viking party raiding England again after a brief period of peace in that area following the reconquest of the [[Danelaw]] in the mid-10th century by King Edgar, Ethelred's father. Orm joins a party led by [[Thorkell the High]] in England and when he learns that Harald's daughter Ylva is staying in London, gets baptised and marries Ylva. They move to a neglected farm, his mother's inheritance in [[\u00d6stra G\u00f6inge Municipality|G\u00f6inge]], northern Sk\u00e5ne, near the border with [[Sm\u00e5land]]. During the following years (992 to 995), Orm prospers, and Ylva gives birth to twin girls (Oddny and Ludmilla), a son, Harald, and later to another son (though possibly from Rainald), Svarth\u00f6fde (Blackhair in the Michael Meyer translation). Meanwhile, Orm also gets busy in converting the heathens in the district, with the help of Father Willibald.\n\nThe [[year 1000]] [[Millennialism|passes without Christ returning]]. In 1007, with Orm now forty-two, his brother Are returns from the east, bringing the news of a treasure (\"[[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgar]] gold\") he had [[buried treasure|hidden]]. Orm decides to travel to the [[Dnieper Rapids|Dnieper weirs]] in [[Kievan Rus]] for the gold, and together with Toke and the Finnveding chieftain Olof mans a ship. They recover the treasure and return home safely. But on their return they encounter an unexpected crisis at home - Rainald, the rather ridiculous failed German Christian missionary, had become a renegade, turned into a Pagan priest of the old Norse gods and the leader of a formidable band of robbers and outlaws, and causes great havoc before being finally overcome. Following this final crisis and from then on, Orm and Toke live in peace and plenty as good neighbours, and Svarth\u00f6fde Ormsson becomes a famous Viking, fighting for [[Canute the Great]]. The story ends with the statement that Orm and Toke in their old age \"did never tire of telling of the years when they had rowed the Caliph's ship and served my lord Al-Mansur.\"\n\n==Writing process==\n[[File:Bengtsson, Frans G med son ur VJ 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Frans G. Bengtsson in 1943]]\nThe Swedish writer [[Sven Stolpe]] reports that somebody asked author [[Frans G. Bengtsson]] \"what intentions he had with ''The Long Ships''\", to which Bengtsson responded that he had no particular intentions. \"I just wanted to write a story that people could enjoy reading, like ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' or the ''[[Odyssey]]''.\"\n\nThe research for the book was based largely on [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Heimskringla]]'' and other old Icelandic literature, but also on medieval chronicles and contemporary research, and historic names, people and events were woven into the fiction. The language of the novel is modelled on the [[Sagas of Icelanders|Icelandic sagas]]. Early in his career, Bengtsson had held a romantic view on the saga literature, promoting an elevated, almost sacral prose in translations, but when writing ''The Long Ships'' he instead made use of the saga's faculties for wisecracks and comic understatements. The main characters were written as likable anti-heroes, far from the romantic view of Vikings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.svd.se/arkiv/2012-02-09/63|title=Det v\u00e5ras f\u00f6r Bengtsson och hans vikingar|last=L\u00f6nnroth|first=Lars|date=2012-02-09|work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]]|language=Swedish|accessdate=2019-05-08}}</ref> Like the sagas, the book relies on verbs and nouns to drive the narrative, with only a minimum of adjectives and descriptive passages. In essays, Bengtsson expresses disgust with \"[[psychological realism]]\" in the literature of his day where the thoughts and feelings of the characters are discussed explicitly rather than indicated by actions and outward signs. In the Swedish original of ''The Longships'', the grammar is deliberately slightly archaic.\n\nJoan Klein noted that \"Within the 10th Century plot, the book's Viking protagonists never heard of [[history of the Jews|Jews]], and have a completely open mind about them - and when encountering a Jew who allies with the Vikings and leads them to treasure beyond their dreams, they are duly grateful (...). However, one can hardly overlook the fact that the book was actually written in a very specific part of the 20th Century - [[Sweden in the Second World War|during the Second World War]], a time when Nazi Germany was involved in [[The Holocaust|a horrific persecution and massacre of Jews]], while the [[Nordicism|Nazis claimed the Viking heritage]] for their monstrous version of German and Germanic Nationalism. Bengtsson in effect throws the Viking heritage back in the Nazis' face\" <ref>Dr. Joan Klein, \"A Distant Mirror - Historical Writing as a Method of Slyly Commenting on Contemporary Issues\" in George Whitley-Smythe (ed.) \"A Round-Up of Recent Essays in Twentieth Century Cultural Issues\"</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe 1964 British-Yugoslav film ''[[The Long Ships (film)|The Long Ships]]'' (starring [[Richard Widmark]] and [[Sidney Poitier]]) very loosely based on the book, retaining little more than the title (of the English translation) and the Moorish settings. In the 1980s, there were plans for a large-scale Swedish screen adaptation. The film was supposed to be directed by [[Hans Alfredson]] and star [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Orm and [[Sverre Anker Ousdal]] as Toke.

In an attempt to further their development, some Kree bred with other species, producing the 'pink-skinned' Kree, who are similar in appearance to [[Caucasian race|Caucasian humans]]. These pinks (also called 'whites') eventually outnumbered the blue-skin Kree, but were far from accepted amongst their brethren; many pink kree were exiled from the homeworld and put into forced labor camps on barren moons by their blue skinned cousins due to prejudice & racism.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Brian Augustyn]]|penciller=Chuck Wojtkiewicz|inker=Ray Snyder|colorist=Brad Vancata and Graphic Color Work|letterer=Phil Felix|editor=Terry Kavanagh|title=Imperial Guard|issue=#2|date=February 1997|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> The Kree value what they consider to be their genetic purity, to such an extent that reproduction outside of the species is a strict taboo. In the Kree empire, it is a crime for a male non-Kree to impregnate any Kree.\n\nThe Kree race has produced individual super-humanoid beings, either through natural mutation, genetic engineering, or cyborg technology, including [[Captain Mar-Vell]], [[Ronan the Accuser]], [[Ultimus (comics)|Ultimus]], [[Shatterax]], [[Korath]], and others.\n\nThe [[Supreme Intelligence]] attempted to jumpstart the evolutionary process of the Kree. Through a series of events discussed below during ''Operation: Galactic Storm'' and the ''Destiny War'', it arranged for a large number of its people to be irradiated with a Nega-Bomb (killing 90% of the Kree), and then artificially sped up their evolution by means of an artifact called the [[Forever Crystal]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Roger Stern]]|penciller=[[Carlos Pacheco]]|inker=Jesus Merino|colorist=Steve Oliff|letterer=Richard Starkings and Albert Deschesne|editor=Tom Brevoort|title=Avengers Forever|issue=#3|date=February 1999|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>\n\nThis new brand of evolved Kree, called '''Ruul''', have a grayish skin tone and many shoulder-length tentacles atop their heads. Individuals possess the ability to consciously 'will' adaptation of physical form to different environments, affording them controlled metamorphosis, spontaneously developing the ability to breathe underwater, fly, change form or whatever their circumstances require. The females had also lost their ability, since the males now had that ability.\n\nThe Inhumans later brought to light a long-held secret about the creation of the Kree. As it turns out, the Kree are in fact of Universal Inhuman stock, the very first of the first of their kind. Unlike a great many races throughout the universe, the Kree were alternated by two races of cosmological abstracts in the likes of the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] and the [[Progenitors (comics)|Progenitors]], which evolved them from primitives to empire builders.<ref name=\"Royals #5\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Al Ewing]]|penciller=Thony Silas|colorist=Jim Charalampidis and Jose Villarrubia|letterer=Clayton Cowles|editor=Wil Moss, Sarah Brunstad and Tom Brevoort|title=Royals|volume=1|issue=#5|date=19 July 2017|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> While the Celestials went on to spawn the Kree born [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], it was the Progenitors, a race of universal gardeners and cosmic scientists that made their home at the far end of the cosmos within the heart of a lone star, who through the introduction of the Prima Materia which the Progenitors mine and process on their World Farm called The [[Primagen Crystals|Primagen]], were able to force evolve the cro-magnon Kree race into the cosmic conquerors that they are today.<ref name=\"Royals #9\">{{Cite comic|writer=Al Ewing|penciller=[[Javier Rodr\u00edguez (artist)|Javier Rodriguez]]|inker=Alvaro Lopez|colorist=Jordie Bellaire|letterer=Clayton Cowles|editor=Wilson Moss|title=Royals|volume=1|issue=#9|date=4 October 2017|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThe Kree are an imperialistic and militaristic society with the only widespread religion being worship of the Supreme Intelligence. A small minority, like the Priests of Pama, practice a pacifist [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] religion, but this is forbidden (early ''Captain Marvel'' stories mentioned an 'idol' called Tam-Borr and a 'fabricated' god named Zo, whom Mar-Vell served between issues 11 and 15). Some are members of the [[Universal Church of Truth]].\n\nThe Kree Empire [[Manifest destiny|extends throughout nearly a thousand worlds]] in the northwestern lobe (Earth reference) of the Greater Magellanic Cloud with outposts in other galaxies.\n\nKree names are usually short, being one or two syllables. Given names are separated from surnames by a hyphen. Examples include Mar-Vell, Yon-Rogg, Una-Rogg, and Zey-Rogg.\n\nSome Kree have been given comic book references as names, such as Mar-Vell ([[Marvel Comics]]), Att-Las ([[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]), Dea-Sea ([[DC Comics]]), and Star-Lyn ([[Jim Starlin]]).\n\nGenerally, the offspring of officers of the Kree Imperial Militia are immediately conscripted.\n\n===Population===\nThe Kree population was in excess of 30 billion prior to the nega-bomb detonation. The Kree lost an alleged 98% of their population after the nega-bomb detonated. Although the pink-skinned Kree are in the majority, it is the blue-skinned Kree, such as Ronan, who dominate their society.\n\n===Government===\nUnder the Supreme Intelligence, the Kree Empire was a military dictatorship. Under Clumsy Foulup, the Kree were temporarily a monarchy, and while under Ael-Dan and Dar-Benn they were a military dictatorship.\n\nLeaders of the Kree have included the Supreme Intelligence, Clumsy Foulup, Nenora, Zarek, Ael-Dan and Dar-Ben, Phae-Dor, Tus-Katt, Morag, [[Ronan the Accuser]], and\u2014most recently\u2014[[Black Bolt]] of the [[Inhumans]].\n\nThe Kree began their empire over a million years ago, within a hundred years of the acquisition of interstellar technology from the Skrulls (at that time, a benevolent people). The Skrulls at the time were attempting to start a galactic empire of their own, this one based on free trade, and they landed on Hala to help the barbaric natives advance to the point where they could join.\n\nAlthough Hala ''is'' the ''official'' planet of the Kree's origin, for a time, the planet Kree-Lar in the Turunal system served as the capital of the Kree Empire as well as the seat of the government. The Kree Empire is ruled as a militaristic dictatorship.

Once back on their homeworld, the Kree leader Morag learned that the Skrulls had been impressed by the city, but the other Skrulls were more impressed by the Cotati's success. Enraged, the Kree wiped out the Cotati and then, when the Skrull protested, killed them as well and seized the Skrulls' starship.

The Kree launched an attack upon the Skrull empire and the peaceful Skrulls were again forced to become war-like.\n\nAt the same time, the Cotati on Hala were almost driven to extinction. However, a small handful of pacifist Kree, hid and kept safe a group of Cotati. Eventually, these Kree began worshipping the Cotati that they had kept sheltered. To further hide and keep them safe, the priests relocated the surviving Cotati throughout the universe.\n\nYears later, the Kree, aware that the Skrulls had once created the [[Cosmic Cube]], designed a [[Cyborg|cybernetic/organic]] supercomputer called the [[Supreme Intelligence]] to help them in creating a Cube. When the computer became functional, it determined that a Cosmic Cube would be too dangerous to construct and refused the Science Council's request.\n\nAt the beginning of the War, the Kree established a station on [[Uranus]]. Through their work, they discovered that sentient life on [[Earth]] had genetic potential invested in it by the [[Celestials]]. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's [[homo sapiens]].\n\nTheir goal was twofold \u2014 to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create powerful soldiers to use against the Skrulls. However, the Kree abandoned their experiments because the Supreme Intelligence foresaw the experiments leading to the destruction of the Kree. In order to disprove that prophecy, the Intelligence ordered Accuser Huran to murder the scientists responsible for the experiments and summon the Accuser Corps to cleanse the experiments.

During the conflict, the [[Super-Skrull]] took his prisoners back to the Skrull home-world, leaving the remaining Avengers to pick up the pieces and reform their tattered forces.\n\nThe conflict worsened when the Avengers began to understand the scale of the war.

Still, Johnny later protects a Kree child that is threatened by a robotic lion meant to carry out the sentence.

Thanks to the attack on it by [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and [[Carol Danvers]] however, the Sentry starts to activate a Kree nega-bomb and wipe out humanity. This is prevented by [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]], a captain in the Kree Navy's science division who want to protect humanity (Carol in particular). Afterward Mar-Vell soon leaves to plead Earth's case to the Supreme Intelligence. In the episode \"Michael Korvac\", it is revealed that the Kree had abducted and experimented on [[Korvac|Michael Korvac]] which ended with Michael Korvac destroying the Kree ship he was aboard. In the episode \"Welcome to the Kree Empire\", Ronan the Accuser led Yon-Rogg, Mar-Vell, and Kalum Lo to Earth in order to make Earth join the Kree Empire. While Kalum Lo and his soldiers take over [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s ship ''Damocles'' (which has been converted into a [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] base), Ronan tasks Yon-Rogg and Mar-Vell to Earth to judge the humans to see if Earth is worthy to join the Kree Empire. Kalum Lo had the Kree's alien slave Sydren enter various codes into Damocles' computer in order to get control of the entire ship. Abigail Brand defeats the Kree and frees Sydren from the Kree's control. While the Avengers and Carol Danvers, now Ms. Marvel, have defeated Ronan the Accuser, S.W.O.R.D. takes control of the Kree ship. Ronan and the Kree soldiers involved are remanded to Prison 42. In the episode \"Operation Galactic Storm\", the Kree attack the S.W.O.R.D. ship ''Falchion'' during their plot to open a wormhole near Earth's sun. At the same time, a Kree black-ops team is sent to spring Ronan the Accuser from the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Other locations|Hydro-Base]]. Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Wasp, Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, Vision, Captain Mar-Vell, and Peter Corbeau were able to stop the wormhole device, but ended up sucked towards Kree space. In the episode \"Live Kree and Die\", the Avengers are separated upon the crash-landing on Hala. Captain America, Wasp, Ms. Marvel, Captain Mar-Vell, and Peter Corbeau are apprehended by the Kree soldiers and brought before the Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence then has the humans experimented upon to see what the humans are capable of. When Captain Mar-Vell tries to plead to the Supreme Intelligence to spare them from the experiments, the Supreme Intelligence states that \"traitors to the Kree Empire have no say\". Thor deals with the Kree soldiers and their Sentries while Iron Man, Black Panther, Hawkeye, and Vision free their captive teammates. After the Avengers and Mar-Vell managed to shut down the Supreme Intelligence for a while, Mar-Vell plans to lead the Kree into a new era of peace.\n* The Kree are informally introduced into the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] through the TV series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' In the episode \"[[T.A.H.I.T.I.]]\", S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] discovers a blue-skinned corpse in a secret, underground facility called the Guest House while searching for the source of the regenerative GH-325 serum.

Running afoul of Coulson's team and Sif, whose memory he temporarily robbed with his truncheon, Vin-Tak learned that [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] was an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] and attempts to kill her. Luckily, [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse]] uses Vin-Tak's truncheon to have himself forget why he came to Earth as Sif escorts him back to Hala. In the episode \"[[Scars (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Scars]]\", it is shown that [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Robert Gonzales|Robert Gonzales]]' faction of S.H.I.E.L.D. has obtained a monolith-like material that the Kree planned to use to destroy the Inhumans. This rock sends anyone who is sucked into it to another planet where an Inhuman being known as [[Hive (comics)|Hive]] was banished to. In the episode \"Failed Experiments,\" it was revealed that the Kree warriors known as Kree Reapers were the ones responsible for abducting the humans for the Inhuman experiments just like they did with the Mayan warrior that became Hive. When the device that was used to make Inhumans was activated by Hive, it attracted the attention of the Kree Reapers where one of them killed Alisha Whitley. Both of them were killed by Hive and Daisy Johnson where the blood of one of them was used in Hive's Inhuman-making projects.

Through a series of events discussed below during ''Operation: Galactic Storm'' and the ''Destiny War'', it arranged for a large number of its people to be irradiated with a Nega-Bomb (killing 90% of the Kree), and then artificially sped up their evolution by means of an artifact called the [[Forever Crystal]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Kurt Busiek]] and [[Roger Stern]]|penciller=[[Carlos Pacheco]]|inker=Jesus Merino|colorist=Steve Oliff|letterer=Richard Starkings and Albert Deschesne|editor=Tom Brevoort|title=Avengers Forever|issue=#3|date=February 1999|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>\n\nThis new brand of evolved Kree, called '''Ruul''', have a grayish skin tone and many shoulder-length tentacles atop their heads.

The females had also lost their ability, since the males now had that ability.\n\nThe Inhumans later brought to light a long-held secret about the creation of the Kree. As it turns out, the Kree are in fact of Universal Inhuman stock, the very first of the first of their kind. Unlike a great many races throughout the universe, the Kree were alternated by two races of cosmological abstracts in the likes of the [[Celestials (comics)|Celestials]] and the [[Progenitors (comics)|Progenitors]], which evolved them from primitives to empire builders.<ref name=\"Royals #5\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Al Ewing]]|penciller=Thony Silas|colorist=Jim Charalampidis and Jose Villarrubia|letterer=Clayton Cowles|editor=Wil Moss, Sarah Brunstad and Tom Brevoort|title=Royals|volume=1|issue=#5|date=19 July 2017|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref> While the Celestials went on to spawn the Kree born [[Eternals (comics)|Eternals]], it was the Progenitors, a race of universal gardeners and cosmic scientists that made their home at the far end of the cosmos within the heart of a lone star, who through the introduction of the Prima Materia which the Progenitors mine and process on their World Farm called The [[Primagen Crystals|Primagen]], were able to force evolve the cro-magnon Kree race into the cosmic conquerors that they are today.<ref name=\"Royals #9\">{{Cite comic|writer=Al Ewing|penciller=[[Javier Rodr\u00edguez (artist)|Javier Rodriguez]]|inker=Alvaro Lopez|colorist=Jordie Bellaire|letterer=Clayton Cowles|editor=Wilson Moss|title=Royals|volume=1|issue=#9|date=4 October 2017|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThe Kree are an imperialistic and militaristic society with the only widespread religion being worship of the Supreme Intelligence. A small minority, like the Priests of Pama, practice a pacifist [[Cotati (comics)|Cotati]] religion, but this is forbidden (early ''Captain Marvel'' stories mentioned an 'idol' called Tam-Borr and a 'fabricated' god named Zo, whom Mar-Vell served between issues 11 and 15). Some are members of the [[Universal Church of Truth]].\n\nThe Kree Empire [[Manifest destiny|extends throughout nearly a thousand worlds]] in the northwestern lobe (Earth reference) of the Greater Magellanic Cloud with outposts in other galaxies.\n\nKree names are usually short, being one or two syllables. Given names are separated from surnames by a hyphen. Examples include Mar-Vell, Yon-Rogg, Una-Rogg, and Zey-Rogg.\n\nSome Kree have been given comic book references as names, such as Mar-Vell ([[Marvel Comics]]), Att-Las ([[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]]), Dea-Sea ([[DC Comics]]), and Star-Lyn ([[Jim Starlin]]).\n\nGenerally, the offspring of officers of the Kree Imperial Militia are immediately conscripted.\n\n===Population===\nThe Kree population was in excess of 30 billion prior to the nega-bomb detonation. The Kree lost an alleged 98% of their population after the nega-bomb detonated. Although the pink-skinned Kree are in the majority, it is the blue-skinned Kree, such as Ronan, who dominate their society.\n\n===Government===\nUnder the Supreme Intelligence, the Kree Empire was a military dictatorship. Under Clumsy Foulup, the Kree were temporarily a monarchy, and while under Ael-Dan and Dar-Benn they were a military dictatorship.\n\nLeaders of the Kree have included the Supreme Intelligence, Clumsy Foulup, Nenora, Zarek, Ael-Dan and Dar-Ben, Phae-Dor, Tus-Katt, Morag, [[Ronan the Accuser]], and\u2014most recently\u2014[[Black Bolt]] of the [[Inhumans]].\n\nThe Kree began their empire over a million years ago, within a hundred years of the acquisition of interstellar technology from the Skrulls (at that time, a benevolent people). The Skrulls at the time were attempting to start a galactic empire of their own, this one based on free trade, and they landed on Hala to help the barbaric natives advance to the point where they could join.\n\nAlthough Hala ''is'' the ''official'' planet of the Kree's origin, for a time, the planet Kree-Lar in the Turunal system served as the capital of the Kree Empire as well as the seat of the government. The Kree Empire is ruled as a militaristic dictatorship. The permanent ruler was the organic computer-construct called the Supremor (or Supreme Intelligence), an immense computer system to which the preserved brains of the greatest intellects of the Kree race have been linked. Aiding the Supreme Intelligence were a number of imperial administrators on Kree-Lar, who are also governors of each of the member worlds, and a vast standing space militia. They also employ powerful automatons called Sentries whose job it is to keep member worlds under the empire's watchful eye.\n\nThe Kree empire is later ruled by Black Bolt and the Inhuman Royal Family who gained power after Ronan the Accuser, ruler of the Kree after the Supreme Intelligence's demise, submitted to him.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Dan Abnett]] and [[Andy Lanning]]|penciller=[[Paul Pelletier]] and Bong Dazo|inker=Rick Magyar and Joe Pimentel|colorist=Wil Quintana and Mike Kelleher|letterer=Joe Caramagna|editor=Bill Rosemann|title=Secret Invasion: War Of Kings|volume=1|issue=#1|date=7 January 2009|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\nThe Kree Empire extends across a thousand worlds in the northwestern lobe (Earth reference) of the Greater Magellanic Cloud.

While the Cotati created a beautiful garden, the Kree constructed the magnificent Blue City.\n\nThe Skrulls returned to judge the accomplishments of the groups and return them all to Hala. Once back on their homeworld, the Kree leader Morag learned that the Skrulls had been impressed by the city, but the other Skrulls were more impressed by the Cotati's success. Enraged, the Kree wiped out the Cotati and then, when the Skrull protested, killed them as well and seized the Skrulls' starship. They then set about deciphering the technology of the starship.<ref name=A133 />\n\n===Kree\u2013Skrull War===\n{{Main|Kree\u2013Skrull War}}\n\nWhen acquiring the technology from the Skrulls, the Kree began to spread throughout the Greater Magellanic Cloud. The Kree launched an attack upon the Skrull empire and the peaceful Skrulls were again forced to become war-like.\n\nAt the same time, the Cotati on Hala were almost driven to extinction. However, a small handful of pacifist Kree, hid and kept safe a group of Cotati. Eventually, these Kree began worshipping the Cotati that they had kept sheltered. To further hide and keep them safe, the priests relocated the surviving Cotati throughout the universe.\n\nYears later, the Kree, aware that the Skrulls had once created the [[Cosmic Cube]], designed a [[Cyborg|cybernetic/organic]] supercomputer called the [[Supreme Intelligence]] to help them in creating a Cube. When the computer became functional, it determined that a Cosmic Cube would be too dangerous to construct and refused the Science Council's request.\n\nAt the beginning of the War, the Kree established a station on [[Uranus]]. Through their work, they discovered that sentient life on [[Earth]] had genetic potential invested in it by the [[Celestials]]. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's [[homo sapiens]].\n\nTheir goal was twofold \u2014 to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create powerful soldiers to use against the Skrulls. However, the Kree abandoned their experiments because the Supreme Intelligence foresaw the experiments leading to the destruction of the Kree. In order to disprove that prophecy, the Intelligence ordered Accuser Huran to murder the scientists responsible for the experiments and summon the Accuser Corps to cleanse the experiments. In its haste, however, the Supreme Intelligence failed to download the full data packet, and five worlds that were seeded escaped the slaughter: [[Badoon]], Centaurians, [[Dire Wraiths]], [[Kymellians]] and early humans.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Jonathan Hickman]]|penciller=[[Greg Tocchini]]|colorist=Paul Mounts|letterer=Clayton Cowles|editor=Tom Brevoort|title=FF|volume=1|issue=#6|date=13 July 2011|publisher=Marvel Comics|location=United States}}</ref>\n\nThe humans test subjects, eventually dubbed the [[Inhumans]], went on to form a society of their own.

This scheme was foiled by Mar-Vell and the Avengers.\n\nAs the war escalated and Earth's position became increasingly precarious, the original Avengers were recalled to active service after a Skrull scouting party managed to abduct Mar-Vell, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], and [[Scarlet Witch]] and also attempted to destroy the Inhumans' Great Refuge, but failed when the Avengers intervened. During the conflict, the [[Super-Skrull]] took his prisoners back to the Skrull home-world, leaving the remaining Avengers to pick up the pieces and reform their tattered forces.\n\nThe conflict worsened when the Avengers began to understand the scale of the war. They discovered a Skrull fleet wanting to destroy Earth and a Kree fleet wanting to stop them. All sides were determined to either invade or decimate the Earth in order to prevent it falling into the 'wrong' hands. Led by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Iron Man (Marvel Comics)|Iron Man]], and The [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]], the Avengers launched an attack on the Skrull flagship, somehow managing to turn back the fleet after a desperate battle.\n\nThe war came to a close when the Supreme Intelligence managed to bring [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] into his presence and temporarily altered Rick's DNA to release his 'full evolutionary potential.' Armed with godlike powers, Rick froze both Kree and Skrull forces, allowing the Intelligence to re-establish control over his people and bring the war to a halt.\n\n===Further Kree\u2013Skrull Wars===\nAt several points in the years after the end of the first Kree\u2013Skrull war, hostilities were said to have broken out again between the two empires.\n\nThe most significant of these instances came when the Skrulls lost their ability to [[shapeshift]],<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Walter Simonson]]|penciller=[[M.

It was later revealed that the Supreme Intelligence was ultimately responsible for the bomb's detonation as part of an attempt to kick-start the Kree race's genetic development. Appalled by this callous disregard for the life of its people, a group of Avengers executed the living supercomputer.

The most notable ability of the Ruul was their ability to evolve their forms spontaneously to suit whatever situation was required.

Still, Johnny later protects a Kree child that is threatened by a robotic lion meant to carry out the sentence.

Thanks to the attack on it by [[Hank Pym|Ant-Man]], [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], and [[Carol Danvers]] however, the Sentry starts to activate a Kree nega-bomb and wipe out humanity. This is prevented by [[Iron Man]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]], a captain in the Kree Navy's science division who want to protect humanity (Carol in particular). Afterward Mar-Vell soon leaves to plead Earth's case to the Supreme Intelligence. In the episode \"Michael Korvac\", it is revealed that the Kree had abducted and experimented on [[Korvac|Michael Korvac]] which ended with Michael Korvac destroying the Kree ship he was aboard. In the episode \"Welcome to the Kree Empire\", Ronan the Accuser led Yon-Rogg, Mar-Vell, and Kalum Lo to Earth in order to make Earth join the Kree Empire. While Kalum Lo and his soldiers take over [[Kang the Conqueror]]'s ship ''Damocles'' (which has been converted into a [[S.W.O.R.D. (comics)|S.W.O.R.D.]] base), Ronan tasks Yon-Rogg and Mar-Vell to Earth to judge the humans to see if Earth is worthy to join the Kree Empire. Kalum Lo had the Kree's alien slave Sydren enter various codes into Damocles' computer in order to get control of the entire ship. Abigail Brand defeats the Kree and frees Sydren from the Kree's control. While the Avengers and Carol Danvers, now Ms. Marvel, have defeated Ronan the Accuser, S.W.O.R.D. takes control of the Kree ship. Ronan and the Kree soldiers involved are remanded to Prison 42. In the episode \"Operation Galactic Storm\", the Kree attack the S.W.O.R.D. ship ''Falchion'' during their plot to open a wormhole near Earth's sun. At the same time, a Kree black-ops team is sent to spring Ronan the Accuser from the [[Features of the Marvel Universe#Other locations|Hydro-Base]]. Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Wasp, Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye, Vision, Captain Mar-Vell, and Peter Corbeau were able to stop the wormhole device, but ended up sucked towards Kree space. In the episode \"Live Kree and Die\", the Avengers are separated upon the crash-landing on Hala. Captain America, Wasp, Ms. Marvel, Captain Mar-Vell, and Peter Corbeau are apprehended by the Kree soldiers and brought before the Supreme Intelligence. The Supreme Intelligence then has the humans experimented upon to see what the humans are capable of. When Captain Mar-Vell tries to plead to the Supreme Intelligence to spare them from the experiments, the Supreme Intelligence states that \"traitors to the Kree Empire have no say\". Thor deals with the Kree soldiers and their Sentries while Iron Man, Black Panther, Hawkeye, and Vision free their captive teammates.

He joined [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on loan in December 1985 and made his league debut, for Torquay, on 14 December in a 1\u20131 draw at home to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]. He returned to Oxford on 13 January 1986, but moved on loan again on 27 March 1986, joining [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] until the end of the season. He broke into the Oxford first team the following season, playing 60 times before a \u00a3140,000 move to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on 27 June 1988.\n\nIn six years at Kenilworth Road he played 214 games, scoring 13 times, but was released at the end of the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] season. In July 1994 he joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], but started only two games for the Potters.

English former professional [[association football|footballer]] who played in [[Defender (football)|defence]] and [[midfielder|midfield]]. After retiring, he became a manager.\n\n==Playing career==\nBorn in [[Alnwick]], Northumberland, Dreyer started his career with [[Wallingford Town F.C.|Wallingford Town]], leaving to join [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] in January 1985. He joined [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]] on loan in December 1985 and made his league debut, for Torquay, on 14 December in a 1\u20131 draw at home to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]. He returned to Oxford on 13 January 1986, but moved on loan again on 27 March 1986, joining [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] until the end of the season. He broke into the Oxford first team the following season, playing 60 times before a \u00a3140,000 move to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] on 27 June 1988.\n\nIn six years at Kenilworth Road he played 214 games, scoring 13 times, but was released at the end of the [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] season. In July 1994 he joined [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]], but started only two games for the Potters. He joined [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] in March 1995, and was part of the Trotters squad which secured promotion to the Premier League via the play-offs.\n\nOn 6 November 1996, he signed for [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] for \u00a325,000. He scored on his debut in a 3\u20133 draw at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. Dreyer scored a further three goals that season all in the FA Cup. They included two goals at [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]] and one in City's 3\u20132 upset of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].\n\nDreyer struggled to hold down a regular place in the side the following season but in [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] he helped the Bantams to gain promotion to the [[Premier League]] including making a vital clearance in the final win of the season, 3\u20132 at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Although Dreyer made just 14 starts in City's season in the top flight, he made an equally vital contribution with the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over [[Sunderland F.C.|Sunderland]] as Bradford stayed up by just two points.<ref>Telegraph & Argus, [http://archive.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/2004/2/17/102941.html City doomed fears Dreyer]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/apr/30/newsstory.sport15|title=Dreyer's life less ordinary|first=Oliver|last=Kay|date=30 April 2000|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=28 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nHe left the Bantams after turning down a new one-year contract as he felt he deserved a two-year deal.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bradford_city/815063.stm Dreyer quits Bantams].

This evil army is led by [[Hordak]], a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the whole of Etheria. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic sword that transforms her into the Princess of Power, [[She-Ra]]. After realizing the suffering that the Horde has inflicted on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora joins the Resistance in the fight against the Horde through rebuilding the Princess Alliance, a group of other [[magical girl]]s that once all opposed Hordak. Adora's newfound allegiance to the Resistance pits her against her former best friend [[Catra]], whose feelings of abandonment twist her personal ambitions, leading her to become Adora's mortal enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/53992/she-ra-reboot-netflix-news|title=She-Ra: first look at Netflix reboot|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, Adora reassembles the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault, although engineer princess Entrapta defects to the Horde when she believes her allies have abandoned her. In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the warlord Horde Prime; Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it. In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend Glimmer, Angella's daughter and Bright Moon's new queen, especially when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria; she destroys the sword to prevent the weapon from activating, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal and becomes accessible to Horde Prime's armada.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{see also|List of She-Ra: Princess of Power and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as [[She-Ra|Adora / She-Ra]]\n** LaLa Nestor as young Adora\n* [[Karen Fukuhara]] as Glimmer, Princess (later Queen) of Bright Moon\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as [[Catra]]\n** Juliet Donenfeld as young Catra\n* [[Marcus Scribner]] as Bow\n* [[Reshma Shetty]] as Angella, Queen of Bright Moon\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as [[Shadow Weaver (character)|Shadow Weaver]]\n* Keston John as [[Hordak]], Horde Prime, [[Grizzlor]],<ref>{{cite news |title=KESTON JOHN VOICES |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Keston-John/ |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |work=Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref> Additional Voices\n* [[Lauren Ash]] as [[Scorpia (Princesses of Power)|Scorpia]]\n* [[Christine Woods]] as [[Entrapta]], Princess of Dryl\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Perfuma, Princess of Plumeria, Additional Voices\n* [[Jordan Fisher]] as Sea Hawk, Seneschal and Soda Pop\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Mermista, Princess of Salineas\n* Merit Leighton as Frosta, Princess of the Kingdom of Snows\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Castaspella\n* [[Krystal Joy Brown]] as Netossa, rebel princess\n* [[Noelle Stevenson]] as Spinnerella, rebel princess\n* Morla Gorrondona as Light Hope, Additional Voices\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Razz, Additional Voices\n* [[Adam Ray (comedian)|Adam Ray]] as [[Swift Wind]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Huntara<ref name=\"io901\">{{cite web |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=She-Ra Season 3 Is Coming This Summer and It's Bringing Geena Davis With It |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/she-ra-season-3-is-coming-this-summer-and-its-bringing-1834681402 |publisher=io9 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Zehra Fazal]] as Mara\n* Chris Jai Alex as George, one of Bow's fathers\n* Regi Davis as Lance, one of Bow's fathers\n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lonnie, Additional Voices\n* Antony Del Rio as Kyle, Additional Voices\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as King Micah\n** [[Taylor Gray]] as Young Micah\n* Jake Eberle as Norwyn and Tung Lashor\n* [[Jacob Tobia]] as Double Trouble\n* [[Amanda C.

A [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the 1985 [[Filmation]] series ''[[She-Ra: Princess of Power]]'', the 2018 series tells the tale of a teenager named Adora, who gains powers that allow her to turn into [[She-Ra|the titular heroine]].

This evil army is led by [[Hordak]], a tyrannical despot who dreams of conquering the whole of Etheria. One day, after getting lost in the woods, Adora finds a magic sword that transforms her into the Princess of Power, [[She-Ra]]. After realizing the suffering that the Horde has inflicted on Etheria and its inhabitants, Adora joins the Resistance in the fight against the Horde through rebuilding the Princess Alliance, a group of other [[magical girl]]s that once all opposed Hordak. Adora's newfound allegiance to the Resistance pits her against her former best friend [[Catra]], whose feelings of abandonment twist her personal ambitions, leading her to become Adora's mortal enemy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/53992/she-ra-reboot-netflix-news|title=She-Ra: first look at Netflix reboot|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the first season, Adora reassembles the Princess Alliance, which successfully defends the rebel stronghold of Bright Moon against the Horde's assault, although engineer princess Entrapta defects to the Horde when she believes her allies have abandoned her. In the second and third seasons, Hordak attempts to build an interdimensional portal which will allow him to contact his creator, the warlord Horde Prime; Catra activates the portal even though it threatens to tear the planet apart, and rebellion leader Queen Angella sacrifices herself to stop it. In the fourth season, friction arises between Adora and her friend Glimmer, Angella's daughter and Bright Moon's new queen, especially when Adora learns that her sword is the key to an ancient superweapon inside Etheria; she destroys the sword to prevent the weapon from activating, but not before Etheria is pulled through a portal and becomes accessible to Horde Prime's armada.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{see also|List of She-Ra: Princess of Power and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power characters}}\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Aimee Carrero]] as [[She-Ra|Adora / She-Ra]]\n** LaLa Nestor as young Adora\n* [[Karen Fukuhara]] as Glimmer, Princess (later Queen) of Bright Moon\n* [[AJ Michalka]] as [[Catra]]\n** Juliet Donenfeld as young Catra\n* [[Marcus Scribner]] as Bow\n* [[Reshma Shetty]] as Angella, Queen of Bright Moon\n* [[Lorraine Toussaint]] as [[Shadow Weaver (character)|Shadow Weaver]]\n* Keston John as [[Hordak]], Horde Prime, [[Grizzlor]],<ref>{{cite news |title=KESTON JOHN VOICES |url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Keston-John/ |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |work=Behind the Voice Actors}}</ref> Additional Voices\n* [[Lauren Ash]] as [[Scorpia (Princesses of Power)|Scorpia]]\n* [[Christine Woods]] as [[Entrapta]], Princess of Dryl\n* [[Genesis Rodriguez]] as Perfuma, Princess of Plumeria, Additional Voices\n* [[Jordan Fisher]] as Sea Hawk, Seneschal and Soda Pop\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Mermista, Princess of Salineas\n* Merit Leighton as Frosta, Princess of the Kingdom of Snows\n* [[Sandra Oh]] as Castaspella\n* [[Krystal Joy Brown]] as Netossa, rebel princess\n* [[Noelle Stevenson]] as Spinnerella, rebel princess\n* Morla Gorrondona as Light Hope, Additional Voices\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Razz, Additional Voices\n* [[Adam Ray (comedian)|Adam Ray]] as [[Swift Wind]]\n* [[Geena Davis]] as Huntara<ref name=\"io901\">{{cite web |last1=Pulliam-Moore |first1=Charles |title=She-Ra Season 3 Is Coming This Summer and It's Bringing Geena Davis With It |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/she-ra-season-3-is-coming-this-summer-and-its-bringing-1834681402 |publisher=io9 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 |date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Zehra Fazal]] as Mara\n* Chris Jai Alex as George, one of Bow's fathers\n* Regi Davis as Lance, one of Bow's fathers\n* [[Dana Davis]] as Lonnie, Additional Voices\n* Antony Del Rio as Kyle, Additional Voices\n* [[Daniel Dae Kim]] as King Micah\n** [[Taylor Gray]] as Young Micah\n* Jake Eberle as Norwyn and Tung Lashor\n* [[Jacob Tobia]] as Double Trouble\n* [[Amanda C.

album by American rock band [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], released on [[Capitol Records Nashville]] on November 1, 2019.<ref name=\"bb\" /> It is their first new studio album in fourteen years; it has received mixed reviews and modest commercial success.\n\n==Recording and release==\nThe album was announced in December 2018, along with their [[Group Therapy Tour]], the first outing the band had made since 2008.<ref name=\"ap\" /> Once the group decided to reform, they went to vocalist [[Darius Rucker]]'s management company to help them arrange for recording and promotion.<ref name=\"gn\" /> The band members decided to record again concurrent with the decision to tour<ref name=\"cst\" /> and used the opportunity to debut new tracks live.<ref name=\"js\" /> This release is the first from the band in 14&nbsp;years and the title was announced on August 9, 2019.<ref name=\"bb\" />\n\nTo promote the album, the single \"Rollin'\" was made available with pre-orders on their site and to the general public on September 6.<ref name=\"bb\" /> The band enlisted [[Frank Rogers (record producer)|Frank Rogers]] and [[Jeff Trott]] to record them, along with a variety of guest musicians.<ref name=\"usa\" /> Individual band members brought in songs that they had considered for solo efforts (guitarist [[Mark Bryan]], with \"Turn It Up\") or that resulted from [[jam session]]s (singer [[Darius Rucker]] with pop musician [[Ed Sheeran]] on \"Wildfire Love\"), finally arriving at 17 tracks recorded in the studio.<ref name=\"rs\" /> The band worked with outside songwriters for this recording, admonishing them, \"We don\u2019t want you to write the Hootie song... Write a song and we\u2019ll make it sound like Hootie.\"<ref name=\"america\" /> The goal for songwriting was authenticity and an ability to speak to the average person.<ref name=\"people\" />\n\nThe band released the track listing and lead single \"Rollin\u2019\" on September 5.<ref name=\"bbtl\" /> \"Miss California\" and \"Lonely on a Saturday Night\" followed, with \"Hold On\" coming out on October 18.<ref name=\"ho\" /> Some sources indicated that the song \"Unafraid\" would be on the final release but it was cut.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\n==Reception==\nThe band's hometown paper, ''[[The Post and Courier]]'' ran a negative review written by [[Associated Press]] writer Mark Kennedy, who acknowledged some solid musicality but ultimately concluded that the album is made up of \"utterly forgettable songs\" and \"nothing on this album is fresh\".<ref name=\"pandc\" /> A second review in the same paper from their local writer Kalyn Oyer was more positive.<ref name=\"pandc2\" /> In [[Consequence of Sound]], Tyler Clark awarded the album a C\u2013, calling it \"painfully bland\" but praises Rucker's vocals and lyrics.<ref name=\"cos\" /> The editorial staff of [[AllMusic Guide]] gave the release four out of five stars, with reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called this \"a nice blend between the group's signature college rock singalongs and Rucker's slick, cheerful solo work\" and praised the album's positive feel, writing, \"This friendliness lends itself to a collection of songs that are resolutely sturdy, designed to sound more charming over time, and the inherent warmth of Imperfect Circle is reason enough to give the tunes a chance to grow.\"<ref name=\"amg\" /> The ''[[Texarkana Gazette]]'' published a mixed interview that called the songs \"earnest and yet utterly forgettable\" which are \"nice when you play them but make no discernible impression\".<ref name=\"tg\" /> Ken Tucker of ''[[Fresh Air]]'' opines \"This collection manages the tricky challenge of sounding like classic Hootie while also extending the group's sound for the 21st century\", calling it \"a well-made, frequently thoughtful album\".<ref name=\"fa\" />\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''Imperfect Circle'' debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Top Country Albums]] and No.&nbsp;26 on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard''&nbsp;200]] based on 17,000 units, 15,000 of which are pure album sales. It is their first appearance on the Country chart, and their highest entry on ''Billboard''&nbsp;200 since 1998.<ref name=\"bbcountry\" /> It has sold 42,700 copies in the United States {{as of|March 2020|lc=yes}}.<ref name=\"sales\" />\n\n==Track listing==\n#\"New Year's Day\" (Tofer Brown, Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh, [[Eric Paslay]], Je\ufb00 Trott)&nbsp;\u2013 3:32\n#\"Miss California\" (Andrew DeRoberts, David Ryan Harris, Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh)&nbsp;\u2013 3:12\n#\"Wild Fire Love\" ([[Joel Crouse]], Kyle Rife, [[Darius Rucker]], [[Ed Sheeran]])&nbsp;\u2013 3:33\n#\"Hold On\" ([[Jim Beavers]], [[Chris Stapleton]])&nbsp;\u2013 3:22\n#\"Turn It Up\" (Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh, Trott)&nbsp;\u2013 3:21\n#\"Not Tonight\" (DeRoberts, David Ryan Harris, Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh)&nbsp;\u2013 3:20\n#\"We Are One\" (Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh)&nbsp;\u2013 2:04\n#\"Everybody but You\" (Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh, Frank Rogers)&nbsp;\u2013 3:30\n#\"Lonely on a Saturday Night\" (Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh, Paslay, Trott)&nbsp;\u2013 3:10\n#\"Why\" (Chris August, Hootie & the Blow\ufb01sh, [[James T.

Despite taking hundreds of measures, the rate of environmental issues is increasing rapidly instead of reducing.\n\n==Movements and ideas==\n{{main|Conservation movement#United States|Conservation in the United States}}\n\n===20th century===\nBoth Conservationism and [[Environmentalism]] appeared in political debate in forests about the [[Progressive Era]] in the early 20th century. There were three main positions. The '''laissez-faire''' position held that owners of private property\u2014including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.<ref>Samuelement, 1890-1920'' (1959)</ref>\n\nThe '''Conservationists''', led by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[Gifford Pinchot]], said that the laissez-faire approach was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources.\n\n'''Environmentalism''' was the third position, led by [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914). Muir's passion for nature made him the most influential American environmentalist. Muir preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. He founded the [[Sierra Club]] and remains an icon of the environmentalist movement. He was primarily responsible for defining the environmentalist position, in the debate between Conservation and environmentalism.\n\nEnvironmentalism preached that nature was almost sacred, and that man was an intruder. It allowed for limited tourism (such as hiking), but opposed automobiles in national parks. It strenuously opposed timber cutting on most public lands, and vehemently denounced the dams that Roosevelt supported for water supplies, electricity and flood control. Especially controversial was the [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], which Roosevelt approved, and which supplies the water supply of San Francisco.\n\n==Climate change==\n{{main|Climate change in the United States}}\nThe United States is the second largest emitter, [[Environment of China|after China]], of [[carbon dioxide]] from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vidal, John |author2=David Adam| title=China Overtakes US as World's Biggest CO<sub>2</sub> Emitter | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/19/china.usnews | date=2007-06-19 | accessdate=2007-06-27|work=Guardian}}</ref> The [[energy policy of the United States]] is widely debated; many call on the country to take a leading role in fighting [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. Faces International Pressure on Climate Change Policy | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec05/climate_7-5.html | date=2005-07-05 | accessdate=2007-05-05| publisher=PBS |work=Online NewsHour}}</ref> The U.S. is one of only three countries that has not signed up to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].\n{{see also|Kyoto protocol#United States}}\n\n===Energy===\n{{main|Energy in the United States}}\n[[Image:Usa night.gif|right|300px|thumb|Satellite image showing the light output at night in the United States]]\n\nSince about 26% of all types of energy used in the United States are derived from [[fossil fuel]] consumption it is closely linked to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. The energy policy of the United States is determined by federal, state and local public entities, which address issues of energy production, distribution, and consumption, such as building codes and gas mileage advancements. The production and transport of fossil fuels are also tied to significant environmental issues.\n\n==Species conservation==\n{{main|Conservation in the United States}}\nMany plant and animal species became extinct in North America soon after first human arrival, including the [[Pleistocene megafauna#North America|North American megafauna]]; others have become nearly extinct since European settlement, among them the [[American bison]] and [[California condor]].<ref>[http://www.cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/megafauna_extinctions.htm Pleistocene Megafauna Extinctions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308123523/http://cpluhna.nau.edu/Biota/megafauna_extinctions.htm |date=2010-03-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe last of the [[passenger pigeon]]s died in 1914 after being the most common bird in North America.

Despite taking hundreds of measures, the rate of environmental issues is increasing rapidly instead of reducing.\n\n==Movements and ideas==\n{{main|Conservation movement#United States|Conservation in the United States}}\n\n===20th century===\nBoth Conservationism and [[Environmentalism]] appeared in political debate in forests about the [[Progressive Era]] in the early 20th century. There were three main positions. The '''laissez-faire''' position held that owners of private property\u2014including lumber and mining companies, should be allowed to do anything they wished for their property.<ref>Samuelement, 1890-1920'' (1959)</ref>\n\nThe '''Conservationists''', led by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and his close ally [[Gifford Pinchot]], said that the laissez-faire approach was too wasteful and inefficient. In any case, they noted, most of the natural resources in the western states were already owned by the federal government.  The best course of action, they argued, was a long-term plan devised by national experts to maximize the long-term economic benefits of natural resources.\n\n'''Environmentalism''' was the third position, led by [[John Muir]] (1838\u20131914). Muir's passion for nature made him the most influential American environmentalist. Muir preached that nature was sacred and humans are intruders who should look but not develop. He founded the [[Sierra Club]] and remains an icon of the environmentalist movement. He was primarily responsible for defining the environmentalist position, in the debate between Conservation and environmentalism.\n\nEnvironmentalism preached that nature was almost sacred, and that man was an intruder. It allowed for limited tourism (such as hiking), but opposed automobiles in national parks. It strenuously opposed timber cutting on most public lands, and vehemently denounced the dams that Roosevelt supported for water supplies, electricity and flood control. Especially controversial was the [[O'Shaughnessy Dam (California)|Hetch Hetchy dam]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], which Roosevelt approved, and which supplies the water supply of San Francisco.\n\n==Climate change==\n{{main|Climate change in the United States}}\nThe United States is the second largest emitter, [[Environment of China|after China]], of [[carbon dioxide]] from the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Vidal, John |author2=David Adam| title=China Overtakes US as World's Biggest CO<sub>2</sub> Emitter | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/19/china.usnews | date=2007-06-19 | accessdate=2007-06-27|work=Guardian}}</ref> The [[energy policy of the United States]] is widely debated; many call on the country to take a leading role in fighting [[global warming]].<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. Faces International Pressure on Climate Change Policy | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec05/climate_7-5.html | date=2005-07-05 | accessdate=2007-05-05| publisher=PBS |work=Online NewsHour}}</ref> The U.S. is one of only three countries that has not signed up to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].\n{{see also|Kyoto protocol#United States}}\n\n===Energy===\n{{main|Energy in the United States}}\n[[Image:Usa night.gif|right|300px|thumb|Satellite image showing the light output at night in the United States]]\n\nSince about 26% of all types of energy used in the United States are derived from [[fossil fuel]] consumption it is closely linked to [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.

It was positioned in the high mountains at the extreme right of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]]. Used to mountain fighting, the FEC pushed back the German 5th Mountain Division taking Monte Belvedere and Colle Abate but stopped before being able to take Monte Cifalco after suffering heavy casualties and lacking reinforcements.{{sfn|Peter Caddick-Adams|2013|p=15}} The Allied command decided to settle down to reinforce and reorganise for a spring campaign code-named \u2018\u2018Diadem\u2019\u2019 set for May 11. New units were added: The 1st French Motorized Division, the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division, as well as another group of Tabors, the 1st GTM.{{sfn|Edward L. Bimberg|1999|p=54}}\n\nIn the next two battles, much smaller affairs on a narrow front around Cassino town, the corps was not involved. For the fourth and final battle the Fifth Army's front had been compressed towards the coast to allow the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] and [[II Corps (Poland)|II Polish Corps]] to join the line. During this battle, launched 11 May 1944, the Corps attacked into the inhospitable [[Aurunci Mountains]] which the Germans had considered impassable by modern infantry. The progress made by the corps and in particular the lightly loaded [[goumiers]], capturing Monte Maio and pushing deep into the Aurunci, threatened the flanks of the German forces on their right in the [[Liri]] valley fighting against XIII Corps. The Germans were consequently forced to withdraw allowing XIII Corps to advance up the Liri valley and the Polish Corps on the right to occupy on 18 May the heights of Monte Cassino and the abbey reduced to rubble on top of it.{{sfn|Richard Natkiel|1985|p=114}}\n\n==Breaking of the Gustav Line==\n[[File:Moroccan soldiers at Monte Cassino.jpg|thumb|Moroccan goumiers at Monte Cassino]]\nIn his autobiography, [[Mark W. Clark]] describes how the FEC broke through the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] in May 1944.\n\n<blockquote>Meantime, the French forces had crossed the [[Garigliano]] (River) and moved forward into the mountainous terrain lying south of the [[Liri|Liri River]].  It was not easy.  As always, the German veterans reacted strongly and there was bitter fighting. The French surprised the enemy and quickly seized key terrain including Mounts Faito Cerasola and high ground near [[Castelforte]].  The 1st Motorized Division helped the 2nd Moroccan division take key Mount Girofano and then advanced rapidly north to S. Apollinare and S. Ambrogio.  In spite of the stiffening enemy resistance, the 2nd Moroccan Division penetrated the [[Gustav Line]] in less than two day\u2019s fighting. The next 48 hours on the French front were decisive.  The knife-wielding [[Goumiers]] swarmed over the hills, particularly at night, and General Juin\u2019s entire force showed an aggressiveness hour after hour that the Germans could not withstand.  Cerasola, San Giogrio, Mt. D\u2019Oro, [[Ausonia, Italy|Ausonia]] and [[Esperia]] were seized in one of the most brilliant and daring advances of the war in Italy, and by May 16 the French Expeditionary Corps had thrust forward some ten miles on their left flank to Mount Revole, with the remainder of their front slanting back somewhat to keep contact with the British 8th Army. For this performance, which was to be a key to the success of the entire drive on Rome, I shall always be a grateful admirer of General Juin and his magnificent FEC... The 8th Army\u2019s delay made Juin\u2019s task more difficult because he was moving forward so rapidly that his right flank---adjacent to the British---constantly was exposed to counter-attacks.<ref>[[Mark Wayne Clark]], ''Calculated risk'', Harper, 1950, p.348</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe battle for the Gustav Line had been difficult for the FEC. It had been involved in violent combat in the mountains. Then, while Clark entered [[Rome]], the FEC attacked the east of the city securing the road to [[Siena]] and capturing it. After the campaign, the soldiers were withdrawn to Africa to join the [[First Army (France)#1944\u20131945|Army B]] that had landed in southern France after [[Operation Dragoon]].\n==Casualties==\nThe casualties for the campaign were approximately 6,500 killed in action, 2,000 missing and 23,000 wounded. The combatants of the C.E.F. rest in the French military cemeteries of [[Monte Mario]] ([[Rome]]) and [[Venafro#The French Military Cemetery|Venafro]].\n\n== Triumph and disgrace ==\n\n=== Praised from Allied military leaders ===\nIn a letter to Marechal Juin, General Mark Clark paid tribute to the Tirailleur units and Goumiers of the CEF :\n\n<blockquote>For me, it has been a deep source of satisfaction to see how the vital part played by the French troops of the Fifth Army throughout our Italian campaign against the common enemy has been universally acknowledged. During these long months, I have had the real privilege of seeing for myself the evidence of the outstanding calibre of the French soldiers, heirs of the noblest traditions of the French Army. Nevertheless, not satisfied with this, you and all your people have added a new epic chapter to the history of France; you have gladdened the hearts of your compatriots, giving them comfort and hope as they languish under the heavy and humiliating yoke of a hated invader. . . .

It was positioned in the high mountains at the extreme right of the [[United States Army North|U.S. Fifth Army]]. Used to mountain fighting, the FEC pushed back the German 5th Mountain Division taking Monte Belvedere and Colle Abate but stopped before being able to take Monte Cifalco after suffering heavy casualties and lacking reinforcements.{{sfn|Peter Caddick-Adams|2013|p=15}} The Allied command decided to settle down to reinforce and reorganise for a spring campaign code-named \u2018\u2018Diadem\u2019\u2019 set for May 11. New units were added: The 1st French Motorized Division, the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division, as well as another group of Tabors, the 1st GTM.{{sfn|Edward L. Bimberg|1999|p=54}}\n\nIn the next two battles, much smaller affairs on a narrow front around Cassino town, the corps was not involved. For the fourth and final battle the Fifth Army's front had been compressed towards the coast to allow the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] and [[II Corps (Poland)|II Polish Corps]] to join the line. During this battle, launched 11 May 1944, the Corps attacked into the inhospitable [[Aurunci Mountains]] which the Germans had considered impassable by modern infantry. The progress made by the corps and in particular the lightly loaded [[goumiers]], capturing Monte Maio and pushing deep into the Aurunci, threatened the flanks of the German forces on their right in the [[Liri]] valley fighting against XIII Corps. The Germans were consequently forced to withdraw allowing XIII Corps to advance up the Liri valley and the Polish Corps on the right to occupy on 18 May the heights of Monte Cassino and the abbey reduced to rubble on top of it.{{sfn|Richard Natkiel|1985|p=114}}\n\n==Breaking of the Gustav Line==\n[[File:Moroccan soldiers at Monte Cassino.jpg|thumb|Moroccan goumiers at Monte Cassino]]\nIn his autobiography, [[Mark W. Clark]] describes how the FEC broke through the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] in May 1944.\n\n<blockquote>Meantime, the French forces had crossed the [[Garigliano]] (River) and moved forward into the mountainous terrain lying south of the [[Liri|Liri River]].  It was not easy.  As always, the German veterans reacted strongly and there was bitter fighting. The French surprised the enemy and quickly seized key terrain including Mounts Faito Cerasola and high ground near [[Castelforte]].  The 1st Motorized Division helped the 2nd Moroccan division take key Mount Girofano and then advanced rapidly north to S. Apollinare and S. Ambrogio.  In spite of the stiffening enemy resistance, the 2nd Moroccan Division penetrated the [[Gustav Line]] in less than two day\u2019s fighting. The next 48 hours on the French front were decisive.  The knife-wielding [[Goumiers]] swarmed over the hills, particularly at night, and General Juin\u2019s entire force showed an aggressiveness hour after hour that the Germans could not withstand.  Cerasola, San Giogrio, Mt. D\u2019Oro, [[Ausonia, Italy|Ausonia]] and [[Esperia]] were seized in one of the most brilliant and daring advances of the war in Italy, and by May 16 the French Expeditionary Corps had thrust forward some ten miles on their left flank to Mount Revole, with the remainder of their front slanting back somewhat to keep contact with the British 8th Army. For this performance, which was to be a key to the success of the entire drive on Rome, I shall always be a grateful admirer of General Juin and his magnificent FEC... The 8th Army\u2019s delay made Juin\u2019s task more difficult because he was moving forward so rapidly that his right flank---adjacent to the British---constantly was exposed to counter-attacks.<ref>[[Mark Wayne Clark]], ''Calculated risk'', Harper, 1950, p.348</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe battle for the Gustav Line had been difficult for the FEC. It had been involved in violent combat in the mountains. Then, while Clark entered [[Rome]], the FEC attacked the east of the city securing the road to [[Siena]] and capturing it. After the campaign, the soldiers were withdrawn to Africa to join the [[First Army (France)#1944\u20131945|Army B]] that had landed in southern France after [[Operation Dragoon]].\n==Casualties==\nThe casualties for the campaign were approximately 6,500 killed in action, 2,000 missing and 23,000 wounded. The combatants of the C.E.F. rest in the French military cemeteries of [[Monte Mario]] ([[Rome]]) and [[Venafro#The French Military Cemetery|Venafro]].\n\n== Triumph and disgrace ==\n\n=== Praised from Allied military leaders ===\nIn a letter to Marechal Juin, General Mark Clark paid tribute to the Tirailleur units and Goumiers of the CEF :\n\n<blockquote>For me, it has been a deep source of satisfaction to see how the vital part played by the French troops of the Fifth Army throughout our Italian campaign against the common enemy has been universally acknowledged. During these long months, I have had the real privilege of seeing for myself the evidence of the outstanding calibre of the French soldiers, heirs of the noblest traditions of the French Army. Nevertheless, not satisfied with this, you and all your people have added a new epic chapter to the history of France; you have gladdened the hearts of your compatriots, giving them comfort and hope as they languish under the heavy and humiliating yoke of a hated invader. . . . With my deepest gratitude for the tremendous contribution that you have made to our joint victories, my dear General.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.montecassinobelvedere.fr/en/leading-figures-in-the-battle-of-belvedere/general-mark-w-clark-en/|title=General Mark W.
