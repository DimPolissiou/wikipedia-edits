A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician and theologian, Sig\u00fcenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in [[Northwest Florida]] during the expedition. While traveling in the area of [[East Bay (Santa Rosa County, Florida)|East Bay]] in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the [[East Bay River]].<ref name=\":13\" /> In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sig\u00fcenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \"The River Jordan\".<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://robledal.org/history/history.htm|title=Robledal History|last=|first=|date=|website=robledal.org|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \"El Robledal,\" meaning \"The Oakgrove\" in Spanish.<ref name=\":13\" /> After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez-Sig\u00fcenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andr\u00e9s de Arriola y Guzm\u00e1n (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.<ref name=\":13\">{{cite web|url=http://navarrepress.com/headlines/navarres-earliest-recorded-heritage-began-spanish-explorers-1693/|title=Navarre's earliest recorded heritage began with Spanish explorers in 1693|last=|first=|date=|website=www.navarrepress.com|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Axelson Point ===\n\n==== Settlement and Shipyard ====\nRobledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] by the Axelson Family.

The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Staff reporters |title=When Navarre was Eagan |url=http://navarrepress.com/community/when-navarre-was-eagan |website=Navarre Press |accessdate=February 28, 2020 |date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Guy Wyman and town development===\nThe founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was [[Guy Wyman]], a colonel in the [[United States Army]]. During [[World War I]], he met a [[France|French]] nurse named Noelle. At the time, immigration policies would not allow him to bring her to the United States as a fianc\u00e9e or even as a wife, but he could bring her back as his legal child.  Colonel Wyman therefore adopted her, and brought her back to the Florida panhandle, where he purchased a large amount of land.

A skilled cartographer, scientist, mathematician and theologian, Sig\u00fcenza was responsible for scouting and mapping possible sites of Spanish colonization in [[Northwest Florida]] during the expedition. While traveling in the area of [[East Bay (Santa Rosa County, Florida)|East Bay]] in April 1693 the Spanish discovered what is today called the [[East Bay River]].<ref name=\":13\" /> In honor of Captain Jordan de Reina, an officer who had taken part in the Barroto-Romero voyage of 1686 as well as Sig\u00fcenza's in 1693, the Spanish dubbed the waters on which they traveled, \"The River Jordan\".<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=http://robledal.org/history/history.htm|title=Robledal History|last=|first=|date=|website=robledal.org|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn April 11, 1693, while sailing up East Bay River, sailors aboard the Spanish ships noticed a group of Native Americans observing from a camp near the shore. In order to greet the natives, a landing party was sent out. By the time the Spanish reached the shore, however, the Native Americans were gone. As the Natives quickly abandoned camp the Spanish discovered half-cooked pieces of buffalo meat sitting over a fire, along with a fierce dog guarding the site. Due to the great number of oak trees in the area the campsite was named \"El Robledal,\" meaning \"The Oakgrove\" in Spanish.<ref name=\":13\" /> After erecting a wooden cross and leaving gifts for the natives, the Spaniards continued their exploration upriver. Upon later return to El Robledal, the explorers noticed that their gifts had been taken. In return, the natives had also constructed a wooden cross and left a buffalo hide as a peace offering. The earliest-known map of Robledal dates from 1693, the same year as the Pez-Sig\u00fcenza Expedition. Three years later, in a 1698 map by Don Andr\u00e9s de Arriola y Guzm\u00e1n (the first governor of a settlement in the Pensacola area after the [[Trist\u00e1n de Luna y Arellano]] colony was abandoned), Robledal is again noted.<ref name=\":13\">{{cite web|url=http://navarrepress.com/headlines/navarres-earliest-recorded-heritage-began-spanish-explorers-1693/|title=Navarre's earliest recorded heritage began with Spanish explorers in 1693|last=|first=|date=|website=www.navarrepress.com|accessdate=June 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":14\" />\n\n=== Axelson Point ===\n\n==== Settlement and Shipyard ====\nRobledal was again populated sometime near 1850, with the establishment of a [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] by the Axelson Family.

The settlement, which formerly existed as a post office location, was named after its first postmaster, John Eagan Esq., a Pensacola lawyer and politician. Following the post office's discontinuation on September 11, 1884, families continued to live in the area, and the town continued to appear on area maps even into the 1890s. While what became of the town and the people who lived there at that time is unknown (some of which are known to have remained in the town, some of which are believed to have moved to neighboring communities), the discovery of the town's existence definitively established settlement of the Navarre area in South Santa Rosa County as being prior to the 20th century. The land upon which Eagan existed would, in fact, later become what is now known as Navarre.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Staff reporters |title=When Navarre was Eagan |url=http://navarrepress.com/community/when-navarre-was-eagan |website=Navarre Press |accessdate=February 28, 2020 |date=December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Guy Wyman and town development===\nThe founder of Navarre, under the name of Navarre, was [[Guy Wyman]], a colonel in the [[United States Army]].

The earliest notes were handwritten and were issued as needed to individuals. These notes were written on one side only and bore the name of the payee, the date, and the signature of the issuing cashier. With the exception of the Restriction Period between 1797 and 1821, when the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused a bullion shortage, these notes could be exchanged in full, or in part, for an equivalent amount of gold when presented at the bank. If redeemed in part, the banknote would be signed to indicate the amount that had been redeemed. From 1853 printed notes replaced handwritten notes, with the declaration \"I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of fifty pounds\" replacing the name of the payee. This declaration remains on Bank of England banknotes to this day. A printed signature of one of three cashiers appeared on the printed notes, although this was replaced by the signature of the Chief Cashier from 1870 onwards.<ref name=\"BoE History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/history.aspx|title=A brief history of banknotes|publisher=[[Bank of England]]|accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:White-note-50-pounds.jpg|thumb|left|A \u00a350 note, issued in 1934]]\nThe ability to redeem banknotes for gold ceased in 1931 when Britain stopped using the [[gold standard]].<ref name=\" BoE History\"/> The \u00a350 note ceased to be produced by the Bank of England in 1943 and did not reappear until it was reintroduced in 1981. These D series notes were predominantly olive green on both sides, with an image of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on the front (as with all subsequent \u00a350 notes) and an image of architect [[Christopher Wren]] on the back. As a security feature, this note had a metallic thread running through it, which was upgraded to a \"windowed\" thread from July 1988 onward. The thread is woven into the paper such that it forms a dashed line, yet appears as a single line when held up to the light. The series D note was gradually replaced by the series E, beginning in 1994. This reddish note replaced Christopher Wren with [[John Houblon]], the first governor of the Bank of England, on the reverse.

It will bear the image of Queen Elizabeth II on the obverse and the image of [[computer science|computer scientist]] and [[Ultra|World War II codebreaker]] [[Alan Turing]] on the reverse.\n\n==History==\n\u00a350 notes were introduced by the [[Bank of England]] for the first time in 1725. The earliest notes were handwritten and were issued as needed to individuals. These notes were written on one side only and bore the name of the payee, the date, and the signature of the issuing cashier. With the exception of the Restriction Period between 1797 and 1821, when the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] caused a bullion shortage, these notes could be exchanged in full, or in part, for an equivalent amount of gold when presented at the bank. If redeemed in part, the banknote would be signed to indicate the amount that had been redeemed. From 1853 printed notes replaced handwritten notes, with the declaration \"I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of fifty pounds\" replacing the name of the payee. This declaration remains on Bank of England banknotes to this day. A printed signature of one of three cashiers appeared on the printed notes, although this was replaced by the signature of the Chief Cashier from 1870 onwards.<ref name=\"BoE History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/history.aspx|title=A brief history of banknotes|publisher=[[Bank of England]]|accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:White-note-50-pounds.jpg|thumb|left|A \u00a350 note, issued in 1934]]\nThe ability to redeem banknotes for gold ceased in 1931 when Britain stopped using the [[gold standard]].<ref name=\" BoE History\"/> The \u00a350 note ceased to be produced by the Bank of England in 1943 and did not reappear until it was reintroduced in 1981. These D series notes were predominantly olive green on both sides, with an image of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on the front (as with all subsequent \u00a350 notes) and an image of architect [[Christopher Wren]] on the back. As a security feature, this note had a metallic thread running through it, which was upgraded to a \"windowed\" thread from July 1988 onward. The thread is woven into the paper such that it forms a dashed line, yet appears as a single line when held up to the light. The series D note was gradually replaced by the series E, beginning in 1994. This reddish note replaced Christopher Wren with [[John Houblon]], the first governor of the Bank of England, on the reverse. As an additional security feature, these notes had a foil patch on the front.<ref name=\"BoE Withdrawn\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/withdrawn-banknotes|title=Withdrawn banknotes reference guide|publisher=[[Bank of England]]|accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> The E revision series did not have a \u00a350 note.\n\nThe current \u00a350 note was introduced in 2011.

The English at [[Fort St David]] frequently failed to pay their rents to the Raja. On one such occasion when Swaroops Singh did not receive any rent for the villages, he responded by capturing two English officers from Fort St David and imprisoning them.  Matters came to standstill in February 1711, when open hostilities broke out between the kingdom of Gingee and the British settlement at [[Fort St David]]. Three Muslim officers in the service of Gingee and one officer of the [[British East India Company]] were killed in the ensuing hostilities. Harrison sent Richard Raworth, a member of the Council of Fort St George along with three ships to the scene of action to settle the matter.\n\nRaworth arrived in Fort St David with three ships as Fort St David was blockaded by Swaroop Singh from land. Raworth's troops ran into a contingent of 400 cavalry and 1,000-foot commanded by Mahobat Khan on 11 August 1711 and barely managed to hold their ground. However, two top officers in the army, Captain Coventry and Ensign Somerville both lost their lives along with around 140 to 150 men of the Company's army. With matters reaching a standstill, Edward Harrison tried to enthuse the [[Nawab of Carnatic]] to come to the Company's aid but failed miserably. In the meantime, Richard Raworth was made the deputy Governor at Fort St David. Immediately on assumption of office, Raworth negotiated terms of peace with the Raja of Gingee. The Raja demanded a war indemnity of 16,000 pagodas in return for which he promised to cede three villages whose names have been mentioned as Trevandrun, Padre Copang and Coronuttum. However, even as the matter was under consideration, hostilities broke out once more when the Company troops attacked the forces of Gingee at Crimambakkam on 25 January 1712.\n\nThe war was, however, brought to a conclusion in April 1712 through the mediation of [[Guillaume Andr\u00e9 d'H\u00e9bert|M.Hebert]], the [[French India|French Governor of Pondicherry]]. Swaroop Singh agreed to a settlement on payment of a war indemnity of 12,000 pagodas.\n\nOn 15 November 1714, Gingee fell to the forces of the Carnatic bringing Rajput rule to an end.\n\n=== Postal service ===\n\nIt was during Edward Harrison's time that a [[Mail|postal service]] was established between the factories at [[Madras]] and [[Calcutta]].
