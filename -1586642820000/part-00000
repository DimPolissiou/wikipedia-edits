The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] overran all of the Philippines during the first half of 1942. The liberation of the Philippines commenced with [[amphibious landings]] on the eastern Philippine island of [[Leyte]] on October 20, 1944. United States and Philippine Commonwealth military forces were progressing in liberating territory and islands when the Japanese forces in the Philippines were [[Surrender of Japan|ordered to surrender by Tokyo]] on August 15, 1945, after [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the dropping of the atomic bombs on mainland Japan]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]].\n\n==Planning==\nBy mid-1944, American forces were only {{convert|300|nmi|km}} southeast of [[Mindanao]], the largest island in the southern Philippines \u2013 and able to [[aerial bomb|bomb]] Japanese positions there using long-range [[bomber]]s. American forces under [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]] had advanced across the [[Pacific Ocean|Central Pacific Ocean]], capturing the [[Gilbert Islands]], some of the [[Marshall Islands]], and most of the [[Marianas Islands]], bypassing many Japanese Army garrisons and leaving them behind, with no source of supplies and militarily impotent.\n\n[[Aircraft carrier]]-based warplanes were already conducting [[air strike]]s and [[fighter plane|fighter]] sweeps against the Japanese in the Philippines, especially their military [[airfield]]s. [[U.S. Army]] and [[Australian Army]] troops under the American [[General of the Army|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], the Supreme Commander of the [[South West Pacific Theater|Southwest Pacific Theater of Operations]], had either overrun, or else isolated and bypassed, all of the Japanese Army on [[New Guinea]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]]. Before the invasion of the Philippines, MacArthur's northernmost conquest had been at [[Battle of Morotai|Morotai]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] on September 15\u201316, 1944. This was MacArthur's one base that was within bomber range of the southern Philippines.\n\n[[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and [[U.S. Army|Army]] as well as Australian and [[New Zealand]] forces under the command of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]] had isolated the large Japanese South Pacific base at [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]], by capturing a ring of islands around Rabaul, and then building [[air base]]s on them from which to bomb and [[blockade]] the Japanese forces at Rabaul into military impotence.\n\nWith victories in the [[Marianas campaign]] (on [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], on [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and on [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]], during June and July 1944), American forces were getting close to Japan itself. From the Marianas, the very long-range [[B-29 Superfortress]] [[heavy bomber]]s of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) could bomb the Japanese home islands from well-supplied [[air base]]s \u2013 ones with direct access to supplies via cargo ships and tankers. (The earlier B-29 bombing campaign against Japan had been from the end of a very long and tortuous [[military logistics|supply line]] via [[British Raj|British India]] and [[British Burma]] \u2013 one that proved to be woefully inadequate. All B-29s were transferred to the Marianas during the fall of 1944.)\n\nAlthough Japan was obviously losing the war, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Government]], and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and Navy, showed no sign of capitulation, collapse or surrender.\n\nThere had been a close relationship between the people of the Philippines and the United States since 1898, with the Philippines becoming the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] in 1935, and promised their independence in mid-1946. Furthermore, an extensive series of air attacks by the American [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] under Admiral William F. Halsey against Japanese [[airfield]]s and other bases on the Philippines had drawn little Japanese opposition, such as interceptions by Japanese Army [[fighter plane]]s. Upon Admiral Halsey's recommendation, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]], meeting in Canada, approved a decision to not only move up the date for the first landing in the Philippines, but also to move it north from the southernmost island of [[Mindanao]] to the central island of [[Leyte]], Philippines. The new date set for the landing on Leyte, October 20, 1944, was two months before the previous target date to land on Mindanao.\n\nThe [[Filipino people]] were ready and waiting for the invasion. After General MacArthur had been evacuated from the Philippines in March 1942, all of its islands fell to the Japanese. The Japanese occupation was harsh, accompanied by atrocities and with large numbers of Filipinos pressed into [[slave labor]]. From mid-1942 through mid-1944, MacArthur and Nimitz supplied and encouraged the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|Filipino guerrilla resistance]] by U.S. Navy [[submarine]]s and a few parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and take control of the rural jungle and mountainous areas \u2013 amounting to about half of the archipelago. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.\n\nThe Australian government offered General MacArthur the use of the [[I Corps (Australia)|First Corps]] of the [[Australian Army]] for the Liberation of the Philippines. MacArthur suggested that two Australian [[division (military)|infantry divisions]] be employed, each of them attached to a different U.S. Army [[corps#Military formation|Corps]], but this idea was not acceptable to the [[Australian Cabinet]], which wanted to have significant operational control within a certain area of the Philippines, rather than simply being part of a U.S. Army Corps.<ref>David Day, 1992, ''Reluctant Nation: Australia and the Allied Defeat of Japan, 1942\u20131945''. (New York, Oxford University Press), p.230</ref> No agreement was ever reached between the Australian Cabinet and MacArthur \u2013 who might have wanted it that way. As a result, the Australian Army played virtually no part in the Philippines. However, units from the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy]], such as the heavy cruiser {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}}, were involved.\n\nDuring the American re-conquest of the Philippines, the guerrillas began to strike openly against Japanese forces, carried out reconnaissance activities ahead of the advancing regular troops, and took their places in battle beside the advancing American divisions.<ref>\"LIEUTENANT RAMSEY'S WAR\" by EDWIN PRICE RAMSEY and STEPHEN J.

The Japanese miscalculated the relative strength of the naval and air forces, and they attempted to destroy the landing. This brought about the massive sequence of battles called the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], fought on October 23 through October 26. This decisive victory by the U.S. Navy, its Fast Carrier Task Force, its [[surface ship|surface fleet]], and its submarines effectively destroyed the remainder of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), which had already lost all of its effective aircraft carrier forces. The IJN had four of its carriers sunk (ships with depleted air squadrons \u2013 which were used only as decoys), numerous [[battleship]]s and [[heavy cruisers]], and a large number of [[light cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s. The IJN was never able to fight a major battle after this.\n\nThe U.S. Sixth Army continued its advance from the east, as the Japanese rushed reinforcements to the [[Ormoc Bay]] area on the western side of the island. While the Sixth Army was continually reinforced, the [[Fifth Air Force|U.S. Fifth Air Force]] and the [[U.S. 3rd Fleet]]'s [[Task Force 38]] were able to devastate the Japanese attempts at air attacks and at landing new reinforcements and supplies, and also provide much support to the Army's ground troops during what is known as the [[Battle of Ormoc Bay]] from November 11 to December 21, 1944.\n\nThe Filipino guerrillas also performed valuable service in maintaining public order and in keeping the roads and highways free of congestion. After the American beachheads were established, the Leyte guerrilla groups were attached directly to the Sixth Army corps and divisions to assist in scouting, intelligence, and combat operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/G/u/Guerrillas.htm |title=Allied guerillas}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2011}}\nWith the initial U.S. Sixth Army landings on the beaches at Tacloban and Dulag, Colonel [[Ruperto Kangleon]]'s units went into action.

On December 7, 1944, the U.S. Army units made another amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay and, after a major land and air battle, the landing force cut off all Japanese ability to reinforce and resupply their troops on Leyte. Although fierce fighting continued on Leyte for months, the U.S. Army was always in control.\n\n==Mindoro==\n{{main|Battle of Mindoro}}\nThe U.S. 6th Army's second major target to attack was [[Mindoro]]. This large island is directly south of [[Luzon]] and [[Manila Bay]], and MacArthur's main goal in taking it was to be able to construct [[airfield]]s on it for fighter planes that could dominate the sky over the most-important island of Luzon, with its major seaport and capital city of [[Manila]].<ref name=\"MacArthur Reports\">{{cite book |title=Reports of General MacArthur: The Campaigns of MacArthur in the Pacific: Volume I |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Library of Congress |pages=242\u2013294 |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch09.htm |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |chapter=Chapter IX: The Mindoro and Luzon Operations}}</ref>\n\nThe Seventh Fleet's large invasion convoy from Leyte to Mindoro came under strong attack by kamikazes, but they could not delay the American invasion of Mindoro.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reports of General MacArthur: The Campaigns of MacArthur in the Pacific: Volume I |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Library of Congress |page=247 |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch09.htm |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |chapter=Chapter IX: The Mindoro and Luzon Operations}}</ref> Mindoro was only lightly occupied by the Japanese Army, and much of it was held by Filipino guerrillas, so Mindoro was quickly overrun. U.S. Army engineers set about rapidly constructing a major air base at [[San Fabian]]. Besides being close to Luzon, Mindoro has another advantage: good flying weather nearly all the time, because this is a part of the Philippines that is relatively dry \u2013 quite unlike Leyte which receives torrential rains most of the year, not only giving it poor flying weather, but making it very muddy and difficult to construct airfields.\n\nSan Fabian was also the location of another breakthrough: the first appearance during the [[War in the Pacific]] of USAAF squadrons flying the fast, long-range [[P-51 Mustang|P-51B Mustang]] fighters \u2013 far superior to anything that the Imperial Japanese Army or Navy had.\n\nMindoro was a major victory for the 6th Army and the USAAF, and it also provided the major base for the next move of MacArthur's 6th Army: the invasion of Luzon, especially at [[Lingayen Gulf]] on its western coast.\n\n==Luzon==\n{{main|Battle of Luzon}}\n[[File:Beware of the Triple Threat.jpg|thumb|Japanese leaflet designed to discourage the landing American troops.]]\n[[File:PanayIslandPhilippines1945.jpg|thumb|Troops of the [[185th Infantry Regiment (United States)|185th Inf.]], 40th Div., take cover behind advancing tanks while moving up on Japanese positions on Panay Island]]\n\nOn December 15, 1944, landings against minimal resistance were made on the southern beaches of the island of [[Mindoro]], a key location in the planned [[Lingayen Gulf]] operations, in support of major landings scheduled on [[Luzon]]. On January 9, 1945, on the south shore of Lingayen Gulf on the western coast of Luzon, General Krueger's [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] landed his first units. Almost 175,000 men followed across the twenty-mile (32&nbsp;km) beachhead within a few days. With heavy air support, Army units pushed inland, taking [[Clark Field]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} northwest of [[Manila]], in the last week of January.\n\nTwo more major landings followed, one to cut off the [[Bataan Peninsula]], and another, which included a parachute drop, south of Manila. Pincers closed on the city. On February 3, 1945, elements of the [[U.S. 1st Cavalry Division]] pushed into the northern outskirts of Manila, and the 8th Cavalry Regiment (organized as infantry) passed through the northern suburbs and into the city itself.\n\nAs the advance on Manila continued from the north and the south, the Bataan Peninsula was rapidly secured. On February 16, paratroopers and amphibious units simultaneously [[Battle of Corregidor (1945)|assaulted the islet of Corregidor]]. Taking this stronghold was necessary because troops there could block the entrance of Manila Bay. The Americans needed to establish a major harbor base at Manila Bay to support the expected invasion of Japan, planned to begin on November 1, 1945. Resistance on Corregidor ended on February 27, and then all resistance by the Japanese Empire ceased on August 15, 1945, obviating the need for an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands.\n\nDespite initial optimism, fighting in Manila was harsh. It took until March 3 to clear the city of all Japanese troops, and the Japanese Marines, who fought on stubbornly and refused to either surrender or to evacuate as the Japanese Army had done. [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Fort Drum]], a fortified island in [[Manila Bay]] near Corregidor, held out until April 13, when a team of Army troops went ashore and pumped 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the fort, then set off [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] charges. No Japanese soldiers in Fort Drum survived the blast and fire.\n\nIn all, ten U.S. divisions and five independent regiments battled on Luzon, making it the largest American campaign of the Pacific war, involving more troops than the United States had used in North Africa, Italy, or southern France.\n\n==Finishing up the campaign==\n[[File:Japanese surrender to 40th.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Troops surrender to the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]]]]\n[[Palawan Island]], between [[Borneo]] and Mindoro, the fifth largest and western-most island of the Philippines, was [[Invasion of Palawan|invaded on February 28]], with landings of the [[Eighth United States Army]] at [[Puerto Princesa]]. The Japanese put up little direct defense of Palawan, but cleaning up pockets of Japanese resistance lasted until late April, with the Japanese using their common tactic of withdrawing into the mountains and jungles, dispersed as small units.

Mindanao was followed by invasion and occupation of [[Panay]], [[Cebu]], [[Negros Island|Negros]] and several islands in the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. These islands provided bases for the U.S. Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces to attack targets throughout the Philippines and the [[South China Sea]].\n\nFollowing additional landings on Mindanao, U.S. Eighth Army troops continued their steady advance against stubborn resistance. By the end of June, the enemy pockets were compressed into isolated pockets on Mindanao and Luzon where fighting continued until the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on August 15, 1945. However, some units of the Japanese Army were out of radio contact with Tokyo, and it was difficult to convince some of them that Japan had surrendered, becoming [[Japanese holdouts]]. As at many Pacific Islands, major Japanese officials, including members of the [[Imperial Family of Japan|Imperial Family]], visited in person to convince the soldiers that they must surrender by order of the Emperor.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacArthur |first=Douglas |date=1994 |title=Reports of General MacArthur |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch14.htm |location= |publisher=United States Army |page=445 |lccn=66-60005 |accessdate=August 15, 2014 |quote=The radio also stated that members of the Imperial family were being sent to Japan's numerous theaters of operations as personal representatives of the Emperor to expedite and insure full compliance with the Imperial order to cease hostilities.}}</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\n\n;U.S. Army and Army Air Forces\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Location\n!Killed\n!Wounded\n!Total\n|-\n!Leyte<ref name=\"Cannon, pp. 368\"/>\n|3,602\n|11,991\n|15,584\n|-\n!Luzon<ref>Smith, pp. 692-693</ref>\n|8,310\n|29,560\n|37,870\n|-\n!Central and Southern Philippines<ref>Smith, ''Triumph in the Philippines'', pp. 692\u2013693</ref>\n|2,070\n|6,990\n|9,060\n|-\n!Total\n|13,982\n|48,541\n|62,523\n|-\n|}\n\n;Japanese\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Location\n!Killed\n!Captured\n!Total\n|-\n!Leyte<ref>Cannon, ''Leyte: Return to the Philippines'', pp. 351\u2013352</ref>\n|80,557\n|828\n|81,456\n|-\n!Luzon<ref>Smith, ''Triumph in the Philippines'', p. 694</ref>\n|205,535\n|9,050\n|214,585\n|-\n!Central and Southern Philippines<ref>Smith, Appendix H</ref>\n|50,260\n|2,695\n|52,955\n|-\n!Total\n|336,352\n|12,573\n|348,925\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dalton Pass]]\n* [[Escuadr\u00f3n 201]]\n* [[Philippine Liberation Medal]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Breuer |first=William B. |authorlink= |year=1986 |chapter= |title=Retaking The Philippines: America's Return to Corregidor & Bataan, 1944\u20131945 |url=https://archive.org/details/retakingphilippi00breu_0 |url-access=registration |publisher=St Martin's Press |location= |id=ASIN B000IN7D3Q}}\n* {{cite book |last=Leary |first=William M. |authorlink=William M.

The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] overran all of the Philippines during the first half of 1942. The liberation of the Philippines commenced with [[amphibious landings]] on the eastern Philippine island of [[Leyte]] on October 20, 1944. United States and Philippine Commonwealth military forces were progressing in liberating territory and islands when the Japanese forces in the Philippines were [[Surrender of Japan|ordered to surrender by Tokyo]] on August 15, 1945, after [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the dropping of the atomic bombs on mainland Japan]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]].\n\n==Planning==\nBy mid-1944, American forces were only {{convert|300|nmi|km}} southeast of [[Mindanao]], the largest island in the southern Philippines \u2013 and able to [[aerial bomb|bomb]] Japanese positions there using long-range [[bomber]]s. American forces under [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[Chester W. Nimitz]] had advanced across the [[Pacific Ocean|Central Pacific Ocean]], capturing the [[Gilbert Islands]], some of the [[Marshall Islands]], and most of the [[Marianas Islands]], bypassing many Japanese Army garrisons and leaving them behind, with no source of supplies and militarily impotent.\n\n[[Aircraft carrier]]-based warplanes were already conducting [[air strike]]s and [[fighter plane|fighter]] sweeps against the Japanese in the Philippines, especially their military [[airfield]]s. [[U.S. Army]] and [[Australian Army]] troops under the American [[General of the Army|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], the Supreme Commander of the [[South West Pacific Theater|Southwest Pacific Theater of Operations]], had either overrun, or else isolated and bypassed, all of the Japanese Army on [[New Guinea]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]]. Before the invasion of the Philippines, MacArthur's northernmost conquest had been at [[Battle of Morotai|Morotai]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] on September 15\u201316, 1944. This was MacArthur's one base that was within bomber range of the southern Philippines.\n\n[[U.S. Navy]], [[U.S Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and [[U.S. Army|Army]] as well as Australian and [[New Zealand]] forces under the command of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral [[William F. Halsey, Jr.]] had isolated the large Japanese South Pacific base at [[Rabaul]], [[New Britain]], by capturing a ring of islands around Rabaul, and then building [[air base]]s on them from which to bomb and [[blockade]] the Japanese forces at Rabaul into military impotence.\n\nWith victories in the [[Marianas campaign]] (on [[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], on [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and on [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]], during June and July 1944), American forces were getting close to Japan itself. From the Marianas, the very long-range [[B-29 Superfortress]] [[heavy bomber]]s of the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) could bomb the Japanese home islands from well-supplied [[air base]]s \u2013 ones with direct access to supplies via cargo ships and tankers. (The earlier B-29 bombing campaign against Japan had been from the end of a very long and tortuous [[military logistics|supply line]] via [[British Raj|British India]] and [[British Burma]] \u2013 one that proved to be woefully inadequate. All B-29s were transferred to the Marianas during the fall of 1944.)\n\nAlthough Japan was obviously losing the war, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Government]], and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and Navy, showed no sign of capitulation, collapse or surrender.\n\nThere had been a close relationship between the people of the Philippines and the United States since 1898, with the Philippines becoming the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] in 1935, and promised their independence in mid-1946. Furthermore, an extensive series of air attacks by the American [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] under Admiral William F. Halsey against Japanese [[airfield]]s and other bases on the Philippines had drawn little Japanese opposition, such as interceptions by Japanese Army [[fighter plane]]s. Upon Admiral Halsey's recommendation, the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]], meeting in Canada, approved a decision to not only move up the date for the first landing in the Philippines, but also to move it north from the southernmost island of [[Mindanao]] to the central island of [[Leyte]], Philippines. The new date set for the landing on Leyte, October 20, 1944, was two months before the previous target date to land on Mindanao.\n\nThe [[Filipino people]] were ready and waiting for the invasion. After General MacArthur had been evacuated from the Philippines in March 1942, all of its islands fell to the Japanese. The Japanese occupation was harsh, accompanied by atrocities and with large numbers of Filipinos pressed into [[slave labor]]. From mid-1942 through mid-1944, MacArthur and Nimitz supplied and encouraged the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|Filipino guerrilla resistance]] by U.S. Navy [[submarine]]s and a few parachute drops, so that the guerrillas could harass the Japanese Army and take control of the rural jungle and mountainous areas \u2013 amounting to about half of the archipelago. While remaining loyal to the United States, many Filipinos hoped and believed that liberation from the Japanese would bring them freedom and their already-promised independence.\n\nThe Australian government offered General MacArthur the use of the [[I Corps (Australia)|First Corps]] of the [[Australian Army]] for the Liberation of the Philippines. MacArthur suggested that two Australian [[division (military)|infantry divisions]] be employed, each of them attached to a different U.S. Army [[corps#Military formation|Corps]], but this idea was not acceptable to the [[Australian Cabinet]], which wanted to have significant operational control within a certain area of the Philippines, rather than simply being part of a U.S. Army Corps.<ref>David Day, 1992, ''Reluctant Nation: Australia and the Allied Defeat of Japan, 1942\u20131945''. (New York, Oxford University Press), p.230</ref> No agreement was ever reached between the Australian Cabinet and MacArthur \u2013 who might have wanted it that way. As a result, the Australian Army played virtually no part in the Philippines. However, units from the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] and the [[Royal Australian Navy]], such as the heavy cruiser {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}}, were involved.\n\nDuring the American re-conquest of the Philippines, the guerrillas began to strike openly against Japanese forces, carried out reconnaissance activities ahead of the advancing regular troops, and took their places in battle beside the advancing American divisions.<ref>\"LIEUTENANT RAMSEY'S WAR\" by EDWIN PRICE RAMSEY and STEPHEN J.

The Japanese miscalculated the relative strength of the naval and air forces, and they attempted to destroy the landing. This brought about the massive sequence of battles called the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], fought on October 23 through October 26. This decisive victory by the U.S. Navy, its Fast Carrier Task Force, its [[surface ship|surface fleet]], and its submarines effectively destroyed the remainder of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN), which had already lost all of its effective aircraft carrier forces. The IJN had four of its carriers sunk (ships with depleted air squadrons \u2013 which were used only as decoys), numerous [[battleship]]s and [[heavy cruisers]], and a large number of [[light cruiser]]s and [[destroyer]]s. The IJN was never able to fight a major battle after this.\n\nThe U.S. Sixth Army continued its advance from the east, as the Japanese rushed reinforcements to the [[Ormoc Bay]] area on the western side of the island. While the Sixth Army was continually reinforced, the [[Fifth Air Force|U.S. Fifth Air Force]] and the [[U.S. 3rd Fleet]]'s [[Task Force 38]] were able to devastate the Japanese attempts at air attacks and at landing new reinforcements and supplies, and also provide much support to the Army's ground troops during what is known as the [[Battle of Ormoc Bay]] from November 11 to December 21, 1944.\n\nThe Filipino guerrillas also performed valuable service in maintaining public order and in keeping the roads and highways free of congestion. After the American beachheads were established, the Leyte guerrilla groups were attached directly to the Sixth Army corps and divisions to assist in scouting, intelligence, and combat operations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/G/u/Guerrillas.htm |title=Allied guerillas}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2011}}\nWith the initial U.S. Sixth Army landings on the beaches at Tacloban and Dulag, Colonel [[Ruperto Kangleon]]'s units went into action. They dynamited key bridges to block Japanese displacement toward the target area; they harassed enemy patrols; and they sabotaged supply and ammunition depots. Information on enemy troop movements and dispositions sent from guerrilla outposts to Kangleon's Headquarters was dispatched immediately to Sixth Army.<ref>{{cite book |last=Macarthur |first=Douglas |title=Reports of General MacArthur: The Campaigns of MacArthur in the Pacific |volume=Volume I |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch10.htm |chapter=Guerrilla Activities in the Philippines: The Philippine Resistance Movement |publisher=Center for Military History, US Army |location=Washington, D.C. |year=1966 |pages=316\u2013318 |oclc=254218615}}</ref>\n\nDuring many torrential rains and over difficult terrain, the advance continued across Leyte and onto the major island of [[Samar]], just north of Leyte. On December 7, 1944, the U.S. Army units made another amphibious landing at Ormoc Bay and, after a major land and air battle, the landing force cut off all Japanese ability to reinforce and resupply their troops on Leyte. Although fierce fighting continued on Leyte for months, the U.S. Army was always in control.\n\n==Mindoro==\n{{main|Battle of Mindoro}}\nThe U.S. 6th Army's second major target to attack was [[Mindoro]]. This large island is directly south of [[Luzon]] and [[Manila Bay]], and MacArthur's main goal in taking it was to be able to construct [[airfield]]s on it for fighter planes that could dominate the sky over the most-important island of Luzon, with its major seaport and capital city of [[Manila]].<ref name=\"MacArthur Reports\">{{cite book |title=Reports of General MacArthur: The Campaigns of MacArthur in the Pacific: Volume I |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Library of Congress |pages=242\u2013294 |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch09.htm |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |chapter=Chapter IX: The Mindoro and Luzon Operations}}</ref>\n\nThe Seventh Fleet's large invasion convoy from Leyte to Mindoro came under strong attack by kamikazes, but they could not delay the American invasion of Mindoro.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reports of General MacArthur: The Campaigns of MacArthur in the Pacific: Volume I |publisher=Department of the Army |location=Library of Congress |page=247 |chapter-url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch09.htm |accessdate=January 5, 2014 |chapter=Chapter IX: The Mindoro and Luzon Operations}}</ref> Mindoro was only lightly occupied by the Japanese Army, and much of it was held by Filipino guerrillas, so Mindoro was quickly overrun. U.S. Army engineers set about rapidly constructing a major air base at [[San Fabian]]. Besides being close to Luzon, Mindoro has another advantage: good flying weather nearly all the time, because this is a part of the Philippines that is relatively dry \u2013 quite unlike Leyte which receives torrential rains most of the year, not only giving it poor flying weather, but making it very muddy and difficult to construct airfields.\n\nSan Fabian was also the location of another breakthrough: the first appearance during the [[War in the Pacific]] of USAAF squadrons flying the fast, long-range [[P-51 Mustang|P-51B Mustang]] fighters \u2013 far superior to anything that the Imperial Japanese Army or Navy had.\n\nMindoro was a major victory for the 6th Army and the USAAF, and it also provided the major base for the next move of MacArthur's 6th Army: the invasion of Luzon, especially at [[Lingayen Gulf]] on its western coast.\n\n==Luzon==\n{{main|Battle of Luzon}}\n[[File:Beware of the Triple Threat.jpg|thumb|Japanese leaflet designed to discourage the landing American troops.]]\n[[File:PanayIslandPhilippines1945.jpg|thumb|Troops of the [[185th Infantry Regiment (United States)|185th Inf.]], 40th Div., take cover behind advancing tanks while moving up on Japanese positions on Panay Island]]\n\nOn December 15, 1944, landings against minimal resistance were made on the southern beaches of the island of [[Mindoro]], a key location in the planned [[Lingayen Gulf]] operations, in support of major landings scheduled on [[Luzon]]. On January 9, 1945, on the south shore of Lingayen Gulf on the western coast of Luzon, General Krueger's [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] landed his first units. Almost 175,000 men followed across the twenty-mile (32&nbsp;km) beachhead within a few days. With heavy air support, Army units pushed inland, taking [[Clark Field]], {{convert|40|mi|km}} northwest of [[Manila]], in the last week of January.\n\nTwo more major landings followed, one to cut off the [[Bataan Peninsula]], and another, which included a parachute drop, south of Manila. Pincers closed on the city. On February 3, 1945, elements of the [[U.S. 1st Cavalry Division]] pushed into the northern outskirts of Manila, and the 8th Cavalry Regiment (organized as infantry) passed through the northern suburbs and into the city itself.\n\nAs the advance on Manila continued from the north and the south, the Bataan Peninsula was rapidly secured. On February 16, paratroopers and amphibious units simultaneously [[Battle of Corregidor (1945)|assaulted the islet of Corregidor]]. Taking this stronghold was necessary because troops there could block the entrance of Manila Bay. The Americans needed to establish a major harbor base at Manila Bay to support the expected invasion of Japan, planned to begin on November 1, 1945. Resistance on Corregidor ended on February 27, and then all resistance by the Japanese Empire ceased on August 15, 1945, obviating the need for an invasion of the Japanese Home Islands.\n\nDespite initial optimism, fighting in Manila was harsh. It took until March 3 to clear the city of all Japanese troops, and the Japanese Marines, who fought on stubbornly and refused to either surrender or to evacuate as the Japanese Army had done. [[Fort Drum (El Fraile Island)|Fort Drum]], a fortified island in [[Manila Bay]] near Corregidor, held out until April 13, when a team of Army troops went ashore and pumped 3,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the fort, then set off [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] charges. No Japanese soldiers in Fort Drum survived the blast and fire.\n\nIn all, ten U.S. divisions and five independent regiments battled on Luzon, making it the largest American campaign of the Pacific war, involving more troops than the United States had used in North Africa, Italy, or southern France.\n\n==Finishing up the campaign==\n[[File:Japanese surrender to 40th.jpg|thumb|right|Japanese Troops surrender to the [[40th Infantry Division (United States)|40th Infantry Division]]]]\n[[Palawan Island]], between [[Borneo]] and Mindoro, the fifth largest and western-most island of the Philippines, was [[Invasion of Palawan|invaded on February 28]], with landings of the [[Eighth United States Army]] at [[Puerto Princesa]]. The Japanese put up little direct defense of Palawan, but cleaning up pockets of Japanese resistance lasted until late April, with the Japanese using their common tactic of withdrawing into the mountains and jungles, dispersed as small units. Throughout the Philippines, U.S. forces were aided by Filipino guerrillas to find and dispatch the [[Japanese holdout|holdouts]],<ref>{{cite book |title=The Oxford companion to American military history |last=Chambers |first=John Whiteclay |authorlink= |author2=Fred Anderson |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press US |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-19-507198-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00cham/page/547 547] |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00cham |url-access=registration |quote=guerrilla Philippine liberation fighting Japanese. |accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> the last of whom, [[Hiroo Onoda]], did not surrender until 1974, in the mountains of Lubang Island in Mindoro.\n\nThe U.S. Eighth Army then moved on to its first [[Battle of Mindanao|landing on Mindanao]] (April 17), the last of the major islands of the Philippines to be taken. Mindanao was followed by invasion and occupation of [[Panay]], [[Cebu]], [[Negros Island|Negros]] and several islands in the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. These islands provided bases for the U.S. Fifth and Thirteenth Air Forces to attack targets throughout the Philippines and the [[South China Sea]].\n\nFollowing additional landings on Mindanao, U.S. Eighth Army troops continued their steady advance against stubborn resistance. By the end of June, the enemy pockets were compressed into isolated pockets on Mindanao and Luzon where fighting continued until the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] on August 15, 1945. However, some units of the Japanese Army were out of radio contact with Tokyo, and it was difficult to convince some of them that Japan had surrendered, becoming [[Japanese holdouts]]. As at many Pacific Islands, major Japanese officials, including members of the [[Imperial Family of Japan|Imperial Family]], visited in person to convince the soldiers that they must surrender by order of the Emperor.<ref>{{cite book |last=MacArthur |first=Douglas |date=1994 |title=Reports of General MacArthur |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/MacArthur%20Reports/MacArthur%20V1/ch14.htm |location= |publisher=United States Army |page=445 |lccn=66-60005 |accessdate=August 15, 2014 |quote=The radio also stated that members of the Imperial family were being sent to Japan's numerous theaters of operations as personal representatives of the Emperor to expedite and insure full compliance with the Imperial order to cease hostilities.}}</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\n\n;U.S. Army and Army Air Forces\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Location\n!Killed\n!Wounded\n!Total\n|-\n!Leyte<ref name=\"Cannon, pp. 368\"/>\n|3,602\n|11,991\n|15,584\n|-\n!Luzon<ref>Smith, pp. 692-693</ref>\n|8,310\n|29,560\n|37,870\n|-\n!Central and Southern Philippines<ref>Smith, ''Triumph in the Philippines'', pp. 692\u2013693</ref>\n|2,070\n|6,990\n|9,060\n|-\n!Total\n|13,982\n|48,541\n|62,523\n|-\n|}\n\n;Japanese\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Location\n!Killed\n!Captured\n!Total\n|-\n!Leyte<ref>Cannon, ''Leyte: Return to the Philippines'', pp. 351\u2013352</ref>\n|80,557\n|828\n|81,456\n|-\n!Luzon<ref>Smith, ''Triumph in the Philippines'', p. 694</ref>\n|205,535\n|9,050\n|214,585\n|-\n!Central and Southern Philippines<ref>Smith, Appendix H</ref>\n|50,260\n|2,695\n|52,955\n|-\n!Total\n|336,352\n|12,573\n|348,925\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dalton Pass]]\n* [[Escuadr\u00f3n 201]]\n* [[Philippine Liberation Medal]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{commons category|Philippines Campaign (1944\u201345)}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Breuer |first=William B. |authorlink= |year=1986 |chapter= |title=Retaking The Philippines: America's Return to Corregidor & Bataan, 1944\u20131945 |url=https://archive.org/details/retakingphilippi00breu_0 |url-access=registration |publisher=St Martin's Press |location= |id=ASIN B000IN7D3Q}}\n* {{cite book |last=Leary |first=William M. |authorlink=William M.

The species varies widely in height, from a bushy shrub 1.5 to 2 m tall, to a tree 10 to 12 m tall with a trunk diameter of about 30&nbsp;cm. ''Z. mauritiana'' may be erect or wide-spreading, with gracefully drooping thorny branches, zigzag branchlets, thornless or set with short, sharp straight or hooked spines.<ref name = \"ISSG\">{{cite web|url= http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=214 |title= ISSG database - Ecology of Ziziphus mauritiana. |publisher=Issg.org|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\n\nThe leaves are alternate, ovate or oblong elliptic with rounded apex, with 3 depressed longitudinal veins at the base. The leaves are about 2.5 to 3.2&nbsp;cm long and 1.8 to 3.8&nbsp;cm wide having fine tooth at margin. It is dark-green and glossy on the upper side and pubescent and pale-green to grey-green on the lower side. Depending on the climate, the foliage of the ''Z. mauritiana'' may be evergreen or deciduous.\n\nThe flowers are tiny, yellow, 5-petalled and are usually in twos and threes in the leaf axils. Flowers are white or greenish white and the fruits are orange to brown, 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, with edible white pulp surrounding a 2-locular pyrene.<ref name = \"PIER\"/>\n\nThis quick growing tree starts producing fruits within three years. The [[fruit]] is a soft, juicy, [[drupe]] that is 2.5&nbsp;cm diameter, though in some [[cultivar]]s the fruit size may reach up to 6.25&nbsp;cm long and 4.5&nbsp;cm wide. The form may be oval, obovate, round or oblong; the skin smooth or rough, glossy, thin but tough. The fruit ripen at different times even on a single tree. Fruits are first green, turning yellow  as they ripen. The fully mature fruit is entirely red, soft, juicy with wrinkled skin and has a pleasant aroma.  The ripe fruit is sweet and sour in taste. Both flesh texture and taste are reminiscent of apples. When under ripe the flesh is white and crispy, acid to subacid to sweet in taste.  Fully ripe fruits are less crisp and somewhat mealy; overripe fruits are wrinkled, the flesh buff-coloured, soft, spongy and musky. At first the aroma is apple like and pleasant but it becomes peculiarly musky when overripe. There is a single, hard, oval or oblate, rough central stone which contains 2 elliptic, brown seeds, 1/4 in (6mm) long.\n\n== Ecology ==\n''Ziziphus mauritiana'' is a hardy tree that copes with extreme temperatures and thrives under rather dry conditions with an annual rainfall of 6 to 88.5 in (15\u2013225&nbsp;cm). In Fiji, sometimes naturalised Ber trees grow along roadsides and in agricultural land, usually near sea level but occasionally up to an elevation of about 600 m.  It also grows well on laterite, medium black soils with good drainage, or sandy, gravelly, alluvial soil of dry river-beds where it is vigorously spontaneous. In Australia, this species grows on a wide variety of soil types, including cracking clays, solodic soils and deep alluvials, in the tropics and sub-tropics where the average annual rainfall is in the range 470-1200mm. In the drier parts of this range, it grows best in [[riparian]] zones.<ref name = \"ISSG\"/> Commercial cultivation usually extends up to 1000 m. Beyond this elevation trees do not perform well, and cultivation becomes less economical.<ref name = \"AFTD\">{{cite web|url= http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/SEA/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1723|title= AgroForestryTree Database - Ziziphus mauritiana. |publisher=Worldagroforestrycentre.org|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\n\nThe tree has a high tolerance to both water-logging and drought and can grow where annual rainfall ranges from 125 to 2,225&nbsp;mm, but is more widespread in areas with an annual rainfall of 300 to 500&nbsp;mm. In China and India, wild trees are found up to an elevation of 5,400&nbsp;ft (1,650 m). In India, the minimum shade temperature for survival is 7\u201313\u00b0 and the maximum temperature is 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. Studies report that this species flourishes in alkaline soils with a pH as high as 9.2. However, deep sandy loam to loamy soils with neutral or slightly alkaline pH are considered optimum for growth.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.winrock.org/fnrm/factnet/factpub/FACTSH/ziziphus.htm |title=Ziziphus mauritiana - a valuable tree for arid and semi-arid lands |publisher=Winrock.org|date=July 1998 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> In India, the tree grows best on sandy loam, neutral or slightly alkaline.\n\n== Reproductive biology ==\nSome cultivars attain anthesis early in the morning, others do so later in the day. The flowers are protandrous. Hence, fruit set depends on cross-pollination by insects attracted by the fragrance and nectar. Pollen of the Indian jujube is thick and heavy. It is not airborne but is transferred from flower to flower by honeybees.<ref name = \"AFTD\"/> The flowers are pollinated by ants and other insects, and in the wild state the trees do not set fruits by self-pollination. Best propagates by seeds, seedlings, direct sowing, root suckers as well as by cuttings. Ber seeds  are spread by birds, native animals, stock, feral pigs and humans who eat the fruit and expel the seeds. Seeds may remain viable for 2\u00bd years but the rate of germination declines with age.<ref name=\"HORT\"/> Cross-incompatibility occurs, and [[cultivar]]s have to be matched for good fruit set; some cultivars produce good crops parthenocarpically.\n\n== Propagation ==\n[[File:Ziziphus mauritiana fruit.jpg|thumb|Fruits at various stages of ripeness, with cracked pit showing the two seeds]]\n\n''Ziziphus mauritiana'' is one of the two ''[[Ziziphus]]'' species that have considerable horticulture importance, the other being [[Chinese jujube]] (''Z. jujuba''). Indian jujube (''Z. mauritiana'') is more tropical, whereas Chinese jujube is a more cold hardy species.<ref name = \"HORT\"/>\n\nIn India, there are 90 or more cultivars, varying in the habit of the tree; leaf shape; fruit form, size, color, flavor and keeping quality; and fruiting season. Among the important cultivars, eleven are described in the encyclopaedic ''Wealth of India'': 'Banarasi (or Banarsi) Pewandi', 'Dandan', 'Kaithli' ('Patham'), 'Muria Mahrara', 'Narikelee', 'Nazuk', 'Sanauri 1', 'Sanauri 5', 'Thornless' and 'Umran' ('Umri'). The skin of most is smooth and greenish-yellow to yellow.<ref name = \"HORT\"/>\n\nPropagation is most commonly from seed, where pretreatment is beneficial. Storage of the seed for 4 months to let it after-ripen improves germination. The hard stone restricts germination and cracking the shell or extraction of seeds hastens germination. Without pretreatment the seeds normally germinate within six weeks whereas extracted seeds only need one week to germinate\n\nSeedlings to be used as rootstock can be raised from seed. Several studies indicate that germination can be improved by soaking seeds in sulfuric acid. Germination time can also be shortened to 7 days by carefully cracking the endocarp. Ber seedlings do not tolerate transplanting, therefore the best alternatives are to sow the seeds directly in the field or to use polythene tubes placed in the nursery bed. Seedlings are ready for budding in 3 to 4 months. In addition, seedlings from the wild [[cultivar]]s can be converted into improved [[cultivar]]s by top-working and grafting. Nurseries are used for large scale seedling multiplication and graft production. The seedlings should also be given full light. The seedlings may need as long as 15 months in the nursery before planting in the field.<ref name = \"AFTD\"/>\n\nScientists in India have standardised propagation techniques for Ber establishment. Budding is the easiest method of vegetative propagation used for improved [[cultivar]]s. Different types of budding techniques have been utilised with ring-budding and shield-budding being the most successful. Wild varieties of ber are usually used as the root-stock. The most common being Z. rotundifolia in India and Z. spina-christi in Africa.<ref name = \"HORT\"/>\n\n== Season and harvesting ==\n[[File:Ziziphus mauritiana (fruits sale).jpg|250px|thumb|Ripe and unripe jujube fruits for sale at the Luangwa Bridge in [[Zambia]].]]\nPlants are capable of seed production once they reach a height of about 1 metre. Wild-growing plants in northern Australia may take 8 years to reach this size. In Australia, plants growing under natural conditions are capable of producing seeds once they reach a height of about 1m. Plants between 1 and 2m high produce, on average, less than five fruits per season. Large plants (>5m high) can produce 5000 or more fruits in a single season.\n\nIn India, some types ripen as early as October, others from mid-February to mid-March, others in March, or mid-March, to the end of April. In the Assiut Governorate, there are 2 crops a year, the main in early spring, the second in the fall. In India the trees flower in July to October and fruits are formed soon after. In February\u2013March the fruits are mature and in some places a second crop is produced in the fall. Pickings are done by hand from ladders and about 110&nbsp;lbs (50&nbsp;kg)is harvested per day. The fruits remaining on the tree are shaken down. Only fully mature fruits are picked directly from the tree. They are transported in open bags to avoid fermentation.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.safruit.org/ziziphus_mauritiana_85.pdf |title= Joker D, SEED LEAFLET No. 85 October 2003 - Ziziphus mauritiana Lam|publisher=Danida Forest Seed Centre |date=2003-10-01 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\n\nSeedling trees bear 5,000 to 10,000 small fruits per year in India. Superior grafted trees may yield as many as 30,000 fruits. The best cultivar in India, with fruits normally averaging 30 to the lb (66 to the kg), yields 175&nbsp;lbs (77&nbsp;kg) annually.

The species varies widely in height, from a bushy shrub 1.5 to 2 m tall, to a tree 10 to 12 m tall with a trunk diameter of about 30&nbsp;cm. ''Z. mauritiana'' may be erect or wide-spreading, with gracefully drooping thorny branches, zigzag branchlets, thornless or set with short, sharp straight or hooked spines.<ref name = \"ISSG\">{{cite web|url= http://www.issg.org/database/species/ecology.asp?si=214 |title= ISSG database - Ecology of Ziziphus mauritiana. |publisher=Issg.org|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\n\nThe leaves are alternate, ovate or oblong elliptic with rounded apex, with 3 depressed longitudinal veins at the base. The leaves are about 2.5 to 3.2&nbsp;cm long and 1.8 to 3.8&nbsp;cm wide having fine tooth at margin. It is dark-green and glossy on the upper side and pubescent and pale-green to grey-green on the lower side. Depending on the climate, the foliage of the ''Z. mauritiana'' may be evergreen or deciduous.\n\nThe flowers are tiny, yellow, 5-petalled and are usually in twos and threes in the leaf axils. Flowers are white or greenish white and the fruits are orange to brown, 2\u20133&nbsp;cm long, with edible white pulp surrounding a 2-locular pyrene.<ref name = \"PIER\"/>\n\nThis quick growing tree starts producing fruits within three years. The [[fruit]] is a soft, juicy, [[drupe]] that is 2.5&nbsp;cm diameter, though in some [[cultivar]]s the fruit size may reach up to 6.25&nbsp;cm long and 4.5&nbsp;cm wide. The form may be oval, obovate, round or oblong; the skin smooth or rough, glossy, thin but tough. The fruit ripen at different times even on a single tree. Fruits are first green, turning yellow  as they ripen. The fully mature fruit is entirely red, soft, juicy with wrinkled skin and has a pleasant aroma.  The ripe fruit is sweet and sour in taste. Both flesh texture and taste are reminiscent of apples. When under ripe the flesh is white and crispy, acid to subacid to sweet in taste.  Fully ripe fruits are less crisp and somewhat mealy; overripe fruits are wrinkled, the flesh buff-coloured, soft, spongy and musky. At first the aroma is apple like and pleasant but it becomes peculiarly musky when overripe. There is a single, hard, oval or oblate, rough central stone which contains 2 elliptic, brown seeds, 1/4 in (6mm) long.\n\n== Ecology ==\n''Ziziphus mauritiana'' is a hardy tree that copes with extreme temperatures and thrives under rather dry conditions with an annual rainfall of 6 to 88.5 in (15\u2013225&nbsp;cm). In Fiji, sometimes naturalised Ber trees grow along roadsides and in agricultural land, usually near sea level but occasionally up to an elevation of about 600 m.  It also grows well on laterite, medium black soils with good drainage, or sandy, gravelly, alluvial soil of dry river-beds where it is vigorously spontaneous. In Australia, this species grows on a wide variety of soil types, including cracking clays, solodic soils and deep alluvials, in the tropics and sub-tropics where the average annual rainfall is in the range 470-1200mm. In the drier parts of this range, it grows best in [[riparian]] zones.<ref name = \"ISSG\"/> Commercial cultivation usually extends up to 1000 m. Beyond this elevation trees do not perform well, and cultivation becomes less economical.<ref name = \"AFTD\">{{cite web|url= http://www.worldagroforestrycentre.org/SEA/Products/AFDbases/AF/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1723|title= AgroForestryTree Database - Ziziphus mauritiana. |publisher=Worldagroforestrycentre.org|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\n\nThe tree has a high tolerance to both water-logging and drought and can grow where annual rainfall ranges from 125 to 2,225&nbsp;mm, but is more widespread in areas with an annual rainfall of 300 to 500&nbsp;mm. In China and India, wild trees are found up to an elevation of 5,400&nbsp;ft (1,650 m). In India, the minimum shade temperature for survival is 7\u201313\u00b0 and the maximum temperature is 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. Studies report that this species flourishes in alkaline soils with a pH as high as 9.2. However, deep sandy loam to loamy soils with neutral or slightly alkaline pH are considered optimum for growth.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.winrock.org/fnrm/factnet/factpub/FACTSH/ziziphus.htm |title=Ziziphus mauritiana - a valuable tree for arid and semi-arid lands |publisher=Winrock.org|date=July 1998 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> In India, the tree grows best on sandy loam, neutral or slightly alkaline.\n\n== Reproductive biology ==\nSome cultivars attain anthesis early in the morning, others do so later in the day. The flowers are protandrous. Hence, fruit set depends on cross-pollination by insects attracted by the fragrance and nectar. Pollen of the Indian jujube is thick and heavy. It is not airborne but is transferred from flower to flower by honeybees.<ref name = \"AFTD\"/> The flowers are pollinated by ants and other insects, and in the wild state the trees do not set fruits by self-pollination. Best propagates by seeds, seedlings, direct sowing, root suckers as well as by cuttings. Ber seeds  are spread by birds, native animals, stock, feral pigs and humans who eat the fruit and expel the seeds. Seeds may remain viable for 2\u00bd years but the rate of germination declines with age.<ref name=\"HORT\"/> Cross-incompatibility occurs, and [[cultivar]]s have to be matched for good fruit set; some cultivars produce good crops parthenocarpically.\n\n== Propagation ==\n[[File:Ziziphus mauritiana fruit.jpg|thumb|Fruits at various stages of ripeness, with cracked pit showing the two seeds]]\n\n''Ziziphus mauritiana'' is one of the two ''[[Ziziphus]]'' species that have considerable horticulture importance, the other being [[Chinese jujube]] (''Z. jujuba''). Indian jujube (''Z. mauritiana'') is more tropical, whereas Chinese jujube is a more cold hardy species.<ref name = \"HORT\"/>\n\nIn India, there are 90 or more cultivars, varying in the habit of the tree; leaf shape; fruit form, size, color, flavor and keeping quality; and fruiting season. Among the important cultivars, eleven are described in the encyclopaedic ''Wealth of India'': 'Banarasi (or Banarsi) Pewandi', 'Dandan', 'Kaithli' ('Patham'), 'Muria Mahrara', 'Narikelee', 'Nazuk', 'Sanauri 1', 'Sanauri 5', 'Thornless' and 'Umran' ('Umri'). The skin of most is smooth and greenish-yellow to yellow.<ref name = \"HORT\"/>\n\nPropagation is most commonly from seed, where pretreatment is beneficial. Storage of the seed for 4 months to let it after-ripen improves germination. The hard stone restricts germination and cracking the shell or extraction of seeds hastens germination. Without pretreatment the seeds normally germinate within six weeks whereas extracted seeds only need one week to germinate\n\nSeedlings to be used as rootstock can be raised from seed. Several studies indicate that germination can be improved by soaking seeds in sulfuric acid. Germination time can also be shortened to 7 days by carefully cracking the endocarp. Ber seedlings do not tolerate transplanting, therefore the best alternatives are to sow the seeds directly in the field or to use polythene tubes placed in the nursery bed. Seedlings are ready for budding in 3 to 4 months. In addition, seedlings from the wild [[cultivar]]s can be converted into improved [[cultivar]]s by top-working and grafting. Nurseries are used for large scale seedling multiplication and graft production. The seedlings should also be given full light. The seedlings may need as long as 15 months in the nursery before planting in the field.<ref name = \"AFTD\"/>\n\nScientists in India have standardised propagation techniques for Ber establishment. Budding is the easiest method of vegetative propagation used for improved [[cultivar]]s. Different types of budding techniques have been utilised with ring-budding and shield-budding being the most successful. Wild varieties of ber are usually used as the root-stock. The most common being Z. rotundifolia in India and Z. spina-christi in Africa.<ref name = \"HORT\"/>\n\n== Season and harvesting ==\n[[File:Ziziphus mauritiana (fruits sale).jpg|250px|thumb|Ripe and unripe jujube fruits for sale at the Luangwa Bridge in [[Zambia]].]]\nPlants are capable of seed production once they reach a height of about 1 metre. Wild-growing plants in northern Australia may take 8 years to reach this size. In Australia, plants growing under natural conditions are capable of producing seeds once they reach a height of about 1m. Plants between 1 and 2m high produce, on average, less than five fruits per season. Large plants (>5m high) can produce 5000 or more fruits in a single season.\n\nIn India, some types ripen as early as October, others from mid-February to mid-March, others in March, or mid-March, to the end of April. In the Assiut Governorate, there are 2 crops a year, the main in early spring, the second in the fall. In India the trees flower in July to October and fruits are formed soon after. In February\u2013March the fruits are mature and in some places a second crop is produced in the fall. Pickings are done by hand from ladders and about 110&nbsp;lbs (50&nbsp;kg)is harvested per day. The fruits remaining on the tree are shaken down. Only fully mature fruits are picked directly from the tree. They are transported in open bags to avoid fermentation.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.safruit.org/ziziphus_mauritiana_85.pdf |title= Joker D, SEED LEAFLET No. 85 October 2003 - Ziziphus mauritiana Lam|publisher=Danida Forest Seed Centre |date=2003-10-01 |accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref>\n\nSeedling trees bear 5,000 to 10,000 small fruits per year in India. Superior grafted trees may yield as many as 30,000 fruits. The best cultivar in India, with fruits normally averaging 30 to the lb (66 to the kg), yields 175&nbsp;lbs (77&nbsp;kg) annually.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 20th, 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder, the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses smarter. They also need to decide which enemy has to be killed firstly and how to move on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-single-player-review|title=Doom Eternal Single-Player Review|last=McCaffrey|first=Ryan|date=April 8, 2020|website=IGN|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145|title=Doom Eternal: The Kotaku Review|last=Alexandra|first=Heather|date=March 24, 2020|website=Kotaku|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-eternal-review-intelligent-inferno/1900-6417432/|title=Doom Eternal Review - Intelligent Inferno|last=Hornshaw|first=Phil|date=March 27, 2020|website=GameSpot|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCreative director Hugo Martin has stated there would be twice as many demon types as in the [[Doom (2016 video game)|2016 reboot]]. There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors. Players can also unlock a bonus weapon, the Unmaykr, after clearing six challenging Slayer Gates. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternals-hub-area-the-fortress-of-doom-has-up/1100-6472907/|title=Doom Eternal's Hub Area: The Fortress Of Doom Has Upgrades, Easter Eggs, And More|website=GameSpot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nEight months after the events of 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', Earth has been overrun by [[Demons|demonic forces]], wiping out 60% of the planet's population, under the now-corrupted Union Aerospace Corporation. What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was subjected to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deag\u2019s inducted him into the Sentinels while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy\u2019s knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. Despite knowing that it is against Sentinel law to murder Deag Grav on sacred ground, the Slayer kills him and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

It is the fifth main game in the [[Doom (franchise)|''Doom'' series]] and a direct sequel to 2016's ''[[Doom (2016 video game)|Doom]]'', and was released on March 2020, for [[Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Google Stadia|Stadia]] and [[Xbox One]], with a [[Nintendo Switch]] version planned for a release at a later date. The game received positive reviews, with praise for its campaign, graphics, level design, soundtrack and combat mechanics, while some disliked the game's increased focus on storytelling.\n\n==Gameplay==\nPlayers once again take on the role of the [[Doom Slayer]], an ancient warrior who battles the demonic forces of [[Hell]], from a [[First-person (video games)|first-person perspective]]. The game continues [[Doom (2016 video game)|its predecessor's]] emphasis on \"push-forward\" combat, encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health, ammo, and armor. The player has access to various firearms, such as the Combat Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Heavy Cannon, Rocket Launcher, Plasma Rifle, [[BFG (weapon)|BFG 9000]], and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw, the \"Crucible Blade\" [[energy sword]] and a retractable arm-blade called the \"Doomblade\" can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent \"glory kill\" executions, which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the \"Meat Hook\", a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them, functioning as a [[grappling hook]], useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer's armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. Additionally the Flame Belch is a flame thrower, which causes the enemies set on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally, killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition.<ref name=\"GIPre\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2018/08/10/a-bigger-badder-bloodier-demon-fest |title=Doom Eternal: A Bigger, Badder, Bloodier Demon Fest |last=Reiner |first=Andrew |date=August 10, 2018 |work=[[Game Informer]] |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing, dash moves, and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/doom-eternal-release-date-trailer-everything-we-know/ |title=Everything we know about Doom Eternal |first=Tom |last=Senior |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger: 15 Minutes of DOOM Eternal Gameplay|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyKppM68qs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref>\n\nLike its [[Doom (2016 video game)|predecessor]], ''Doom Eternal'' involves the player to develop simple tactics.

There are new types of enemies, such as the Marauder and Doom Hunter, while others, such as the Pain Elemental, Arachnotron, and Archvile, have been reintroduced from previous ''Doom'' entries. A new system called \"Destructible Demons\" is featured, in which enemies' bodies become progressively destroyed and deteriorated in combat as they suffer damage. Through this system, certain parts of a demon's anatomy can be destroyed to eliminate their ability to use their stronger attacks. There is also a new lives system. During gameplay, players can collect 1-up items (which look like green helmets) scattered around the environment. When the Doom Slayer perishes in combat, he will respawn where he died if he has spare lives, instead of restarting at the nearest checkpoint.\n\nThe game features several asymmetric multiplayer modes, including \"Battlemode\". This game type is a 2v1 [[Player versus player|PvP]] multi-round match where two player-controlled demons take on one fully loaded Slayer. There are five playable demons at launch, with more to be included in free updates post-launch. The five initially available demons are the Marauder, Mancubus, Pain Elemental, Revenant, and Arch Vile. In addition to regular attacks, each demon has a \"summoning wheel\", which contains a selection of four additional abilities. An additional mode, called \"Invasion\", is also in the works, and is expected to be released as a free post-launch update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wccftech.com/doom-eternal-delayed/|title=DOOM Eternal Delayed To March 2020; Invasion Mode To Come After Launch|last=Meo|first=Francesco De|date=2019-10-08|website=Wccftech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-24}}</ref> In this mode, players will be able to join others' single-player campaigns, fighting against them as demons.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-6-most-metal-things-in-the-doom-eternal-reveal/ |title=The 6 most metal things in the Doom Eternal reveal |first=Christopher |last=Livington |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=August 10, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref> This mode can be turned off by players who wish to play the game solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/doom-eternal-reveals-new-powers-puts-hell-back-on-earth/ |title=Doom Eternal ushers in idTech 7, bloody new powers |first=Sam |last=Machkovech |work=[[Ars Technica]] |date=August 11, 2018 |accessdate=August 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAlso new to the game is the hub area, called \"Fortress of Doom\", which players can visit between missions, containing a number of rooms with upgrades and gear locked behind doors.

What remains of humanity has either fled Earth or have banded together as part of ARC, a resistance movement formed to stop the invasion but have gone into hiding after suffering heavy losses. The Doom Slayer, having previously been betrayed and [[Teleportation|teleported]] away by Dr. Samuel Hayden, returns with a satellite fortress controlled by the [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] VEGA to quell the demonic invasion by killing the Hell Priests; Deags Nilox, Ranak, and Grav. The priests serve an angelic being known as the Khan Maykr who seeks to sacrifice mankind. The Slayer teleports to [[New York City]] and kills Deag Nilox, but the Khan Maykr teleports the two remaining priests to unknown locations, forcing the Slayer to continue searching.\n\nAfter retrieving a celestial locator from the Sentinel world of Exultia, the Slayer travels to [[Hell]] to retrieve a power source from a fallen Sentinel known as the Betrayer. He warns the Slayer that humanity's time has come before giving him the power source and a special dagger. VEGA directs the Slayer to a citadel in the [[Arctic]] where Deag Ranak has taken refuge, and the Slayer kills him after defeating his guardian Doom Hunters.\n\nIn response, the Khan Maykr moves Deag Grav to a hidden location and accelerates the invasion of Earth. Forced to change tactics, the Slayer destroys the Super Gore Nest in central Europe, where the invasion began. With no leads on finding the last Hell Priest, VEGA suggests finding Dr. Hayden, who knows the location of Deag Grav. The Slayer makes his way to an ARC compound where he retrieves Hayden\u2019s robot chassis as well as the Crucible before facing a Marauder, a demonic Sentinel sent to stop the Slayer. \n\nUpon uploading Hayden\u2019s mind into the fortress, he reveals Deag Grav is hiding on Sentinel Prime. With the only portal to Sentinel Prime located in the ancient city of Hebeth in Mars\u2019s core, the Slayer travels to a facility on [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] where he uses the [[BFG (weapon)| BFG 10000]] to shoot a hole in Mars and makes his way to Hebeth. After reaching Sentinel Prime, flashbacks reveal the Slayer to be [[Doomguy]]. Found badly wounded by Sentinels, Doomguy was brought before the Deags and was subjected to fight in a gladiatorial arena. Impressed by Doomguy\u2019s ruthlessness in battle, the Deag\u2019s inducted him into the Sentinels while the Khan Maykr inquires into Doomguy\u2019s knowledge of the Demons. In the present, the Slayer finds Deag Grav in the arena and defeats a massive demon known as the Gladiator. Despite knowing that it is against Sentinel law to murder Deag Grav on sacred ground, the Slayer kills him and returns to the fortress.\n\nUpon his return, the Slayer's fortress is shut down remotely by the Khan Maykr to prevent any further interference in her plans. She reveals her intentions to resurrect the demon world-eating super-predator, the [[Baphomet|Icon of Sin]], to consume mankind before having the Slayer attacked by demons. Surviving the ambush, the Slayer uses the demonic Crucible's latent Argent energy to reactivate the fortress and travels to Argent d'Nur to retrieve his own Crucible from his time in the Sentinels. \n\nFurther flashbacks reveal that during the ill fated battle of Argent d'Nur, a rogue Maykr known as [[Seraph]] had imbued Doomguy with superior abilities, transforming him into the Doom Slayer. After retrieving the hilt of the Crucible, it is revealed that the Khan Maykr formed an alliance with Hell to produce Argent energy, which is created through the mass sacrifice of human souls. In return for providing worlds for Hell to invade, the Maykrs receive a share of the Argent energy produced by Hell which allows their own dimension, Urdak, to survive.\n\nHayden directs the Slayer through Hell's massive citadel, Nekravol, until he finds a portal leading to the Urdak. He then finds the Khan Maykr and stops the ceremony by using the Betrayer's dagger to destroy the Icon\u2019s heart. Free from Maykr control, the Icon of Sin awakens from its dormant state and teleports to Earth. The Icon\u2019s awakening also breaks the alliance between the Maykrs and Demons, who proceed to invade Urdak. The Khan Maykr confronts the Slayer, saying that Urdak must destroy Earth to survive. They battle and the Slayer kills the Khan Maykr before taking a portal back to Earth to confront the Icon of Sin, although VEGA is left behind to ensure the portal stays open. After an intense battle across the cityscape, the Slayer kills the Icon of Sin by stabbing it in the head with the Crucible, putting an end to Hell\u2019s invasion of Earth.\n\n==Development and release==\nPublisher [[Bethesda Softworks]] announced the game at [[E3 2018]], with the first gameplay footage being unveiled at [[QuakeCon]] 2018.

The AUS is designed to supplement the function of the natural [[urinary sphincter]] that restricts urine flow out of the [[bladder]].\n\n==Description==\nThere are two types of artificial urinary sphincters:\n* The artificial urinary sphincter with a balloon reservoir (3-component): cuff, pump and balloon. The cuff is placed around the urethra; the pump is inserted in the scrotum and the balloon reservoir is implanted in the retropubic space \u2013 between bladder and iliac vein.

The pressure in the hydraulic circuit is generated by the spring of the pump unit.

The AUS is designed to supplement the function of the natural [[urinary sphincter]] that restricts urine flow out of the [[bladder]].\n\n==Description==\nThere are two types of artificial urinary sphincters:\n* The artificial urinary sphincter with a balloon reservoir (3-component): cuff, pump and balloon. The cuff is placed around the urethra; the pump is inserted in the scrotum and the balloon reservoir is implanted in the retropubic space \u2013 between bladder and iliac vein. The pressure in the hydraulic circuit is generated by the elastic balloon reservoir and from retropubic pressure.<ref name=\"AU\" /><ref name=\"Urodynamic\" />\n* The artificial urinary sphincter with a spring (2-component): cuff and pump unit.<ref name =\"Bauer\">{{cite journal |last1=Bauer |first1=Ricarda M. |last2=Gozzi |first2=Christian |last3=H\u00fcbner |first3=Wilhelm |last4=Nitti |first4=Victor W. |last5=Novara |first5=Giacomo |last6=Peterson |first6=Andrew |last7=Sandhu |first7=Jaspreet S. |last8=Stief |first8=Christian G. |title=Contemporary Management of Postprostatectomy Incontinence |journal=European Urology |date=June 2011 |volume=59 |issue=6 |pages=985\u2013996 |doi=10.1016/j.eururo.2011.03.020 |pmid=21458914 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0302283811002648 |accessdate=24 January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Cordon\">{{cite journal |last1=Cordon |first1=Billy H |last2=Singla |first2=Nirmish |last3=Singla |first3=Ajay K |title=Artificial urinary sphincters for male stress urinary incontinence: current perspectives |journal=Medical Devices: Evidence and Research |date=4 July 2016 |volume=2016 |issue=9 |pages=175\u2013183 |doi=10.2147/MDER.S93637 |pmid=27445509 |pmc=4938139}}</ref> The cuff is placed around the urethra and the pump unit is inserted in the [[scrotum]]. The pressure in the hydraulic circuit is generated by the spring of the pump unit. The pressure in the [[retropubic space]] does not have any influence for this type of sphincter.\n\nThe common theme among currently available designs is a mechanical constriction mechanism \u2013 an inflatable cuff filled with sterile [[Saline (medicine)|saline solution]] and placed around the [[urethra]] which keeps the urethral lumen closed; this is due to the pressure produced inside the device and an externally accessible control pump mechanism placed between two skin layers of the scrotum (subdartos pouch) which allows the user to manually relieve the constriction to allow urination.\n\n==History==\n[[File:AMS 800 and ZSI 375 artificial urinary sphincters.jpg|thumb|284px|Left to right: AMS 800 and ZSI 375]]\nFrederic Foley was the first to describe an externally worn artificial urinary sphincter to treat urinary incontinence, published in 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley |first1=Frederic E.B. |title=An Artificial Sphincter: A New Device and Operation for Control of Enuresis and Urinary Incontinence |journal=Journal of Urology |date=October 1947 |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=250\u2013259 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5347(17)69552-1 |pmid=20266239 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022534717695521 |accessdate=5 February 2020}}</ref> In 1972, F.

The sea-based tests, called Project SHAD were primarily launched from other ships such as the [[USS Granville S.

Furthermore, The Deseret Test Center was closed in the 1970s and the search for 40-year-old documents and records kept by different military services in different locations was a challenge to researchers.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" /> A fact sheet was developed for each test that was conducted and when a test cancellation was not documented, a cancellation analysis was developed outlining the logic used to presume that the test had been cancelled.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" />\n\n== Declassification ==\nThe existence of Project 112 (along with the related Project SHAD) was categorically denied by the military until May 2000, when a [[CBS News|CBS Evening News]] investigative report produced dramatic revelations about the tests. This report caused the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] to launch an extensive investigation of the experiments, and reveal to the affected personnel their exposure to toxins.\n\nRevelations concerning Project SHAD were first exposed by independent producer and investigative journalist [[Eric Longabardi]]. Longabardi's 6-year investigation into the still secret program began in early 1994. It ultimately resulted in a series of investigative reports produced by him, which were broadcast on the CBS Evening News in May 2000. After the broadcast of these exclusive reports, the Pentagon and Veteran's Administration opened their own ongoing investigations into the long classified program. In 2002, Congressional hearings on Project SHAD, in both the Senate and House, further shed media attention on the program. In 2002, a class action federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of the US sailors exposed in the testing. Additional actions, including a multi-year medical study was conducted by [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]/Institute of Medicine to assess the potential medical harm caused to the thousands of unwitting US Navy sailors, civilians, and others who were exposed in the secret testing. The results of that study were finally released in May 2007.\n\nBecause most of the participants that were involved with Project 112 and SHAD were unaware of any tests being done, no effort was made to ensure the [[informed consent]] of the military personnel.<ref>[http://www.olmstedfoundation.org/olmsted/data/attachments/e20080613.pdf Atlanta Journal-Constitution (June 13, 2008) 40. \"Cold War Test Victims Seek Aid\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195901/http://www.olmstedfoundation.org/olmsted/data/attachments/e20080613.pdf |date=January 2, 2014 }}</ref> The US Department of Defense (DoD) conducted testing of agents in other countries that were considered too unethical to perform within the continental United States. Until 1998, the Department of Defense stated officially that Project SHAD did not exist. Because the DoD refused to acknowledge the program, surviving test subjects have been unable to obtain disability payments for health issues related to the project. US Representative [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]] said of the program and the DoD's effort to conceal it, \"They told me \u2013 they said, but don't worry about it, we only used simulants. And my first thought was, well, you've lied to these guys for 40 years, you've lied to me for a couple of years.

The study cost approximately 3 million US Dollars, and results are being compiled for future release.  DoD has committed to providing the VA with the relevant information it needs to settle benefits claims as quickly and efficiently as possible and to evaluate and treat veterans who were involved in those tests. This required analyzing historical documents recording the planning and execution of Project 112/SHAD tests.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" />\n\nThe released historical information about Project 112 from DoD consists of summary fact sheets rather than original documents or maintained federal information.

The tests conducted there were aimed at both human, animal and plant reaction to BW. It is known that tests were undertaken in Cairo, Egypt, Liberia, in South Korea, and in Japan's satellite province of Okinawa in 1961, or earlier. This was at least one year prior to the creation of Project 112.  The Okinawa anti-crop research project may lend some insight to the larger projects 112 sponsored. BW experts in Okinawa and \"at several sites in the Midwest and south:\" conducted in 1961 \"field tests\" for wheat rust and rice blast disease. These tests met with \"partial success\" in the gathering of data, and led, therefore, to a significant increase in research dollars in fiscal year 1962 to conduct additional research in these areas. The money was devoted largely to developing \"technical advice on the conduct of defoliation and anti-crop activities in Southeast Asia.\" By the end of fiscal year 1962, the Chemical Corps had let or were negotiating contracts for over one thousand chemical defoliants.

Project SHAD encompassed tests designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop procedures to respond to such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" /> The Department of Defense (DoD) states that Project 112 was initiated out of concern for the ability of the United States to protect and defend against potential CB threats.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\">{{cite web | title=Project 112/SHAD \u2013 Shipboard Hazard and Defense, Force Health Protection & Readiness | url=http://mcm.dhhq.health.mil/cb_exposures/project112_shad/shad.aspx | accessdate=23 December 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726023840/http://mcm.dhhq.health.mil/cb_exposures/project112_shad/shad.aspx | archivedate=26 July 2013 }}</ref> Project 112 consisted of both land-based and sea-based tests. The sea-based tests, called Project SHAD were primarily launched from other ships such as the [[USS Granville S. Hall (YAG-40)]] and [[USS George Eastman (YAG-39)]], Army tugboats, submarines, or fighter aircraft and was designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop decontamination and other methods to counter such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" /> The classified information related to SHAD was not completely cataloged or located in one facility. Furthermore, The Deseret Test Center was closed in the 1970s and the search for 40-year-old documents and records kept by different military services in different locations was a challenge to researchers.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" /> A fact sheet was developed for each test that was conducted and when a test cancellation was not documented, a cancellation analysis was developed outlining the logic used to presume that the test had been cancelled.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" />\n\n== Declassification ==\nThe existence of Project 112 (along with the related Project SHAD) was categorically denied by the military until May 2000, when a [[CBS News|CBS Evening News]] investigative report produced dramatic revelations about the tests. This report caused the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] to launch an extensive investigation of the experiments, and reveal to the affected personnel their exposure to toxins.\n\nRevelations concerning Project SHAD were first exposed by independent producer and investigative journalist [[Eric Longabardi]]. Longabardi's 6-year investigation into the still secret program began in early 1994. It ultimately resulted in a series of investigative reports produced by him, which were broadcast on the CBS Evening News in May 2000. After the broadcast of these exclusive reports, the Pentagon and Veteran's Administration opened their own ongoing investigations into the long classified program. In 2002, Congressional hearings on Project SHAD, in both the Senate and House, further shed media attention on the program. In 2002, a class action federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of the US sailors exposed in the testing. Additional actions, including a multi-year medical study was conducted by [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]/Institute of Medicine to assess the potential medical harm caused to the thousands of unwitting US Navy sailors, civilians, and others who were exposed in the secret testing. The results of that study were finally released in May 2007.\n\nBecause most of the participants that were involved with Project 112 and SHAD were unaware of any tests being done, no effort was made to ensure the [[informed consent]] of the military personnel.<ref>[http://www.olmstedfoundation.org/olmsted/data/attachments/e20080613.pdf Atlanta Journal-Constitution (June 13, 2008) 40. \"Cold War Test Victims Seek Aid\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195901/http://www.olmstedfoundation.org/olmsted/data/attachments/e20080613.pdf |date=January 2, 2014 }}</ref> The US Department of Defense (DoD) conducted testing of agents in other countries that were considered too unethical to perform within the continental United States. Until 1998, the Department of Defense stated officially that Project SHAD did not exist. Because the DoD refused to acknowledge the program, surviving test subjects have been unable to obtain disability payments for health issues related to the project. US Representative [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]] said of the program and the DoD's effort to conceal it, \"They told me \u2013 they said, but don't worry about it, we only used simulants. And my first thought was, well, you've lied to these guys for 40 years, you've lied to me for a couple of years.

The study cost approximately 3 million US Dollars, and results are being compiled for future release.  DoD has committed to providing the VA with the relevant information it needs to settle benefits claims as quickly and efficiently as possible and to evaluate and treat veterans who were involved in those tests. This required analyzing historical documents recording the planning and execution of Project 112/SHAD tests.<ref name=\"112/SHAD\" />\n\nThe released historical information about Project 112 from DoD consists of summary fact sheets rather than original documents or maintained federal information.  As of 2003, 28 fact sheets have been released, focusing on the [[Deseret Test Center]] in [[Dugway, Utah]], which was built entirely for Project 112/SHAD and was closed after the project was finished in 1973.\n\nOriginal records are missing or incomplete.

The tests conducted there were aimed at both human, animal and plant reaction to BW. It is known that tests were undertaken in Cairo, Egypt, Liberia, in South Korea, and in Japan's satellite province of Okinawa in 1961, or earlier. This was at least one year prior to the creation of Project 112.  The Okinawa anti-crop research project may lend some insight to the larger projects 112 sponsored. BW experts in Okinawa and \"at several sites in the Midwest and south:\" conducted in 1961 \"field tests\" for wheat rust and rice blast disease. These tests met with \"partial success\" in the gathering of data, and led, therefore, to a significant increase in research dollars in fiscal year 1962 to conduct additional research in these areas. The money was devoted largely to developing \"technical advice on the conduct of defoliation and anti-crop activities in Southeast Asia.\" By the end of fiscal year 1962, the Chemical Corps had let or were negotiating contracts for over one thousand chemical defoliants.
