He was aged between 30 and 45 years, remarkably old for a Neanderthal. Shanidar 1 had a cranial capacity of 1,600 cm<sup>3</sup>, was around the height of 5 feet 7 inches, and displayed severe signs of deformity.<ref name=\":12\">Lewis, R. Barry., et al. ''Understanding Humans: Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology''. Wadsworth, 2013.</ref> He was one of four reasonably complete skeletons from the cave which displayed trauma-related abnormalities, which in his case would have been debilitating to the point of making day-to-day life painful.\n\nDuring the course of the individual\u2019s life, he had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. Research by J\u00e1n Lietava shows that the individual exhibits \u201catypically worn teeth\u201d.<ref name=\":22\">{{cite journal|jstor=44602496|url=http://puvodni.mzm.cz/Anthropologie/downloads/articles/1988/Lietava_1988_p183-196.pdf|title=A Differential Diagnostics of the Right Shoulder Girdle Deformity in the Shanidar I Neanderthal|journal=Anthropologie |volume=26|issue=3|pages=183\u2013196|last1=Lietava|first1=J\u00e1n|year=1988}}</ref> Severe changes to the individuals incisors and a flattened capitulum show additional evidence towards Shanidar 1 suffering from a degenerative disease. Additionally, analysis shows that Shanidar 1 likely suffered from profound hearing loss, as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by exostoses. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places. A fracture of the individual\u2019s C5 vertebrae is thought to have caused damage to his muscle function (specifically the deltoids and biceps) of the right arm<ref name=\":22\" />. Shanidar 1 healed, but this caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma, or due to an amputation later in his life. The sharp point caused by a distal fracture of the individual's right humerus points towards this theory of amputation. \u00a0If the arm was amputated, this demonstrates one of the earliest signs of surgery on a living individual. The arm had healed, but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his lower legs and feet. Studies show that this individual had suffered from two broken legs<ref name=\":12\" />. This would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp. These findings in Shanidar 1\u2019s skeleton propose that he was unlikely to be able to provide for himself in a Neandertal society<ref name=\":22\" />.\n\nMore recent analysis of Shanidar 1 by [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] Professor Erik Trinkaus and Dr. S\u00e9bastien Villotte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research confirm that bony growths in his ear canals would have resulted in extensive hearing loss. These bony growths support a diagnosis of [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]] (DISH), also known as Forestier's disease. This diagnosis would make Shanidar 1 the oldest hominin specimen clearly presenting this systemic condition.The researchers found these bone growths in multiple places all over the partial skeleton. <ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1463085|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330890402|title=Shanidar 1: A case of hyperostotic disease (DISH) in the middle Paleolithic|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=89|issue=4|pages=411\u2013420|year=1992|last1=Crub\u00e9zy|first1=Eric|last2=Trinkaus|first2=Erik}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the healing of his injuries, Shanidar 1 lived a substantial amount of time before his death. If the Neandertals did perform surgery on Shanidar 1, this proves that their methods were successful in sustaining life. Considering that all the injuries were healed during this time period may lead to the reasoning that this individual was kept alive for a reason. According to paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, Shanidar must have been aided by others in order to survive his injuries<ref name=\":12\" />. Due to all of the injuries and side effects of trauma, it was very unlikely that this individual could provide for his family or contribute to society in a meaningful way. With that being said, this individual may have been kept alive due to a high status within society or a repository of cultural knowledge.\n\nThis leads us to believe that the Neandertals had some sort of altruistic characteristics with the possibility of the presence of ethos within the Neandertal community. The discovery of stone tools found in proximity to these individuals allows us to deduce that the Neandertals exhibited enough intelligence to make everyday life easier themselves. Maybe this knowledge surpasses basic comprehension to include characteristics such as humility and compassion which have the most known presence in ''Homo sapiens''<ref name=\":12\" />. These individuals may have had the capacity to show empathy to others and come to the understanding that life has meaning - causing them to want to help Shanidar 1.\n\n=== Shanidar 2 ===\nShanidar 2 was a Neanderthal male around the age of 30 who suffered from slight arthritis, found lying on his right side. It is estimated that Shanidar 2 was 5 feet 2 inches in stature which places him just below the average height of a male neanderthal. He was killed by rocks falling from the cave\u2019s ceiling, which crushed his skull and bones significantly. The skull had been compressed by about 5-6 cm. Much of his bones were missing when discovered, and the left tibia had teeth marks. Scavengers likely disposed of parts of his remains.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=986524|title=The Neanderthal Skeletal Remains from Shanidar Cave, Iraq: A Summary of Findings to Date|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=121|issue=2|pages=121\u2013165|last1=Stewart|first1=T. D.|year=1977}}</ref> There is evidence that Shanidar 2 was given a ritual send-off: a small pile of stones with some worked stone points (made out of [[chert]]) were found on top of his grave. Also, there had been a large fire by the burial site.<ref>T. D. Stewart, The Skull of Shanidar II, Sumer, vol. 17, pp. 97-106, 1961</ref>\n\nShanidar 2 had a \"higher cranial vault\", and other skull proportions that did not quite match up to the average Neanderthal skull. This may prove that the Neanderthals of Shanidar had more of a \"morphology of anatomically modern humans\" than other Neanderthals, or that the group was very diverse. This points to similarities between the two species, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, but it doesn\u2019t show any inherit \"relationships within that species\".<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.academia.edu/4862544|title=The Shanidar Neanderthal crania|editor-last=Stringer|editor-first=C.B.|encyclopedia=Aspects of Human Evolution|pages= 129\u2013165|last1=Stringer|first1=C.B.|last2=Trinkaus|first2=E.}}</ref>\n\n=== Shanidar 3 ===\n[[File:Shanidar Cave - overview.jpg|thumb|Inside the Shanidar Cave]]\nShanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, found in the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url = http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/3d-collection/neanderthal-shanidar-3|title = Neanderthal (Shanidar 3)|date = 2013-02-14|accessdate = 17 October 2014|website = The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program|publisher = The Smithsonian Institution}}</ref> A wound to the left 9th rib suggests that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a sharp implement.

Routine [[soil sample]]s from around the body, gathered for [[pollen]] analysis in an attempt to reconstruct the [[palaeoclimate]] and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered by [[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]] in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire [[flowering plant]]s (or at least heads of plants) had been part of the grave deposit.<ref>[[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]], Shanidar et ses fleurs, Pal\u00e9orient, vol. 24, pp. 79-88, 1998</ref> Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. [[Achillea millefolium|Yarrow]], [[Centaurea cyanus|cornflower]], [[Bachelor's buttons|bachelor's button]], [[Centaurea solstitialis|St Barnaby's thistle]], [[Senecio|ragwort]], [[Muscari|grape hyacinth]],  [[Equisetum|horsetail]] and [[Alcea|hollyhock]] were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have been traditionally used, as [[diuretic]]s, [[stimulant]]s, and [[astringent]]s and [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0378-8741(92)90023-K|pmid=1548898|title=Medicinal plants in a Middle Paleolithic grave Shanidar IV?|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=263\u2013266|year=1992|last1=Lietava|first1=Jan}}</ref> This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had [[shamanism|shamanic powers]], perhaps acting as [[medicine man]] to the Shanidar Neandertals.<ref>T.

The jird is known to store large numbers of seeds and flowers at certain points in their burrows and this argument was used in conjunction with the lack of ritual treatment of the rest of the skeletons in the cave to suggest that the Shanidar 4 burial had natural, not cultural, origins.<ref>D.J.

Pettitt]] has stated that the \"deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated\", noting that \"A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent ''Meriones persicus'', which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today\". Despite his conclusions that flowers were unlikely to have been deliberately placed, Petitt nevertheless concludes that the Shanidar burials, because they happened over so many years, represent a deliberate mortuary practice by Neanderthals.<ref>The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in Middle Paleolithic Eurasia.

He was aged between 30 and 45 years, remarkably old for a Neanderthal. Shanidar 1 had a cranial capacity of 1,600 cm<sup>3</sup>, was around the height of 5 feet 7 inches, and displayed severe signs of deformity.<ref name=\":12\">Lewis, R. Barry., et al. ''Understanding Humans: Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology''. Wadsworth, 2013.</ref> He was one of four reasonably complete skeletons from the cave which displayed trauma-related abnormalities, which in his case would have been debilitating to the point of making day-to-day life painful.\n\nDuring the course of the individual\u2019s life, he had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. Research by J\u00e1n Lietava shows that the individual exhibits \u201catypically worn teeth\u201d.<ref name=\":22\">{{cite journal|jstor=44602496|url=http://puvodni.mzm.cz/Anthropologie/downloads/articles/1988/Lietava_1988_p183-196.pdf|title=A Differential Diagnostics of the Right Shoulder Girdle Deformity in the Shanidar I Neanderthal|journal=Anthropologie |volume=26|issue=3|pages=183\u2013196|last1=Lietava|first1=J\u00e1n|year=1988}}</ref> Severe changes to the individuals incisors and a flattened capitulum show additional evidence towards Shanidar 1 suffering from a degenerative disease. Additionally, analysis shows that Shanidar 1 likely suffered from profound hearing loss, as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by exostoses. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places. A fracture of the individual\u2019s C5 vertebrae is thought to have caused damage to his muscle function (specifically the deltoids and biceps) of the right arm<ref name=\":22\" />. Shanidar 1 healed, but this caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma, or due to an amputation later in his life. The sharp point caused by a distal fracture of the individual's right humerus points towards this theory of amputation. \u00a0If the arm was amputated, this demonstrates one of the earliest signs of surgery on a living individual. The arm had healed, but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his lower legs and feet. Studies show that this individual had suffered from two broken legs<ref name=\":12\" />. This would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp. These findings in Shanidar 1\u2019s skeleton propose that he was unlikely to be able to provide for himself in a Neandertal society<ref name=\":22\" />.\n\nMore recent analysis of Shanidar 1 by [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] Professor Erik Trinkaus and Dr. S\u00e9bastien Villotte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research confirm that bony growths in his ear canals would have resulted in extensive hearing loss. These bony growths support a diagnosis of [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]] (DISH), also known as Forestier's disease. This diagnosis would make Shanidar 1 the oldest hominin specimen clearly presenting this systemic condition.The researchers found these bone growths in multiple places all over the partial skeleton. <ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1463085|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330890402|title=Shanidar 1: A case of hyperostotic disease (DISH) in the middle Paleolithic|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=89|issue=4|pages=411\u2013420|year=1992|last1=Crub\u00e9zy|first1=Eric|last2=Trinkaus|first2=Erik}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the healing of his injuries, Shanidar 1 lived a substantial amount of time before his death. If the Neandertals did perform surgery on Shanidar 1, this proves that their methods were successful in sustaining life. Considering that all the injuries were healed during this time period may lead to the reasoning that this individual was kept alive for a reason. According to paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, Shanidar must have been aided by others in order to survive his injuries<ref name=\":12\" />. Due to all of the injuries and side effects of trauma, it was very unlikely that this individual could provide for his family or contribute to society in a meaningful way. With that being said, this individual may have been kept alive due to a high status within society or a repository of cultural knowledge.\n\nThis leads us to believe that the Neandertals had some sort of altruistic characteristics with the possibility of the presence of ethos within the Neandertal community. The discovery of stone tools found in proximity to these individuals allows us to deduce that the Neandertals exhibited enough intelligence to make everyday life easier themselves. Maybe this knowledge surpasses basic comprehension to include characteristics such as humility and compassion which have the most known presence in ''Homo sapiens''<ref name=\":12\" />. These individuals may have had the capacity to show empathy to others and come to the understanding that life has meaning - causing them to want to help Shanidar 1.\n\n=== Shanidar 2 ===\nShanidar 2 was a Neanderthal male around the age of 30 who suffered from slight arthritis, found lying on his right side. It is estimated that Shanidar 2 was 5 feet 2 inches in stature which places him just below the average height of a male neanderthal. He was killed by rocks falling from the cave\u2019s ceiling, which crushed his skull and bones significantly. The skull had been compressed by about 5-6 cm. Much of his bones were missing when discovered, and the left tibia had teeth marks. Scavengers likely disposed of parts of his remains.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=986524|title=The Neanderthal Skeletal Remains from Shanidar Cave, Iraq: A Summary of Findings to Date|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=121|issue=2|pages=121\u2013165|last1=Stewart|first1=T. D.|year=1977}}</ref> There is evidence that Shanidar 2 was given a ritual send-off: a small pile of stones with some worked stone points (made out of [[chert]]) were found on top of his grave. Also, there had been a large fire by the burial site.<ref>T. D. Stewart, The Skull of Shanidar II, Sumer, vol. 17, pp. 97-106, 1961</ref>\n\nShanidar 2 had a \"higher cranial vault\", and other skull proportions that didn't quite match up to the average Neanderthal skull. This may prove that the Neanderthals of Shanidar had more of a \"morphology of anatomically modern humans\" than other Neanderthals, or that the group was very diverse. This points to similarities between the two species, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, but it doesn\u2019t show any inherit \"relationships within that species\".<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.academia.edu/4862544|title=The Shanidar Neanderthal crania|editor-last=Stringer|editor-first=C.B.|encyclopedia=Aspects of Human Evolution|pages= 129\u2013165|last1=Stringer|first1=C.B.|last2=Trinkaus|first2=E.}}</ref>\n\n=== Shanidar 3 ===\n[[File:Shanidar Cave - overview.jpg|thumb|Inside the Shanidar Cave]]\nShanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, found in the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url = http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/3d-collection/neanderthal-shanidar-3|title = Neanderthal (Shanidar 3)|date = 2013-02-14|accessdate = 17 October 2014|website = The Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program|publisher = The Smithsonian Institution}}</ref> A wound to the left 9th rib suggests that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a sharp implement.

Routine [[soil sample]]s from around the body, gathered for [[pollen]] analysis in an attempt to reconstruct the [[palaeoclimate]] and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered by [[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]] in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire [[flowering plant]]s (or at least heads of plants) had been part of the grave deposit.<ref>[[Arlette Leroi-Gourhan]], Shanidar et ses fleurs, Pal\u00e9orient, vol. 24, pp. 79-88, 1998</ref> Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. [[Achillea millefolium|Yarrow]], [[Centaurea cyanus|cornflower]], [[Bachelor's buttons|bachelor's button]], [[Centaurea solstitialis|St Barnaby's thistle]], [[Senecio|ragwort]], [[Muscari|grape hyacinth]],  [[Equisetum|horsetail]] and [[Alcea|hollyhock]] were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have been traditionally used, as [[diuretic]]s, [[stimulant]]s, and [[astringent]]s and [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatories]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0378-8741(92)90023-K|pmid=1548898|title=Medicinal plants in a Middle Paleolithic grave Shanidar IV?|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|volume=35|issue=3|pages=263\u2013266|year=1992|last1=Lietava|first1=Jan}}</ref> This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had [[shamanism|shamanic powers]], perhaps acting as [[medicine man]] to the Shanidar Neandertals.<ref>T.

The jird is known to store large numbers of seeds and flowers at certain points in their burrows and this argument was used in conjunction with the lack of ritual treatment of the rest of the skeletons in the cave to suggest that the Shanidar 4 burial had natural, not cultural, origins.<ref>D.J.

Pettitt]] has stated that the \"deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated\", noting that \"A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent ''Meriones persicus'', which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today\". Despite his conclusions that flowers were unlikely to have been deliberately placed, Petitt nevertheless concludes that the Shanidar burials, because they happened over so many years, represent a deliberate mortuary practice by Neanderthals.<ref>The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in Middle Paleolithic Eurasia.

On their debut album, the song \"Suicide Landscape\" became a number one hit on the [[World Gothic Charts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gothicera.com/2007.htm |title=Global Gothic Chart \u2013 Top of the year 2007 |website=Gothicera.com}}</ref> For this song, a video was shot at the [[San Bernardino Pass]] which was played on [[Viva (TV station)|VIVA]] (MTV Europe) and put into rotation on [[Schweizer Fernsehen]].\n\nIn the spring of 2008, they were the supporting act for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] in the Zurich [[Hallenstadion]]. In May, they played at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] in [[Leipzig]].\nAfter a tour with the German rock band [[ASP (band)|ASP]] and some concerts in [[England]], they completed their second album ''A Stranger to Tears''. It was released in Switzerland under their own label tBoG Music, and in Austria and Germany with [[Danse Macabre Records]], the label of [[Bruno Kramm]] of [[Das Ich]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Imhof |first=Nicole | url=http://www.art-noir.ch/art-noir/interview-mit-michael-sele-the-beauty-of-gemina.htm |title=Interview mit Michael Sele \u2013 The Beauty Of Gemina |website=Art-noir.ch |language=German |date=2008-09-27 |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> The video for the song \"This Time\" was again aired on [[Viva (TV station)#VIVA Switzerland|VIVA Switzerland]] and Schweizer Fernsehen.

Influences include [[techno]]/[[trance music|trance]] (\"Victims of Love\", \"Shadow Dancer\" and \"Galilee Song\") and [[gothic rock]]/[[dark wave]] (guitar on \"This Time\") that could already be seen in Michael Sele's predecessor band Nuuk.\n\nFor their third album ''At The End Of The Sea'', The Beauty of Gemina added more guitars to the foreground, including [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[post-punk]] sounds of the 1980s (for example, in \"Obscura\", \"Rumours\" and \"Narcotica\") and alternative rock riffs from the 1990s in such songs as \"Black Cat Nights\" and \"Counting Tears\". However, their music still features the fusion of different genres of rock and electronic dance music. For instance, \"King's Men Come\", \"Narcotica\" and \"La Mer \u2013 Rythme Eternel\" have [[breakbeat]] and [[trip hop]] rhythms, while \"In Silence\" features a typical [[techno]] beat from a [[Roland TR-909]] bass drum.\n\nWhen the band released ''Iscariot Blues'' in 2012, the album saw a shift in musical style that would later be developed on subsequent releases. This album saw an increased reliance on acoustic guitar and a sparser, lighter atmosphere. Songs such as \"Stairs\" and \"Badlands\" fused elements of folk and blues to their established sound, and Michael Sele's arrangements began to mature. This diverse approach was fully realised on 2016's ''Minor Sun'', which drew on every facet of the band's sound. 2018's ''Flying With the Owl'' pushed the band further from its roots into semi-acoustic territory.\n\nOn 6 December 2019, the band announced its eighth album, ''Skeleton Dreams'', via social media with a release date of 4 September 2020. The band will support the release with a series of European tour dates.\n\n== Lyrics ==\nMichael Sele's lyrics deal with issues such as suicide, depression, loneliness and heartache. He has also criticized the Catholic Church, specifically by releasing the songs \"Victims of Love\" and \"Galilee Song\" as free downloads during Easter 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.imscheinwerfer.ch/index.php?option=com_k2&view=item&id=154:michael-sele-beauty-of-gemina-im-gespraech&Itemid=179 |title=Michael Sele (Beauty of Gemina) \u2013 im Gespr\u00e4ch |newspaper=Imscheinwerfer |date=May 5, 2009 |first=Janosch |last=Tr\u00f6hler | first2=Cornelius |last2=Fischer |language=German |quote=Sele: \u201eDie Beweggr\u00fcnde waren einmal mehr die Negativschlagzeilen um den Papst.
