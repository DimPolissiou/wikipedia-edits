Young Jericho witnessed his father shot and killed in his own front hall by two gunmen. In his father's right hand was his pocket watch, which Jericho now keeps with him constantly. In the series, Jericho carries on a private feud with a local crime boss, whom Jericho believes, but cannot prove, either brought about his father's death or knew who had him killed; the boss in turn has suborned a thuggish [[Scotland Yard]] Inspector named Christie to hound Jericho by planting scandal sheets under his nose about his father being a \"corrupt policeman\" or by implying Jericho has a less than professional relationship with his downstairs neighbour &ndash; a French prostitute. Jericho's mother is still alive, although they are only seen meeting in the cemetery on the anniversary of his father's death.\n\nJericho served in World War II. Besides his off again-on again relationship with his downstairs neighbour, he is a workaholic who sleeps poorly. He has a faithful secretary, a tough sergeant, a younger DI assistant, and, as [[comic relief]], an informer who is a street fence. The last episode, \"The Hollow Men\", features in-jokes about the TV industry: a director replaces Jericho with a comic actor, starring as Jericho in a fictionalized series of Jericho's Scotland Yard cases; at a banquet meeting of police widows and orphans, Christie tries to get Jericho as the [[master of ceremonies]] after guest speaker [[Benny Hill]] can't come.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Lindsay (actor)|Robert Lindsay]] \u2014 DI Michael Jericho\n* [[David Troughton]] \u2014 Sgt Clive Harvey \n* [[Ciar\u00e1n McMenamin]] \u2014 DC John Caldicott\n* [[Nicholas Jones (actor)|Nicholas Jones]] \u2014 AC Graham Cherry\n* [[Kellie Bright]] \u2014 WPC Penny Collins \n* [[Eve Matheson]] \u2014 Rita Harvey \n* [[Lee Ross (actor)|Lee Ross]] \u2014 Louis Jackson\n* [[Lydia Leonard]] \u2014 Angela \n* Aur\u00e9lie Barg\u00e8me \u2014 Juliette\n\n==Episodes==\nThree of the four episode titles are derived from poems by [[T.

It has been the summer home of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] since 1937.  Tanglewood is also home to three music schools: the [[Tanglewood Music Center]], Days in the Arts and the [[Boston University Tanglewood Institute]]. Besides classical music, Tanglewood hosts the Festival of Contemporary Music, jazz and popular artists, concerts, and frequent appearances by [[James Taylor]], [[John Williams]], and the [[Boston Pops Orchestra|Boston Pops]].\n\n==First seasons, 1934 and 1935==\n[[File:Tanglewood Music Shed and Lawn, Lenox, MA.JPG|thumb|right|Tanglewood Music Shed and lawn]]\n[[File:Seiji Ozawa Hall (exterior), Tanglewood, Lenox, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|right|Seiji Ozawa Hall]]\n\nThe history of Tanglewood begins with a series of concerts held on August 23, 25 and 26, 1934 at the [[Old Curtisville Historic District|Interlaken]] estate of Daniel Hanna, about a mile from today\u2019s festival site.  A few months earlier, composer and conductor [[Henry Kimball Hadley]] had scouted the Berkshires for a site and support for his dream of establishing a seasonal classical music festival.  He found an enthusiastic and capable patron in [[Gertrude Robinson Smith]].  Within a few months they had organized a series of concerts featuring the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], where Hadley once had been the Associate Conductor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://images.skem1.com/client_id_25308/Article_from_Berkshire_Magazine_Issue_August-September_1990.pdf |title=Berkshire Magazine, Madame Chairman |accessdate=December 19, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141754/http://images.skem1.com/client_id_25308/Article_from_Berkshire_Magazine_Issue_August-September_1990.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2015 }}</ref> Staged in an amphitheater built on the estate's show horse ring, the first concert was attended by [[Sara Roosevelt|Sara Delano Roosevelt]], the President's mother.

In 1940 conductor Serge Koussevitzky initiated a summer school for approximately 300 young musicians, now known as the [[Tanglewood Music Center]].  Also, nearby is the [[Boston University Tanglewood Institute]] (BUTI) for high school students and Days in the Arts (DARTs) for middle school students. Other youth-symphony organizations have performed at either the Music Shed or Ozawa Hall, including the Norwalk Youth Symphony, from [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], the [[Empire State Youth Orchestra]], from [[Albany, New York]], and the Greater Boston Youth Symphony (currently known as the Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras).\n\n==BSO and Tanglewood music directors==\n* [[Serge Koussevitzky]] (1936\u20131949)\n* [[Charles Munch (conductor)|Charles Munch]] (1949\u20131962)\n* [[Erich Leinsdorf]] (1962\u20131969)\n* [[William Steinberg]] (1969\u20131972)\n* [[Seiji Ozawa]] (1973\u20132002)\n* [[James Levine]] (2004\u20132011)\n* [[Andris Nelsons]] (2014\u2013present)\n\n== Facilities ==\n{{multiple image\n | align  = right\n | direction  = vertical\n |image1  = BostonPopsAtTanglewood.JPG\n |caption1  = [[Boston Pops]] preparing to play under the direction of [[John Williams]] in the Shed\n |image2  = Tanglewood OzawaHall July 2009.jpg\n |caption2  = Ozawa Hall before a concert\n |width  = 180}}\n* The '''Koussevitzky Music Shed''' was inaugurated in 1938, with major acoustic refurbishment made in 1959.

Seiji Ozawa Hall has received numerous awards for its architecture, including a National American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Interior Architecture (2000) and a National American Institute of Architects Honor Award for Architecture (1995).

Wampler contributed to the DIY community via email exchanges that at times took up hours of each evening. In a move designed to professionalize his work, Wampler eventually self-published a series of books on guitar pedal design that he represents as helping launch the career of several popular boutique guitar pedal builders.<ref name=\":6\" /> In this early phase of the company's development, Brian Wampler operated under the name Indyguitarist.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2007, the company began to operate under the Wampler Pedals name.\n\nThe company and its founder have participated in the DIY community by writing articles for ''[[Premier Guitar]]'' and hosting a [[podcast]] on guitar gear, Chasing Tone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/mxr-distortion-plus-mods-1 |title=MXR Distortion Plus Mods |date=November 26, 2008 |last=Wampler |first=Brian |website=premierguitar.com |access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/13562-diy-mods-to-perfect-your-ibanez-ts9-and-boss-sd-1 |title=5 DIY Mods to Perfect Your Ibanez TS9 and Boss SD-1 |date=September 6, 2012 |last=Wampler |first=Brian |website=premierguitar.com |access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/chasing-tone-guitar-podcast-about-gear-effects-amps/id891802835?mt=2 |title=Chasing Tone - Guitar Podcast About Gear, Effects, Amps and Tone by Wampler Pedals on Apple Podcasts |website=itunes.apple.com |access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> The company also regularly posts blogs on gear-related topics as part of a larger content-strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wamplerpedals.com/wamplerblog/itemlist |title=News / Blog - Wampler Pedals |website=wamplerpedals.com |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.martechadvisor.com/amp/articles/content-experience/3-small-brands-big-content-experiences/ |title=3 Small Brands \u2014 Big Content Experiences |website=martechadvisor.com |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Design and fabrication process ==\nMirroring the founder-oriented approach of other boutique pedal designers such as EarthQuaker Devices,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/tone-makers-earthquaker-devices-jamie-stillman-the-way-i-voice-the-pedals-is-just-how-i-like-a-guitar-to-sound |title=Tone makers - EarthQuaker Devices' Jamie Stillman: \"The way I voice the pedals is just how I like a guitar to sound\" |date=March 29, 2018 |website=musicradar.com |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref> Wampler pedals are primarily designed by Brian Wampler himself, and the design process can range from a few days to several years of development time on a [[breadboard]]. Once the breadboard design is finalized, the company generates prototypes that are distributed for testing before the design is finalized and produced.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nUnlike similar boutique manufacturers such as [[JHS Pedals]], [[Keeley Electronics]], and EarthQuaker Devices, Wampler Pedals does not produce their pedals on-site at their company headquarters.

Wampler contributed to the DIY community via email exchanges that at times took up hours of each evening. In a move designed to professionalize his work, Wampler eventually self-published a series of books on guitar pedal design that he represents as helping launch the career of several popular boutique guitar pedal builders.<ref name=\":6\" /> In this early phase of the company's development, Brian Wampler operated under the name Indyguitarist.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2007, the company began to operate under the Wampler Pedals name.\n\nThe company and its founder have participated in the DIY community by writing articles for ''[[Premier Guitar]]'' and hosting a [[podcast]] on guitar gear, Chasing Tone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/mxr-distortion-plus-mods-1 |title=MXR Distortion Plus Mods |date=November 26, 2008 |last=Wampler |first=Brian |website=premierguitar.com |access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/13562-diy-mods-to-perfect-your-ibanez-ts9-and-boss-sd-1 |title=5 DIY Mods to Perfect Your Ibanez TS9 and Boss SD-1 |date=September 6, 2012 |last=Wampler |first=Brian |website=premierguitar.com |access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/chasing-tone-guitar-podcast-about-gear-effects-amps/id891802835?mt=2 |title=Chasing Tone - Guitar Podcast About Gear, Effects, Amps and Tone by Wampler Pedals on Apple Podcasts |website=itunes.apple.com |access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> The company also regularly posts blogs on gear-related topics as part of a larger content-strategy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wamplerpedals.com/wamplerblog/itemlist |title=News / Blog - Wampler Pedals |website=wamplerpedals.com |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.martechadvisor.com/amp/articles/content-experience/3-small-brands-big-content-experiences/ |title=3 Small Brands \u2014 Big Content Experiences |website=martechadvisor.com |access-date=March 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Design and fabrication process ==\nMirroring the founder-oriented approach of other boutique pedal designers such as EarthQuaker Devices,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/tone-makers-earthquaker-devices-jamie-stillman-the-way-i-voice-the-pedals-is-just-how-i-like-a-guitar-to-sound |title=Tone makers - EarthQuaker Devices' Jamie Stillman: \"The way I voice the pedals is just how I like a guitar to sound\" |date=March 29, 2018 |website=musicradar.com |access-date=February 28, 2019}}</ref> Wampler pedals are primarily designed by Brian Wampler himself, and the design process can range from a few days to several years of development time on a [[breadboard]]. Once the breadboard design is finalized, the company generates prototypes that are distributed for testing before the design is finalized and produced.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nUnlike similar boutique manufacturers such as [[JHS Pedals]], [[Keeley Electronics]], and EarthQuaker Devices, Wampler Pedals does not produce their pedals on-site at their company headquarters.
