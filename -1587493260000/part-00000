At the age of six, he moved with his family to [[Virginia]] where he grew up. At the age of eight, he began singing in church and learning to play piano by ear.

I just loved it, loved everything about it, loved being in front of people playing music.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\nWhile studying art at [[Ohio University]], he became a fixture at local clubs, playing with a variety of rock, folk, and blues bands.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\n==Music career==\nIn 1967, he and his band moved to Boston and played clubs throughout New England. With [[Joe Dolce]] on lead guitar, they played cover tunes as well as their own country blues originals under various names, including the Headstone Circus, St. James Doorknob, and the Finite Minds, and they made an album for [[Metromedia Records]] as Sugar Creek.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Edwards left the band and began performing as a solo acoustic artist. He would later recall:\n{{quote|I liked the sound of bronze strings on rosewood better than steel strings on magnets, and so I walked out of that club in Vermont, rented myself a van and PA system, and started traveling around the colleges in New England by myself, without gigs, just setting up in the lobbies of dormitories on a Saturday.  Pretty soon I started getting a following.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\n\nEdwards began opening up for acts such as the [[Allman Brothers Band]] and [[B.B. King]]. He signed with [[Capricorn Records]] to record his first album, ''[[Jonathan Edwards (album)|Jonathan Edwards]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \n{{quote|We took about a year recording the first album\u2014different times, different studios, different sounds, different techniques. Recording was so new in '69 and '70. There was a song on the album called 'Please Find Me', and for some reason the engineer rolled over it. It got erased. We spent hours looking for it. We fired the engineer and put \"[[Sunshine (Jonathan Edwards song)|Sunshine]]\" in its place.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\n\nLike most of the songs on ''Jonathan Edwards'', \"Sunshine\" was written shortly after Edwards left the band. \"I felt really fresh, really liberated,\" he later recalled. \"I just went out in the woods every day with my bottle of wine and guitar, sat by a lake near Boston and wrote down all those tunes, day after day.\" Regarding the theme of \"Sunshine\", Edwards commented, \"It was just at the time of the Vietnam War and Nixon. It was looking bad out there. That song meant a lot to a lot of people during that time\u2014especially me.\"<ref name=\"je\"/> \"Sunshine\" reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in January 1972.<ref name=\"golden-discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 292] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the release of his debut album, Edwards moved out of the city to a farm in western Massachusetts, which provided the rural, country inspiration for his second album, ''Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy'' on the [[Atlantic Records]] label. This was an album of mostly self-penned acoustic, country-flavored songs about love and life and was closely followed by ''Have a Good Time For Me'', also on Atlantic.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn 1973 he and his friends got together to record a live album for his fans called ''Lucky Day'', named after a song he wrote in the truck on his way up to live in Nova Scotia. This \"fresh-air break\" lasted only a couple of months, when his old friend [[Emmylou Harris]] invited him to Los Angeles to sing backup on her ''[[Elite Hotel]]'' album. That led to a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and two albums produced by Harris' husband/producer [[Brian Ahern (producer)|Brian Ahern]]: ''Rockin' Chair'' and ''Sailboat''.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn 1979, Edwards moved back to the United States to [[New Hampshire]], and then two years later back to Northern Virginia area where he had grown up. In 1983, he produced and recorded ''Blue Ridge'' with the bluegrass band, [[The Seldom Scene]], for [[Sugar Hill Records]]. Then in 1987 he recorded a children's album, ''Little Hands'', which was released on the small independent American Melody label. It was selected by the [[American Library Association]] as a Notable Children's Recording.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nTurning to acting, Edwards toured as the lead in the Broadway musical ''[[Pump Boys and Dinettes]]''. When the show reached Nashville, he met an old friend from the folk circuit, Wendy Waldman.<ref name=\"Appleseed Edwards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.appleseedmusic.com/jonathanedwards/ |title=Jonathan Edwards |authorlink=[[Appleseed Recordings]] |publisher=Appleseed Recordings |accessdate=2018-04-13 }}</ref> She and Mike Robertson convinced Edwards to come to town and record a country album. \"I've been making country-sounding records all my life, but never in Nashville. Yeah, let's do it.\" Edwards said. So, ''[[Natural Thing (Jonathan Edwards album)|Natural Thing]]'' was produced, recorded, and released on MCA/Curb Records in 1989. \"I was crazy about the songs we selected from those great Nashville writers, and the acoustic-based production that Wendy and I put together was just a joy to make and to listen to. I count that as one of the best albums I've ever been involved with.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/de/music/Jonathan+Edwards/+wiki|title=Alter, Heimatstadt, Biografie von Jonathan Edwards|website=Last.fm|language=de|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, Edwards continued to tour, doing session work, and producing his own music as well as that of other talents, such as [[Cheryl Wheeler]] (\"Driving Home,\" \"Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar\"). He took part in the 1994 \"Back to the Future\" tour that also included [[Don McLean]], [[Tom Rush]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Steve Forbert]] and [[Al Stewart]]. In 1994 he released ''One Day Closer'', his first solo album in five years, on his new record label, Rising Records. ''Man in the Moon'', which includes several of Edwards' original songs, followed the end of 1997. In September 1997, Rising Records released a remixed, re-sequenced ''Among Us'', a CD by [[Simon Townshend]], younger brother of the Who's [[Pete Townshend]]. Edwards also scored the soundtrack for ''The Mouse'', starring [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-mouse-1200447610/|title=The Mouse|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|last2=Harvey|first2=Dennis|date=1996-11-18|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Michael Martin Murphey and Jonathan Edwards 2012.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Jonathan Edwards, Michael Martin Murphey, and Gary Roller at The Flying Monkey, Plymouth, New Hampshire, October 13, 2012]]\nIn 2001, Edwards celebrated thirty years of \"Sunshine\" with a First Annual Farewell Tour with [[Kenny White]] on piano. In the 2000s, Edwards narrated and performed in a travel series for Media Artists entitled ''Cruising America's Waterways'',<ref>[http://www.cruisingamerica.com ''Cruising America's Waterways'']</ref> which was purchased by [[PBS]]. Media Artists also released a companion album. Edwards participated in a second series, which started running on PBS-TV stations in May 2004.\n\nIn 2008, Edwards appeared in the romantic comedy film ''[[The Golden Boys]]'', starring [[Bruce Dern]], [[David Carradine]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Mariel Hemingway]], and [[Rip Torn]]. Set in Cape Cod in 1905, the film featured Edwards in the role of Reverend Perley. In addition to acting, Edwards scored the film.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nHe continues to tour. In the fall of 2012, he appeared with [[Michael Martin Murphey]] in a series of concerts throughout New England.\n\nJonathan continues to tour both solo and with band members Tom Snow, Rick Brodsky, Rob Duquette and Joe K.

At the age of six, he moved with his family to [[Virginia]] where he grew up. At the age of eight, he began singing in church and learning to play piano by ear. While attending military school, he began playing guitar and composing his own songs.<ref name=\"je\">{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Donna |title=Jonathan Edwards Biography |publisher=Jonathan Edwards |url=http://www.jonathanedwards.net/general/presskit-biography.php |accessdate=October 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104124900/http://www.jonathanedwards.net/general/presskit-biography.php |archive-date=November 4, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a teenager he began performing in front of audiences.\n{{quote|I started on a $29 guitar and immediately started putting a band together, writing songs and learning all the contemporary folk songs of the time. I just loved it, loved everything about it, loved being in front of people playing music.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\nWhile studying art at [[Ohio University]], he became a fixture at local clubs, playing with a variety of rock, folk, and blues bands.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\n==Music career==\nIn 1967, he and his band moved to Boston and played clubs throughout New England. With [[Joe Dolce]] on lead guitar, they played cover tunes as well as their own country blues originals under various names, including the Headstone Circus, St. James Doorknob, and the Finite Minds, and they made an album for [[Metromedia Records]] as Sugar Creek.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Edwards left the band and began performing as a solo acoustic artist. He would later recall:\n{{quote|I liked the sound of bronze strings on rosewood better than steel strings on magnets, and so I walked out of that club in Vermont, rented myself a van and PA system, and started traveling around the colleges in New England by myself, without gigs, just setting up in the lobbies of dormitories on a Saturday.  Pretty soon I started getting a following.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\n\nEdwards began opening up for acts such as the [[Allman Brothers Band]] and [[B.B. King]]. He signed with [[Capricorn Records]] to record his first album, ''[[Jonathan Edwards (album)|Jonathan Edwards]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \n{{quote|We took about a year recording the first album\u2014different times, different studios, different sounds, different techniques. Recording was so new in '69 and '70. There was a song on the album called 'Please Find Me', and for some reason the engineer rolled over it. It got erased. We spent hours looking for it. We fired the engineer and put \"[[Sunshine (Jonathan Edwards song)|Sunshine]]\" in its place.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\n\nLike most of the songs on ''Jonathan Edwards'', \"Sunshine\" was written shortly after Edwards left the band. \"I felt really fresh, really liberated,\" he later recalled. \"I just went out in the woods every day with my bottle of wine and guitar, sat by a lake near Boston and wrote down all those tunes, day after day.\" Regarding the theme of \"Sunshine\", Edwards commented, \"It was just at the time of the Vietnam War and Nixon. It was looking bad out there. That song meant a lot to a lot of people during that time\u2014especially me.\"<ref name=\"je\"/> \"Sunshine\" reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in January 1972.<ref name=\"golden-discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 292] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the release of his debut album, Edwards moved out of the city to a farm in western Massachusetts, which provided the rural, country inspiration for his second album, ''Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy'' on the [[Atlantic Records]] label. This was an album of mostly self-penned acoustic, country-flavored songs about love and life and was closely followed by ''Have a Good Time For Me'', also on Atlantic.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn 1973 he and his friends got together to record a live album for his fans called ''Lucky Day'', named after a song he wrote in the truck on his way up to live in Nova Scotia. This \"fresh-air break\" lasted only a couple of months, when his old friend [[Emmylou Harris]] invited him to Los Angeles to sing backup on her ''[[Elite Hotel]]'' album. That led to a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and two albums produced by Harris' husband/producer [[Brian Ahern (producer)|Brian Ahern]]: ''Rockin' Chair'' and ''Sailboat''.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn 1979, Edwards moved back to the United States to [[New Hampshire]], and then two years later back to Northern Virginia area where he had grown up. In 1983, he produced and recorded ''Blue Ridge'' with the bluegrass band, [[The Seldom Scene]], for [[Sugar Hill Records]]. Then in 1987 he recorded a children's album, ''Little Hands'', which was released on the small independent American Melody label. It was selected by the [[American Library Association]] as a Notable Children's Recording.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nTurning to acting, Edwards toured as the lead in the Broadway musical ''[[Pump Boys and Dinettes]]''. When the show reached Nashville, he met an old friend from the folk circuit, Wendy Waldman.<ref name=\"Appleseed Edwards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.appleseedmusic.com/jonathanedwards/ |title=Jonathan Edwards |authorlink=[[Appleseed Recordings]] |publisher=Appleseed Recordings |accessdate=2018-04-13 }}</ref> She and Mike Robertson convinced Edwards to come to town and record a country album. \"I've been making country-sounding records all my life, but never in Nashville. Yeah, let's do it.\" Edwards said. So, ''[[Natural Thing (Jonathan Edwards album)|Natural Thing]]'' was produced, recorded, and released on MCA/Curb Records in 1989. \"I was crazy about the songs we selected from those great Nashville writers, and the acoustic-based production that Wendy and I put together was just a joy to make and to listen to. I count that as one of the best albums I've ever been involved with.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/de/music/Jonathan+Edwards/+wiki|title=Alter, Heimatstadt, Biografie von Jonathan Edwards|website=Last.fm|language=de|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, Edwards continued to tour, doing session work, and producing his own music as well as that of other talents, such as [[Cheryl Wheeler]] (\"Driving Home,\" \"Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar\"). He took part in the 1994 \"Back to the Future\" tour that also included [[Don McLean]], [[Tom Rush]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Steve Forbert]] and [[Al Stewart]]. In 1994 he released ''One Day Closer'', his first solo album in five years, on his new record label, Rising Records. ''Man in the Moon'', which includes several of Edwards' original songs, followed the end of 1997. In September 1997, Rising Records released a remixed, re-sequenced ''Among Us'', a CD by [[Simon Townshend]], younger brother of the Who's [[Pete Townshend]]. Edwards also scored the soundtrack for ''The Mouse'', starring [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-mouse-1200447610/|title=The Mouse|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|last2=Harvey|first2=Dennis|date=1996-11-18|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Michael Martin Murphey and Jonathan Edwards 2012.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Jonathan Edwards, Michael Martin Murphey, and Gary Roller at The Flying Monkey, Plymouth, New Hampshire, October 13, 2012]]\nIn 2001, Edwards celebrated thirty years of \"Sunshine\" with a First Annual Farewell Tour with [[Kenny White]] on piano. In the 2000s, Edwards narrated and performed in a travel series for Media Artists entitled ''Cruising America's Waterways'',<ref>[http://www.cruisingamerica.com ''Cruising America's Waterways'']</ref> which was purchased by [[PBS]]. Media Artists also released a companion album. Edwards participated in a second series, which started running on PBS-TV stations in May 2004.\n\nIn 2008, Edwards appeared in the romantic comedy film ''[[The Golden Boys]]'', starring [[Bruce Dern]], [[David Carradine]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Mariel Hemingway]], and [[Rip Torn]]. Set in Cape Cod in 1905, the film featured Edwards in the role of Reverend Perley. In addition to acting, Edwards scored the film.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nHe continues to tour. In the fall of 2012, he appeared with [[Michael Martin Murphey]] in a series of concerts throughout New England.\n\nJonathan continues to tour both solo and with band members Tom Snow, Rick Brodsky, Rob Duquette and Joe K.

They are typically designed to be integrated into a [[home cinema]] configuration, and attached to a [[television]] and/or [[AV receiver]].\n\nThe term is most synonymous with devices designed primarily for the consumption of content from [[streaming media]] services such as [[internet video]], including subscription-based [[Over-the-top media service|over-the-top content services]]. These devices usually have a compact form factor (either as a compact [[set-top box]], or a [[dongle]] designed to plug into an [[HDMI]] port), and contain a [[10-foot user interface]] with support for a [[remote control]] and, in some cases, [[Speech recognition|voice command]]s, as control schemes. Some services may support remote control on digital media players using their respective [[mobile app]]s, while [[Google]]'s [[Chromecast]] line is designed exclusively around this method of operation.\n\nA digital media player's operating system may provide a [[Web search engine|search engine]] for locating content available across multiple services and installed apps. Many digital media players offer internal access to [[digital distribution]] platforms, where users can download or purchase content such as films, television episodes, and [[App store|apps]]. In addition to internet sources, digital media players may support the playback of content from other sources, such as external media (including [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] or [[memory card]]s), or streamed from a [[computer]] or [[media server]]. Some digital media players may also support [[video game]]s, though their complexity (which can range from [[casual game]]s to ports of larger games) depends on operating system and hardware support, and besides those marketed as [[microconsoles]], are not usually promoted as the device's main function.\n\nDigital media players do not usually include a [[Tuner (radio)|tuner]] for receiving television service, nor disc drives for [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray disc]]s. Some devices, such as standalone Blu-ray players, may include similar functions to digital media players (often in a reduced form), as well as recent generations of [[video game console]]s, while \"[[smart TV]]s\" integrate similar functions into the television itself. Some TV makers have, in turn, licensed operating system platforms from digital media players as [[middleware]] for their smart TVs\u2014such as [[Android TV]], [[Amazon Fire TV]], and [[Roku]]\u2014which typically provide a similar user experience to their standalone counterparts, but with TV-specific features and settings reflected in their user interface.\n\n==Overview==\nIn the 2010s, with the popularity of [[portable media player]]s and [[digital camera]]s, as well as fast Internet download speeds and relatively cheap mass storage, many people came into possession of large collections of digital media files that cannot be played on a conventional analog [[HiFi]] without connecting a computer to an amplifier or television. The means to play these files on a network-connected ug digital media player that is permanently connected to a television is seen as a convenience. The rapid growth in the availability of online content has made it easier for consumers to use these devices and obtain content.  [[YouTube]], for instance, is a common plug-in available on most networked devices.  [[Netflix]] has also struck deals with many consumer-electronics makers to make their interface available in the device's menus, for their streaming subscribers.  This symbiotic relationship between Netflix and consumer electronics makers has helped propel Netflix to become the largest subscription video service in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite news | last = Narcisse | first = Evan | title = Netflix Becoming Largest Subscription Entertainment Company | work = | pages = | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 25 April 2011 | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/04/25/netflix-becoming-largest-subscription-entertainment-company/ | accessdate = 2 May 2011}}</ref> using up to 20% of U.S. bandwidth at peak times.<ref>{{cite news|last=Liedtke |first=Michael |title=Netflix expects video streaming to drown out DVDs |work= |pages= |agency=Associated Press |date=22 November 2010 |url=http://www.valleynewslive.com/Global/story.asp?S=13551980&clienttype=printable |accessdate=7 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nMedia players are often designed for compactness and affordability, and tend to have small or non-existent hardware displays other than simple [[LED]] lights to indicate whether the device is powered on. Interface navigation on the television is usually done with an [[infrared]] [[remote control]], while more-advanced digital media players come with high-performance [[remote control]]s which allow control of the interface using integrated touch sensors. Some remotes also include [[accelerometer]]s for [[air mouse]] features which allow basic motion gaming.  Most digital media player devices are unable to play physical audio or video media directly, and instead require a user to convert these media into playable digital files using a separate computer and software. They are also usually incapable of recording audio or video. In the 2010s, it is also common to find digital media player functionality integrated into other consumer-electronics appliances, such as [[DVD player]]s, [[set-top box]]es, [[smart TV]]s, or even [[video game console]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nDigital media players are also commonly referred to as a \"digital media extender\", \"digital media streamer\", \"digital media hub\", \"digital media adapter\", or \"digital media receiver\" (which should not be confused with ''[[AV Receiver]]'' that are also called ''Digital Media Renderer'').<ref>https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35234 {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131107174008/https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35234 |date=7 November 2013 }} What are the differences in DLNA device classes?</ref><ref>http://hometheater.about.com/od/interactivetelevision/a/Dlna-Certifications-The-Role-Of-Each-Network-Media-Component-In-Media-Sharing.htm DLNA Certifications - The Role of Each Network Media Component in Media Sharing</ref>\n\nDigital media player manufacturers use a variety of names to describe their devices.

An early version of a video-capable digital media player was presented by F.C. Jeng et al. in the International Conf. on Consumer Electronics in 2002.<ref>F.C. Jeng, M. Jeanson, S-Y Zhu, and K. Konstantinides, [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1013945 \"Design of a home media center with network and streaming capabilities\"], IEEE Intern. Conf. on Consumer Electronics, 2002, pp. 102-103.</ref> It included a network interface card, a media processor for audio and video decoding, an analog video encoder (for video playback to a TV), an audio digital to analog converter for audio playback, and an IR (infrared receiver) for remote-control-interface.\n\nA concept of a digital media player was also introduced by Intel in 2002 at the [[Intel Developer Forum]] as part of their \u201cExtended Wireless PC Initiative.\"  Intel's digital media player was based on an Xscale PXA210 processor and supported 802.11b wireless networking. Intel was among the first to use the Linux embedded operating system and [[UPnP]] technology for its digital media player. Networked audio and DVD players were among the first consumer devices to integrate digital media player functionality. Examples include the Philips [[Streamium]]-range of products that allowed for remote streaming of audio, the GoVideo D2730 Networked DVD player which integrated DVD playback with the capability to stream Rhapsody audio from a PC, and the Buffalo LinkTheater which combined a DVD player with a digital media player.  More recently, the Xbox 360 gaming console from Microsoft was among the first gaming devices that integrated a digital media player. With the Xbox 360, Microsoft also introduced the concept of a [[Windows Media Center Extender]], which allows users to access the Media center capabilities of a PC remotely, through a home network.  More recently, Linksys, D-Link, and HP introduced the latest generation of digital media players that support 720p and 1080p high resolution video playback and may integrate both Windows Extender and traditional digital media player functionality.\n\n==Typical features==\nA digital media player can connect to the home network using either a wireless ([[IEEE 802.11a-1999|IEEE 802.11a]], b, g, and n) or wired [[Ethernet]] connection. Digital media players includes a user interface that allows users to navigate through their digital media library, search for, and play back media files. Some digital media players only handle music; some handle music and pictures; some handle music, pictures, and video; while others go further to allow internet browsing or controlling Live TV from a PC with a TV tuner.\n\nSome other capabilities which are accomplished by digital media players include:\n* Play, catalog, and store local [[hard disk]], [[USB flash drive|flash drive]], or [[memory card]] music [[CD]]s and view CD album art, view digital photos, and watch [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] or other videos.\n* Stream movies, music, photos (media) over the wired or wireless network<ref>{{cite web|title=Airplay|url=https://www.apple.com/airplay/|publisher=apple.com}}</ref>\n* View digital pictures (one by one or as picture [[slideshow]]s)\n* Stream online video to a TV from services such as [[Netflix]] and [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Google TV|url=https://www.google.com/tv/apps.html|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>\n*Play video games such as [[Angry Birds]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Charlie|title=Now You Can Play Angry Birds On a Roku 2 [PICS]|url=http://mashable.com/2011/08/06/roku-2-xs-review/|publisher=mashable.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>\n*Browse the Internet, check email and access [[social networking]] sites like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[LinkedIn]] on TV through downloadable applications.\n*[[Videotelephony|Video conference]] by connecting a [[webcam]] and microphone.<ref name=\"amkette1\"/>\n\nIn the 2010s, there are stand-alone digital media players on the market from AC Ryan, Asus, Apple (e.g., [[Apple TV]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Graham|title=Apple TV review|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/apple-tv-900409/review|publisher=techradar.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>), NetGear (e.g., NTV and NeoTV models), Dune, iOmega, [[Logitech]], Pivos Group, Micca, Sybas (Popcorn Hour), [[Amkette EvoTV]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Almeida|first=Aaron|title=Amkette EvoTV Review|url=http://tech2.in.com/reviews/hd-media-players/amkette-evotv-review/323422|publisher=tech2.in.com|accessdate=17 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712161933/http://tech2.in.com/reviews/hd-media-players/amkette-evotv-review/323422|archivedate=12 July 2012}}</ref> D-Link,  EZfetch, [[Fire TV]], [[Android TV]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Will|title=Sony Internet Player With Google TV (NSZ-GS7)|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2413422,00.asp|publisher=pcmag.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> Pinnacle, [[Xtreamer]], and [[Roku]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Biddle|first=Sam|title=Roku 3 Review: The New Best Streaming Box|url=https://gizmodo.com/5991159/roku-3-review-the-new-best-streaming-box|publisher=gizmodo.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> just to name a few.

All these can play computer-based media files to a television without the need for a separate computer or network connection, and some can even be used as a conventional external hard-drive. These types of digital media players are sometimes sold as empty shells to allow the user to fit their own choice of hard drive (some can manage unlimited hard disk capacity and other only a certain capacity, i.e. 1TB, 2TB, 3TB, or 4TB), and the same model is sometimes sold with or without an internal hard drive already fitted.\n\n=== Formats, resolutions and file systems ===\nDigital media players can usually play [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] (SD and [[high resolution|HD]]), [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] (SD and HD), [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]] [[.mpg]], [[MPEG-2]] .[[MPEG transport stream|TS]], [[VOB]] and [[ISO image]]s video, with [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[MP3]] and [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] audio tracks. They can also display images (such as [[JPEG]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]) and play music files (such as [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] and [[Ogg]]).\n\n===Operating system===\n{{main|List of smart TV platforms and middleware software}}\nWhile most media players have traditionally been running [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] or [[Open-source model|open source]] [[software framework]]s versions based [[Linux]] as their operating systems, many newer network connected media players are based on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform which gives them an advantage in terms of applications and games from the [[Google Play]] store.

A wireless connection can be established between the media extender and its central media center. On the downside, interference may cause a \"less than optimal\" connection and cause network congestion, resulting in stuttering sound, missing frames from video, and other anomalies. It is recommended{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that an [[802.11a]] or better be used, and over as short of a distance as possible.\n[[File:Digital media receiver - network music player.jpg|thumb|A wireless media extender from [[Arctic (company)|Arctic]] for music streaming and multi-room entertainment<ref>[http://www.arctic.ac/en/p/living/multi-room-system/463/audio-relay.html?c=2327 \"Audio Relay\"] Retrieved 11 October 2012</ref>]]\n\n===Streaming and communication protocols===\nWhile early digital media players used proprietary communication protocols to interface with media servers, today most digital media players either use standard-based protocols such [[Server Message Block|SMB/CIFS/SAMBA]] or [[Network File System|NFS]], or rely on some version of [[UPnP]] (Universal Plug and Play) and [[DLNA]] (Digital Living Network Alliance) standards. DLNA-compliant digital media players and Media Servers is meant to guarantee a minimum set of functionality and proper interoperability among digital media players and servers regardless of the manufacturer, but unfortunately not every manufacturer follows the standards perfectly which can lead to incompatibility.\n\n===Media server===\nSome digital media players will only connect to specific media server software installed on a PC to stream music, pictures and recorded or live TV originating from the computer. Apple iTunes can, for example, be used this way with the Apple TV hardware that connects to a TV.

They are typically designed to be integrated into a [[home cinema]] configuration, and attached to a [[television]] and/or [[AV receiver]].\n\nThe term is most synonymous with devices designed primarily for the consumption of content from [[streaming media]] services such as [[internet video]], including subscription-based [[Over-the-top media service|over-the-top content services]]. These devices usually have a compact form factor (either as a compact [[set-top box]], or a [[dongle]] designed to plug into an [[HDMI]] port), and contain a [[10-foot user interface]] with support for a [[remote control]] and, in some cases, [[Speech recognition|voice command]]s, as control schemes. Some services may support remote control on digital media players using their respective [[mobile app]]s, while [[Google]]'s [[Chromecast]] line is designed exclusively around this method of operation.\n\nA digital media player's operating system may provide a [[Web search engine|search engine]] for locating content available across multiple services and installed apps. Many digital media players offer internal access to [[digital distribution]] platforms, where users can download or purchase content such as films, television episodes, and [[App store|apps]]. In addition to internet sources, digital media players may support the playback of content from other sources, such as external media (including [[USB flash drive|USB drives]] or [[memory card]]s), or streamed from a [[computer]] or [[media server]]. Some digital media players may also support [[video game]]s, though their complexity (which can range from [[casual game]]s to ports of larger games) depends on operating system and hardware support, and besides those marketed as [[microconsoles]], are not usually promoted as the device's main function.\n\nDigital media players do not usually include a [[Tuner (radio)|tuner]] for receiving television service, nor disc drives for [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray disc]]s. Some devices, such as standalone Blu-ray players, may include similar functions to digital media players (often in a reduced form), as well as recent generations of [[video game console]]s, while \"[[smart TV]]s\" integrate similar functions into the television itself. Some TV makers have, in turn, licensed operating system platforms from digital media players as [[middleware]] for their smart TVs\u2014such as [[Android TV]], [[Amazon Fire TV]], and [[Roku]]\u2014which typically provide a similar user experience to their standalone counterparts, but with TV-specific features and settings reflected in their user interface.\n\n==Overview==\nIn the 2010s, with the popularity of [[portable media player]]s and [[digital camera]]s, as well as fast Internet download speeds and relatively cheap mass storage, many people came into possession of large collections of digital media files that cannot be played on a conventional analog [[HiFi]] without connecting a computer to an amplifier or television. The means to play these files on a network-connected digital media player that is permanently connected to a television is seen as a convenience. The rapid growth in the availability of online content has made it easier for consumers to use these devices and obtain content.  [[YouTube]], for instance, is a common plug-in available on most networked devices.  [[Netflix]] has also struck deals with many consumer-electronics makers to make their interface available in the device's menus, for their streaming subscribers.  This symbiotic relationship between Netflix and consumer electronics makers has helped propel Netflix to become the largest subscription video service in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite news | last = Narcisse | first = Evan | title = Netflix Becoming Largest Subscription Entertainment Company | work = | pages = | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 25 April 2011 | url = http://techland.time.com/2011/04/25/netflix-becoming-largest-subscription-entertainment-company/ | accessdate = 2 May 2011}}</ref> using up to 20% of U.S. bandwidth at peak times.<ref>{{cite news|last=Liedtke |first=Michael |title=Netflix expects video streaming to drown out DVDs |work= |pages= |agency=Associated Press |date=22 November 2010 |url=http://www.valleynewslive.com/Global/story.asp?S=13551980&clienttype=printable |accessdate=7 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nMedia players are often designed for compactness and affordability, and tend to have small or non-existent hardware displays other than simple [[LED]] lights to indicate whether the device is powered on. Interface navigation on the television is usually done with an [[infrared]] [[remote control]], while more-advanced digital media players come with high-performance [[remote control]]s which allow control of the interface using integrated touch sensors. Some remotes also include [[accelerometer]]s for [[air mouse]] features which allow basic motion gaming.  Most digital media player devices are unable to play physical audio or video media directly, and instead require a user to convert these media into playable digital files using a separate computer and software. They are also usually incapable of recording audio or video. In the 2010s, it is also common to find digital media player functionality integrated into other consumer-electronics appliances, such as [[DVD player]]s, [[set-top box]]es, [[smart TV]]s, or even [[video game console]]s.\n\n==Terminology==\nDigital media players are also commonly referred to as a \"digital media extender\", \"digital media streamer\", \"digital media hub\", \"digital media adapter\", or \"digital media receiver\" (which should not be confused with ''[[AV Receiver]]'' that are also called ''Digital Media Renderer'').<ref>https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35234 {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20131107174008/https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/35234 |date=7 November 2013 }} What are the differences in DLNA device classes?</ref><ref>http://hometheater.about.com/od/interactivetelevision/a/Dlna-Certifications-The-Role-Of-Each-Network-Media-Component-In-Media-Sharing.htm DLNA Certifications - The Role of Each Network Media Component in Media Sharing</ref>\n\nDigital media player manufacturers use a variety of names to describe their devices.

An early version of a video-capable digital media player was presented by F.C. Jeng et al. in the International Conf. on Consumer Electronics in 2002.<ref>F.C. Jeng, M. Jeanson, S-Y Zhu, and K. Konstantinides, [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1013945 \"Design of a home media center with network and streaming capabilities\"], IEEE Intern. Conf. on Consumer Electronics, 2002, pp. 102-103.</ref> It included a network interface card, a media processor for audio and video decoding, an analog video encoder (for video playback to a TV), an audio digital to analog converter for audio playback, and an IR (infrared receiver) for remote-control-interface.\n\nA concept of a digital media player was also introduced by Intel in 2002 at the [[Intel Developer Forum]] as part of their \u201cExtended Wireless PC Initiative.\"  Intel's digital media player was based on an Xscale PXA210 processor and supported 802.11b wireless networking. Intel was among the first to use the Linux embedded operating system and [[UPnP]] technology for its digital media player. Networked audio and DVD players were among the first consumer devices to integrate digital media player functionality. Examples include the Philips [[Streamium]]-range of products that allowed for remote streaming of audio, the GoVideo D2730 Networked DVD player which integrated DVD playback with the capability to stream Rhapsody audio from a PC, and the Buffalo LinkTheater which combined a DVD player with a digital media player.  More recently, the Xbox 360 gaming console from Microsoft was among the first gaming devices that integrated a digital media player. With the Xbox 360, Microsoft also introduced the concept of a [[Windows Media Center Extender]], which allows users to access the Media center capabilities of a PC remotely, through a home network.  More recently, Linksys, D-Link, and HP introduced the latest generation of digital media players that support 720p and 1080p high resolution video playback and may integrate both Windows Extender and traditional digital media player functionality.\n\n==Typical features==\nA digital media player can connect to the home network using either a wireless ([[IEEE 802.11a-1999|IEEE 802.11a]], b, g, and n) or wired [[Ethernet]] connection. Digital media players includes a user interface that allows users to navigate through their digital media library, search for, and play back media files. Some digital media players only handle music; some handle music and pictures; some handle music, pictures, and video; while others go further to allow internet browsing or controlling Live TV from a PC with a TV tuner.\n\nSome other capabilities which are accomplished by digital media players include:\n* Play, catalog, and store local [[hard disk]], [[USB flash drive|flash drive]], or [[memory card]] music [[CD]]s and view CD album art, view digital photos, and watch [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] or other videos.\n* Stream movies, music, photos (media) over the wired or wireless network<ref>{{cite web|title=Airplay|url=https://www.apple.com/airplay/|publisher=apple.com}}</ref>\n* View digital pictures (one by one or as picture [[slideshow]]s)\n* Stream online video to a TV from services such as [[Netflix]] and [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Google TV|url=https://www.google.com/tv/apps.html|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>\n*Play video games such as [[Angry Birds]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Charlie|title=Now You Can Play Angry Birds On a Roku 2 [PICS]|url=http://mashable.com/2011/08/06/roku-2-xs-review/|publisher=mashable.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>\n*Browse the Internet, check email and access [[social networking]] sites like [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[LinkedIn]] on TV through downloadable applications.\n*[[Videotelephony|Video conference]] by connecting a [[webcam]] and microphone.<ref name=\"amkette1\"/>\n\nIn the 2010s, there are stand-alone digital media players on the market from AC Ryan, Asus, Apple (e.g., [[Apple TV]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Graham|title=Apple TV review|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/apple-tv-900409/review|publisher=techradar.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref>), NetGear (e.g., NTV and NeoTV models), Dune, iOmega, [[Logitech]], Pivos Group, Micca, Sybas (Popcorn Hour), [[Amkette EvoTV]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Almeida|first=Aaron|title=Amkette EvoTV Review|url=http://tech2.in.com/reviews/hd-media-players/amkette-evotv-review/323422|publisher=tech2.in.com|accessdate=17 April 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712161933/http://tech2.in.com/reviews/hd-media-players/amkette-evotv-review/323422|archivedate=12 July 2012}}</ref> D-Link,  EZfetch, [[Fire TV]], [[Android TV]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Will|title=Sony Internet Player With Google TV (NSZ-GS7)|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2413422,00.asp|publisher=pcmag.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> Pinnacle, [[Xtreamer]], and [[Roku]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Biddle|first=Sam|title=Roku 3 Review: The New Best Streaming Box|url=https://gizmodo.com/5991159/roku-3-review-the-new-best-streaming-box|publisher=gizmodo.com|accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> just to name a few.

All these can play computer-based media files to a television without the need for a separate computer or network connection, and some can even be used as a conventional external hard-drive. These types of digital media players are sometimes sold as empty shells to allow the user to fit their own choice of hard drive (some can manage unlimited hard disk capacity and other only a certain capacity, i.e. 1TB, 2TB, 3TB, or 4TB), and the same model is sometimes sold with or without an internal hard drive already fitted.\n\n=== Formats, resolutions and file systems ===\nDigital media players can usually play [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] (SD and [[high resolution|HD]]), [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] (SD and HD), [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]] [[.mpg]], [[MPEG-2]] .[[MPEG transport stream|TS]], [[VOB]] and [[ISO image]]s video, with [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[MP3]] and [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] audio tracks. They can also display images (such as [[JPEG]] and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]) and play music files (such as [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] and [[Ogg]]).\n\n===Operating system===\n{{main|List of smart TV platforms and middleware software}}\nWhile most media players have traditionally been running [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] or [[Open-source model|open source]] [[software framework]]s versions based [[Linux]] as their operating systems, many newer network connected media players are based on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform which gives them an advantage in terms of applications and games from the [[Google Play]] store.

A wireless connection can be established between the media extender and its central media center. On the downside, interference may cause a \"less than optimal\" connection and cause network congestion, resulting in stuttering sound, missing frames from video, and other anomalies. It is recommended{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that an [[802.11a]] or better be used, and over as short of a distance as possible.\n[[File:Digital media receiver - network music player.jpg|thumb|A wireless media extender from [[Arctic (company)|Arctic]] for music streaming and multi-room entertainment<ref>[http://www.arctic.ac/en/p/living/multi-room-system/463/audio-relay.html?c=2327 \"Audio Relay\"] Retrieved 11 October 2012</ref>]]\n\n===Streaming and communication protocols===\nWhile early digital media players used proprietary communication protocols to interface with media servers, today most digital media players either use standard-based protocols such [[Server Message Block|SMB/CIFS/SAMBA]] or [[Network File System|NFS]], or rely on some version of [[UPnP]] (Universal Plug and Play) and [[DLNA]] (Digital Living Network Alliance) standards. DLNA-compliant digital media players and Media Servers is meant to guarantee a minimum set of functionality and proper interoperability among digital media players and servers regardless of the manufacturer, but unfortunately not every manufacturer follows the standards perfectly which can lead to incompatibility.\n\n===Media server===\nSome digital media players will only connect to specific media server software installed on a PC to stream music, pictures and recorded or live TV originating from the computer. Apple iTunes can, for example, be used this way with the Apple TV hardware that connects to a TV. Apple has developed a tightly integrated device and content management ecosystem with their [[iTunes Store]], personal computers, [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] [[List of iOS devices|devices]], and the [[AppleTV]] [[digital media receiver]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2010/10/01/how-apple-took-the-high-ground-in-the-battle-for-the-global-digital-living-room/ | title=How Apple took the high ground in the battle for the global digital living room | first=Philip | last=Elmer-DeWitt | date=1 October 2010 | publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] | accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref>  The most recent version of the AppleTV, at $99, has lost the hard-drive that was included in its predecessor and fully depends on either streaming internet content, or another computer on the home network for media.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bostonherald.com/business/technology/reviews/view/20110124apples_web_tv_packs_big_bang_for_the_buck/srvc=home&position=also | title=Apple's Web TV packs big bang for the buck | first=Brendan| last=Lynch | date=24 January 2011 | publisher=[[Boston Herald]] | accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Connection ports===\n[[File:Apple TV. 1st generation-2290.jpg|thumb|Back of 1st generation Apple TV]]\n[[File:Apple TV 2nd Generation back.jpg|thumb|Back of 2nd &amp; 3rd generation Apple TV]]\nTelevision connection is usually done via; composite, [[SCART]], Component, [[HDMI]] video, with Optical Audio (TOSLINK/SPDIF), and connect to the local network and [[broadband]] internet using either a wired [[Ethernet]] or a wireless [[Wi-Fi]] connection, and some also have built-in [[Bluetooth]] support for remotes and game-pads or joysticks.

Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry.\"<ref name = \"food and famine\"/>]]\nIn politics, humanitarian aid, and social science, '''hunger''' is a condition in which a person, for a sustained period, is unable to eat sufficient food to meet basic [[nutrition]]al needs. So in the field of hunger relief, the term ''BIG MAC!'' is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience.\n\nThroughout history, portions of the world's population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by [[war]], [[Pandemic|plagues]], or [[adverse weather]]. In the decades following [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2015 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's population. According to figures published by the [[FAO]] in 2019 however, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger has been increasing over the last four years.  This is both as a percentage of the world's population, and in absolute terms, with about 821 million afflicted with hunger in 2018.\n\nWhile most of the world's hungry people continue to live in [[Asia]], much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. The FAO's 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: [[climate]], [[Group conflict|conflict]], and [[Recession|economic slowdowns]]. The 2018 report focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rises were especially severe in countries where the agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme variations in weather. While the FAO's 2019 report found there was also a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an [[economic slowdown]].\n\nMany thousands of organizations are engaged in the field of hunger relief;  operating at local, national, regional or international levels. Some of these organizations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in a number of different fields. The organizations range from multilateral institutions, to national governments, to small local initiatives such as independent [[Soup kitchen|soup kitchens]]. Many participate in umbrella networks that connect together thousands of different hunger relief organizations. At the global level, much of the world's hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the [[United Nations|UN]], and geared towards achieving the 2030 [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] for \"''Zero hunger''\".\n\n==Definition and related terms==\nThere is only one globally recognized approach for defining and measuring hunger that is generally used by those studying or working to relieve hunger as a social problem. This is the United Nation's [[FAO]] measurement, which they typically refer to as undernourishment, sometimes as hunger or 'food deprivation'. For the FAO:\n*Hunger or undernourishment exists when \"caloric intake is below the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDR). The MDER is the amount of energy needed to perform light activity and to maintain a minimum acceptable weight for attained height.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2490e/i2490e02a.pdf\n|title=FAO Statistical Yearbook 2012: Part 2 Hunger dimensions\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=2012\n|accessdate=27 December 2018\n}}\n</ref> The FAO use different MDER thresholds for different countries, due to variations in climate and cultural factors. Typically a yearly \"balance sheet\" approach is used, with the minimum dietary energy requirement tallied against the estimated total calories consumed over the year.  The FAO definitions differentiate hunger from malnutrition and food insecurity:<ref name = \"BMJ2018\">{{cite journal\n| author = Patrick Webb, Gunhild Anker Stordalen, Sudhir Singh, Ramani Wijesinha-Bettoni, Prakash Shetty, Anna Lartey\n| title = Hunger and malnutrition in the 21st century\n| journal = [[The BMJ]]\n| volume = 350\n| pages = k2238| year = 2018| Url = https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2238\n| DOI = 10.1136/bmj.k2238 | paid = 29898884\n| PMC = 5996965\n}}</ref><ref name=\"FAO2018\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/3/I9553EN/i9553en.pdf\n|title=The state of food security and nutrition in the world (2018)\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=11 September 2018\n|accessdate=27 December 2018\n}}\n</ref><ref name = \"FAOintro\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/al936e/al936e00.pdf\n|title=An Introduction to the Basic Concepts of Food Security\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=2008\n|accessdate=27 December 2018\n}}\n</ref>\n \n*[[Malnutrition]] results from  \"deficiencies,  excesses or imbalances in the consumption of macro- and/or micro-nutrients.\" In the FAO definition, all hungry people suffer from malnutrition, but people who are malnourished may not be hungry. They may get sufficient raw calories to avoid hunger but lack essential micronutrients, or they may even consume an excess of raw calories and hence suffer from obesity.<ref name = \"FAOintro\"/><ref name=\"FAO2018\"/><ref name = \"BMJ2018\"/>\n*[[Food insecurity]] occurs when people are at risk, or worried about, not being able to meet their preferences for food, including in terms of raw calories and nutritional value.  In the FAO definition, all hungry people are food insecure, but not all food-insecure people are hungry (though there is a very strong overlap between hunger and ''severe food insecurity''.). The FAO have reported that food insecurity quite often results in simultaneous [[stunted growth]] for children, and obesity for adults.<ref name = \"FAOintro\"/><ref name=\"FAO2018\"/><ref name = \"BMJ2018\"/>\n\nNot all of the organizations in the hunger relief field use the FAO definition of hunger. Some use a broader definition that overlaps more fully with malnutrition. The alternative definitions do however tend to go beyond the commonly understood meaning of hunger as a painful or uncomfortable motivational condition; the desire for food is something that all humans frequently experience, even the most affluent, and is not in itself a social problem.<ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Holben | first1 = David, H.\n | title = The Concept and Definition of Hunger and Its Relationship to Food Insecurity\n | work = [[National Academies of Science]]\n | date = 2005\n  }}</ref><ref name = \"FAOintro\"/><ref name=\"FAO2018\"/><ref name = \"BMJ2018\"/>\n\nVery low food supply can be described as \"food insecure with hunger.\" A change in description was made in 2006 at the recommendation of the Committee on National Statistics (National Research Council, 2006) in order to distinguish the physiological state of hunger from indicators of food availability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1|title=Household Food Security in the United States in 2018|last=Coleman-Jensen|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Food insecure is when food intake of one or more household members was reduced and their eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year because the household lacked money and other resources for food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1|title=Household Food Security in the United States in 2018|last=Coleman-Jensen|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Food security statistics, is measured by using survey data, based on household responses to items about whether the household was able to obtain enough food to meet their needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1|title=Household Food Security in the United states in 2018|last=Coleman-Jensen|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==As a physical condition==\n{{main|Hunger (motivational state)}}\nThe physical sensation of hunger is related to contractions of the stomach muscles. These contractions\u2014sometimes called hunger pangs once they become severe\u2014are believed to be triggered by high concentrations of the [[ghrelin]] hormone. The hormones [[Peptide YY]] and [[Leptin]] can have an opposite effect on the appetite, causing the sensation of being full. Ghrelin can be released if [[blood sugar level]]s get low\u2014a condition that can result from long periods without eating. Stomach contractions from hunger can be especially severe and painful in children and young adults.\n\nHunger pangs can be made worse by irregular meals.

Led by the [[FAO]], the 2019 report was joint authored by four other UN agencies: the [[WFP]], [[IFAD]], [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]. The FAO's yearly report provides a statistical overview of the prevalence of hunger around the world, and is widely considered the main global reference for tracking hunger. No simple set of statistics can ever fully capture the multidimensional nature of hunger however. Reasons include that the FAO's key metric for hunger, \"undernourishment\", is defined solely in terms of dietary energy availability \u2013 disregarding micro-nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. Second, the FAO uses the energy requirements for minimum activity levels as a benchmark; many people would not count as hungry by the FAO's measure yet still be eating too little to undertake hard manual labor, which might be the only sort of work available to them. Thirdly, the FAO statistics do not always reflect short-term undernourishment.<ref name=\"FAO2018\"/><ref name=\"FAO2019\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/3/ca5162en/ca5162en.pdf\n|title=The state of food security and nutrition in the world (2019)\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=15 July 2019\n|accessdate=15 July 2019\n}}\n</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year!!2005!!2010!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018\n|-\n\n!Number (million) of undernourished people (global)<ref name=\"FAO2019\"/>\n|947.2||822.3||785.4||796.5||811.7||821.6\n|-\n\n!Percentage of undernourished people (global)<ref name=\"FAO2019\"/>\n|14.5%||11.8%||10.6%||10.7%||10.8%||10.8%\n|}\n\nAn alternative measure of hunger across the world is the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI).

Chpts. 1\u20133. In 2012, advocates of small government spoke out against the US food stamp program, saying it discourages people from fending for themselves, in the same way as it is not always a good idea to feed hungry wild animals.

Historical hunger relief efforts were often largely left to religious organisations and individual kindness.  Even up to early modern times, political leaders often reacted to famine with bewilderment and confusion. From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for the elite to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.<ref>For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].</ref><ref>\nThere were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007),  James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists. There were also more frequent calls for large scale intervention against world hunger from academics and politicians,  such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].  Funded both by the government and private donations, the U.S. was able to dispatch millions of tons of food aid to European countries during and in the years immediately after WWI, organised by agencies such as the [[American Relief Administration]].  Hunger as an academic and social topic came to further prominence in the U.S. thanks to mass media coverage of the issue as a domestic problem during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called \"the paradox of want amid plenty,\" agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.</ref><ref name = \"HungerModHist\">\n{{cite book\n|author = James Vernon\n|title = Hunger: A Modern History\n|chapter = Chpts. 1-3\n|year = 2007\n|isbn = 978-0674026780\n|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]\n|chapter-url-access = registration\n|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0\n|url-access = registration\n|url = https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Grigg\">\n{{cite journal\n|author = David Grigg\n|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945\u20131980\n|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers\n|year= 1981\n|volume= 6| issue = 3\n|series= NS\n|pages=279\u2013292\n|quote= Before 1945 very little academic or political notice was taken of the problem of world hunger, since 1945 there has been a vast literature on the subject.\n|doi=10.2307/622288\n|jstor=622288\n}}</ref><ref name = \"HistoryEpidemics\">\n{{cite book \n|author = Charles Creighton\n|title=History of Epidemics in Britain\n|chapter = Chapt. 1\n|orig-year= 1891\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=978-1144947604 \n|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]\n|author-link=Charles Creighton\n}}</ref><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\">{{cite book\n|editor= William A Dando\n|title=Food and Famine in the 21st Century: Vol 1, Topics and Issues\n|chapter = ''passim'', see esp Introduction; Historiography of Food, Hunger and famine; Hunger and Starvation\n|year=2012\n|isbn=978-1598847307\n|publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Janet Poppendieck\n | title = Eating Agendas\n | year = 1995\n | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0\n | publisher = Aldine Transaction\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/eatingagendasfoo0000unse\n }}</ref>\n\n===Efforts after World War II===\nWhile there had been increasing attention to hunger relief from the late 19th century,  Dr David Grigg has summarised that prior to the end of World War II, world hunger still received relatively little academic or political attention; whereas after 1945 there was an explosion of interest in the topic.<ref name=\"Grigg\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]]. For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, then by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).<ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\">\n{{cite book \n|author = John R.

The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas. WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.<ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\"/>\n\nFollowing successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.<ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\"/>\n\nThe United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism.  By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.<ref name=\"Ecologist-2014-04-03\"/><ref name=\"MR-2013-11-Magdoff\"/><ref name=\"MRzine-2012-12-Goswami\"/>\n[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]\nOrganizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the \"[[free trade]]\" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening. The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.<ref name=\"WB30Jul12\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond\n|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond\n|publisher= [[World Bank]]\n|date=30 March 2012\n|accessdate=31 July 2012\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\"/><ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/05/20115712428956842.html\n|title= The IMF's change of heart\n|publisher=[[Aljazeera]]\n|author=Joseph Stiglitz\n|date = 7 May 2011\n|accessdate=16 May 2011|author-link= Joseph Stiglitz\n}}\n</ref>\n\nUntil at least the 1980s\u2014and, to an extent, the 1990s\u2014the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.<ref name=\"Ecologist-2014-04-03\"/><ref name=\"MR-2013-11-Magdoff\">[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)</ref><ref name=\"MRzine-2012-12-Goswami\">Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04</ref>  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.<ref name=\"foodAndFamine\" /><ref>{{cite book \n|editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens \n|author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans\n|title=The Globalization of World Politics\n|chapter = \"Poverty, development and hunger\"\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=978-0199569090 \n|publisher= [[Oxford University press]]\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a [[2007\u201308 world food price crisis|global food crisis]].

A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief.

In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b71a9052-6d2b-11de-9032-00144feabdc0.html\n|title= G8 to commit $20bn for food security\n|work= [[Financial Times]]\n|author= Guy Dinmore in L'Aquila\n|date = 10 July 2009\n|accessdate=15 November 2009\n|url-access=registration }}\n</ref><ref name = \"G8 and Pope\">\n{{cite news\n|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cc9150d0-6af4-11de-861d-00144feabdc0.html\n|title= Pope condemns capitalism's 'failures'\n|work= [[Financial Times]]\n|author= Guy Dinmore in Rome\n|date = 7 July 2009\n|accessdate=7 July 2009\n|url-access=registration }}\n</ref>\n\nFood prices fell sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action.

While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]]. This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat. According to a 1992 survey of 1000 randomly selected US voters, 77% of Americans had contributed to efforts to feed the hungry, either by volunteering for various hunger relief agencies such as [[food banks]] and [[soup kitchen]]s, or by donating cash or food.<ref>\n{{cite book \n|author = Janet Poppendieck\n|title= Sweet Charity?: Emergency Food and the End of Entitlement \n|chapter = Introduction, Chpt 1\n|year= 1999\n|isbn= 0140245561\n|publisher= Penguine\n}}</ref> \nEurope, with its more generous welfare system, had little awareness of domestic hunger until the food price inflation that began in late 2006, and especially as austerity-imposed welfare cuts began to take effect in 2010. Various surveys reported that upwards of 10% of Europe's population had begun to suffer from food insecurity.

It has created viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAfter the [[Millennium Development Goals]] expired in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) became key objectives to shape the world's response to development challenges such as hunger. In particular Goal 2: ''Zero Hunger'' sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAside from the UN agencies themselves,  hundreds of other organisations address the problem of hunger on the global level. These include national governments, religious groups, international charities and in some cases international corporations. Though except perhaps in the cases of charities, the priority these organisations assign to hunger relief may vary from year to year.  In many cases the organisations partner with the UN agencies, though often they can pursue independent goals. For example, [[Post-2015 Development Agenda|as consensus began to form]]  for the SDG ''zero hunger'' goal to aim to end hunger by 2030, a number of organizations formed initiatives with the more ambitious target to achieve this outcome early, by 2025:\n\n* In 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/2013/12/pope-francis-denounces-global-scandal-hunger/|title=Pope Francis denounces 'global scandal' of hunger|date=9 December 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* The partnership [https://web.archive.org/web/20151013222109/http://www.compact2025.org/ Compact2025], led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact2025.org/about-compact2025/governance/leadership-council/|title=Leadership Council|website=www.compact2025.org}}</ref> develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition|title=Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition - IFPRI|website=www.ifpri.org}}</ref>  It bases its claim that hunger can be ended by 2025 on a report by [[Shenggen Fan]] and [[Paul Polman]] that analyzed the experiences from China, Vietnam, Brazil and Thailand and concludes that eliminating hunger and undernutrition was possible by 2025.<ref name=\"IFPRI2013\"/>\n* In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children.

Food banks tend to run on different operating models depending on where they are located. In the U.S., Australia, and to some extent in Canada, foodbanks tend to perform a warehouse type function, storing and delivering food to front line food orgs, but not giving it directly to hungry peoples themselves. In much of Europe and elsewhere, food banks operate on the ''front line'' model, where they hand out parcels of uncooked food direct to the hungry, typically giving them enough for several meals which they can eat in their homes. In the U.S and Australia, establishments that hand out uncooked food to individual people are instead called ''food pantries'', ''food shelves'' or ''food closets'.<ref>{{cite book | last=Riches | first=G. | title=Food Banks and the Welfare Crisis | publisher=James Lorimer Limited, Publishers | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-88810-363-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW9CEBIslSQC&pg=PA25 | access-date=December 19, 2018 | pages=25, ''passim'', see esp. \"Models of Food Banks\" }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Less Developed Countries]], there are charity-run food banks that operate on a semi-commercial system that differs from both the more common \"warehouse\" and \"frontline\" models. In some rural [[Least developed country|LDCs]] such as Malawi, food is often relatively cheap and plentiful for the first few months after the harvest, but then becomes more and more expensive. Food banks in those areas can buy large amounts of food shortly after the harvest, and then as food prices start to rise, they sell it back to local people throughout the year at well below market prices. Such food banks will sometimes also act as centres to provide small holders and subsistence farmers with various forms of support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thp.org/where_we_work/africa/malawi/overview |title=''The hunger project'', overview for Malawi |publisher=Thp.org |date= |access-date=2013-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724042611/http://www.thp.org/where_we_work/africa/malawi/overview |archive-date=24 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Soup kitchen ====\n[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]\nA [[soup kitchen]], '''meal center,''' or '''food kitchen''' is a place where [[food]] is offered to the hungry for free or at a below market [[price]]. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, they are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]] organizations, such as [[Church body|church]] or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a [[food bank]] for free or at a low price, because they are considered a [[Charitable organization|charity]], which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.\n\n====Others====\nLocal establishments calling themselves \"food banks\" or \"soup kitchens\" are often run either by Christian churches or less frequently by secular civil society groups.  Other religions carry out similar hunger relief efforts, though sometimes with slightly different methods. For example, in the Sikh tradition of [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]], food is served to the hungry direct from Sikh temples. There are exceptions to this, for example in the UK Sikhs run some of the food banks, as well as giving out food direct from their [[Gurdwara]]'s.<ref>{{cite book | last=  Fieldhouse| first=Paul | title=Food, Feasts, and Faith: An Encyclopedia of Food Culture in World Religions  | publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] | year=2017 | isbn=9781610694117 | pages=97\u2013102 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-temple-to-the-street-how-sikh-kitchens-are-becoming-the-new-food-banks-44611\n|title=From the temple to the street: how Sikh kitchens are becoming the new food banks \n|publisher= [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]\n|date=22 July 2015\n|accessdate=3 January 2019\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Hunger and gender==\n{{see also|Food security#Gender and food security}}\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]\n\nIn both developing and advanced countries, parents sometimes go without food so they can feed their children. Women, however, seem more likely to make this sacrifice than men. World Bank studies consistently find that about 60% of those who are hungry are female. The apparent explanation for this imbalance is that, compared to men, women more often forgo meals in order to feed their children. Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.<ref name=\"WB30Jul12\"/><ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide \n |title=555 million women go hungry worldwide \n |publisher=[[World Development Movement]] \n |author=Miriam Ross \n |date=8 March 2012 \n |accessdate=31 July 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213616/http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide \n |archivedate=21 March 2012 \n |df=dmy-all \n}}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9084054/Mums-missing-meals-to-feed-kids.html\n|title=Mums missing meals to feed kids\n|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]\n|date= 16 February 2012\n|accessdate= 31 July 2012\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion. Men who failed to provide for themselves and their families were often regarded with contempt.<ref name = \"HungerModHist\"/>\n\nThis changed after [[World War I]], where thousands of men who had proved their manliness in combat found themselves unable to secure employment. Similarly, female gender could be advantageous for those wishing to advocate for hunger relief, with Vernon writing that being a woman helped [[Emily Hobhouse]] draw the plight of hungry people to wider attention during the [[Second Boer War]].<ref name = \"HungerModHist\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Action Against Hunger]]\n* ''[[A Place at the Table]]''\n* [[Basic income]]\n* [[:Category:Hunger relief organizations]]\n* [[Donation]]\n* [[Economic issues]]\n* [[Famine]]\n* [[Famine relief]]\n* [[Famine scales]]\n* [[Feeding America]]\n* [[Fome Zero]] (Hunger 0)\n* [[Food Bank]]\n* [[Food Donation Connection]]\n* [[Food Matters]]\n* [[Food production]]\n* [[Global Hunger Index]]\n* [[Homelessness]]\n* [[Human rights]]\n* [[Hunger in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Hunger in the United States]]\n* [[Hunger marches]]\n* [[The Hunger Project]]\n* [[Income inequality]]\n* [[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification]]\n* [[Malnutrition]]\n* [[Millennium Development Goals]] (Goal 1)\n* [[Muselmann]]\n* [[National Security Study Memorandum 200]] (1974)\n* [[Oxfam]]\n* [[Poverty trap]]\n* [[Project Open Hand]]\n* [[Right to food]]\n* [[Social programs]]\n* [[Soup kitchen]]\n* [[Starvation]]\n* [[Starvation response]]\n* [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]]\n* [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] (1974)\n* [[2007\u201308 world food price crisis]]{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|title=Mumbai Sets Up A Community Fridge To Feed The Hungry|date=15 Nov 2019|language=en|website=InUth|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/yearinoffbeatgoodnews/mumbai-sets-up-a-community-fridge-to-feed-the-hungry/ar-BBWQQTo?ocid=spartanntp}}\n* ''Hunger: an unnatural history'' (2006) by Sharman Apt Russell\u2014rather than focus on the politics and economics of hunger, this work discusses the psychological effect on individuals and also explores the topic from an anthropological perspective.\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiversity}}\n*[http://www.actionagainsthunger.org Action Against Hunger | ACF-USA]\n*[http://www.actionagainsthunger.org.uk Action Against Hunger | ACF-UK]\n*[https://www.hungerreliefinternational.org Hunger Relief International | HRI]\n*[http://www.issuelab.org/issues/profile/hunger Hunger Relief research on IssueLab]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100116182839/http://km.fao.org/fsn/ The Global Food Security and Nutrition Forum (FSN Forum)]\n*[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090601/ten_things Ten Things you can do to Fight World Hunger] ''The Nation'', 13 May 2009\n*[http://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N07/487/05/PDF/N0748705.pdf?OpenElement United Nation 2007 report]\n*[http://wfp.org World Food Programme | WFP]\n\n[[Category:Food and drink]]\n[[Category:Hunger| ]]\n[[Category:Limbic system]]\n[[Category:Motivation]]\n[[Category:Neuropsychology]]\n[[Category:Eating behaviors]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the social and political aspects of hunger|the physical sensation|Hunger (motivational state)|the physical extremes|Starvation|and|Famine|other uses|Hunger (disambiguation)}}\n{{redirect|Hungry}}\n{{distinguish|Hungary}}\n{{short description|Sustained inability to eat sufficient food}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C.

Don't bestow me degrees from great universities. Just clothe the naked. Say that I tried to house the homeless. Let people say that I tried to feed the hungry.\"<ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/>]]\nIn politics, humanitarian aid, and social science, '''hunger''' is a condition in which a person, for a sustained period, is unable to eat sufficient food to meet basic [[nutrition]]al needs. So in the field of hunger relief, the term ''hunger'' is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience.\n\nThroughout history, portions of the world's population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by [[war]], [[Pandemic|plagues]], or [[adverse weather]]. In the decades following [[World War II]], technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2015 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world's population. According to figures published by the [[FAO]] in 2019 however, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger has been increasing over the last four years.  This is both as a percentage of the world's population, and in absolute terms, with about 821 million afflicted with hunger in 2018.\n\nWhile most of the world's hungry people continue to live in [[Asia]], much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. The FAO's 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: [[climate]], [[Group conflict|conflict]], and [[Recession|economic slowdowns]]. The 2018 report focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rises were especially severe in countries where the agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme variations in weather. While the FAO's 2019 report found there was also a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an [[economic slowdown]].\n\nMany thousands of organisations are engaged in the field of hunger relief;  operating at local, national, regional or international levels. Some of these organisations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in a number of different fields. The organisations range from multilateral institutions, to national governments, to small local initiatives such as independent [[Soup kitchen|soup kitchens]]. Many participate in umbrella networks that connect together thousands of different hunger relief organisations. At the global level, much of the world's hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the [[United Nations|UN]], and geared towards achieving the 2030 [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] for \"''Zero hunger''\".\n\n==Definition and related terms==\nThere is only one globally recognized approach for defining and measuring hunger that is generally used by those studying or working to relieve hunger as a social problem. This is the United Nation's [[FAO]] measurement, which they typically refer to as undernourishment, sometimes as hunger or 'food deprivation'. For the FAO:\n*Hunger or undernourishment exists when \"caloric intake is below the minimum dietary energy requirement (MDER). The MDER is the amount of energy needed to perform light activity and to maintain a minimum acceptable weight for attained height.\"<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2490e/i2490e02a.pdf\n|title=FAO Statistical Yearbook 2012: Part 2 Hunger dimensions\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=2012\n|accessdate=27 December 2018\n}}\n</ref> The FAO use different MDER thresholds for different countries, due to variations in climate and cultural factors. Typically a yearly \"balance sheet\" approach is used, with the minimum dietary energy requirement tallied against the estimated total calories consumed over the year.  The FAO definitions differentate hunger from malnutrition and food insecurity:<ref name = \"BMJ2018\">{{cite journal\n| author = Patrick Webb, Gunhild Anker Stordalen, Sudhvir Singh, Ramani Wijesinha-Bettoni, Prakash Shetty, Anna Lartey\n| title = Hunger and malnutrition in the 21st century\n| journal = [[The BMJ]]\n| volume = 350\n| pages = k2238| year = 2018| url = https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2238\n| doi = 10.1136/bmj.k2238 | pmid = 29898884\n| pmc = 5996965\n}}</ref><ref name=\"FAO2018\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/3/I9553EN/i9553en.pdf\n|title=The state of food security and nutrition in the world (2018)\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=11 September 2018\n|accessdate=27 December 2018\n}}\n</ref><ref name = \"FAOintro\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/al936e/al936e00.pdf\n|title=An Introduction to the Basic Concepts of Food Security\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=2008\n|accessdate=27 December 2018\n}}\n</ref>\n \n*[[Malnutrition]] results from  \"deficiencies,  excesses or imbalances in the consumption of macro- and/or micro-nutrients.\" In the FAO definition, all hungry people suffer from malnutrition, but people who are malnourished may not be hungry.

In the FAO definition, all hungry people are food insecure, but not all food-insecure people are hungry (though there is a very strong overlap between hunger and ''severe food insecurity''.). The FAO have reported that food insecurity quite often results in simultaneous [[stunted growth]] for children, and obesity for adults.<ref name = \"FAOintro\"/><ref name=\"FAO2018\"/><ref name = \"BMJ2018\"/>\n\nNot all of the organizations in the hunger relief field use the FAO definition of hunger. Some use a broader definition that overlaps more fully with malnutrition. The alternative definitions do however tend to go beyond the commonly understood meaning of hunger as a painful or uncomfortable motivational condition; the desire for food is something that all humans frequently experience, even the most affluent, and is not in itself a social problem.<ref>{{Citation\n | last1 = Holben | first1 = David, H.\n | title = The Concept and Definition of Hunger and Its Relationship to Food Insecurity\n | work = [[National Academies of Science]]\n | date = 2005\n  }}</ref><ref name = \"FAOintro\"/><ref name=\"FAO2018\"/><ref name = \"BMJ2018\"/>\n\nVery low food supply can be described as \"food insecure with hunger.\" A change in description was made in 2006 at the recommendation of the Committee on National Statistics (National Research Council, 2006) in order to distinguish the physiological state of hunger from indicators of food availability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1|title=Household Food Security in the United States in 2018|last=Coleman-Jensen|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Food insecure is when food intake of one or more household members was reduced and their eating patterns were disrupted at times during the year because the household lacked money and other resources for food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1|title=Household Food Security in the United States in 2018|last=Coleman-Jensen|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Food security statistics, is measured by using survey data, based on household responses to items about whether the household was able to obtain enough food to meet their needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/94849/err-270.pdf?v=963.1|title=Household Food Security in the United states in 2018|last=Coleman-Jensen|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==As a physical condition==\n{{main|Hunger (motivational state)}}\nThe physical sensation of hunger is related to contractions of the stomach muscles.

The FAO's yearly report provides a statistical overview on the prevalence of hunger around the world, and is widely considered the main global reference for tracking hunger. No simple set of statistics can ever fully capture the multi dimensional nature of hunger however. Reasons include that the FAO's key metric for hunger, \"undernourishment\", is defined solely in terms of dietary energy availability \u2013 disregarding micro-nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. Second, the FAO uses the energy requirements for minimum activity levels as a benchmark; many people would not count as hungry by the FAO's measure yet still be eating too little to undertake hard manual labour, which might be the only sort of work available to them. Thirdly, the FAO statistics do not always reflect short-term undernourishment.<ref name=\"FAO2018\"/><ref name=\"FAO2019\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/3/ca5162en/ca5162en.pdf\n|title=The state of food security and nutrition in the world (2019)\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=15 July 2019\n|accessdate=15 July 2019\n}}\n</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year!!2005!!2010!!2015!!2016!!2017!!2018\n|-\n\n!Number (million) of undernourished people (global)<ref name=\"FAO2019\"/>\n|947.2||822.3||785.4||796.5||811.7||821.6\n|-\n\n!Percentage of undernourished people (global)<ref name=\"FAO2019\"/>\n|14.5%||11.8%||10.6%||10.7%||10.8%||10.8%\n|}\n\nAn alternative measure of hunger across the world is the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI).

Historical hunger relief efforts were often largely left to religious organisations and individual kindness.  Even up to early modern times, political leaders often reacted to famine with bewilderment and confusion. From the first age of globalization, which began in the 19th century, it became more common for the elite to consider problems like hunger in global terms. However, as early globalization largely coincided with the high peak of influence for [[classical liberalism]], there was relatively little call for politicians to address world hunger.<ref>For further info see [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Attitudes towards hunger relief]].</ref><ref>\nThere were many exceptions. For example, in ''Hunger: A Modern History'' (2007),  James Vernon describes dozens of 18th and 19th century campaigners who spoke in favor of hunger relief.</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the view that politicians ought not to intervene against hunger was increasingly challenged by campaigning journalists. There were also more frequent calls for large scale intervention against world hunger from academics and politicians,  such as U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]].  Funded both by the government and private donations, the U.S. was able to dispatch millions of tons of food aid to European countries during and in the years immediately after WWI, organised by agencies such as the [[American Relief Administration]].  Hunger as an academic and social topic came to further prominence in the U.S. thanks to mass media coverage of the issue as a domestic problem during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>As many individuals struggled for food, the same agricultural industries were suddenly producing large surpluses as means of increased production to counter the drop in demand from the European markets. This increased output was meant to ease the growing debt levels, however domestic demand could not keep up with prices. Instead, what is often called \"the paradox of want amid plenty,\" agricultural surpluses and large demand simply did not fit together, causing the Hoover administration to buy large amounts of product, such as grain, to stabilize prices. Initially refusing to further compromise the distressed price levels, political pressure from starving families across the country forced Congress to reconsider. With large deposits of grain already wasting away in government possession, the only political move left was to begin a process of donations to the hungry from the Farm Board, a federal oversight created in 1929 to promote the sale and stabilization of agricultural products. Instead of hunger being a reason for the allocation of large grain surpluses, waste became the eventual driving force.</ref><ref name = \"HungerModHist\">\n{{cite book\n|author = James Vernon\n|title = Hunger: A Modern History\n|chapter = Chpts. 1-3\n|year = 2007\n|isbn = 978-0674026780\n|publisher = [[Harvard University Press]]\n|chapter-url-access = registration\n|chapter-url = https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0\n|url-access = registration\n|url = https://archive.org/details/hungermodernhist00vern_0\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Grigg\">\n{{cite journal\n|author = David Grigg\n|title=The historiography of hunger: changing views on the world food problem 1945\u20131980\n|journal=Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers\n|year= 1981\n|volume= 6| issue = 3\n|series= NS\n|pages=279\u2013292\n|quote= Before 1945 very little academic or political notice was taken of the problem of world hunger, since 1945 there has been a vast literature on the subject.\n|doi=10.2307/622288\n|jstor=622288\n}}</ref><ref name = \"HistoryEpidemics\">\n{{cite book \n|author = Charles Creighton\n|title=History of Epidemics in Britain\n|chapter = Chapt. 1\n|orig-year= 1891\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=978-1144947604 \n|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]\n|author-link=Charles Creighton\n}}</ref><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\">{{cite book\n|editor= William A Dando\n|title=Food and Famine in the 21st Century: Vol 1, Topics and Issues\n|chapter = ''passim'', see esp Introduction; Historiography of Food, Hunger and famine; Hunger and Starvation\n|year=2012\n|isbn=978-1598847307\n|publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n | author = Janet Poppendieck\n | title = Eating Agendas\n | year = 1995\n | isbn = 978-0-202-30508-0\n | publisher = Aldine Transaction\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/eatingagendasfoo0000unse\n }}</ref>\n\n===Efforts after World War II===\nWhile there had been increasing attention to hunger relief from the late 19th century,  Dr David Grigg has summarised that prior to the end of World War II, world hunger still received relatively little academic or political attention; whereas after 1945 there was an explosion of interest in the topic.<ref name=\"Grigg\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, a new international politico-economic order came into being, which was later described as [[Embedded liberalism]]. For at least the first decade after the war, the United States, then by far the period's most dominant national actor, was strongly supportive of efforts to tackle world hunger and to promote international development. It heavily funded the United Nation's development programmes, and later the efforts of other multilateral organizations like the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB).<ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\">\n{{cite book \n|author = John R.

The UN has three agencies that work to promote food security and agricultural development: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD). FAO is the world's agricultural knowledge agency, providing policy and technical assistance to developing countries to promote food security, nutrition and sustainable agricultural production, particularly in rural areas. WFP's key mission is to deliver food into the hands of the hungry poor. The agency steps in during [[emergencies]] and uses food to aid recovery after emergencies. Its longer term approaches to hunger helps the transition from recovery to development. IFAD, with its knowledge of rural poverty and exclusive focus on poor rural people, designs and implements programmes to help those people access the assets, services and opportunities they need to overcome poverty.<ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\"/>\n\nFollowing successful post WWII reconstruction of Germany and Japan, the IMF and WB began to turn their attention to the developing world. A great many [[NGO|civil society actors]] were also active in trying to combat hunger, especially after the late 1970s when global media began to bring the plight of starving people in places like [[Ethiopia]] to wider attention.  Most significant of all, especially in the late 1960s and 70s, the [[Green revolution]] helped improved agricultural technology propagate throughout the world.<ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\"/>\n\nThe United States began to change its approach to the problem of world hunger from about the mid 1950s. Influential members of the administration became less enthusiastic about methods they saw as promoting an over reliance on the state, as they feared that might assist the spread of communism.  By the 1980s, the previous consensus in favour of moderate government intervention had been [[Post-war displacement of Keynesianism|displaced across the western world.]] The IMF and World Bank in particular began to promote market-based solutions. In cases where countries became dependent on the IMF, they sometimes forced national governments to prioritize debt repayments and sharply cut public services. This sometimes had a negative effect on efforts to combat hunger.<ref name=\"Ecologist-2014-04-03\"/><ref name=\"MR-2013-11-Magdoff\"/><ref name=\"MRzine-2012-12-Goswami\"/>\n[[File:Irrigation1.jpg|thumb|left|Increased use of irrigation played a major role in the [[Green Revolution]].]]\nOrganizations such as [[Food First]] raised the issue of [[food sovereignty]] and claimed that every country on earth (with the possible minor exceptions of some city-states) has sufficient agricultural capacity to feed its own people, but that the \"[[free trade]]\" economic order, which from the late 1970s to about 2008 had been associated with such institutions as the IMF and World Bank, had prevented this from happening. The World Bank itself claimed it was part of the solution to hunger, asserting that the best way for countries to break the cycle of poverty and hunger was to build export-led economies that provide the financial means to buy foodstuffs on the world market. However, in the early 21st century the World Bank and IMF became less dogmatic about promoting [[free market]] reforms. They increasingly returned to the view that government intervention does have a role to play, and that it can be advisable for governments to support food security with policies favourable to domestic agriculture, even for countries that do not have a [[Comparative advantage]] in that area. As of 2012, the World Bank remains active in helping governments to intervene against hunger.<ref name=\"WB30Jul12\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/2012/07/30/food-price-volatility-growing-concern-world-bank-stands-ready-respond\n|title=Food Price Volatility a Growing Concern, World Bank Stands Ready to Respond\n|publisher= [[World Bank]]\n|date=30 March 2012\n|accessdate=31 July 2012\n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Grigg\"/><ref name = \"foodAndFamine\"/><ref name = \"Politics of hunger\"/><ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/05/20115712428956842.html\n|title= The IMF's change of heart\n|publisher=[[Aljazeera]]\n|author=Joseph Stiglitz\n|date = 7 May 2011\n|accessdate=16 May 2011|author-link= Joseph Stiglitz\n}}\n</ref>\n\nUntil at least the 1980s\u2014and, to an extent, the 1990s\u2014the dominant academic view concerning world hunger was that it was a problem of demand exceeding supply. Proposed solutions often focused on boosting food production, and sometimes on birth control. There were exceptions to this, even as early as the 1940s, [[John Boyd Orr, 1st Baron Boyd-Orr|Lord Boyd-Orr]], the first head of the UN's FAO, had perceived hunger as largely a problem of distribution, and drew up comprehensive plans to correct this. Few agreed with him at the time, however, and he resigned after failing to secure support for his plans from the US and Great Britain. In 1998, [[Amartya Sen]] won a [[Nobel Prize]] in part for demonstrating that hunger in modern times is not typically the product of a lack of food. Rather, hunger usually arises from food distribution problems, or from governmental policies in the developed and developing world. It has since been broadly accepted that world hunger results from issues with the distribution as well as the production of food.<ref name=\"Ecologist-2014-04-03\"/><ref name=\"MR-2013-11-Magdoff\">[[Harry Magdoff#Death|Fred Magdoff]], [https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/twenty-first-century-land-grabs Twenty-First-Century Land Grabs - Accumulation by Agricultural Dispossession], ''[[Monthly Review]]'', 2013, Volume 65, Issue 06 (November)</ref><ref name=\"MRzine-2012-12-Goswami\">Rahul Goswami, [http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2012/goswami041212.html For Whom Do the FAO and Its Director-General Work?], ''[[Monthly Review|Monthly Review Magazine]]'', 2012.12.04</ref>  Sen's 1981 essay ''Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation'' played a prominent part in forging the new consensus.<ref name=\"foodAndFamine\" /><ref>{{cite book \n|editor= John Baylis, Steve Smith and Patricia Owens \n|author = Caroline Thomas and Tony Evans\n|title=The Globalization of World Politics\n|chapter = \"Poverty, development and hunger\"\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=978-0199569090 \n|publisher= [[Oxford University press]]\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, rapidly increasing food prices caused a [[2007\u201308 world food price crisis|global food crisis]].

A second ''global food crisis'' unfolded due to the spike in food prices of late 2010 and early 2011. Fewer food riots occurred, due in part to greater availability of food stock piles for relief.

In 2009, Pope Benedict published his third encyclical, [[Caritas in Veritate]], which emphasised the importance of fighting against hunger. The encyclical was intentionally published immediately before the [[35th G8 summit|July 2009 G8 Summit]] to maximise its influence on that event. At the Summit, which took place at [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy, the ''L'Aquila Food Security Initiative'' was launched, with a total of US$22 billion committed to combat hunger.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b71a9052-6d2b-11de-9032-00144feabdc0.html\n|title= G8 to commit $20bn for food security\n|work= [[Financial Times]]\n|author= Guy Dinmore in L'Aquila\n|date = 10 July 2009\n|accessdate=15 November 2009\n|url-access=registration }}\n</ref><ref name = \"G8 and Pope\">\n{{cite news\n|url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cc9150d0-6af4-11de-861d-00144feabdc0.html\n|title= Pope condemns capitalism's 'failures'\n|work= [[Financial Times]]\n|author= Guy Dinmore in Rome\n|date = 7 July 2009\n|accessdate=7 July 2009\n|url-access=registration }}\n</ref>\n\nFood prices fell sharply in 2009 and early 2010, though analysts credit this much more to farmers increasing production in response to the 2008 spike in prices, than to the fruits of enhanced government action.

While folk throughout the world had long contributed to efforts to alleviate hunger in the developing world, there has recently been a rapid increase in the numbers involved in tackling domestic hunger even within the economically advanced nations of the [[Global North]]. This had happened much earlier in North America than it did in Europe. In the US, the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration scaled back welfare the early 1980s, leading to a vast increase of charity sector efforts to help Americans unable to buy enough to eat.

Some but not all are entirely dedicated to fighting hunger. They range from independent soup kitchens that serve only one locality,  to global organisations. Organisations working at the global and regional level will often focus much of their efforts on helping hungry communities to better feed themselves, for example by sharing agricultural technology. With some exceptions, organisations that work just on the local level tend to focus more on providing food directly to hungry people.  Many of the entities are connected by a web of national, regional and global alliances that help them share resources, knowledge, and coordinate efforts.<ref name = \"FAOalliances\">{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i2859e.pdf\n|title=Organizing for action\n|publisher= [[FAO]]\n|date=2011\n|accessdate=27 December 2018\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Global===\nThe United Nations is central to global efforts to relieve hunger, most especially through the [[FAO]], and also via other agencies: such as [[WFP]], [[IFAD]], [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]]. The FAO's [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger campaign|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has created viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAfter the [[Millennium Development Goals]] expired in 2015, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) became key objectives to shape the world's response to development challenges such as hunger. In particular Goal 2: ''Zero Hunger'' sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAside from the UN agencies themselves,  hundreds of other organisations address the problem of hunger on the global level. These include national governments, religious groups, international charities and in some cases international corporations. Though except perhaps in the cases of charities, the priority these organisations assign to hunger relief may vary from year to year.  In many cases the organisations partner with the UN agencies, though often they can pursue independent goals. For example, [[Post-2015 Development Agenda|as consensus began to form]]  for the SDG ''zero hunger'' goal to aim to end hunger by 2030, a number of organizations formed initiatives with the more ambitious target to achieve this outcome early, by 2025:\n\n* In 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/2013/12/pope-francis-denounces-global-scandal-hunger/|title=Pope Francis denounces 'global scandal' of hunger|date=9 December 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n* The partnership [https://web.archive.org/web/20151013222109/http://www.compact2025.org/ Compact2025], led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact2025.org/about-compact2025/governance/leadership-council/|title=Leadership Council|website=www.compact2025.org}}</ref> develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition|title=Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition - IFPRI|website=www.ifpri.org}}</ref>  It bases its claim that hunger can be ended by 2025 on a report by [[Shenggen Fan]] and [[Paul Polman]] that analyzed the experiences from China, Vietnam, Brazil and Thailand and concludes that eliminating hunger and undernutrition was possible by 2025.<ref name=\"IFPRI2013\"/>\n* In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children.

Others targets are partly instrumental to reduce hunger such as increasing agricultural productivity and incomes of small scale food producers (2.3), [[sustainable food systems|sustainable food]] production systems and resilient agricultural practices (2.4) and genetic diversity of seeds and access to \"arising benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge\" (2.5){{cite web |last1=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affaires |title=Goal 2 .:.

Food banks tend to run on different operating models depending on where they are located. In the U.S., Australia, and to some extent in Canada, foodbanks tend to perform a warehouse type function, storing and delivering food to front line food orgs, but not giving it directly to hungry peoples themselves. In much of Europe and elsewhere, food banks operate on the ''front line'' model, where they hand out parcels of uncooked food direct to the hungry, typically giving them enough for several meals which they can eat in their homes. In the U.S and Australia, establishments that hand out uncooked food to individual people are instead called ''food pantries'', ''food shelves'' or ''food closets'.<ref>{{cite book | last=Riches | first=G. | title=Food Banks and the Welfare Crisis | publisher=James Lorimer Limited, Publishers | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-88810-363-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BW9CEBIslSQC&pg=PA25 | access-date=December 19, 2018 | pages=25, ''passim'', see esp. \"Models of Food Banks\" }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Less Developed Countries]], there are charity-run food banks that operate on a semi-commercial system that differs from both the more common \"warehouse\" and \"frontline\" models. In some rural [[Least developed country|LDCs]] such as Malawi, food is often relatively cheap and plentiful for the first few months after the harvest, but then becomes more and more expensive. Food banks in those areas can buy large amounts of food shortly after the harvest, and then as food prices start to rise, they sell it back to local people throughout the year at well below market prices. Such food banks will sometimes also act as centres to provide small holders and subsistence farmers with various forms of support.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thp.org/where_we_work/africa/malawi/overview |title=''The hunger project'', overview for Malawi |publisher=Thp.org |date= |access-date=2013-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724042611/http://www.thp.org/where_we_work/africa/malawi/overview |archive-date=24 July 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==== Soup kitchen ====\n[[File:MontrealSoupKitchen1931.jpg|thumb|A soup kitchen in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]] in 1931.]]\nA [[soup kitchen]], '''meal center,''' or '''food kitchen''' is a place where [[food]] is offered to the hungry for free or at a below market [[price]]. Frequently located in lower-income neighborhoods, they are often staffed by [[Volunteering|volunteer]] organizations, such as [[Church body|church]] or community groups. Soup kitchens sometimes obtain food from a [[food bank]] for free or at a low price, because they are considered a [[Charitable organization|charity]], which makes it easier for them to feed the many people who require their services.\n\n====Others====\nLocal establishments calling themselves \"food banks\" or \"soup kitchens\" are often run either by Christian churches or less frequently by secular civil society groups.  Other religions carry out similar hunger relief efforts, though sometimes with slightly different methods. For example, in the Sikh tradition of [[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]], food is served to the hungry direct from Sikh temples. There are exceptions to this, for example in the UK Sikhs run some of the food banks, as well as giving out food direct from their [[Gurdwara]]'s.<ref>{{cite book | last=  Fieldhouse| first=Paul | title=Food, Feasts, and Faith: An Encyclopedia of Food Culture in World Religions  | publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] | year=2017 | isbn=9781610694117 | pages=97\u2013102 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-temple-to-the-street-how-sikh-kitchens-are-becoming-the-new-food-banks-44611\n|title=From the temple to the street: how Sikh kitchens are becoming the new food banks \n|publisher= [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]\n|date=22 July 2015\n|accessdate=3 January 2019\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Hunger and gender==\n{{see also|Food security#Gender and food security}}\n[[File:Lange-MigrantMother02.jpg|thumb|''[[Migrant Mother]]'' by [[Dorothea Lange]] (1936).]]\n\nIn both developing and advanced countries, parents sometimes go without food so they can feed their children. Women, however, seem more likely to make this sacrifice than men. World Bank studies consistently find that about 60% of those who are hungry are female. The apparent explanation for this imbalance is that, compared to men, women more often forgo meals in order to feed their children. Older sources sometimes claim this phenomenon is unique to developing countries, due to greater sexual inequality. More recent findings suggested that mothers often miss meals in advanced economies too. For example, a 2012 study undertaken by [[Netmums]] in the UK found that one in five mothers sometimes misses out on food to save their children from hunger.<ref name=\"WB30Jul12\"/><ref>{{Cite web\n |url=http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide \n |title=555 million women go hungry worldwide \n |publisher=[[World Development Movement]] \n |author=Miriam Ross \n |date=8 March 2012 \n |accessdate=31 July 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321213616/http://www.wdm.org.uk/food-and-hunger/555-million-women-go-hungry-worldwide \n |archivedate=21 March 2012 \n |df=dmy-all \n}}\n</ref><ref>{{Cite news\n|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/9084054/Mums-missing-meals-to-feed-kids.html\n|title=Mums missing meals to feed kids\n|work= [[The Daily Telegraph]]\n|date= 16 February 2012\n|accessdate= 31 July 2012\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn several periods and regions, gender has also been an important factor determining whether or not victims of hunger would make suitable examples for generating enthusiasm for hunger relief efforts. James Vernon, in his ''Hunger: A Modern History'', wrote that in Britain before the 20th century, it was generally only women and children suffering from hunger who could arouse compassion.
