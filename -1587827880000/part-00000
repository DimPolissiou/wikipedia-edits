[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Lancashire]], the town is north of [[Liverpool]] and south of [[Ormskirk]] in [[West Lancashire]]. The area also contains [[Ashworth Hospital]].\n\nMaghull had a population of 20,444 at the 2011 Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11126240&c=Maghull&d=16&e=62&g=6351976&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1433324648775&enc=1|title=Parish population 2011|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Housing in the town is almost entirely a 20th-century settlement of semi-detached and detached housing although remains of the original town do exist. The town has had an elected council since the [[Local Government Act 1894]] when the government set up a network of local governance across England. Following the [[Local Government Act 1974]], the council changed its name from a parish to a town council.\n\nMaghull itself is situated north of the world famous Aintree Village home of the Grand National horse race. A common consensus among residents is that they feel maghull lives in the shadow of the Old Roan and its residents such as the infamous Jack \u201cMomo\u201d Morris. Magwoolians as they are affectionately known to locals by are traditional conservative voters and stern royalists as shown by the constant display of [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[England|English]] flags. It is the home of many pubs which are of low quality and pale in comparison to the oldy club just south of Switch Island.\n\n==Etymology==\nIt has been proposed by Dr [[Eilert Ekwall]] that the name Maghull may have been derived from the Celtic word ''*magos'' referring to a plain or field, and the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''halh'' referring to a corner or nook, giving the meaning of a \"flat land in a bend\".<ref name=Ekwall>{{cite book |last=Ekwall |first=Eilert |date=1922 |title=Place Names of Lancashire |language=English |location=Manchester |publisher=The University Press |url=https://archive.org/stream/placenamesoflanc00ekwauoft/placenamesoflanc00ekwauoft_djvu.txt | archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote=The second el. of the name is obviously O.E. halh \" haugh.\" This word here refers to the very gently sloping fields E. of the old mossland along the Alt. The first el. is not easy to explain. It appears to have had the form Magh- [ma3J in the earliest M.E. ; later [3] became [x] perhaps owing to assimilation with the h of the second el., and disappeared. Many names in ''-halh'' have a pers. n. as first el., and it is reasonable to suppose that also that of Maghull is one. But there is no (O.E. or O.N.) pers. n. that fits the name. O.E. mago \" son,\" only used in poetry, might be thought of (cf. Childwall), but there are to my knowledge no other place-names in which the word is used. But O.E. Maga corresponding to O.H.Gr. Mago may well have existed. Another possibility is that the first el. of Maghull, like that of Mayfield, Suss. (Magefeud 1260, Maghfeud 1274, Maghefeld 1316, 1343; Roberts), is the Celtic *magos \"plain\" (Brit. *mag, whence Welsh ma \"place,\" Ir. magh \"plain, field,\" etc.). This derivation seems unexceptionable from the point of view of form and meaning. Brit, mag, i.e., [ma3], would not have lost its final consonant at the time when Lancashire was conquered by the Anglians ; cf . Douglas infra. Maghull occupies a plateau rising slightly over the low-lying land E. and W. This plateau is mostly level and would be aptly described as a plain. If the etymology suggested is correct, we must assume that the Brit, name of it was, or contained, the word mag \"plain.\"  |page=119 & 120}}</ref> Another theorised origin is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''m\u00e6g\u00f0e'' to refer to [[mayweed]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original settlement, consisting of fifty people and six square miles of agricultural settlement, was established prior to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]] of 1086 where the town is recorded as Magele on a ridge of high ground, that can be most clearly seen at Red Lion Bridge towards the centre of the town and the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] follows it on the plain and the [[A5147]] on the brow. This ridge marks the edge of the [[flood plain]] of the [[River Alt]], providing protection from flooding and access to this fertile pasture of the plain. A church is known to have existed in the area in 1100 although it has been rebuilt at least once and the chapel still stands, in the [[churchyard]] of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] St Andrew's and is the oldest ecclesiastical building in [[Merseyside]] still in regular use for worship but in 1756 the mediaeval nave of Maghull Chapel was pulled down with a [[Roman Catholic]] dual-purpose school-chapel opening in 1890 near Massey's Barn.\n\nIt is noted that in 1568 Maghull Moss was divided between [[Sir Richard Molyneux]] of [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]] and Edward Hulme of Maghull. The boundary of Maghull was, in the north, Maghull Brook and to the south, Melling Brook; the west was marked by the River Alt. At the eastern edge, however, the boundary was ill-defined on the moorland and due to the value of turf from the moss as a vital fuel this caused regular disputes between both Maghull and [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]] Manors. Maghull Manor House was built in 1638 and local tradition has it that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] slept there during a visit to the area but by 1780 a new manor house had been built near the site of the original and it still stands in the grounds of Maghull Homes with part of the original [[moat]].\n\nIt is also recorded that by 1667 the population of Maghull had increased to 599 with 136 houses and 127 families and by 1770 initial work had begun on the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] with the first sod being cut by [[the Honourable]] Charles Lewis Morduant. The actual spot lies in a rock cutting 400 metres to the east of [[Halsall]] Hill Bridge. Soon after, the Red Lion [[public house]] was built in Maghull to serve the canal trade. It became a caf\u00e9 and general store in the 20th century and was demolished after the [[Second World War]]. Several other canalside pubs were built over the years; for example, near Hall Lane Bridge there was the Traveller's Rest (demolished 1936) and the Horse and Jockey in Melling. In 1774, the canal had reached Maghull and provided it with its second connection to Liverpool. The arrival of the canal created new industry in the area, notably quarrying of [[sandstone]] and [[clay]] extraction. It also bolstered the local [[hostelry]] trade.\n\nMaghull's first school was founded in 1668 in a small cottage in School Lane with the headmaster being Humphries Webster, showing the town's emergence although County Rates from 1716 said of the town \"Maghull doth always bear and pay a third less than either Down Holland or Lidyeat\". This shows that Maghull was a developing community, but still not as rich as its neighbours [[Downholland]] and [[Lydiate]]. Economic development continued with the Molyneux family ([[Earl of Sefton|Earls of Sefton]]) being significantly active in bringing about the Alt Drainage Act in 1779 which resulted in many acres of marsh land along the river eventually becoming good agricultural land. This had led to the growth of the population to 534, with about half the employment being in trade rather than agriculture and a rise in 1815 to a population of 720 people with 71 families engaged in agriculture and 29 in trade, manufactures and handicrafts. There were 108 inhabited houses.\n\nBy the 1820s, horse racing was well established on land in Maghull.<ref>Mutlow, Mick (15 June 2009). \"The Birth of The Grand National: The Real Story\". Thoroughbred Heritage. [http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/racecharts/Steeplechase/GrandNationalEarly.html]. Retrieved 8 April 2010</ref> Old Racecourse Farm later became the site for the Meadows Hotel; and Old Racecourse Road, off Sefton Lane, commemorates the sport. Baines' Directory of Lancashire in 1825 provided the first list of specialist male occupations in Maghull \u2013 1 [[blacksmith]], 1 [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]], 1 [[tailor]], 1 [[Construction surveying|land surveyor]] and 1 [[wheelwright]].\n\nBy 1840 the agriculture of the area had changed from animal to [[agronomy|arable]] farming and the 1861 National Census the population stood at 1,222. Due to this increase in population the [[railway]] came to Maghull in 1849, with a station on the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]] as well as the construction of the town's first [[police station]] which was set up by [[Lancashire County Council]] in 1870 and the town got a second station in 1884, [[Sefton and Maghull railway station|Sefton and Maghull]], on the newly built [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] [[Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway]] to [[Southport]], the line was an extension of the [[North Liverpool Extension Line]]. A large section of embankment has been destroyed to make space for [[Switch Island]]. In 1933 Northway ([[A59 road]]) was built, initially as a tree-lined single carriageway but dualled in the early 1960s, which bisects Maghull, taking travellers from [[Liverpool]] to [[Ormskirk]] off 'Liverpool Road'. The arrival of Northway triggered an increased rate of expansion in Maghull.\n\nIn 1939, the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|IRA]] [[S-Plan#Events June 1939 - December 1939|blew up the swing bridge]] at Green Lane on the canal but the strategic significance of this has never been fully explained due to Maghull's relative insignificance. In the [[Second World War]], three bombs landed, one adjacent to King George V Playing Fields, on the site of the former residential home, and one in Ormonde Drive and one in the middle of The Meadows Hotel bowling green A house that was then 16 Park Lane (now 321, the houses were re-numbered in the late 1960s or early 1970s), Moss Side, was also destroyed; it was rebuilt in the 1950s. It served as a refuge for up to 6,000 people a night from [[Bootle]]. [[United States|American]] and [[Poland|Polish]] army units were stationed in Maghull and it also held several camps for displaced persons. Park Lane [[tuberculosis|TB]] [[sanatorium]] and a hospital, built to treat [[shell shock]] victims, were combined to form [[Ashworth Hospital]] and one hundred patients transferred from [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] with it remaining a secure hospital to this day, holding such patients as [[Ian Brady]]. In 2010, plans were announced by the Labour government that new housing was needed and Sefton East \u2013 where Maghull is \u2013 was chosen as one of the locations for the new homes. [[Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council]] showcased the plans at various locations around south Sefton, and were met by local opposition.\n\n[[File:Westwaytogreen.jpg|thumb|right|The Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Maghull looking towards Leeds from Westway Bridge]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nMaghull is eight miles north-northeast of Liverpool city centre. To the northwest is [[Lydiate]], to the east [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]], to the south [[Aintree]] and [[Netherton, Merseyside|Netherton]] and to the west the Mersey Forest and [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton village]]. Maghull is separated from the rest of the Greater Liverpool sprawl by a [[green belt]] which runs across the Switch Island motorway junction and through which flows the River Alt.\n\n==Governance==\n\nIn 1912, the Maghull & District [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Club]] was founded on Station Road which still stands today. The Maghull Labour Party was formed in 1928. Maghull has been governed as part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Borough of Sefton]] since the [[Local Government Act 1974]], when the boundaries were redrawn. Maghull moved from [[Lancashire]] into [[Merseyside]]. Maghull has had an elected council since the [[Local Government Act 1894]] when the government set up a network of local councils across England. Following the [[Local Government Act 1974]], the council changed its name from a parish to a town council and remains the second largest town council in England. Maghull has working with the neighbouring parishes and villages, as well as [[Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council]] under the banner of the Altside Business Village, to give businesses in the areas a united voice and to promote tourism in the area. For this scheme, Maghull works with [[Aintree]], [[Lydiate]], [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]] and Sefton Village; all of which are connected geographically as being near the [[River Alt]] \u2013 hence the name Altside, and politically as they are all in the eastern parishes of Sefton borough. By 1971 the population of the town stood at 22,794 and gave Maghull the largest population of any [[civil parish]] in the country.\n\nMaghull also has a town council, established by the 1974 Local Government Act. The town council is composed of councillors elected every four years. The council has been under the control of Labour since the 2011 local elections; the Liberal Democrats previously had control. There are 19 seats on the council and the current composition is: Labour 14, Liberal Democrat 5. A by-election took place in north ward in March 2013 in which Labour won the 3 seats available with 54% of the vote. Another by-election took place in North, South and East wards on 25 July 2013 for the seats which had become vacant due to resignations by Labour councillors. The results were a gain for the Liberal Democrats in North and East wards and a gain for Labour in South ward. Maghull town council is made up of four wards: East which elects five councillors, West which elects four councillors, North which elects five councillors, and South which elects two Councillors\n\n==Education==\n\nEducation in the town began with William Harper founding the Maghull School in Damfield Lane, the location of [[Maricourt Catholic High School]], in 1815 under the terms of his will. In 1839, the [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]], later St Andrew's Church of England School, was built and the earlier school, a small cottage, which still stands, became the headmaster's house. Money for the school, which cost \u00a3450 7s 0d (\u00a3450.35p), was raised by local subscription and the school mistress was paid \u00a35 a year, and each scholar had to pay one penny (1d) a month towards the cost of a fire, and tuppence (2d) a month for pens and ink, if they were being taught to write but by 1873 a second storey was added to the school to accommodate the growing population. In 1957, the [[Sisters of Mercy]] created the [[Maricourt Catholic High School]] with all students initially taught in Quarry Brook House with an initial intake of only twelve girls. In 1982, [[Old Hall High School]], formerly Maghull Grammar School, was merged with Ormonde Drive High School to form [[Maghull High School]], concentrating on Ormonde Drive site. Today Maghull contains several primary schools including [[county school|State]], [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Church of England]] schools. There are also three high schools which all contain independent [[Sixth Form]] facilities, working together as part of the Maghull Collaborative. These secondary schools being [[Deyes High School]], [[Maghull High School]] and [[Maricourt Catholic High School]]. As well as serving Maghull, the secondary schools serve pupils from the neighbouring towns in south Sefton, and the neighbouring local authorities of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley]] and [[Liverpool]].\n\n==Transport==\n\nMaghull is bisected by the [[A59 road]] and is served by [[Maghull railway station]] and the [[Maghull North railway station|Maghull North]] railway station, along with bus routes to the nearby areas of Kirkby, Southport, Ormskirk and Liverpool city centre with most running past or near Maghull Square. The [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M58 motorway|M58]] motorways start at [[Switch Island]], between Aintree and Maghull. The [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] runs through the centre of old Maghull. The [[Trans Pennine Trail]], a long distance footpath from [[Southport]] to [[Hornsea]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] skirts Maghull, following the line of the old [[Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway|Cheshire Lines]] railway.\n\n==Shopping==\nMaghull is served by the Central Square Shopping Centre, which is based in the north west of Maghull, which is the original town centre. Known locally as \"the square\", it contains several shops, a police station, numerous banks and nearby is a [[Morrisons]] supermarket. In [[Kennessee Green]] there is a shopping area called Tree View Court. There are also the Meadows shops near to Maghull Town Hall and Deyes Lane shops near the end of Deyes Lane, about five or ten minutes walking distance from Deyes High School. In 2009, Maghull Town Hall was given a large extension costing \u00a38.2million, and which included a library and sports facilities.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Lidl supermarket, Maghull - geograph.org.uk - 1411357.jpg|Supermarket\nFile:Maghull Maths Centre & The Nail Academy.jpg|Shops\nFile:The Square, Maghull - geograph.org.uk - 1411694.jpg|Maghull Square\nFile:Maghull Square - Cool Trader.JPG|Frozen food shop\nFile:Dave's barber shop, Maghull.JPG|Barbers\nFile:Shops on Station Road, Maghull (1).JPG|Station Road shops\nFile:Newsagent in Maghull.JPG|Newsagent\n</gallery>\n\n== Community==\nIn 1929, the Maghull Townswomen's Guild was formed. It later became the Maghull Summerhill Townswomen's Guild and was a [[Registered Charity]], but closed in 2014. The Maghull Community Association on Green Lane provides live entertainment, family fun days and special events such as Christmas parties and ladies nights.\n\n==Media==\n\nThe main local newspapers are the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' (evening) and the ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' (morning). Both are [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s published by the [[Trinity Mirror]] group. There are also two local newspapers, the ''Aintree & Maghull Champion'' and the ''Maghull Star'', both of which are free and are delivered every week either on a Wednesday or a Thursday. The local [[BBC]] radio station is [[Radio Merseyside]]. Maghull is also served by the Liverpool radio stations, and multiple [[North West England|pan-North West]] radio stations. The [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise holder for the town is [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], previously Granada, and the BBC regional news programme is ''[[North West Tonight]]''.\n\nAn online radio station, Maghull Radio, has been running since February 2014 in partnership with Maghull Council and Maghull Community Enterprise. This radio station broadcasts live from Maghull Town Hall and has a variety of shows that combine music, both mainstream and niche, as well as talk shows including news and sport updates.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Esterson|title=Budding Maghull DJs invited to come forward to be the voices of Maghull Radio|url=http://www.billesterson.org.uk/budding-maghull-djs-invited-to-come-forward-to-be-the-voices-of-|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Robertson|title=Maghull Community Radio \u2013 It sounds like a great idea to me|url=http://tonyrobertson.mycouncillor.org.uk/2013/10/31/maghull-community-radio-it-sounds-like-a-great-idea-to-me/|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\n\nMaghull's sport facilities include bowls and tennis next to the town hall and Maghull football and cricket clubs playing at Old Hall Field. Maghull Cricket Club<ref>[http://www.maghullcc.co.uk Maghull Cricket Club Website]</ref> was founded in 1926 and after playing friendly cricket for the 50 years of their existence started playing league cricket in the 1970s. After moving through various junior leagues, they joined the Liverpool and District Competition in 1999. The 1st XI gained promotion to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] Premier League in 2001 before being relegated in 2004. In 2005, they won the First Division title for the 2nd time and rejoined the Premier league in 2006. They were relegated in 2008. The 1st XI captain from the beginning of the 2011 season is batsman John Ring, who led the team to their 3rd First Division Championship in ten years in 2011, returning Maghull to the Premier League for the 2012 campaign. The 2nd XI plays in the 2nd XI First Division and is captained by Liam Gibbons. Gibbons led the side to promotion, and the 1st Division championship, to the 2nd XI Premier Division in 2010, but the side was relegated in 2011. The club has a 3rd and 4th XI, with Andy Buchannon in charge of the 3rds and Gareth Barry responsible for the 4th team. In 2007, the 3rd XI won the 3rd XI First Division championship, and plays in the 3rd XI Premier Division.  2011 saw the 3rd XI win the Embee Trophy and narrowly miss out on the Premier Division championship.  It also saw the 4th XI win promotion to the Premier Division for the first time in the sides history. In 2005, the club entered a team in the Sunday 3rd XI First Division Competition, called the 5th XI. Due to regional boundaries in this league, the team have moved between the East and West divisions. As of 2018, the 1st XI captain is Paul Walter. 2nd XI captain is James Stanley and the 3rd XI and 4th XI are now equal teams being captained by Adam Lloyd and Gareth Lloyd respectively. The 5 XI is now defunct ending in 2016 under the final captaincy of Joe Campbell.\n\nIn the last few years, the 1st XI has slumped to the 2nd Division of the Liverpool Competition but are on the rise. Also, the club has had trouble with the local council over the issue of the rent, this has now been resolved with a new lease being signed in 2017.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th teams play at the Parkhaven Trust, which is situated a few hundred metres from the main Old Hall pitch.\n\n[[Maghull F.C.]] joined the Lancashire Combination in 1972.

[[Historic counties of England|Historically]] in [[Lancashire]], the town is north of [[Liverpool]] and south of [[Ormskirk]] in [[West Lancashire]]. The area also contains [[Ashworth Hospital]].\n\nMaghull had a population of 20,444 at the 2011 Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=11126240&c=Maghull&d=16&e=62&g=6351976&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1433324648775&enc=1|title=Parish population 2011|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Housing in the town is almost entirely a 20th-century settlement of semi-detached and detached housing although remains of the original town do exist. The town has had an elected council since the [[Local Government Act 1894]] when the government set up a network of local governance across England. Following the [[Local Government Act 1974]], the council changed its name from a parish to a town council.\n\nMaghull itself is situated north of the world famous Aintree Village home of the Grand National horse race. A common consensus among residents is that they feel maghull lives in the shadow of the Old Roan and its residents such as the infamous Jack \u201cMomo\u201d Morris. Magwoolians as they are affectionately known to locals by are traditional conservative voters and stern royalists as shown by the constant display of [[British]] and [[England|English]] flags. It is the home of many pubs which are of low quality and pale in comparison to the oldy club just south of Switch Island.\n\n==Etymology==\nIt has been proposed by Dr [[Eilert Ekwall]] that the name Maghull may have been derived from the Celtic word ''*magos'' referring to a plain or field, and the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''halh'' referring to a corner or nook, giving the meaning of a \"flat land in a bend\".<ref name=Ekwall>{{cite book |last=Ekwall |first=Eilert |date=1922 |title=Place Names of Lancashire |language=English |location=Manchester |publisher=The University Press |url=https://archive.org/stream/placenamesoflanc00ekwauoft/placenamesoflanc00ekwauoft_djvu.txt | archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote=The second el. of the name is obviously O.E. halh \" haugh.\" This word here refers to the very gently sloping fields E. of the old mossland along the Alt. The first el. is not easy to explain. It appears to have had the form Magh- [ma3J in the earliest M.E. ; later [3] became [x] perhaps owing to assimilation with the h of the second el., and disappeared. Many names in ''-halh'' have a pers. n. as first el., and it is reasonable to suppose that also that of Maghull is one. But there is no (O.E. or O.N.) pers. n. that fits the name. O.E. mago \" son,\" only used in poetry, might be thought of (cf. Childwall), but there are to my knowledge no other place-names in which the word is used. But O.E. Maga corresponding to O.H.Gr. Mago may well have existed. Another possibility is that the first el. of Maghull, like that of Mayfield, Suss. (Magefeud 1260, Maghfeud 1274, Maghefeld 1316, 1343; Roberts), is the Celtic *magos \"plain\" (Brit. *mag, whence Welsh ma \"place,\" Ir. magh \"plain, field,\" etc.). This derivation seems unexceptionable from the point of view of form and meaning. Brit, mag, i.e., [ma3], would not have lost its final consonant at the time when Lancashire was conquered by the Anglians ; cf . Douglas infra. Maghull occupies a plateau rising slightly over the low-lying land E. and W. This plateau is mostly level and would be aptly described as a plain. If the etymology suggested is correct, we must assume that the Brit, name of it was, or contained, the word mag \"plain.\"  |page=119 & 120}}</ref> Another theorised origin is [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''m\u00e6g\u00f0e'' to refer to [[mayweed]].{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== History ==\n\nThe original settlement, consisting of fifty people and six square miles of agricultural settlement, was established prior to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday Survey]] of 1086 where the town is recorded as Magele on a ridge of high ground, that can be most clearly seen at Red Lion Bridge towards the centre of the town and the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] follows it on the plain and the [[A5147]] on the brow. This ridge marks the edge of the [[flood plain]] of the [[River Alt]], providing protection from flooding and access to this fertile pasture of the plain. A church is known to have existed in the area in 1100 although it has been rebuilt at least once and the chapel still stands, in the [[churchyard]] of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] St Andrew's and is the oldest ecclesiastical building in [[Merseyside]] still in regular use for worship but in 1756 the mediaeval nave of Maghull Chapel was pulled down with a [[Roman Catholic]] dual-purpose school-chapel opening in 1890 near Massey's Barn.\n\nIt is noted that in 1568 Maghull Moss was divided between [[Sir Richard Molyneux]] of [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]] and Edward Hulme of Maghull. The boundary of Maghull was, in the north, Maghull Brook and to the south, Melling Brook; the west was marked by the River Alt. At the eastern edge, however, the boundary was ill-defined on the moorland and due to the value of turf from the moss as a vital fuel this caused regular disputes between both Maghull and [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]] Manors. Maghull Manor House was built in 1638 and local tradition has it that [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] slept there during a visit to the area but by 1780 a new manor house had been built near the site of the original and it still stands in the grounds of Maghull Homes with part of the original [[moat]].\n\nIt is also recorded that by 1667 the population of Maghull had increased to 599 with 136 houses and 127 families and by 1770 initial work had begun on the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] with the first sod being cut by [[the Honourable]] Charles Lewis Morduant. The actual spot lies in a rock cutting 400 metres to the east of [[Halsall]] Hill Bridge. Soon after, the Red Lion [[public house]] was built in Maghull to serve the canal trade. It became a caf\u00e9 and general store in the 20th century and was demolished after the [[Second World War]]. Several other canalside pubs were built over the years; for example, near Hall Lane Bridge there was the Traveller's Rest (demolished 1936) and the Horse and Jockey in Melling. In 1774, the canal had reached Maghull and provided it with its second connection to Liverpool. The arrival of the canal created new industry in the area, notably quarrying of [[sandstone]] and [[clay]] extraction. It also bolstered the local [[hostelry]] trade.\n\nMaghull's first school was founded in 1668 in a small cottage in School Lane with the headmaster being Humphries Webster, showing the town's emergence although County Rates from 1716 said of the town \"Maghull doth always bear and pay a third less than either Down Holland or Lidyeat\". This shows that Maghull was a developing community, but still not as rich as its neighbours [[Downholland]] and [[Lydiate]]. Economic development continued with the Molyneux family ([[Earl of Sefton|Earls of Sefton]]) being significantly active in bringing about the Alt Drainage Act in 1779 which resulted in many acres of marsh land along the river eventually becoming good agricultural land. This had led to the growth of the population to 534, with about half the employment being in trade rather than agriculture and a rise in 1815 to a population of 720 people with 71 families engaged in agriculture and 29 in trade, manufactures and handicrafts. There were 108 inhabited houses.\n\nBy the 1820s, horse racing was well established on land in Maghull.<ref>Mutlow, Mick (15 June 2009). \"The Birth of The Grand National: The Real Story\". Thoroughbred Heritage. [http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/racecharts/Steeplechase/GrandNationalEarly.html]. Retrieved 8 April 2010</ref> Old Racecourse Farm later became the site for the Meadows Hotel; and Old Racecourse Road, off Sefton Lane, commemorates the sport. Baines' Directory of Lancashire in 1825 provided the first list of specialist male occupations in Maghull \u2013 1 [[blacksmith]], 1 [[Cooper (profession)|cooper]], 1 [[tailor]], 1 [[Construction surveying|land surveyor]] and 1 [[wheelwright]].\n\nBy 1840 the agriculture of the area had changed from animal to [[agronomy|arable]] farming and the 1861 National Census the population stood at 1,222. Due to this increase in population the [[railway]] came to Maghull in 1849, with a station on the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]] as well as the construction of the town's first [[police station]] which was set up by [[Lancashire County Council]] in 1870 and the town got a second station in 1884, [[Sefton and Maghull railway station|Sefton and Maghull]], on the newly built [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] [[Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway]] to [[Southport]], the line was an extension of the [[North Liverpool Extension Line]]. A large section of embankment has been destroyed to make space for [[Switch Island]]. In 1933 Northway ([[A59 road]]) was built, initially as a tree-lined single carriageway but dualled in the early 1960s, which bisects Maghull, taking travellers from [[Liverpool]] to [[Ormskirk]] off 'Liverpool Road'. The arrival of Northway triggered an increased rate of expansion in Maghull.\n\nIn 1939, the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|IRA]] [[S-Plan#Events June 1939 - December 1939|blew up the swing bridge]] at Green Lane on the canal but the strategic significance of this has never been fully explained due to Maghull's relative insignificance. In the [[Second World War]], three bombs landed, one adjacent to King George V Playing Fields, on the site of the former residential home, and one in Ormonde Drive and one in the middle of The Meadows Hotel bowling green A house that was then 16 Park Lane (now 321, the houses were re-numbered in the late 1960s or early 1970s), Moss Side, was also destroyed; it was rebuilt in the 1950s. It served as a refuge for up to 6,000 people a night from [[Bootle]]. [[United States|American]] and [[Poland|Polish]] army units were stationed in Maghull and it also held several camps for displaced persons. Park Lane [[tuberculosis|TB]] [[sanatorium]] and a hospital, built to treat [[shell shock]] victims, were combined to form [[Ashworth Hospital]] and one hundred patients transferred from [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] with it remaining a secure hospital to this day, holding such patients as [[Ian Brady]]. In 2010, plans were announced by the Labour government that new housing was needed and Sefton East \u2013 where Maghull is \u2013 was chosen as one of the locations for the new homes. [[Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council]] showcased the plans at various locations around south Sefton, and were met by local opposition.\n\n[[File:Westwaytogreen.jpg|thumb|right|The Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Maghull looking towards Leeds from Westway Bridge]]\n\n==Geography==\n\nMaghull is eight miles north-northeast of Liverpool city centre. To the northwest is [[Lydiate]], to the east [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]], to the south [[Aintree]] and [[Netherton, Merseyside|Netherton]] and to the west the Mersey Forest and [[Sefton, Merseyside|Sefton village]]. Maghull is separated from the rest of the Greater Liverpool sprawl by a [[green belt]] which runs across the Switch Island motorway junction and through which flows the River Alt.\n\n==Governance==\n\nIn 1912, the Maghull & District [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Club]] was founded on Station Road which still stands today. The Maghull Labour Party was formed in 1928. Maghull has been governed as part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Borough of Sefton]] since the [[Local Government Act 1974]], when the boundaries were redrawn. Maghull moved from [[Lancashire]] into [[Merseyside]]. Maghull has had an elected council since the [[Local Government Act 1894]] when the government set up a network of local councils across England. Following the [[Local Government Act 1974]], the council changed its name from a parish to a town council and remains the second largest town council in England. Maghull has working with the neighbouring parishes and villages, as well as [[Sefton Metropolitan Borough Council]] under the banner of the Altside Business Village, to give businesses in the areas a united voice and to promote tourism in the area. For this scheme, Maghull works with [[Aintree]], [[Lydiate]], [[Melling, Merseyside|Melling]] and Sefton Village; all of which are connected geographically as being near the [[River Alt]] \u2013 hence the name Altside, and politically as they are all in the eastern parishes of Sefton borough. By 1971 the population of the town stood at 22,794 and gave Maghull the largest population of any [[civil parish]] in the country.\n\nMaghull also has a town council, established by the 1974 Local Government Act. The town council is composed of councillors elected every four years. The council has been under the control of Labour since the 2011 local elections; the Liberal Democrats previously had control. There are 19 seats on the council and the current composition is: Labour 14, Liberal Democrat 5. A by-election took place in north ward in March 2013 in which Labour won the 3 seats available with 54% of the vote. Another by-election took place in North, South and East wards on 25 July 2013 for the seats which had become vacant due to resignations by Labour councillors. The results were a gain for the Liberal Democrats in North and East wards and a gain for Labour in South ward. Maghull town council is made up of four wards: East which elects five councillors, West which elects four councillors, North which elects five councillors, and South which elects two Councillors\n\n==Education==\n\nEducation in the town began with William Harper founding the Maghull School in Damfield Lane, the location of [[Maricourt Catholic High School]], in 1815 under the terms of his will. In 1839, the [[National school (England and Wales)|National School]], later St Andrew's Church of England School, was built and the earlier school, a small cottage, which still stands, became the headmaster's house. Money for the school, which cost \u00a3450 7s 0d (\u00a3450.35p), was raised by local subscription and the school mistress was paid \u00a35 a year, and each scholar had to pay one penny (1d) a month towards the cost of a fire, and tuppence (2d) a month for pens and ink, if they were being taught to write but by 1873 a second storey was added to the school to accommodate the growing population. In 1957, the [[Sisters of Mercy]] created the [[Maricourt Catholic High School]] with all students initially taught in Quarry Brook House with an initial intake of only twelve girls. In 1982, [[Old Hall High School]], formerly Maghull Grammar School, was merged with Ormonde Drive High School to form [[Maghull High School]], concentrating on Ormonde Drive site. Today Maghull contains several primary schools including [[county school|State]], [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Church of England]] schools. There are also three high schools which all contain independent [[Sixth Form]] facilities, working together as part of the Maghull Collaborative. These secondary schools being [[Deyes High School]], [[Maghull High School]] and [[Maricourt Catholic High School]]. As well as serving Maghull, the secondary schools serve pupils from the neighbouring towns in south Sefton, and the neighbouring local authorities of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley]] and [[Liverpool]].\n\n==Transport==\n\nMaghull is bisected by the [[A59 road]] and is served by [[Maghull railway station]] and the [[Maghull North railway station|Maghull North]] railway station, along with bus routes to the nearby areas of Kirkby, Southport, Ormskirk and Liverpool city centre with most running past or near Maghull Square. The [[M57 motorway|M57]] and [[M58 motorway|M58]] motorways start at [[Switch Island]], between Aintree and Maghull. The [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] runs through the centre of old Maghull. The [[Trans Pennine Trail]], a long distance footpath from [[Southport]] to [[Hornsea]], near [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] skirts Maghull, following the line of the old [[Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway|Cheshire Lines]] railway.\n\n==Shopping==\nMaghull is served by the Central Square Shopping Centre, which is based in the north west of Maghull, which is the original town centre. Known locally as \"the square\", it contains several shops, a police station, numerous banks and nearby is a [[Morrisons]] supermarket. In [[Kennessee Green]] there is a shopping area called Tree View Court. There are also the Meadows shops near to Maghull Town Hall and Deyes Lane shops near the end of Deyes Lane, about five or ten minutes walking distance from Deyes High School. In 2009, Maghull Town Hall was given a large extension costing \u00a38.2million, and which included a library and sports facilities.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Lidl supermarket, Maghull - geograph.org.uk - 1411357.jpg|Supermarket\nFile:Maghull Maths Centre & The Nail Academy.jpg|Shops\nFile:The Square, Maghull - geograph.org.uk - 1411694.jpg|Maghull Square\nFile:Maghull Square - Cool Trader.JPG|Frozen food shop\nFile:Dave's barber shop, Maghull.JPG|Barbers\nFile:Shops on Station Road, Maghull (1).JPG|Station Road shops\nFile:Newsagent in Maghull.JPG|Newsagent\n</gallery>\n\n== Community==\nIn 1929, the Maghull Townswomen's Guild was formed. It later became the Maghull Summerhill Townswomen's Guild and was a [[Registered Charity]], but closed in 2014. The Maghull Community Association on Green Lane provides live entertainment, family fun days and special events such as Christmas parties and ladies nights.\n\n==Media==\n\nThe main local newspapers are the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' (evening) and the ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' (morning). Both are [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s published by the [[Trinity Mirror]] group. There are also two local newspapers, the ''Aintree & Maghull Champion'' and the ''Maghull Star'', both of which are free and are delivered every week either on a Wednesday or a Thursday. The local [[BBC]] radio station is [[Radio Merseyside]]. Maghull is also served by the Liverpool radio stations, and multiple [[North West England|pan-North West]] radio stations. The [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise holder for the town is [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], previously Granada, and the BBC regional news programme is ''[[North West Tonight]]''.\n\nAn online radio station, Maghull Radio, has been running since February 2014 in partnership with Maghull Council and Maghull Community Enterprise. This radio station broadcasts live from Maghull Town Hall and has a variety of shows that combine music, both mainstream and niche, as well as talk shows including news and sport updates.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Esterson|title=Budding Maghull DJs invited to come forward to be the voices of Maghull Radio|url=http://www.billesterson.org.uk/budding-maghull-djs-invited-to-come-forward-to-be-the-voices-of-|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Tony|last=Robertson|title=Maghull Community Radio \u2013 It sounds like a great idea to me|url=http://tonyrobertson.mycouncillor.org.uk/2013/10/31/maghull-community-radio-it-sounds-like-a-great-idea-to-me/|accessdate=18 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Sport==\n\nMaghull's sport facilities include bowls and tennis next to the town hall and Maghull football and cricket clubs playing at Old Hall Field. Maghull Cricket Club<ref>[http://www.maghullcc.co.uk Maghull Cricket Club Website]</ref> was founded in 1926 and after playing friendly cricket for the 50 years of their existence started playing league cricket in the 1970s. After moving through various junior leagues, they joined the Liverpool and District Competition in 1999. The 1st XI gained promotion to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] Premier League in 2001 before being relegated in 2004. In 2005, they won the First Division title for the 2nd time and rejoined the Premier league in 2006. They were relegated in 2008. The 1st XI captain from the beginning of the 2011 season is batsman John Ring, who led the team to their 3rd First Division Championship in ten years in 2011, returning Maghull to the Premier League for the 2012 campaign. The 2nd XI plays in the 2nd XI First Division and is captained by Liam Gibbons. Gibbons led the side to promotion, and the 1st Division championship, to the 2nd XI Premier Division in 2010, but the side was relegated in 2011. The club has a 3rd and 4th XI, with Andy Buchannon in charge of the 3rds and Gareth Barry responsible for the 4th team. In 2007, the 3rd XI won the 3rd XI First Division championship, and plays in the 3rd XI Premier Division.  2011 saw the 3rd XI win the Embee Trophy and narrowly miss out on the Premier Division championship.  It also saw the 4th XI win promotion to the Premier Division for the first time in the sides history. In 2005, the club entered a team in the Sunday 3rd XI First Division Competition, called the 5th XI. Due to regional boundaries in this league, the team have moved between the East and West divisions. As of 2018, the 1st XI captain is Paul Walter. 2nd XI captain is James Stanley and the 3rd XI and 4th XI are now equal teams being captained by Adam Lloyd and Gareth Lloyd respectively. The 5 XI is now defunct ending in 2016 under the final captaincy of Joe Campbell.\n\nIn the last few years, the 1st XI has slumped to the 2nd Division of the Liverpool Competition but are on the rise. Also, the club has had trouble with the local council over the issue of the rent, this has now been resolved with a new lease being signed in 2017.\n\nThe 3rd and 4th teams play at the Parkhaven Trust, which is situated a few hundred metres from the main Old Hall pitch.\n\n[[Maghull F.C.]] joined the Lancashire Combination in 1972. In the 1978\u201379 season, they joined [[Cheshire County League]] as founder members of Division Two, while they were founder members of [[North West Counties League]] in 1982\u201383. In 1992\u201393, they were North West Counties League Division Two Champions but were not promoted due to ground gradings. They left to join the [[West Cheshire League]] in 1999\u201300.<ref>[http://www.fchd.info/MAGHULL.HTM Maghull FC]</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Batting practice at Maghull Cricket Club - geograph.org.uk - 491923.jpg|Cricket Pitch\nFile:Cheshire Lines health club, Maghull.jpg|Gym\n</gallery>\n\n== Notable people==\n<!-- please don't add people here who do not have their own article; they will be removed.

The game was the 83rd edition of the annual [[Rose Bowl Game]], held on [[New Year's Day]] in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The game resulted in a dramatic 20&ndash;17 victory for the Buckeyes when [[Joe Germaine]] led a [[Hurry-up offense#Two-minute drill|last-minute]] touchdown drive. Joe Germaine was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game.<ref name=\"ROSEBOWLPROGRAM\">[http://www.bowlprograms.com/rosebowl/?pg=182 2008 Rose Bowl Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306033551/http://www.bowlprograms.com/rosebowl/?pg=182 |date=March 6, 2008 }}, [[2008 Rose Bowl]]. Accessed January 26, 2008.</ref> The loss remains infamous among Arizona State fans, as the loss cost them a chance at winning their only national championship. Had they won, they would've been the only undefeated team in the nation, and as a result, would've likely given the Devils at least a share of the national championship.\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Ohio State===\n{{see also|1996 Ohio State Buckeyes football team}}\nThe Buckeyes had rolled through the regular season using a two-quarterback system; [[Stanley Jackson (American football)|Stanley Jackson]] and [[Joe Germaine]] split time in each game at QB.  The Buckeye offensive attack was led by [[Outland Trophy]]- and [[Lombardi Award]]-winning tackle [[Orlando Pace]] (who would go on to be the #1 pick in the [[1997 NFL Draft|ensuing]] [[NFL Draft]]) and true freshman wide receiver [[David Boston]], a budding star.  The Buckeyes\u2019 only loss was in the [[Regular season|regular-season]] finale against [[Ohio State-Michigan rivalry|archrival]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], which spoiled their undefeated season and national title hopes; however, OSU had clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl one week before The Game with a win over [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]].  The defense was led by the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, lockdown cornerback [[Shawn Springs]], and true freshman middle linebacker [[Andy Katzenmoyer]].\n\n===Arizona State===\n{{see also|1996 Arizona State Sun Devils football team}}\nThe Sun Devils, meanwhile, were undefeated, ranked <nowiki>#</nowiki>2 in the nation, and had hopes of capturing the school's first national championship in football.  Leading the way for ASU were senior quarterback [[Jake Plummer]], [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] [[Terry Battle]], and a stingy defense led by end [[Derrick Rodgers]] and linebacker [[Pat Tillman]].  Perhaps ASU's most impressive regular-season victory came against [[1996 Fiesta Bowl|defending national champion]] [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], when ASU's defense held the \u2019Huskers scoreless; Arizona State won by a score of 19&ndash;0.\n\n==Game summary==\n===First quarter===\nThe Buckeyes scored first midway through the opening period when [[quarterback]] [[Stanley Jackson (American football)|Stanley Jackson]] threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to [[true freshman]] [[wide receiver|wideout]] [[David Boston]], capping a drive that saw Jackson [[Quarterback scramble|scramble]] for some twenty yards on a third down. [[Josh Jackson (American football kicker)|Josh Jackson]]\u2019s PAT was good, making it 7&ndash;0 in favor of the Buckeyes.  No other scoring ensued in the period, and the Buckeyes led after one, 7&ndash;0.\n\n===Second quarter===\nShortly before halftime, the Sun Devils finally answered via a 25-yard pass play from [[Jake Plummer]] to [[Ricky Boyer]], tying the game after [[Robert Nycz]]\u2019s extra point. [[Instant replay|Replays]] seemed to show that Boyer had trapped the ball against the [[end zone]] turf, but the touchdown stood.  Neither team could manage any more points before [[halftime]], and the game went to the break, still tied at 7&ndash;7.\n\n===Third quarter===\nAfter halftime, the Sun Devils would add a 37-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by Nycz to take a 10-7 lead on the opening drive of the second half.<br/>\nThe Buckeyes countered only two plays later, when [[Joe Germaine]] hit [[Dimitrious Stanley]] on a [[Post route|post pattern]].  ASU corner [[Jason Simmons]] slipped and fell on the turf, and Stanley was off to the races.  72 yards and an [[Point after touchdown|extra point]] later, the Buckeyes were back on top with a 14&ndash;10 lead. <br/>\nNo more scoring ensued in the third, and the teams went to the fourth quarter with the game very much up for grabs.\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nLate in the fourth quarter, the Buckeyes looked to put the game away. [[Pepe Pearson]] broke a long run, leading the Buckeyes from inside their own five-yard line deep into ASU territory.  However, the drive stalled only three plays later, and OSU had to settle for a Josh Jackson field goal attempt.<br/>\nThat was not to be, as ASU's [[Brent Burnstein]] blocked the kick.  ASU [[Defensive end]] [[Derrick Rodgers]] took what appeared to be a lateral and ran the ball into the end zone, but the play was called back:  Rodgers had taken an illegal ''forward'' lateral.  The Sun Devils, however, had the ball with less than five minutes to play.<br/>\nJake Plummer, who had built a reputation over his college career for leading late comeback drives, did just that.  The key play was a fourth down conversion when Plummer hit wideout [[Lenzie Jackson]] for a big gain.  With just over a minute remaining, Plummer [[Quarterback scramble|scrambled]] for eleven yards and a touchdown on third-and-goal, and ASU took the lead, 17&ndash;14.<br/>\nHowever, Germaine was not done.  He led the Buckeyes on a remarkable [[Hurry-up offense#Two-minute drill|last-minute drive]].  Dimitrious Stanley caught two third-down passes from Germaine, and then, with the help of two pass interference penalties against ASU, the Bucks had the ball on the Devils\u2019 five-yard line.  Germaine then flipped a pass to the aforementioned Boston, who was left undefended on a zig-out route &mdash; ASU [[redshirt freshman]] corner [[Courtney Jackson]] had blown the coverage.  Boston walked into the end zone untouched, and the Buckeyes, with 19 seconds left, retook the lead, 20&ndash;17. On the next play, Burnstein blocked Josh Jackson's extra point, leaving the Sun Devils within a field goal.\n\nUltimately, Lenzie Jackson would be tackled in bounds by OSU's Antoine Winfield after catching a pass from Plummer on the second play of the ensuing drive, and time ran out.  The Buckeyes had won the Rose Bowl &mdash; their first victory in the Rose Bowl since [[Archie Griffin]]\u2019s sophomore season.\n\n==Scoring summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Scoring play\n!

The previously-third-ranked [[1996 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] would end up winning the national championship after defeating the then-top-ranked [[1996 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] 52&ndash;20 in the [[1997 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. FSU had defeated the Gators earlier in the [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|season]] by a score of 24&ndash;21. Had the Sun Devils won the game, they would likely had a claim to at least the AP national championship, since they would have been the only undefeated team in the nation.  They ultimately finished fourth in both polls, behind Florida, Ohio State and Florida State.\n\nBuckeye quarterback Joe Germaine, who was named the game's Most Valuable Player, would go on to be named the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football|Big Ten's Most Valuable Player]] during his senior season of [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]].

The game was the 83rd edition of the annual [[Rose Bowl Game]], held on [[New Year's Day]] in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. The game resulted in a dramatic 20&ndash;17 victory for the Buckeyes when [[Joe Germaine]] led a [[Hurry-up offense#Two-minute drill|last-minute]] touchdown drive. Joe Germaine was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game.<ref name=\"ROSEBOWLPROGRAM\">[http://www.bowlprograms.com/rosebowl/?pg=182 2008 Rose Bowl Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306033551/http://www.bowlprograms.com/rosebowl/?pg=182 |date=March 6, 2008 }}, [[2008 Rose Bowl]]. Accessed January 26, 2008.</ref> The loss remains infamous among Arizona State fans, as the loss cost them a chance at winning their only national championship. Had they won, they would've been the only undefeated team in the nation, and as a result, would've likely given the Devils at least a share of the national championship.\n\n==Teams==\n\n===Ohio State===\n{{see also|1996 Ohio State Buckeyes football team}}\nThe Buckeyes had rolled through the regular season using a two-quarterback system; [[Stanley Jackson (American football)|Stanley Jackson]] and [[Joe Germaine]] split time in each game at QB.  The Buckeye offensive attack was led by [[Outland Trophy]]- and [[Lombardi Award]]-winning tackle [[Orlando Pace]] (who would go on to be the #1 pick in the [[1997 NFL Draft|ensuing]] [[NFL Draft]]) and true freshman wide receiver [[David Boston]], a budding star.  The Buckeyes\u2019 only loss was in the [[Regular season|regular-season]] finale against [[Ohio State-Michigan rivalry|archrival]] [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], which spoiled their undefeated season and national title hopes; however, OSU had clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl one week before The Game with a win over [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]].  The defense was led by the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, lockdown cornerback [[Shawn Springs]], and true freshman middle linebacker [[Andy Katzenmoyer]].\n===Arizona State===\n{{see also|1996 Arizona State Sun Devils football team}}\nThe Sun Devils, meanwhile, were undefeated, ranked <nowiki>#</nowiki>2 in the nation, and had hopes of capturing the school's first national championship in football.  Leading the way for ASU were senior quarterback [[Jake Plummer]], [[Halfback (American football)|tailback]] [[Terry Battle]], and a stingy defense led by end [[Derrick Rodgers]] and linebacker [[Pat Tillman]].  Perhaps ASU's most impressive regular-season victory came against [[1996 Fiesta Bowl|defending national champion]] [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]], when ASU's defense held the \u2019Huskers scoreless; Arizona State won by a score of 19&ndash;0.\n\n==Game summary==\n===First quarter===\nThe Buckeyes scored first midway through the opening period when [[quarterback]] [[Stanley Jackson (American football)|Stanley Jackson]] threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to [[true freshman]] [[wide receiver|wideout]] [[David Boston]], capping a drive that saw Jackson [[Quarterback scramble|scramble]] for some twenty yards on a third down. [[Josh Jackson (American football kicker)|Josh Jackson]]\u2019s PAT was good, making it 7&ndash;0 in favor of the Buckeyes.  No other scoring ensued in the period, and the Buckeyes led after one, 7&ndash;0.\n\n===Second quarter===\nShortly before halftime, the Sun Devils finally answered via a 25-yard pass play from [[Jake Plummer]] to [[Ricky Boyer]], tying the game after [[Robert Nycz]]\u2019s extra point. [[Instant replay|Replays]] seemed to show that Boyer had trapped the ball against the [[end zone]] turf, but the touchdown stood.  Neither team could manage any more points before [[halftime]], and the game went to the break, still tied at 7&ndash;7.\n\n===Third quarter===\nAfter halftime, the Sun Devils would add a 37-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by Nycz to take a 10-7 lead on the opening drive of the second half.<br/>\nThe Buckeyes countered only two plays later, when [[Joe Germaine]] hit [[Dimitrious Stanley]] on a [[Post route|post pattern]].  ASU corner [[Jason Simmons]] slipped and fell on the turf, and Stanley was off to the races.  72 yards and an [[Point after touchdown|extra point]] later, the Buckeyes were back on top with a 14&ndash;10 lead. <br/>\nNo more scoring ensued in the third, and the teams went to the fourth quarter with the game very much up for grabs.\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nLate in the fourth quarter, the Buckeyes looked to put the game away. [[Pepe Pearson]] broke a long run, leading the Buckeyes from inside their own five-yard line deep into ASU territory.  However, the drive stalled only three plays later, and OSU had to settle for a Josh Jackson field goal attempt.<br/>\nThat was not to be, as ASU's [[Brent Burnstein]] blocked the kick.  ASU [[Defensive end]] [[Derrick Rodgers]] took what appeared to be a lateral and ran the ball into the end zone, but the play was called back:  Rodgers had taken an illegal ''forward'' lateral.  The Sun Devils, however, had the ball with less than five minutes to play.<br/>\nJake Plummer, who had built a reputation over his college career for leading late comeback drives, did just that.  The key play was a fourth down conversion when Plummer hit wideout [[Lenzie Jackson]] for a big gain.  With just over a minute remaining, Plummer [[Quarterback scramble|scrambled]] for eleven yards and a touchdown on third-and-goal, and ASU took the lead, 17&ndash;14.<br/>\nHowever, Germaine was not done.  He led the Buckeyes on a remarkable [[Hurry-up offense#Two-minute drill|last-minute drive]].  Dimitrious Stanley caught two third-down passes from Germaine, and then, with the help of two pass interference penalties against ASU, the Bucks had the ball on the Devils\u2019 five-yard line.  Germaine then flipped a pass to the aforementioned Boston, who was left undefended on a zig-out route &mdash; ASU [[redshirt freshman]] corner [[Courtney Jackson]] had blown the coverage.  Boston walked into the end zone untouched, and the Buckeyes, with 19 seconds left, retook the lead, 20&ndash;17. On the next play, Burnstein blocked Josh Jackson's extra point, leaving the Sun Devils within a field goal.\n\nUltimately, Lenzie Jackson would be tackled in bounds by OSU's Antoine Winfield after catching a pass from Plummer on the second play of the ensuing drive, and time ran out.  The Buckeyes had won the Rose Bowl &mdash; their first victory in the Rose Bowl since [[Archie Griffin]]\u2019s sophomore season.\n\n==Scoring summary==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Scoring play\n!

The previously-third-ranked [[1996 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] would end up winning the national championship after defeating the then-top-ranked [[1996 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State Seminoles]] 52&ndash;20 in the [[1997 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. FSU had defeated the Gators earlier in the [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|season]] by a score of 24&ndash;21. Had the Sun Devils won the game, they would likely had a claim to at least the AP national championship, since they would have been the only undefeated team in the nation.  They ultimately finished fourth in both polls, behind Florida, Ohio State and Florida State.\n\nBuckeye quarterback Joe Germaine, who was named the game's Most Valuable Player, would go on to be named the [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football|Big Ten's Most Valuable Player]] during his senior season of [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]].

It is a suburban city included in the [[Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nBy 1914 the area around Orange Lake was being called \"new Port Richey\" and the older part of Port Richey was called \"old Port Richey.\" In 1915 a separate post office was established for the residents of the southern part of [[Port Richey, Florida|Port Richey]]. The post office was named New Port Richey, and the name became official. The first postmaster was Gerben DeVries. The growth of the city came about after George Sims purchased the Port Richey Land Company. He built a home in New Port Richey in 1916.\n\nThe first Chasco Fiesta was held in 1922 to raise money for the local library. The event was revived in 1947 and has been held annually since then. It includes a large street parade and a boat parade on successive Saturdays.\n \nIn 1924 New Port Richey was incorporated. The first mayor was Dr. [[Elroy M. Avery]], an educator, historian, and prolific author who came to New Port Richey from [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] after he retired in 1919.<ref name=\"EarlyPasco\">[http://fivay.org/pasco2a.html History of Pasco County - Early Residents of Pasco County] by Jeff Miller (with sources given including 1950 ''[[Funk & Wagnalls]] Encyclopedia'').</ref>\n\nThe first act of the city council was to accept Enchantment Park as a gift from George Sims. The park was renamed [[Sims Park (New Port Richey)|Sims Park]]. The main attractions of the city were the park, the [[Pithlachascotee River]], and Orange Lake.\n\nIn the mid-1920s the city hoped to become a winter home for Hollywood stars. In fact, [[Thomas Meighan]], a leading actor in silent movies, built a large home on the river in 1928 and spent the winters there. He hoped to make movies in New Port Richey. [[Gene Sarazen]], one of the top golfers in the 1920s, also built a home in New Port Richey. He invented the modern [[sand wedge]] in a garage in New Port Richey. Other Hollywood figures such as [[Ed Wynn]] visited New Port Richey. Songwriter [[Irving Berlin]] and bandleader [[Paul Whiteman]] made down payments on property, but did not build homes. In 1926, a new theater named for Thomas Meighan opened, and in 1927, the [[Hacienda Hotel]], a 55-room Spanish-style luxury hotel, was completed. Moon Lake Gardens and Dude Ranch, which featured a private game preserve of 7,000 acres, opened in the 1930s.\n\nThe end of the 1920s [[Florida land boom]] ended the aspirations of New Port Richey to become a haven for Hollywood celebrities, and the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] had a devastating effect on the town.\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, western Pasco County began a decades-long period of rapid population growth, although the population of New Port Richey has not increased much because of the small area which makes up the city. Most of the population of western Pasco County is in unincorporated areas. [[Pasco-Hernando Community College|Pasco-Hernando State College]] began offering classes in New Port Richey in 1972, and completed construction of a campus in 1976.

It is a suburban city included in the [[Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\nBy 1914 the area around Orange Lake was being called \"new Port Richey\" and the older part of Port Richey was called \"old Port Richey.\" In 1915 a separate post office was established for the residents of the southern part of [[Port Richey, Florida|Port Richey]]. The post office was named New Port Richey, and the name became official. The first postmaster was Gerben DeVries. The growth of the city came about after George Sims purchased the Port Richey Land Company. He built a home in New Port Richey in 1916.\n\nThe first Chasco Fiesta was held in 1922 to raise money for the local library. The event was revived in 1947 and has been held annually since then. It includes a large street parade and a boat parade on successive Saturdays.\n \nIn 1924 New Port Richey was incorporated. The first mayor was Dr. [[Elroy M. Avery]], an educator, historian, and prolific author who came to New Port Richey from [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] after he retired in 1919.<ref name=\"EarlyPasco\">[http://fivay.org/pasco2a.html History of Pasco County - Early Residents of Pasco County] by Jeff Miller (with sources given including 1950 ''[[Funk & Wagnalls]] Encyclopedia'').</ref>\n\nThe first act of the city council was to accept Enchantment Park as a gift from George Sims. The park was renamed [[Sims Park (New Port Richey)|Sims Park]]. The main attractions of the city were the park, the [[Pithlachascotee River]], and Orange Lake.\n\nIn the mid-1920s the city hoped to become a winter home for Hollywood stars. In fact, [[Thomas Meighan]], a leading actor in silent movies, built a large home on the river in 1928 and spent the winters there. He hoped to make movies in New Port Richey. [[Gene Sarazen]], one of the top golfers in the 1920s, also built a home in New Port Richey. He invented the modern [[sand wedge]] in a garage in New Port Richey. Other Hollywood figures such as [[Ed Wynn]] visited New Port Richey. Songwriter [[Irving Berlin]] and bandleader [[Paul Whiteman]] made down payments on property, but did not build homes. In 1926, a new theater named for Thomas Meighan opened, and in 1927, the [[Hacienda Hotel]], a 55-room Spanish-style luxury hotel, was completed. Moon Lake Gardens and Dude Ranch, which featured a private game preserve of 7,000 acres, opened in the 1930s.\n\nThe end of the 1920s [[Florida land boom]] ended the aspirations of New Port Richey to become a haven for Hollywood celebrities, and the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] had a devastating effect on the town.\n\nBeginning in the late 1960s, western Pasco County began a decades-long period of rapid population growth, although the population of New Port Richey has not increased much because of the small area which makes up the city. Most of the population of western Pasco County is in unincorporated areas. [[Pasco-Hernando Community College|Pasco-Hernando State College]] began offering classes in New Port Richey in 1972, and completed construction of a campus in 1976. [[Gulf View Square]] shopping mall opened in 1980. In 1995, New Port Richey became sister cities with [[Cavalaire-sur-Mer]] on the French Riviera. Cavalaire Square in downtown was named in honor of that relationship.<ref>{{cite web|title=About New Port Richey|url=http://www.cityofnewportrichey.org|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref> In 2004 President [[George W.
