The show was broadcast in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on [[RT\u00c92]] and in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] on the [[BBC]] under its original Canadian title.\n\n==Scenario==\nThe show took place on or around the fictional Coral Island, and revolved around a group of island-dwelling people called Suntots and a trio of polluting treasure hunters called the Smoggies. The Suntots spent much of their time defending their island paradise from the Smoggies, who polluted everything around them and lived on a coal fired steam ship, the SS ''Stinky Poo'', which polluted the water and air around the island. The Smoggies constantly tried to destroy the Suntots' home for their own benefits.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Smoggies! | date = | url = http://tv.nytimes.com/show/159899/Smoggies-/overview | accessdate = 2009-06-28 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAlmost every episode had the environmentalist Suntots outsmarting the Smoggies latest scheme, after which the Smoggies invariably hatched another scheme. Thus, the show also explains the importance of protecting the environment.\n\nA recurring theme was their attempt to steal the island's \"magic coral\" (which the Smoggies believed granted eternal youth), or find some alternative way to maintain youth. The show often implied that the magic coral did not actually exist, however, and were just manifestations of the Smoggies' (mainly Emma's) greed and vanity.\n\n\n==Casting==\n*[[Stephanie Morgenstern]]: Emma, Princess Lila\n*[[Rick Jones (actor) |Rick Jones]]: Captain Clarence (voice 1), Uncle Boom (voice 1), Sport (voice 1), Scaredy (voice 1), Sailor (voice 1), Choo-Choo (voice 1), Tricks (voice 1), Cool (voice 1)\n*[[Walter Massey (actor) |Walter Massey]]: Polluto\n*[[Terrence Scammell (Canadian actor)|Terrence Scammell]]: Speed (voice 1), Gardener (voice 1)\n*Teddy Lee Dillon: Chip, Additional voices\n*[[Joan Orenstein]]: Miss Doctor\n*Karen Marginson: Cookie, Little, Choosy, Additional voices\n*Pier Paquette: Speed (voice 2), Gardener (voice 2), Sport (voice 2), Cool (voice 2),\n*Harvey Berger: Captain Clarence (voice 2), Uncle Boom (voice 2), Scaredy (voice 2), Sailor (voice 2), Choo-Choo (voice 2), Tricks (voice 2)\n\n==Main characters==\n===The Suntots===\n*'''Princess Lila''': Somewhat taller than other Suntots, her body has more human-like dimensions, as opposed to the pudginess of her subjects. Her hairstyle is also entirely different from the other Suntots and she is the only one with red hair. The rest of the Suntots regard her as a leader. Emma considers her a thorn in her side, but Princess Lila keeps trying to convince Emma that the magic coral doesn\u2019t exist.\n*'''Speed''': Somewhat daring, outspoken and headstrong for a Suntot, his fast-swimming ability earned him his name. He is usually the one to think of a solution to the Suntots' problems. He has bright blue hair, and he and Princess Lila are often partners in their adventures of solving problems; they are the real heroes of the series.\n*'''Chip''': The brilliant orange-haired engineer for the Suntots. Chip invents and builds various things, using environmentally friendly methods. A bit quieter than Speed or Princess Lila, he often joins them on their adventures, but is more of a sidekick, as he rarely takes charge of a situation.\n*'''Uncle Boom''': The oldest Suntot and only one with white hair. He is the self-appointed mayor of Suntot Town. He makes speeches whenever he gets the chance, but is rather absent-minded and bungling.\n\n===The Smoggies===\n*'''Emma''': The self-appointed leader of the Smoggies, she has a short temper and a fear of growing old, and is always trying to think of a scheme to get her way. She always bosses her two cohorts around, and is obsessed with finding the magic coral, thinking that that is what keeps the Suntots young. Polluto calls her \"Miss Emma.\" She is very determined to acquire what she believes allows The Suntots to stay young, the Magic Coral of Youth, and outright refuses to believe that it simply isn't real. She is also a bully and has no qualms about lying or being deceitful in getting her own way.\n*'''Clarence''': Emma's husband and the captain of a polluting coal fired ship called the ''Stinky-Poo''. He is also an inventor and scientist, but his inventions rarely work the right way. Most of the time, he is spineless towards Emma and rarely temperamental, but he can get frustrated himself if things don\u2019t work out. Polluto calls him \"the Captain\" or \"Captain Clarence.\"\n*'''Polluto''': Clarence's only crewmate. He is rather dimwitted, as Emma always points out, but he is the Smoggie with most of the practical skills. He runs the engine room (for some reason, he eats coal and oil), and acts as cook, pilot, mechanic and custodian. He is often shown to have a warm heart, so his polluting tendencies are more related to ignorance and a desire to do his job. Sometimes he is friends with the Suntots but can just as quickly turn against them when ordered to chase them by Emma.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n*'''Other Suntots''': Other recurring Suntots, besides Princess Lila, Speed, Chip and Uncle Boom, are minor or supporting characters, but most were the focus of one or more episodes. Each is named after one overbearing character trait (often related their job).\n**'''Sport''': A yellow-haired all-around talented athlete who wears a sweatband and a number 8 shirt. He is also a bit of a show-off and occasionally acts before thinking. One episode he befriends a bird and ended up being kidnapped by the Smoggies and the Smoggies tied up Sport in a burlap sack. Later, Suntots rescue the bird and him.\n**'''Little''': The youngest Suntot, with bluish-green hair. He is childish, playful, curious and short (even for a Suntot) and has a bit of an inferiority complex.\n**'''Cool''': A laid-back hipster and musician who prefers to work on his songs than do other work. He has light blue hair and sunglasses, and is usually concerned as to whether something is \"cool\".\n**'''Miss Doctor''': The Suntots' doctor, veterinarian and animal life expert. She is calm, logical, motherly and reserved, and has pale green hair and spectacles.\n**'''Gardener''': The Suntots' resident plant life and farming expert. He has dark green hair and spends most of his time growing fruits and vegetables in his greenhouse or on his farm.\n**'''Cookie''': She has pink hair, and all Suntots love anything she cooks. Her focus on her cooking sometimes makes her forget about other things.\n**'''Sailor''': The Suntot who can sail a boat better than anyone. He has navy blue hair, a moustache, and speaks with stereotypical sailor slang and a thick accent.\n**'''Scaredy''': The very easily frightened orange-haired Suntot. Deep down, however, he has hidden courage. He and Sport are best friends.\n**'''Choo-Choo''': The orange-haired, sentimental driver of the steam locomotive \"No. 9\".\n**'''Tricks''': The practical joker with orange hair who occasionally likes frightening Scaredy.\n**'''Choosy''': The yellow-haired Suntot who can never make up her mind about anything.\n**'''Lumber''': The Suntots' pink-haired forestry and conservation expert who can identify any kind of tree by its wood.\n**'''[[Hobo]]''': Purple-haired Suntot who hates having baths. Apart from Sailor and Uncle Boom, he is the only other Suntot with facial hair.\n**'''Town Crier''': The purple-haired Suntot whose only role is to say \"Big meeting in the town square!\"\n*'''Turtle Tom''': A [[sea turtle]] and a friend of the Suntots. He does not speak, but the top of his shell opens like a hatch so that Suntots can ride him above or below the water. He sometimes comes ashore if the Suntots need his strength to help move something.\n*'''Pelican Pete''': A [[pelican]] and another Suntot animal friend who provides air transportation when needed.\n*'''Arnold''': A [[great white shark]] with a friendly disposition. He sometimes helps the Suntots with transport and any tasks that require brute strength deep under water. Despite his pleasant nature, Polluto is terrified of him.\n*'''Winston''': A white [[sperm whale]] who communicates with [[sonar]].

The show was broadcast in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on [[RT\u00c92]] and in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] on the [[BBC]] under its original Canadian title.\n\n==Scenario==\nThe show took place on or around the fictional Coral Island, and revolved around a group of island-dwelling people called Suntots and a trio of polluting treasure hunters called the Smoggies. The Suntots spent much of their time defending their island paradise from the Smoggies, who polluted everything around them and lived on a coal fired steam ship, the SS ''Stinky Poo'', which polluted the water and air around the island. The Smoggies constantly tried to destroy the Suntots' home for their own benefits.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Smoggies! | date = | url = http://tv.nytimes.com/show/159899/Smoggies-/overview | accessdate = 2009-06-28 | work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nAlmost every episode had the environmentalist Suntots outsmarting the Smoggies latest scheme, after which the Smoggies invariably hatched another scheme. Thus, the show also explains the importance of protecting the environment.\n\nA recurring theme was their attempt to steal the island's \"magic coral\" (which the Smoggies believed granted eternal youth), or find some alternative way to maintain youth. The show often implied that the magic coral did not actually exist, however, and were just manifestations of the Smoggies' (mainly Emma's) greed and vanity.\n\n\n==Casting==\n*[[Stephanie Morgenstern]]: Emma, Princess Lila\n*[[Rick Jones (actor) |Rick Jones]]: Captain Clarence (voice 1), Uncle Boom (voice 1), Sport (voice 1), Scaredy (voice 1), Sailor (voice 1), Choo-Choo (voice 1), Tricks (voice 1), Cool (voice 1)\n*[[Walter Massey (actor) |Walter Massey]]: Polluto\n*[[Terrence Scammell (Canadian actor)|Terrence Scammell]]: Speed (voice 1), Gardener (voice 1)\n*Teddy Lee Dillon: Chip, Additional voices\n*[[Joan Orenstein]]: Miss Doctor\n*Karen Marginson: Cookie, Little, Choosy, Additional voices\n*Pier Paquette: Speed (voice 2), Gardener (voice 2), Sport (voice 2), Cool (voice 2),\n*Harvey Berger: Captain Clarence (voice 2), Uncle Boom (voice 2), Scaredy (voice 2), Sailor (voice 2), Choo-Choo (voice 2), Tricks (voice 2)\n\n==Main characters==\n===The Suntots===\n*'''Princess Lila''': Somewhat taller than other Suntots, her body has more human-like dimensions, as opposed to the pudginess of her subjects. Her hairstyle is also entirely different from the other Suntots and she is the only one with red hair. The rest of the Suntots regard her as a leader. Emma considers her a thorn in her side, but Princess Lila keeps trying to convince Emma that the magic coral doesn\u2019t exist.\n*'''Speed''': Somewhat daring, outspoken and headstrong for a Suntot, his fast-swimming ability earned him his name. He is usually the one to think of a solution to the Suntots' problems. He has bright blue hair, and he and Princess Lila are often partners in their adventures of solving problems; they are the real heroes of the series.\n*'''Chip''': The brilliant orange-haired engineer for the Suntots. Chip invents and builds various things, using environmentally friendly methods. A bit quieter than Speed or Princess Lila, he often joins them on their adventures, but is more of a sidekick, as he rarely takes charge of a situation.\n*'''Uncle Boom''': The oldest Suntot and only one with white hair. He is the self-appointed mayor of Suntot Town. He makes speeches whenever he gets the chance, but is rather absent-minded and bungling.\n\n===The Smoggies===\n*'''Emma''': The self-appointed leader of the Smoggies, she has a short temper and a fear of growing old, and is always trying to think of a scheme to get her way. She always bosses her two cohorts around, and is obsessed with finding the magic coral, thinking that that is what keeps the Suntots young. Polluto calls her \"Miss Emma.\" She is very determined to acquire what she believes allows The Suntots to stay young, the Magic Coral of Youth, and outright refuses to believe that it simply isn't real. She is also a bully and has no qualms about lying or being deceitful in getting her own way.\n*'''Clarence''': Emma's husband and the captain of a polluting coal fired ship called the ''Stinky-Poo''. He is also an inventor and scientist, but his inventions rarely work the right way. Most of the time, he is spineless towards Emma and rarely temperamental, but he can get frustrated himself if things don\u2019t work out. Polluto calls him \"the Captain\" or \"Captain Clarence.\"\n*'''Polluto''': Clarence's only crewmate. He is rather dimwitted, as Emma always points out, but he is the Smoggie with most of the practical skills. He runs the engine room (for some reason, he eats coal and oil), and acts as cook, pilot, mechanic and custodian. He is often shown to have a warm heart, so his polluting tendencies are more related to ignorance and a desire to do his job. Sometimes he is friends with the Suntots but can just as quickly turn against them when ordered to chase them by Emma.\n\n===Supporting characters===\n*'''Other Suntots''': Other recurring Suntots, besides Princess Lila, Speed, Chip and Uncle Boom, are minor or supporting characters, but most were the focus of one or more episodes. Each is named after one overbearing character trait (often related their job).\n**'''Sport''': A yellow-haired all-around talented athlete who wears a sweatband and a number 8 shirt. He is also a bit of a show-off and occasionally acts before thinking. One episode he befriends a bird and ended up being kidnapped by the Smoggies and the Smoggies tied up Sport in a burlap sack. Later, Suntots rescue the bird and him.\n**'''Little''': The youngest Suntot, with bluish-green hair. He is childish, playful, curious and short (even for a Suntot) and has a bit of an inferiority complex.\n**'''Cool''': A laid-back hipster and musician who prefers to work on his songs than do other work. He has light blue hair and sunglasses, and is usually concerned as to whether something is \"cool\".\n**'''Miss Doctor''': The Suntots' doctor, veterinarian and animal life expert. She is calm, logical, motherly and reserved, and has pale green hair and spectacles.\n**'''Gardener''': The Suntots' resident plant life and farming expert. He has dark green hair and spends most of his time growing fruits and vegetables in his greenhouse or on his farm.\n**'''Cookie''': She has pink hair, and all Suntots love anything she cooks. Her focus on her cooking sometimes makes her forget about other things.\n**'''Sailor''': The Suntot who can sail a boat better than anyone. He has navy blue hair, a moustache, and speaks with stereotypical sailor slang and a thick accent.\n**'''Scaredy''': The very easily frightened orange-haired Suntot. Deep down, however, he has hidden courage. He and Sport are best friends.\n**'''Choo-Choo''': The orange-haired, sentimental driver of the steam locomotive \"No. 9\".\n**'''Tricks''': The practical joker with orange hair who occasionally likes frightening Scaredy.\n**'''Choosy''': The yellow-haired Suntot who can never make up her mind about anything.\n**'''Lumber''': The Suntots' pink-haired forestry and conservation expert who can identify any kind of tree by its wood.\n**'''[[Hobo]]''': Purple-haired Suntot who hates having baths. Apart from Sailor and Uncle Boom, he is the only other Suntot with facial hair.\n**'''Town Crier''': The purple-haired Suntot whose only role is to say \"Big meeting in the town square!\"\n*'''Turtle Tom''': A [[sea turtle]] and a friend of the Suntots. He does not speak, but the top of his shell opens like a hatch so that Suntots can ride him above or below the water. He sometimes comes ashore if the Suntots need his strength to help move something.\n*'''Pelican Pete''': A [[pelican]] and another Suntot animal friend who provides air transportation when needed.\n*'''Arnold''': A [[great white shark]] with a friendly disposition. He sometimes helps the Suntots with transport and any tasks that require brute strength deep under water.

The Cravinhos brothers went upstairs to the parents' bedroom and hit them with iron bars before strangling them with towels. Suzane was waiting in the living room downstairs. After the murder was accomplished, the three simulated a break-in by pocketing money they found, spreading papers in the library, and creating a mess in the house. Then they left; Suzane and Daniel went to a motel, while Christian went to a fast-food restaurant. Early in the morning, Suzane and Daniel picked up her little brother, Andreas, then aged 15, at an internet cafe and went home, where they \"discovered\" the crime, called the police at once and told them their story.<ref name=\"Epoca20021108\">{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Epoca/0,6993,EPT435540-1653,00.html |title=Monstro em casa|work=Revistaepoca.globo.com |date=2002-11-08 |accessdate=2011-07-22|language=Portuguese}}</ref> \n\nThe investigating officers, however, doubted that the crime was a burglary and suspected that the perpetrators were known to the victims; they soon began to question the children and the employees of the Richthofen family. What made them suspicious was not only the crime scene, with the alarm system switched off and the papers spread very regularly, as if by design, but also Suzane's extraordinarily cold behavior - she was seen in the house's swimming pool with Daniel the day after the murder, and celebrated her 19th birthday with friends just hours after the parents' burial. The investigators focused their attention on Suzane and her boyfriend and began shadowing them. The clue for the arrest came with Christian Cravinhos, who had bought a motorcycle a few days later and paid cash in 100-dollar bills. A few days later, on November 9, 2002 he was arrested, as well as his brother and Suzane, who soon confessed to the murder.<ref name=\"Epoca\" /> Suzane was released from prison in May 2005, when the Supreme Court of Justice granted her [[habeas corpus]].

Also, his [[Working class|lower-class]] background and his unwillingness to work or to attend school caused their disagreement. In July, 2002, her parents were on vacation, so Daniel moved in with the children for a month, much to Suzane's delight. When the parents came back home, Suzane suggested they buy her a flat in which she could live with Daniel, but her father refused, saying that she could do whatever she liked to only if she earned money herself.<ref name=\"Epoca\">{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Epoca/0,6993,EPT449819-1653-2,00.html |title=\nNo rastro de Suzane|publisher=Revistaepoca.globo.com |date=2002-12-06 |accessdate=2011-07-22|language=Portuguese}}</ref> She continued meeting Daniel secretly.

As [[Prosecutor]] Roberto Tardelli put it, Suzane wanted to \"''get her hands on the money and assets her parents had worked so hard to obtain''\"; she \"''wanted her freedom and independence without having to work for it\"''.<ref name=\"BBC Online\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5207124.stm |title=Red Baron heiress killed parents |work=BBC News |date=2006-07-23 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> On trial, Daniel Cravinhos claimed that Suzane was physically violated by her father, which she and her brother Andreas von Richthofen deny.

The trial was delayed and finally started on July 17. On trial, Suzane blamed Daniel Cravinhos for everything, while the Cravinhos brothers claimed that they acted on her wishes. Prosecutor Roberto Tardelli, however, called Suzane the \"mastermind\"<ref name=\"BBC Online\" /> of the crime. Roberto Tardelli called for 50 years imprisonment for each of the three defendants.

While the Cravinhos brothers fitted the stereotype of the uneducated, unemployed, drug-addicted killers, this was not true for Suzane: She was a pretty girl from an upper-middle-class family of German and Lebanese descent, \"well-behaved\", always doing well at school, speaking three foreign languages and doing [[ballet]]. <ref name=\"Berliner Zeitung\" /> A discussion emerged in the Brazilian public about the worth of family values and the effects of education: Does a high standard of education and high class status lead to good character?\nThe question as to whether Suzane was the evil mind behind the crime or just Daniel's tool was also widely discussed. Many people who initially were emotionally on Suzane's side, changed their opinion when a TV interview with her was shown. Before the interview, when the cameras were already on, she was instructed for the interview by her lawyer.

Suzane has a younger brother, Andreas Albert von Richthofen. After graduating from a German high school, Suzane studied law at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of S\u00e3o Paulo]]. In the summer of 1999, she started attending a [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] class and met Daniel Cravinhos de Paula e Silva, who became her boyfriend. \n\nSuzane's family had a declared [[net worth]] of R$5.5 million. However, [[prosecutor]]s suspect that two anonymous accounts in [[Swiss bank]]s, containing at least \u20ac10 million, were opened by Suzane's father in her name in November 2001, when she turned 18. Manfred von Richthofen is thought to have [[embezzlement|embezzled]] this money from DERSA.

The Cravinhos brothers went upstairs to the parents' bedroom and hit them with iron bars before strangling them with towels. Suzane was waiting in the living room downstairs. After the murder was accomplished, the three simulated a break-in by pocketing money they found, spreading papers in the library, and creating a mess in the house. Then they left; Suzane and Daniel went to a motel, while Christian went to a fast-food restaurant. Early in the morning, Suzane and Daniel picked up her little brother, Andreas, then aged 15, at an internet cafe and went home, where they \"discovered\" the crime, called the police at once and told them their story.<ref name=\"Epoca20021108\">{{cite web|url=http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Epoca/0,6993,EPT435540-1653,00.html |title=Monstro em casa|work=Revistaepoca.globo.com |date=2002-11-08 |accessdate=2011-07-22|language=Portuguese}}</ref> \n\nThe investigating officers, however, doubted that the crime was a burglary and suspected that the perpetrators were known to the victims; they soon began to question the children and the employees of the Richthofen family. What made them suspicious was not only the crime scene, with the alarm system switched off and the papers spread very regularly, as if by design, but also Suzane's extraordinarily cold behavior - she was seen in the house's swimming pool with Daniel the day after the murder, and celebrated her 19th birthday with friends just hours after the parents' burial. The investigators focused their attention on Suzane and her boyfriend and began shadowing them. The clue for the arrest came with Christian Cravinhos, who had bought a motorcycle a few days later and paid cash in 100-dollar bills. A few days later, on November 9, 2002 he was arrested, as well as his brother and Suzane, who soon confessed to the murder.<ref name=\"Epoca\" /> Suzane was released from prison in May 2005, when the Supreme Court of Justice granted her [[habeas corpus]].

Also, his [[Working class|lower-class]] background and his unwillingness to work or to attend school caused their disagreement. In July, 2002, her parents were on vacation, so Daniel moved in with the children for a month, much to Suzane's delight.

The trial was delayed and finally started on July 17. On trial, Suzane blamed Daniel Cravinhos for everything, while the Cravinhos brothers claimed that they acted on her wishes.

While the Cravinhos brothers fitted the stereotype of the uneducated, unemployed, drug-addicted killers, this was not true for Suzane: She was a pretty girl from an upper-middle-class family of German and Lebanese descent, \"well-behaved\", always doing well at school, speaking three foreign languages and doing [[ballet]]. <ref name=\"Berliner Zeitung\" /> A discussion emerged in the Brazilian public about the worth of family values and the effects of education: Does a high standard of education and high class status lead to good character?\nThe question as to whether Suzane was the evil mind behind the crime or just Daniel's tool was also widely discussed. Many people who initially were emotionally on Suzane's side, changed their opinion when a TV interview with her was shown. Before the interview, when the cameras were already on, she was instructed for the interview by her lawyer. He told her to cry out loud during the broadcast, to create public sympathy.<ref name=\"Daily Telegraph\" /> In the outcome, however, the interview dealt a major blow to her credibility.

''Reef knot'' itself then is understood as the single slipped version, while the name '''[[shoelace knot]]''' is to indicate double slipped version. Sometimes the name '''bowtie''' also may be used to indicate a double slipped version, but tying a bowtie is usually performed on flat material, and involves a [[slip knot]] of one end holding a bight of the other end i.e. not really a double slipped reef knot. The name \"Square knot\" is also used for completely different other knots such as the mathematical concept of [[Square knot (mathematics)|square knot]], or [[friendship knot]]; this last one earns the name by being flat and drawing a square on one face (and a cross on the other face).\n\n== Uses ==\nThe reef knot is used to tie the two ends of a single rope pieces together such that they will secure something, for example a bundle of objects, that is unlikely to move much.  In addition to being used by sailors for [[reefing]] and [[Furl (sailing)|furling]] sails, it is also one of the key knots of [[macrame]] textiles.<ref name=\"ashley399\">Ashley, pp. 399-400.</ref>\n\nThe knot lies flat when made with cloth and has been used for tying [[bandage]]s for millennia.  As a binding knot it was known to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] as the [[Hercules]] knot (''Herakleotikon hamma'') and is still used extensively in medicine.<ref name=\"hage\">{{citation|doi=10.1007/s00268-007-9359-x|last=Hage|first=J.

A modern use in this manner includes tying the [[Obi (sash)|obi]] (or belt) of a [[martial arts]] [[keikogi]].\n\nWith both ends tucked (slipped) it becomes a good way to tie [[shoelaces]], whilst the non-slipped version is useful for shoelaces that are excessively short.

''Reef knot'' itself then is understood as the single slipped version, while the name '''[[shoelace knot]]''' is to indicate double slipped version. Sometimes the name '''bowtie''' also may be used to indicate a double slipped version, but tying a bowtie is usually performed on flat material, and involves a [[slip knot]] of one end holding a bight of the other end i.e. not really a double slipped reef knot. The name \"Square knot\" is also used for completely different other knots such as the mathematical concept of [[Square knot (mathematics)|square knot]], or [[friendship knot]]; this last one earns the name by being flat and drawing a square on one face (and a cross on the other face).\n\n== Uses ==\nThe reef knot is used to tie the two ends of a single rope pieces together such that they will secure something, for example a bundle of objects, that is unlikely to move much.  In addition to being used by sailors for [[reefing]] and [[Furl (sailing)|furling]] sails, it is also one of the key knots of [[macrame]] textiles.<ref name=\"ashley399\">Ashley, pp. 399-400.</ref>\n\nThe knot lies flat when made with cloth and has been used for tying [[bandage]]s for millennia.  As a binding knot it was known to the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] as the [[Hercules]] knot (''Herakleotikon hamma'') and is still used extensively in medicine.<ref name=\"hage\">{{citation|doi=10.1007/s00268-007-9359-x|last=Hage|first=J.

A modern use in this manner includes tying the [[Obi (sash)|obi]] (or belt) of a [[martial arts]] [[keikogi]].\n\nWith both ends tucked (slipped) it becomes a good way to tie [[shoelaces]], whilst the non-slipped version is useful for shoelaces that are excessively short.  It is appropriate for tying plastic garbage or trash bags, as the knot forms a handle when tied in two twisted edges of the bag.\n\nThe reef knot figures prominently in [[Scouting]] worldwide.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} After Cooke's death, Louisa remained in residence at Donhead Lodge until 1813.{{r|DH:30}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} Formerly of [[Hinton Charterhouse]], she died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of 18th\u201319th century Royal Naval history]]\n\n==Notes==\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\n{{notelist\n | refs=\n{{efn|name = \"EFN:Baptism\"\n | A number of sources, including T.
