In May 1979 he was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, arising from an earlier relationship with [[Norman Josiffe|Norman Scott]], a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and [[Thorpe affair|the furore surrounding it]], ended his political career.\n\nThorpe was the son and grandson of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After reading law at [[Oxford University]] he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered Parliament at the age of 30, rapidly made his mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election of February 1974]], when the party won 6 million votes. Under the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but in a [[hung parliament]], no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, [[Edward Heath]], if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|a minority Labour government]].\n\nThe February 1974 election was the high-water mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Norman Scott began to multiply. Thorpe resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence to avoid being cross-examined by counsel for the prosecution. This left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and did not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by [[Parkinson's disease]]. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of [[apartheid]].\n\n==Family background and early childhood==\n[[File:PMLloydGeorge--nsillustratedwar03londuoft.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[David Lloyd George]], Thorpe's earliest political hero]]\nThorpe was born in [[South Kensington]], London, on 29 April 1929.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=25}} His father was [[John Henry Thorpe]], a lawyer and politician who was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Manchester Rusholme (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Rusholme]] between 1919 and 1923.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=9\u201310}} His mother, Ursula Norton-Griffiths (1903\u20131992), was the daughter of another Conservative MP, [[Sir John Norton-Griffiths, 1st Baronet|Sir John Norton-Griffiths]], widely known as \"Empire Jack\" because of his passionate imperialism.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=15\u201316}} The Thorpe family claimed kinship with distant forebears carrying the name, including [[Robert Thorpe (Lord Chancellor)|Sir Robert Thorpe]], who was briefly [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1372, and [[Thomas Thorpe (speaker)|Thomas Thorpe]], who was [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] in 1453\u201354. There is no direct evidence of any link between these figures and Jeremy Thorpe's family.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe more recent Thorpe ancestors were Irish, stemming from the elder of two brothers who were, according to family tradition, soldiers under Cromwell during the combat in Ireland. Both were rewarded with land; the descendants of the younger brother\u2014from [[County Carlow]]\u2014prospered in [[Dublin]] as [[Sheriff of Dublin City|High Sheriffs]] and [[List of mayors of Dublin|Lord Mayors]], but those of the elder lost their land and became tenant farmers and tradesmen.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=3\u20134}} Jeremy Thorpe's great-grandfather, William Thorpe, was a Dublin policeman who, having been a labourer, joined the police as a constable and rose to the rank of superintendent. One of his many sons, [[John Thorpe (priest)|John Thorpe]], became an Anglican priest and served as [[Archdeacon of Macclesfield]] from 1922 to 1932. The archdeacon's marriage in 1884 to a daughter of the prosperous [[Anglo-Irish]] Aylmer family brought considerable wealth to the Thorpes, as did his elder daughter Olive's marriage into the influential Christie-Miller family of Cheshire. Both John Henry and Jeremy Thorpe would benefit from this connection, as the Christie-Millers paid the costs of their education.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=8\u201310}}\n\nJeremy was his parents' third child, following two sisters.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=3\u20134}} His upbringing was privileged and protected, under the care of [[Nanny|nannies]] and nursemaids until, in 1935, he began attending Wagner's day school in [[Queen's Gate]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=26\u201328}} He became a proficient violinist, and often performed at school concerts.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|p=33}} Although John Henry Thorpe was no longer in parliament, he had maintained many of his political contacts and friendships, and leading politicians were regularly entertained at the Thorpe home. Among the strongest of these friendships was that with the [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] family\u2014Ursula Thorpe was a close friend of the former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister's daughter, [[Megan Lloyd George|Megan]], who became Jeremy's godmother. The former prime minister [[David Lloyd George]], an occasional visitor, became Jeremy's political hero and role model, and helped form his ambitions for a political career in the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=32\u201336}}\n\n==Education==\n\n===Schooling===\nIn January 1938 Jeremy went to [[Cothill House]], a school in [[Oxfordshire]] that prepared boys for entry to [[Eton College|Eton]]. By summer 1939 war looked likely, and the Thorpe family moved from London to the [[Surrey]] village of [[Limpsfield]] where Jeremy attended [[Hazelwood School]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=37\u201339}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Limpsfield-educated-Jeremy-Thorpe-dies|url=http://www.surreymirror.co.uk/Limpsfield-educated-Jeremy-Thorpe-dies/story-25609782-detail/story.html|website=Surrey Mirror|accessdate=10 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112051/http://www.surreymirror.co.uk/Limpsfield-educated-Jeremy-Thorpe-dies/story-25609782-detail/story.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> War began in September 1939; in June 1940, with invasion threatening, the Thorpe children were sent to live with their American aunt, Kay Norton-Griffiths, in [[Boston]]. In September that year Jeremy began at [[The Rectory School]] in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]]. He remained there for three generally happy years; his main extracurricular task, he later recalled, was looking after the school's pigs. In 1943 it was thought safe for the children to return to England, and John Henry used his political connections to secure for Jeremy a passage in the [[Royal Navy]] cruiser [[HMS Phoebe (43)|HMS ''Phoebe'']].{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThorpe started at Eton in September 1943. He proved an indifferent scholar, he lacked sporting aptitude, and although superficially a rebel against conformity, his frequent toadying to authority earned him the nickname \"Oily Thorpe\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=44\u201346}} He also annoyed his fellow-pupils by parading his acquaintance with a range of famous and important people. He offended the school's traditionalists by resigning from the school's cadet force, and shocked others by expressing his intention to marry [[Princess Margaret]], then second in line to the British throne.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=55\u201357}} Thorpe revealed little about his Eton years, beyond his membership of the school orchestra and his winning a cup for his violin playing\u2014he briefly considered the possibility of a career as a professional violinist.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=33\u201334}} His time at Eton was marred by the death of his father in 1944, at the age of 57.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|p=11}}\n\n===Oxford===\n[[File:UK-2014-Oxford-Trinity College 01.JPG|thumb|[[Trinity College, Oxford]]]]\nHaving secured a place at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], Thorpe left Eton in March 1947. In September he began 18 months' [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], but within six weeks was discharged on medical grounds after collapsing while attempting an [[Assault course#Military training|assault course]].{{#tag:ref|As Thorpe had apparently told his friends that he would avoid his national service commitment by simulating a seizure that would convince the medical authorities, it seems likely that the \"seizure\" was a deception.{{sfn|Bloch |2014|p=59}} |group=\"n\"|name=\"assault\"}} As his place at Oxford was unavailable until the following year, Thorpe worked as a temporary preparatory school teacher before his admission to Trinity on 8 October 1948.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=58\u201361, 65}}\n\nThorpe was reading Law, but his primary interests at Oxford were political and social.{{sfn|Glover|2015}} From his earliest undergraduate days he drew attention to himself by his flamboyant behaviour; according to Thorpe's biographer, [[Michael Bloch]], his \"pallid appearance, dark hair and eyes and angular features, gave him a diabolonian air\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=65\u201367}} He was quick to seek political office, initially in the [[Oxford University Liberal Democrats|Oxford University Liberal Club]] (OULC) which, despite the doldrums affecting the Liberal Party nationally,{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=61}} was a thriving club with over 800 members.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=69}} Thorpe was elected to the club's committee at the end of his first term; in November 1949 he became its president.{{sfn|Bloch|2014||pp=71\u201373}} Outside Oxford, Thorpe showed a genuine commitment to Liberalism in his enthusiastic contributions to the party's national election campaigns, and on reaching his 21st birthday in April 1950, applied to have his name added to the party's list of possible parliamentary candidates.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nBeyond the OULC, Thorpe achieved the presidency of the Oxford University Law Society, although his principal objective was the presidency of the [[Oxford Union]], an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster [[Robin Day]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=75\u201380}} His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders\u2014the socialist [[Dick Taverne]] and the Conservative [[William Rees-Mogg]]\u2014to secure the presidency for the [[Hilary term]] of 1951.{{sfn|Glover|2015}}{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=85}}\n\nThorpe's term as president was marked by the range of distinguished guest speakers that he recruited, among them the future [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]], the barrister and former Liberal MP [[Norman Birkett]], and the humorist [[Stephen Potter]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=85\u201386}} The time-consuming nature of his various offices meant that Thorpe required a fourth year to complete his law studies, which ended in the summer of 1952 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Degree classification|third-class honours degree]].{{sfn|Glover|2015}}\n\nAt Oxford Thorpe enjoyed numerous friendships with his contemporaries, many of whom later achieved distinction.{{sfn|Glover|2015}} These were almost exclusively with men; even so, he was not identified as a member of any of Oxford's homosexual sets. He confided to a friend that politics provided him with the necessary level of emotional excitement, thus making sexual relationships unnecessary. Thus, Bloch suggests, he was accepted by his fellow-students as \"a basically asexual character, wrapped up in politics and his career\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=90}}\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Parliamentary candidate===\nHaving been accepted as a potential Liberal parliamentary candidate, Thorpe looked for a constituency. The general elections of 1950 and 1951 had seen the party's MPs fall, first to nine, then six;{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=330}} some commentators saw little future except \"further attrition and further losses to the two major parties\".<ref>{{cite news|title= The Change|newspaper= The Manchester Guardian|date= 27 October 1951|page= 6}}</ref>{{#tag:ref| In 1951, the incoming prime minister [[Winston Churchill]] sought to boost his slender majority by inviting the six Liberals into a formal coalition. This offer was refused by the Liberal leader [[Clement Davies]]. The party's historian David Dutton believes that had the offer been accepted, the Liberal Party might have ceased its independent existence.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=177}}|group=\"n\"|name=\"coalition\"}} The journalist [[Julian Glover (journalist)|Julian Glover]] writes that Thorpe's determination to stay with the party, despite its woes, showed a more principled commitment to Liberalism than many critics have acknowledged; his prospects of reaching parliament would have been considerably greater within either the Conservative or Labour parties.{{sfn|Glover|2015}}\n[[File:Barnstaple Long Bridge and surrounding buildings - geograph.org.uk - 1754403.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barnstaple]], at the heart of the North Devon constituency]]\nInitially the young would-be candidate was offered the opportunity of succeeding the party leader, [[Clement Davies]], in the Welsh seat of [[Montgomeryshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Montgomeryshire]], when Davies decided to retire. There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where the party had long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=96\u201397}} In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]], [[Dingle Foot]], whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring [[North Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|North Devon]] constituency. The [[Torrington (UK Parliament constituency)|Torrington]] local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot saw him as a possible successor in North Cornwall.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=89\u201390}} Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, the party had finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=98}}\n\nThorpe was adopted as North Devon's Liberal candidate in April 1952.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=89\u201390}} His political stance matched that of other young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the [[Radical Reform Group]], to drive the party in that direction.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=103, 117}} He spent much of his spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as [[colonialism]] and [[apartheid]].{{sfn|Glover|2015}} When [[Anthony Eden]], who had succeeded [[Winston Churchill]] as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.{{sfn|Glover|2015}}{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=109\u201310}}\n\n===Barrister-at-law and television journalist===\nIn need of a paid occupation Thorpe opted for the law, and in February 1954 was [[Call to the bar|called to the bar]] in the [[Inner Temple]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=104\u201308}} Initially he found it difficult to earn a living from his fees; he needed another source of income, and found it in television journalism. Thorpe was employed by [[Associated Rediffusion]], at first as chairman of a science discussion programme, ''The Scientist Replies'', and later as an interviewer on the station's major current affairs vehicle ''[[This Week (ITV TV series)|This Week]]'' .{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=112\u201314}} Among various assignments for ''This Week'', he travelled to Ghana in 1957 to cover the country's independence celebrations,{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=115}} and in 1958 he reported from Jordan on a plot to assassinate [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]].{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=42\u201343}} Thorpe was a skilled broadcaster, and in addition to his television work he became a regular guest on the BBC radio programme ''[[Any Questions?]]''{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=116}} In 1959 he was offered the post of chief commentator by Associated Rediffusion, but as the condition was that he gave up his parliamentary candidature, he declined.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|p=45}}\n\nThrough the later 1950s Thorpe juggled his legal and television work with his political duties in North Devon, where he worked tirelessly to build up support.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=116, 127}} From September 1956 the Liberal Party was led by [[Jo Grimond]], a more up-to-date figure than his elderly predecessor Davies, and more in tune with the ideas of Thorpe and the Radical Reform Group. After an uncertain beginning\u2014the Liberals lost one of their six seats to Labour in a February 1957 by-election{{#tag:ref| The seat was [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]], and the victorious candidate was Megan Lloyd George, who had transferred her allegiance to the Labour Party.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=137\u201339}} |group=\"n\"|name=\"carmarthen\"}}\u2014Grimond's leadership began to produce results. The party polled well in a series of by-elections during 1957 and 1958, culminating in a victory at Torrington in March 1958\u2014a seat which the party had not contested in the 1955 general election.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=137\u201339}} Thorpe, who had figured prominently in the Torrington campaign,{{sfn|Glover|2015}} saw this victory in an adjoining Devon constituency as a harbinger of his own future success.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=123}}\n\nThorpe's television and radio work had brought him a measure of celebrity, and his colourful and individualistic campaigning style was widely admired. The journalist [[Christopher Booker]] recalled: \"He had an extraordinary ability both to cheer up his followers and send up his opponents\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=121}} Throughout the 1950s Thorpe was leading a secret homosexual life, at a time when all such activity was illegal in the United Kingdom, and subject to heavy penalties; exposure would have ended his political prospects instantly.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=131\u201332}} This sexual orientation, concealed from the wider public, was known and tolerated in North Devon,{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=142\u201343}} and was at least suspected by many in the wider Liberal Party.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2013|p=442}}\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nThorpe's efforts in North Devon came to fruition in the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|October 1959 general election]], when he won the seat with a majority of 362 over his Conservative opponent\u2014the Liberal Party's solitary gain in what was generally an electoral triumph for [[Harold Macmillan]]'s Conservative government.{{sfn|Chester|1979|p= 29}}<ref>{{cite web|title=1959: 'Supermac' leads Tories to victory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/9/newsid_3095000/3095531.stm |publisher=BBC News|work= On This Day |date=9 October 1959 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |archivedate= 11 October 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011211506/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/9/newsid_3095000/3095531.stm |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Liberals failed to hold their recent by-election gain in the adjoining Torrington seat, which returned to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=184}} |group=\"n\"|name=\"torrington\"}} On 10 November 1959, he made his [[maiden speech]], during a debate on the government's local employment bill.

These results were accompanied by substantial Liberal gains in municipal elections; national opinion polls briefly showed the party on equal terms with the Labour and Conservative parties.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|pp=198\u201399}} This advance was barely reflected in the results of the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|October 1964 general election]]; the party nearly doubled its share of the national vote, to 11.2%, but secured a net gain of only two seats.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=204}}{{sfn|Cook|1998|p=246}} One of the new Liberals was [[Peter Bessell]], who won the Cornish seat of [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]].{{sfn|Ingham|2004}} In North Devon, Thorpe increased his personal majority to over 5,000.{{sfn|Cook|1998|p=143}}\n\nAfter the election, which Labour won with a small majority,{{sfn|Cook|1998|p=143}} Thorpe was seen by many as Grimond's natural successor; his speeches were generally the highlights of the party's annual assemblies, and he strengthened his position when, in 1965, he secured the important post of party treasurer.

Wilson would not countenance the use of troops; the UDI took place on 11 November.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=167\u201368}} In a speech to the [[Liberal Assembly]] in September 1966, Thorpe condemned Wilson's handling of the Rhodesia issue (\"misjudged and misplanned\"), and called for the bombing by United Nations aircraft of the rail link through which the post-UDI Rhodesian government received its oil supplies.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=171\u201375}} The speech delighted the more radical elements in the Liberal Party but outraged many Conservatives, who used the derisive nickname \"Bomber Thorpe\" for the rest of Thorpe's parliamentary career.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=219\u201320}}\n\nIn March 1966 Wilson called an election, hoping to improve his tiny parliamentary majority. He did so, increasing it to almost 100. The Liberals, although their overall share of the vote fell to 8.5%, increased their number of MPs from nine to 12, an indication of success in targeted campaigning under the \"Winnable Seats\" strategy. Thorpe suffered a personal disappointment in North Devon, where his majority dropped to 1,166.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=215\u201316}}\n\n==Party leader==\n\n===1967\u20131970===\nAfter the 1966 election, Grimond confided to senior party officials that he wished soon to step down from the leadership.{{sfn|Beaumont|1997}} Thorpe was now the senior Liberal MP after Grimond, and the party's highest-profile member,{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=147\u201348}} although [[Timothy Beaumont]], chairman of the party's organising committee, noted in his diary: \"I am pretty certain that he has little popularity within the Parliamentary Party\".{{sfn|Beaumont|1997}}{{#tag:ref|Beaumont's diary at this time mentions that \"the question of Jeremy's security standing is an unfortunate one&nbsp;... this might stop him getting a Privy Councillorship\"\u2014indicating an awareness by party officials at this early date that Thorpe's private life might present problems.{{sfn|Beaumont|1997}} |group=\"n\"|name=\"beaumont\"}} When Grimond finally resigned, on 17 January 1967, [[1967 Liberal Party leadership election|an election to replace him]] was arranged to take place within 48 hours, leaving little time for manoeuvring. The 12 Liberal MPs formed the whole electorate; after the first ballot, Thorpe had secured six votes against three each for [[Eric Lubbock]], the Orpington MP, and [[Emlyn Hooson]] who had succeeded to the Montgomeryshire seat.

He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=255}} His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself at odds with the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]], who were advocating policies far to the left of the Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from [[NATO]], and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=147\u201348}} Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=210}} Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=291\u201395}}\n\nThorpe's marriage provided him with a period of emotional stability; a son, Rupert, was born in April 1969.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=296\u201398}} Shortly afterwards, Thorpe received a political boost when the Liberals unexpectedly won a by-election at [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]], in a previously safe Labour seat. This was a solitary success, and the party faced the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|general election of June 1970]] with little confidence.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=149\u201350}} The results justified their gloomy premonitions; the party's share of the vote fell to 7.5%, and seven of its thirteen seats, including Ladywood, were lost. Thorpe barely hung on in North Devon, his majority reduced to 369. Three of his colleagues had comparably small majorities; only Grimond and Hooson were relatively safe.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=211}} Heath's Conservatives secured a 30-seat majority.{{sfn|Ziegler|2010|pp=224\u201325}}{{#tag:ref|Interviewed much later, Thorpe confided that the party had nearly died in 1970: \"If I hadn't survived as an MP I really don't know if there would still be a Liberal Party\".

For the rest of 1970 and for much of 1971, Thorpe was preoccupied with his loss and his plan for a permanent memorial to Caroline.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=315\u201319}} Meanwhile, the party began to recover, chiefly through its adoption of \"[[community politics]]\"\u2014engagement with local rather than national issues\u2014and achieved modest gains in the 1971 local elections.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|pp=212\u201313}}{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=151\u201352}}\n\nBy early 1972, with the monument to Caroline erected on [[Bishop's Tawton|Codden Hill]], Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=340}} In February he assisted the passage through the House of Commons of Heath's [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Bill]], approving the United Kingdom's accession to the [[European Economic Community]]. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's [[second reading]], and it duly became law.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=341\u201342}} By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] was won from Labour, and in the next year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: [[Sutton and Cheam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton]], [[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]], [[Ripon (UK Parliament constituency)|Ripon]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]].{{sfn|Membery|2008}}{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=152\u201354}}\n\nOn 14 March 1973, Thorpe married [[Marion Stein]], a concert pianist and the former wife of [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood]]. The couple had been brought together a year earlier by a mutual acquaintance, the pianist [[Moura Lympany]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=352\u201357}} The year ended less happily for Thorpe, when the secondary banking firm of London & County Securities, of which he had been a director since May 1971, collapsed amid rumours of mismanagement and fraud, marking the start of the [[secondary banking crisis of 1973\u201375]]; the details were not revealed until 1976.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=372\u201376, 439\u201340}} In February 1974, Heath, whose government had been plagued by industrial unrest, called a general election on the issue of \"Who governs Britain?\".{{sfn|Wilson|1979|pp=4\u20135}} During the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|election campaign]] there was evidence of disaffection with both Heath and Wilson, and of a surge in Liberal support. Thorpe was confident that the party would make a significant breakthrough; on election day, 28 February, it secured its highest national vote to date, 6 million, and its highest share of the vote (19.3%) since 1929. Under the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system, these figures translated into just 14 seats. Thorpe's majority in North Devon rose to 11,072.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=155\u201356, 246}}\n\n===Coalition negotiations===\n[[File:Lord Harold Wilson Allan Warren.jpg|thumb| upright|[[Harold Wilson]], who formed a minority Labour government in the wake of the failed Heath-Thorpe coalition talks in March 1974]]\nThe February 1974 general election produced a [[hung parliament]]; neither Labour, with 301 seats, nor the Conservatives, with 297 seats, achieved an overall majority. As was his right as the sitting Prime Minister, Heath did not resign, hoping to persuade the Liberals into a Conservative-led coalition.{{sfn|Dutton|2004}} He met Thorpe on 2 March to discuss possible bases for co-operation, Heath's preferred option being a formal coalition in which Thorpe would be given a cabinet post,{{sfn|Dorey|2009}}{{#tag:ref|Some accounts indicate that Thorpe was offered, or requested, the post of Home Secretary.{{sfn|Membery|2008}}{{sfn|Sandbrook|2013|p=445}} Heath says that Thorpe expressed \"a strong preference for the post\";{{sfn|Heath|1998|p=518}} according to the Cabinet Secretary [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Sir Robert Armstrong]], such an appointment was discussed and dismissed.{{sfn|Ziegler|2010|p=439}} Thorpe denied making any claim to the post, and said that no specific ministry was ever mentioned; he later understood that Heath had in mind \"a Foreign Office job with specific responsibility for Europe\".{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=114\u201315}}|group=\"n\"|name=\"coalition 2\"}} and junior ministries would be allocated to other senior Liberals. As the combined Conservative-Liberal vote amounted to 57% of the electorate, such a government would, Heath thought, have some moral legitimacy. If Thorpe would not accept coalition, a less formal basis of inter-party co-operation might be agreed which would enable the Conservative government to retain office.{{sfn|Dorey|2009}}\n\nThe next day, after discussions with senior colleagues, Thorpe advised Heath that a commitment to electoral reform would be a prerequisite to any arrangement between the two parties. Thorpe proposed that Heath establish a Speaker's Conference whose recommendations on electoral reform would, if acceptable to the Liberals, form the basis of subsequent legislation with full cabinet approval. After further consultations with their parties, the two leaders met again; Heath reported that while his party would not object to a Speaker's Conference, they could not commit themselves in advance to accepting its recommendations, which would be subject to a free House of Commons vote.{{sfn|Dorey|2009}}{{sfn|Heath|1998|p=518}} This was unacceptable to Thorpe, who then made a separate proposal that an all-party \"Government of national unity\" be formed to tackle the urgent economic problems facing the country.{{sfn|Glover|2015}} This idea was rejected by Heath, who resigned on Monday 4 March.{{sfn|Ziegler|2010|pp=441\u201342}}\n\nThorpe later admitted that a coalition agreement would have torn the party apart; the more radical elements, in particular the Young Liberals, would never have accepted it.

In May 1979 he was tried at the [[Old Bailey]] on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, arising from an earlier relationship with [[Norman Josiffe|Norman Scott]], a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and [[Thorpe affair|the furore surrounding it]], ended his political career.\n\nThorpe was the son and grandson of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After reading law at [[Oxford University]] he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered Parliament at the age of 30, rapidly made his mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|general election of February 1974]], when the party won 6 million votes. Under the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but in a [[hung parliament]], no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, [[Edward Heath]], if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of [[Labour government, 1974\u20131979|a minority Labour government]].\n\nThe February 1974 election was the high-water mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Norman Scott began to multiply. Thorpe resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence to avoid being cross-examined by counsel for the prosecution. This left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and did not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by [[Parkinson's disease]]. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of [[apartheid]].\n\n==Family background and early childhood==\n[[File:PMLloydGeorge--nsillustratedwar03londuoft.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[David Lloyd George]], Thorpe's earliest political hero]]\nThorpe was born in [[South Kensington]], London, on 29 April 1929.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=25}} His father was [[John Henry Thorpe]], a lawyer and politician who was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of parliament|MP]] for [[Manchester Rusholme (UK Parliament constituency)|Manchester Rusholme]] between 1919 and 1923.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=9\u201310}} His mother, Ursula Norton-Griffiths (1903\u20131992), was the daughter of another Conservative MP, [[Sir John Norton-Griffiths, 1st Baronet|Sir John Norton-Griffiths]], widely known as \"Empire Jack\" because of his passionate imperialism.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=15\u201316}} The Thorpe family claimed kinship with distant forebears carrying the name, including [[Robert Thorpe (Lord Chancellor)|Sir Robert Thorpe]], who was briefly [[Lord Chancellor]] in 1372, and [[Thomas Thorpe (speaker)|Thomas Thorpe]], who was [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] in 1453\u201354. There is no direct evidence of any link between these figures and Jeremy Thorpe's family.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe more recent Thorpe ancestors were Irish, stemming from the elder of two brothers who were, according to family tradition, soldiers under Cromwell during the combat in Ireland. Both were rewarded with land; the descendants of the younger brother\u2014from [[County Carlow]]\u2014prospered in [[Dublin]] as [[Sheriff of Dublin City|High Sheriffs]] and [[List of mayors of Dublin|Lord Mayors]], but those of the elder lost their land and became tenant farmers and tradesmen.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=3\u20134}} Jeremy Thorpe's great-grandfather, William Thorpe, was a Dublin policeman who, having been a labourer, joined the police as a constable and rose to the rank of superintendent. One of his many sons, [[John Thorpe (priest)|John Thorpe]], became an Anglican priest and served as [[Archdeacon of Macclesfield]] from 1922 to 1932. The archdeacon's marriage in 1884 to a daughter of the prosperous [[Anglo-Irish]] Aylmer family brought considerable wealth to the Thorpes, as did his elder daughter Olive's marriage into the influential Christie-Miller family of Cheshire. Both John Henry and Jeremy Thorpe would benefit from this connection, as the Christie-Millers paid the costs of their education.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=8\u201310}}\n\nJeremy was his parents' third child, following two sisters.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=3\u20134}} His upbringing was privileged and protected, under the care of [[Nanny|nannies]] and nursemaids until, in 1935, he began attending Wagner's day school in [[Queen's Gate]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=26\u201328}} He became a proficient violinist, and often performed at school concerts.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|p=33}} Although John Henry Thorpe was no longer in parliament, he had maintained many of his political contacts and friendships, and leading politicians were regularly entertained at the Thorpe home. Among the strongest of these friendships was that with the [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] family\u2014Ursula Thorpe was a close friend of the former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] prime minister's daughter, [[Megan Lloyd George|Megan]], who became Jeremy's godmother. The former prime minister [[David Lloyd George]], an occasional visitor, became Jeremy's political hero and role model, and helped form his ambitions for a political career in the Liberal Party.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=32\u201336}}\n\n==Education==\n\n===Schooling===\nIn January 1938 Jeremy went to [[Cothill House]], a school in [[Oxfordshire]] that prepared boys for entry to [[Eton College|Eton]].

In September that year Jeremy began at [[The Rectory School]] in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]]. He remained there for three generally happy years; his main extracurricular task, he later recalled, was looking after the school's pigs. In 1943 it was thought safe for the children to return to England, and John Henry used his political connections to secure for Jeremy a passage in the [[Royal Navy]] cruiser [[HMS Phoebe (43)|HMS ''Phoebe'']].{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nThorpe started at Eton in September 1943. He proved an indifferent scholar, he lacked sporting aptitude, and although superficially a rebel against conformity, his frequent toadying to authority earned him the nickname \"Oily Thorpe\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=44\u201346}} He also annoyed his fellow-pupils by parading his acquaintance with a range of famous and important people. He offended the school's traditionalists by resigning from the school's cadet force, and shocked others by expressing his intention to marry [[Princess Margaret]], then second in line to the British throne.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=55\u201357}} Thorpe revealed little about his Eton years, beyond his membership of the school orchestra and his winning a cup for his violin playing\u2014he briefly considered the possibility of a career as a professional violinist.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=33\u201334}} His time at Eton was marred by the death of his father in 1944, at the age of 57.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|p=11}}\n\n===Oxford===\n[[File:UK-2014-Oxford-Trinity College 01.JPG|thumb|[[Trinity College, Oxford]]]]\nHaving secured a place at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], Thorpe left Eton in March 1947. In September he began 18 months' [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]], but within six weeks was discharged on medical grounds after collapsing while attempting an [[Assault course#Military training|assault course]].{{#tag:ref|As Thorpe had apparently told his friends that he would avoid his national service commitment by simulating a seizure that would convince the medical authorities, it seems likely that the \"seizure\" was a deception.{{sfn|Bloch |2014|p=59}} |group=\"n\"|name=\"assault\"}} As his place at Oxford was unavailable until the following year, Thorpe worked as a temporary preparatory school teacher before his admission to Trinity on 8 October 1948.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=58\u201361, 65}}\n\nThorpe was reading Law, but his primary interests at Oxford were political and social.{{sfn|Glover|2015}} From his earliest undergraduate days he drew attention to himself by his flamboyant behaviour; according to Thorpe's biographer, [[Michael Bloch]], his \"pallid appearance, dark hair and eyes and angular features, gave him a diabolonian air\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=65\u201367}} He was quick to seek political office, initially in the [[Oxford University Liberal Democrats|Oxford University Liberal Club]] (OULC) which, despite the doldrums affecting the Liberal Party nationally,{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=61}} was a thriving club with over 800 members.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=69}} Thorpe was elected to the club's committee at the end of his first term; in November 1949 he became its president.{{sfn|Bloch|2014||pp=71\u201373}} Outside Oxford, Thorpe showed a genuine commitment to Liberalism in his enthusiastic contributions to the party's national election campaigns, and on reaching his 21st birthday in April 1950, applied to have his name added to the party's list of possible parliamentary candidates.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nBeyond the OULC, Thorpe achieved the presidency of the Oxford University Law Society, although his principal objective was the presidency of the [[Oxford Union]], an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster [[Robin Day]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=75\u201380}} His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders\u2014the socialist [[Dick Taverne]] and the Conservative [[William Rees-Mogg]]\u2014to secure the presidency for the [[Hilary term]] of 1951.{{sfn|Glover|2015}}{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=85}}\n\nThorpe's term as president was marked by the range of distinguished guest speakers that he recruited, among them the future [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Lord Hailsham]], the barrister and former Liberal MP [[Norman Birkett]], and the humorist [[Stephen Potter]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=85\u201386}} The time-consuming nature of his various offices meant that Thorpe required a fourth year to complete his law studies, which ended in the summer of 1952 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Degree classification|third-class honours degree]].{{sfn|Glover|2015}}\n\nAt Oxford Thorpe enjoyed numerous friendships with his contemporaries, many of whom later achieved distinction.{{sfn|Glover|2015}} These were almost exclusively with men; even so, he was not identified as a member of any of Oxford's homosexual sets. He confided to a friend that politics provided him with the necessary level of emotional excitement, thus making sexual relationships unnecessary. Thus, Bloch suggests, he was accepted by his fellow-students as \"a basically asexual character, wrapped up in politics and his career\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=90}}\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Parliamentary candidate===\nHaving been accepted as a potential Liberal parliamentary candidate, Thorpe looked for a constituency.

There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where the party had long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=96\u201397}} In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]], [[Dingle Foot]], whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring [[North Devon (UK Parliament constituency)|North Devon]] constituency. The [[Torrington (UK Parliament constituency)|Torrington]] local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot saw him as a possible successor in North Cornwall.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=89\u201390}} Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, the party had finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=98}}\n\nThorpe was adopted as North Devon's Liberal candidate in April 1952.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=89\u201390}} His political stance matched that of other young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the [[Radical Reform Group]], to drive the party in that direction.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=103, 117}} He spent much of his spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as [[colonialism]] and [[apartheid]].{{sfn|Glover|2015}} When [[Anthony Eden]], who had succeeded [[Winston Churchill]] as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign.

Thorpe was employed by [[Associated Rediffusion]], at first as chairman of a science discussion programme, ''The Scientist Replies'', and later as an interviewer on the station's major current affairs vehicle ''[[This Week (ITV TV series)|This Week]]'' .{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=112\u201314}} Among various assignments for ''This Week'', he travelled to Ghana in 1957 to cover the country's independence celebrations,{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=115}} and in 1958 he reported from Jordan on a plot to assassinate [[Hussein of Jordan|King Hussein]].{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=42\u201343}} Thorpe was a skilled broadcaster, and in addition to his television work he became a regular guest on the BBC radio programme ''[[Any Questions?]]''{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=116}} In 1959 he was offered the post of chief commentator by Associated Rediffusion, but as the condition was that he gave up his parliamentary candidature, he declined.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|p=45}}\n\nThrough the later 1950s Thorpe juggled his legal and television work with his political duties in North Devon, where he worked tirelessly to build up support.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=116, 127}} From September 1956 the Liberal Party was led by [[Jo Grimond]], a more up-to-date figure than his elderly predecessor Davies, and more in tune with the ideas of Thorpe and the Radical Reform Group. After an uncertain beginning\u2014the Liberals lost one of their six seats to Labour in a February 1957 by-election{{#tag:ref| The seat was [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]], and the victorious candidate was Megan Lloyd George, who had transferred her allegiance to the Labour Party.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=137\u201339}} |group=\"n\"|name=\"carmarthen\"}}\u2014Grimond's leadership began to produce results. The party polled well in a series of by-elections during 1957 and 1958, culminating in a victory at Torrington in March 1958\u2014a seat which the party had not contested in the 1955 general election.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=137\u201339}} Thorpe, who had figured prominently in the Torrington campaign,{{sfn|Glover|2015}} saw this victory in an adjoining Devon constituency as a harbinger of his own future success.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=123}}\n\nThorpe's television and radio work had brought him a measure of celebrity, and his colourful and individualistic campaigning style was widely admired. The journalist [[Christopher Booker]] recalled: \"He had an extraordinary ability both to cheer up his followers and send up his opponents\".{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=121}} Throughout the 1950s Thorpe was leading a secret homosexual life, at a time when all such activity was illegal in the United Kingdom, and subject to heavy penalties; exposure would have ended his political prospects instantly.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=131\u201332}} This sexual orientation, concealed from the wider public, was known and tolerated in North Devon,{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=142\u201343}} and was at least suspected by many in the wider Liberal Party.{{sfn|Sandbrook|2013|p=442}}\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nThorpe's efforts in North Devon came to fruition in the [[1959 United Kingdom general election|October 1959 general election]], when he won the seat with a majority of 362 over his Conservative opponent\u2014the Liberal Party's solitary gain in what was generally an electoral triumph for [[Harold Macmillan]]'s Conservative government.{{sfn|Chester|1979|p= 29}}<ref>{{cite web|title=1959: 'Supermac' leads Tories to victory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/9/newsid_3095000/3095531.stm |publisher=BBC News|work= On This Day |date=9 October 1959 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |archivedate= 11 October 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011211506/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/9/newsid_3095000/3095531.stm |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Liberals failed to hold their recent by-election gain in the adjoining Torrington seat, which returned to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=184}} |group=\"n\"|name=\"torrington\"}} On 10 November 1959, he made his [[maiden speech]], during a debate on the government's local employment bill.

These results were accompanied by substantial Liberal gains in municipal elections; national opinion polls briefly showed the party on equal terms with the Labour and Conservative parties.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|pp=198\u201399}} This advance was barely reflected in the results of the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|October 1964 general election]]; the party nearly doubled its share of the national vote, to 11.2%, but secured a net gain of only two seats.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=204}}{{sfn|Cook|1998|p=246}} One of the new Liberals was [[Peter Bessell]], who won the Cornish seat of [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]].{{sfn|Ingham|2004}} In North Devon, Thorpe increased his personal majority to over 5,000.{{sfn|Cook|1998|p=143}}\n\nAfter the election, which Labour won with a small majority,{{sfn|Cook|1998|p=143}} Thorpe was seen by many as Grimond's natural successor; his speeches were generally the highlights of the party's annual assemblies, and he strengthened his position when, in 1965, he secured the important post of party treasurer. He proved to be an excellent fund-raiser, although his insistence on personal control of much of the party's funds aroused criticism and resentment.{{sfn|Glover|2015}} In July 1965, after the end of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Thorpe toured Central and East Africa, visiting both [[Zambia]] and Rhodesia.{{#tag:ref|The Federation had dissolved in 1964, with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland becoming the separate independent states of Zambia and [[Malawi]].

Wilson would not countenance the use of troops; the UDI took place on 11 November.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=167\u201368}} In a speech to the [[Liberal Assembly]] in September 1966, Thorpe condemned Wilson's handling of the Rhodesia issue (\"misjudged and misplanned\"), and called for the bombing by United Nations aircraft of the rail link through which the post-UDI Rhodesian government received its oil supplies.{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=171\u201375}} The speech delighted the more radical elements in the Liberal Party but outraged many Conservatives, who used the derisive nickname \"Bomber Thorpe\" for the rest of Thorpe's parliamentary career.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=219\u201320}}\n\nIn March 1966 Wilson called an election, hoping to improve his tiny parliamentary majority. He did so, increasing it to almost 100. The Liberals, although their overall share of the vote fell to 8.5%, increased their number of MPs from nine to 12, an indication of success in targeted campaigning under the \"Winnable Seats\" strategy.

Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from [[NATO]], and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=147\u201348}} Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=210}} Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck.

Three of his colleagues had comparably small majorities; only Grimond and Hooson were relatively safe.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=211}} Heath's Conservatives secured a 30-seat majority.{{sfn|Ziegler|2010|pp=224\u201325}}{{#tag:ref|Interviewed much later, Thorpe confided that the party had nearly died in 1970: \"If I hadn't survived as an MP I really don't know if there would still be a Liberal Party\".

In October 1972 [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale]] was won from Labour, and in the next year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: [[Sutton and Cheam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton]], [[Isle of Ely (UK Parliament constituency)|Isle of Ely]], [[Ripon (UK Parliament constituency)|Ripon]] and [[Berwick-upon-Tweed (UK Parliament constituency)|Berwick-upon-Tweed]].{{sfn|Membery|2008}}{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=152\u201354}}\n\nOn 14 March 1973, Thorpe married [[Marion Stein]], a concert pianist and the former wife of [[George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood]]. The couple had been brought together a year earlier by a mutual acquaintance, the pianist [[Moura Lympany]].{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=352\u201357}} The year ended less happily for Thorpe, when the secondary banking firm of London & County Securities, of which he had been a director since May 1971, collapsed amid rumours of mismanagement and fraud, marking the start of the [[secondary banking crisis of 1973\u201375]]; the details were not revealed until 1976.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=372\u201376, 439\u201340}} In February 1974, Heath, whose government had been plagued by industrial unrest, called a general election on the issue of \"Who governs Britain?\".{{sfn|Wilson|1979|pp=4\u20135}} During the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|election campaign]] there was evidence of disaffection with both Heath and Wilson, and of a surge in Liberal support. Thorpe was confident that the party would make a significant breakthrough; on election day, 28 February, it secured its highest national vote to date, 6 million, and its highest share of the vote (19.3%) since 1929. Under the [[first-past-the-post voting]] system, these figures translated into just 14 seats. Thorpe's majority in North Devon rose to 11,072.{{sfn|Cook|1998|pp=155\u201356, 246}}\n\n===Coalition negotiations===\n[[File:Lord Harold Wilson Allan Warren.jpg|thumb| upright|[[Harold Wilson]], who formed a minority Labour government in the wake of the failed Heath-Thorpe coalition talks in March 1974]]\nThe February 1974 general election produced a [[hung parliament]]; neither Labour, with 301 seats, nor the Conservatives, with 297 seats, achieved an overall majority. As was his right as the sitting Prime Minister, Heath did not resign, hoping to persuade the Liberals into a Conservative-led coalition.{{sfn|Dutton|2004}} He met Thorpe on 2 March to discuss possible bases for co-operation, Heath's preferred option being a formal coalition in which Thorpe would be given a cabinet post,{{sfn|Dorey|2009}}{{#tag:ref|Some accounts indicate that Thorpe was offered, or requested, the post of Home Secretary.{{sfn|Membery|2008}}{{sfn|Sandbrook|2013|p=445}} Heath says that Thorpe expressed \"a strong preference for the post\";{{sfn|Heath|1998|p=518}} according to the Cabinet Secretary [[Robert Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Ilminster|Sir Robert Armstrong]], such an appointment was discussed and dismissed.{{sfn|Ziegler|2010|p=439}} Thorpe denied making any claim to the post, and said that no specific ministry was ever mentioned; he later understood that Heath had in mind \"a Foreign Office job with specific responsibility for Europe\".{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=114\u201315}}|group=\"n\"|name=\"coalition 2\"}} and junior ministries would be allocated to other senior Liberals. As the combined Conservative-Liberal vote amounted to 57% of the electorate, such a government would, Heath thought, have some moral legitimacy. If Thorpe would not accept coalition, a less formal basis of inter-party co-operation might be agreed which would enable the Conservative government to retain office.{{sfn|Dorey|2009}}\n\nThe next day, after discussions with senior colleagues, Thorpe advised Heath that a commitment to electoral reform would be a prerequisite to any arrangement between the two parties. Thorpe proposed that Heath establish a Speaker's Conference whose recommendations on electoral reform would, if acceptable to the Liberals, form the basis of subsequent legislation with full cabinet approval. After further consultations with their parties, the two leaders met again; Heath reported that while his party would not object to a Speaker's Conference, they could not commit themselves in advance to accepting its recommendations, which would be subject to a free House of Commons vote.{{sfn|Dorey|2009}}{{sfn|Heath|1998|p=518}} This was unacceptable to Thorpe, who then made a separate proposal that an all-party \"Government of national unity\" be formed to tackle the urgent economic problems facing the country.{{sfn|Glover|2015}} This idea was rejected by Heath, who resigned on Monday 4 March.{{sfn|Ziegler|2010|pp=441\u201342}}\n\nThorpe later admitted that a coalition agreement would have torn the party apart; the more radical elements, in particular the Young Liberals, would never have accepted it. Furthermore, Thorpe said that \"even with our support Heath wouldn't have had a parliamentary majority\";{{sfn|Membery|2008}} without some arrangements with the [[Scottish National Party|Scottish Nationalists]] or the [[Ulster Unionist Party|Ulster Unionists]], the coalition could have been brought down by the first vote on the [[Speech from the throne|Queen's Speech]].{{sfn|Thorpe|1999|pp=114\u201315}} Following Heath's resignation, Wilson formed a minority Labour government.{{sfn|Dutton|2004|p=222}}\n\n===Declining fortunes===\nAs Harold Wilson did not have an overall majority after the February 1974 election, he was widely expected to call another election before too long; he did so in September 1974.<ref name=1929-2014>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/history/thorpe-jeremy/|title=Jeremy Thorpe, 1929\u20132014|author=Julian Glover|publisher=Liberal History|date=20 May 2012|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref> Thorpe anticipated a turning point in the Liberals' fortunes and campaigned under the slogan \"[[one more heave]]\",<ref name=1929-2014/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://peterblack.blogspot.co.uk/2007/09/great-election-slogans.html|title=Great election slogans|author=Peter Black|work=Peter Black's Blog|date=30 September 2007|accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XuiuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=the+liberal+party+%22one+more+heave%22#v=onepage&q=heave&f=false|title=Realignment of the Left?

Bessell met Scott and warned him that his threats against Thorpe might be considered blackmail; he offered to help Scott obtain a new [[National Insurance]] card, the lack of which had been a long-running source of irritation.<ref>{{harvnb|Freeman|Penrose|1997|pp=97\u201399}}</ref> This quietened matters for a while, but within a year Scott was causing trouble again.

His campaign was largely ignored by the national party; of its leading figures only [[John Pardoe]], the MP for [[North Cornwall (UK Parliament constituency)|North Cornwall]], visited the constituency. Thorpe, supported by his wife, his mother and some loyal friends, fought hard, although much of his characteristic vigour was missing. He lost to his Conservative opponent by 8,500 votes.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=517\u201320}} Overall, the Conservatives obtained a majority of 43 seats, and Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Afterward, Thorpe told the ''Daily Mail'' that he had not \"expected to get hammered. You never do\".<ref>''Daily Mail'', 9 May 1979, quoted in Bloch, 1979, p. 521.</ref> The Liberal Party's share of the national vote fell to 13.8%, and its total seats from 13 to 11.

While emphasising Thorpe's distinguished public record,{{sfn|Waugh|1980|p=217}} he was scathing about the principal prosecution witnesses: Bessell was a \"humbug\",{{sfn|Waugh|1980|pp=220\u201321}} Scott a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite\u2014\"but of course he could still be telling the truth.\"{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=539}} Newton was \"determined to milk the case as hard as he can.\"{{sfn|Waugh|1980|pp=225\u201327}} On 20 June the jury retired; they returned two days later and acquitted the four defendants on all charges. In a brief public statement, Thorpe said that he considered the verdict \"a complete vindication.\"{{sfn|Bloch|2014|p=543}} Scott said he was \"unsurprised\" by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench.{{sfn|Chester|1979|p=369}}\n\n==Later life==\nAfter his acquittal, Thorpe announced that he proposed to attend the 1979 Liberal assembly and the forthcoming [[Liberal International]] Congress in Canada.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=545\u201346}} His failure to explain himself under oath was widely criticised in the press,<ref>{{harvnb|Freeman|Penrose|1997|p=364}}</ref> and the public perception was that he had been fortunate to have \"got off\". Reluctantly, Thorpe accepted that there was no future role for him within the Liberal Party, and informed the North Devon association that he would not seek to fight the seat again.{{sfn|Bloch|2014|pp=545\u201346}} Steel expressed the hope that Thorpe would, \"after a suitable period of rest and recuperation&nbsp;... find many avenues where his great talents may be used.\"{{sfn|Waugh|1980|p=238}}\n\nIn his search for a new career Thorpe applied unsuccessfully for the posts of administrator of the [[Aldeburgh Festival]], and race relations adviser to the [[Greater London Council]].

The account, written in French, was said to have been taken from a letter written in cipher from a maid of honour to her cousin in England.<ref>The French text is printed in Martin Royalton-Kisch, ''Adriaen Van de Venne's Album: In the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum'' (London, 1988), and with an English translation in Lisa Jardine, ''Temptation in the Archive'' (London, 2015), pp. 108-119.</ref> The narrative is very different from formal accounts of royal progresses, and [[Elizabeth Dudley, Countess of L\u00f6wenstein]], a daughter of [[John Dudley (1569-1645)|John Dudley]], features in several comic episodes.<ref>Lisa Jardine, ''Temptation in the Archives'' (UCL: London, 2015), pp. 6-15: Mary Anne Everett Green, ''Elizabeth Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia'' (London, 1909), pp. 245-247.</ref>\n\nCroft has been identified as the mistress of \"H\", [[Philipp Moritz, Count of Hanau-M\u00fcnzenberg]], described in [[Frederick V of the Palatinate|Frederick's]] letters.<ref>Nadine Akkerman, ''The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia'', vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 126-8, 142-3: Lisa Jardine, 'In Search of the \"Real\" Doroth\u00e9e van Dorp', ''De Zeventiende Eeuw'', 25 (2009), pp. 44-6.</ref>\n\n[[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]], Elizabeth's son, put in a good word for Croft's brother Herbert Croft with the [[William Laud|Archibishop of Canterbury]] at Oxford in August 1636.<ref>Nadine Akkerman, ''The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia'', vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 519-520.</ref>\n\n==Disgrace and Death==\nShe returned to England in 1637. She had offended Elizabeth, who wanted the exact reasons for her dismissal kept secret, partly because they would prejudice Croft's chances of getting a reward from [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] and partly to prevent their public airing, and told them to [[Richard Cave|Sir Richard Cave]], rather than put them in a letter.<ref>Nadine Akkerman, ''The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia'', vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 594, 643.</ref>\n\nCharles Louis wrote to Elizabeth, his mother, on 24 May 1637 from [[Whitehall Palace]], mentioning an old quarrel he had with Croft, that she had fallen out with his sister [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate]] and that recently she had told [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608\u20131697)|Lord Craven]] he was rude to her. In a second letter of 12 June 1637 from [[Greenwich Palace]] he described how Croft in conversation with [[Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle|Lady Carlisle]] had \"well stitched\" most the characters of Elizabeth's court at [[The Hague]] with \"censure sharp enough\". He wanted her to stay in London where she could do less harm. There was already a troublesome rumour that another lady in waiting, Elizabeth Dudley, Countess of L\u00f6wenstein, had boxed his sister Elisabeth's ear in the [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange's]] garden.<ref>Mary Anne Everett Green, ''Elizabeth Electress Palatine and Queen of Bohemia'' (London, 1909), p. 352: George Bromley, ''A Collection of Original Royal Letters'' (London, 1787), pp. 85, 87-9: Nadine Akkerman, ''The Correspondence of Elizabeth Stuart Queen of Bohemia'', vol. 2 (Oxford, 2012), pp. 602-3, 605-6, suggests the censure was in verses.</ref>\n\nShe died in London in 1637 and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 14 December 1637. In her will she hoped the Queen of Bohemia would settle her debts at [[The Hague]] amounting to \u00a3100. In London she owed Mr Berry in Paternoster Row for white satin for a waistcoat and mohair for a gown.<ref>Joseph Lemuel Chester, ''Westminster Abbey Registers: Harleian Society'', vol. 10 (London, 1869), pp. 64, 132, citing 'Will of Margery Crofts', TNA PROB 11/177/290: Owen George Scudamore Croft, ''House of Croft of Croft Castle'' (Hereford, 1949), p. 92-3 quoting TNA PROB 11/177/290.</ref>\n\n==References==\n* [https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/elizabeth-croft-d-1622-lady-thomas-cave-131660 Portrait of Margaret Croft's sister, Elizabeth Croft, Lady Cave, at Croft Castle, National Trust]\n* [http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/briefwisselingconstantijnhuygens/brieven?reset=1&zk_correspondentid=1266 Huygen's letters to Margaret Croft, Huygens ING]\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Croft, Margaret}}\n[[Category:1637 deaths]]\n[[Category:Women of the Stuart period]]\n[[Category:16th-century English people]]\n[[Category:17th-century English people]]\n[[Category:Burials at Westminster Abbey]]\n[[Category:British maids of honour]]\n[[Category:English courtiers]]\n[[Category:17th-century English women writers]]\n[[Category:People from Herefordshire]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Croft"}

It follows the story of Jeanne, a peasant woman who is raped which leads to her being accused of witchcraft and is notable for its erotic, violent and psychedelic imagery.\n\n==Plot==\nJeanne and Jean are happy newlyweds in a rural village in [[France in the Middle Ages|Medieval France]]. Their idyll is promptly shattered when Jeanne, on her wedding night, is raped in a [[jus primae noctis|ritual deflowering]] by the local baron and his courtiers. She returns to Jean terrified and in pain, and he calms her, saying, \"Let us forget everything in the past\". That night, Jeanne begins to see visions of a phallic-headed spirit who promises her power. As a result, the couple's fortunes rise even as famine strikes the village and the baron raises taxes to fund his war effort. Jean is made tax collector, and the baron cuts off his hand as punishment when he cannot extract enough money from the village. The spirit visits once again (having grown in size) and rapes Jeanne in exchange for more riches. Although she submits her body, she attests that her soul belongs to God. Shortly after, Jeanne takes out a large loan from a usurer and sets herself up in the same trade, eventually becoming the true power in the village.\n\nThen the baron returns victorious from his war, and his wife, envious of the respect and admiration accorded Jeanne, calls her a witch, turning the town against her. Jeanne first tries to return home to Jean, but he refuses to open the door for her and she is assaulted. That evening, when soldiers come to arrest her, she flees into the nearby forest. In the wilderness, she finally makes a [[Deal with the Devil|pact]] with the spirit, who reveals himself to be the Devil. She is granted considerable magical powers, and returns to find the village has been infected with the [[Black death|Bubonic plague]]. Jeanne uses her powers to create a cure for the disease and the village flocks to her for aid. Having won their favor, Jeanne presides over [[orgy|orgiastic rites]] among the villagers. A page, who is in love with the baron's wife, begs Jeanne to help him seduce her. She gives him a potion that causes the baron's wife to accept his advances, but the baron catches his wife sleeping with the page and kills them both. \n\nPerturbed by Jeanne's power, the baron sends Jean to invite her to a meeting. The couple reconcile and Jeanne accepts the invitation. In exchange for sharing her cure for the plague, the baron offers to make Jeanne the second-highest noble in the land, but she refuses, saying she wishes to rule the entire world. Angered at her refusal, the baron orders Jeanne burnt at the stake. Jean is killed by the baron's soldiers when he tries to retaliate, which angers the villagers. As Jeanne is burned, the faces of the villagers transform into Jeanne's, fulfilling a priest's warning that if a witch is burnt while her pride is intact, her soul will survive to influence everyone around her. Centuries later, the influence of Jeanne's spirit initiates [[The French Revolution]].\n\n==Cast==\n* Aiko Nagayama as Jeanne\n* Katsutaka Ito as Jean\n* Tatsuya Tashiro as Witch\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as The Devil\n* Masaya Takahashi as Milord\n* Shigaku Shimegi as Milady\n* [[Masakane Yonekura]] as Catholic Priest\n* Chinatsu Nakayama as Narrator\n\n==Production and release==\n[[File:Belladonna of Sadness title card.png|thumb|350px|The film's title card, showing the original Japanese title \u54c0\u3057\u307f\u306e\u30d9\u30e9\u30c9\u30f3\u30ca, the original English-language title ''La Sorci\u00e8re'' and the U.S.-release title ''Belladonna of Sadness'']]\nDirected and co-written by [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] and inspired by [[Jules Michelet]]'s [[non-fiction]] book ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft]]'', it is the third and final film in the [[Animerama]] trilogy and the only one to be neither written nor directed by [[Osamu Tezuka]] (he left Mushi Production during the film's early stages to concentrate on his [[manga]]<ref name=\"Sharp2006\"/> and his conceptual-stage contribution is uncredited).

Their idyll is promptly shattered when Jeanne, on her wedding night, is raped in a [[jus primae noctis|ritual deflowering]] by the local baron and his courtiers. She returns to Jean terrified and in pain, and he calms her, saying, \"Let us forget everything in the past\". That night, Jeanne begins to see visions of a phallic-headed spirit who promises her power. As a result, the couple's fortunes rise even as famine strikes the village and the baron raises taxes to fund his war effort. Jean is made tax collector, and the baron cuts off his hand as punishment when he cannot extract enough money from the village. The spirit visits once again (having grown in size) and rapes Jeanne in exchange for more riches. Although she submits her body, she attests that her soul belongs to God. Shortly after, Jeanne takes out a large loan from a usurer and sets herself up in the same trade, eventually becoming the true power in the village.\n\nThen the baron returns victorious from his war, and his wife, envious of the respect and admiration accorded Jeanne, calls her a witch, turning the town against her. Jeanne first tries to return home to Jean, but he refuses to open the door for her and she is assaulted. That evening, when soldiers come to arrest her, she flees into the nearby forest. In the wilderness, she finally makes a [[Deal with the Devil|pact]] with the spirit, who reveals himself to be the Devil. She is granted considerable magical powers, and returns to find the village has been infected with the [[Black death|Bubonic plague]]. Jeanne uses her powers to create a cure for the disease and the village flocks to her for aid. Having won their favor, Jeanne presides over [[orgy|orgiastic rites]] among the villagers. A page, who is in love with the baron's wife, begs Jeanne to help him seduce her. She gives him a potion that causes the baron's wife to accept his advances, but the baron catches his wife sleeping with the page and kills them both. \n\nPerturbed by Jeanne's power, the baron sends Jean to invite her to a meeting. The couple reconcile and Jeanne accepts the invitation. In exchange for sharing her cure for the plague, the baron offers to make Jeanne the second-highest noble in the land, but she refuses, saying she wishes to rule the entire world. Angered at her refusal, the baron orders Jeanne burnt at the stake. Jean is killed by the baron's soldiers when he tries to retaliate, which angers the villagers. As Jeanne is burned, the faces of the villagers transform into Jeanne's, fulfilling a priest's warning that if a witch is burnt while her pride is intact, her soul will survive to influence everyone around her. Centuries later, the influence of Jeanne's spirit initiates [[The French Revolution]].\n\n==Cast==\n* Aiko Nagayama as Jeanne\n* Katsutaka Ito as Jean\n* Tatsuya Tashiro as Witch\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as The Devil\n* Masaya Takahashi as Milord\n* Shigaku Shimegi as Milady\n* [[Masakane Yonekura]] as Catholic Priest\n* Chinatsu Nakayama as Narrator\n\n==Production and release==\n[[File:Belladonna of Sadness title card.png|thumb|350px|The film's title card, showing the original Japanese title \u54c0\u3057\u307f\u306e\u30d9\u30e9\u30c9\u30f3\u30ca, the original English-language title ''La Sorci\u00e8re'' and the U.S.-release title ''Belladonna of Sadness'']]\nDirected and co-written by [[Eiichi Yamamoto]] and inspired by [[Jules Michelet]]'s [[non-fiction]] book ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft]]'', it is the third and final film in the [[Animerama]] trilogy and the only one to be neither written nor directed by [[Osamu Tezuka]] (he left Mushi Production during the film's early stages to concentrate on his [[manga]]<ref name=\"Sharp2006\"/> and his conceptual-stage contribution is uncredited). ''Belladonna'' is also of a more serious tone than the more comedic first two Animerama films. Its visuals consist mostly of still paintings panned across<ref name=\"Sharp2006\" /> and are influenced by western art, such as that of [[Gustav Klimt]],<ref name=\"Sharp2006\" /> and [[Tarot]] illustrations (see also the work of [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and [[Harry Clarke]]). Production of the film lasted from 1967 to 1973. The film was a commercial failure and contributed to Mushi Pro becoming bankrupt by the end of the year.<ref name=\"Sharp2006\" /> The film was entered into the [[23rd Berlin International Film
