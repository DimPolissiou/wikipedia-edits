Mutations in this gene may cause a variety of effects on the aforementioned processes.

Since CHRDL1 is a tumor and metastasis suppressor, a mutation in this gene may lead to tumor cell formation.<ref name=\":1\" /> The most major effect a mutation could have is on synaptic stabilization. Since the gene limits synaptic plasticity, a mutation may cause issues in proper synapse maturation, leading to a variety of neurological disorders.<ref name=\":2\" /> There is currently a knockout model for this gene that shows disruption may cause altered synaptic events and reduced synaptic GluA2 AMPARs leading to reduced plasticity.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin | 2}}\n*{{cite journal |author1=Sakuta H |author2=Suzuki R |author3=Takahashi H |author4=Kato A |author5=Shintani T |author6=Iemura Si |author7=Yamamoto TS |author8=Ueno N |author9=Noda M | title = Ventroptin: a BMP-4 antagonist expressed in a double-gradient pattern in the retina | journal = Science | volume = 293 | issue = 5527 | pages = 111\u20135 |date=July 2001  | pmid = 11441185 | doi = 10.1126/science.1058379 | url = }}\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Webb TR, Matarin M, Gardner JC, Kelberman D, Hassan H, Ang W, Michaelides M, Ruddle JB, Pennell CE, Yazar S, Khor CC, Aung T, Yogarajah M, Robson AG, Holder GE, Cheetham ME, Traboulsi EI, Moore AT, Sowden JC, Sisodiya SM, Mackey DA, Tuft SJ, Hardcastle AJ | title = X-linked megalocornea caused by mutations in CHRDL1 identifies an essential role for ventroptin in anterior segment development | journal = Am.
