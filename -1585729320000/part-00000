India is the last country with both lions and tigers in the wild. Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/> from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/>]]\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')<ref name=Geptner /><ref name=CAP /> has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,<ref name=Ortega2007 /><ref name=\"Porter1894\" /> naturalists,<ref name=\"TOTW2010\" /> artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Thespokesmanreview1959\" /><ref name=lat /><ref name=Thomas2006 /><ref name=\"PapersPast1900\" /> In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],<ref name=minn /><ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\" /> where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Humphreys1999 /> The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],<ref name=\"Beatty1941\" /> either deliberately<ref name=lat/><ref name=\"Auguet1994\" /> or accidentally.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"newspaperarchive.com\" />\n\n== Physical and behavioral comparison ==\n\n=== Behavioral comparison ===\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The american biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

The two animals were found fighting each other, in which the keepers made fruitless efforts to part the two animals. Towards the end of the fight, the lion gained a brief advantage, at which point the tiger, while on his back, with swift strikes and using his back legs, tore open the lion's stomach. The lion died after that. The tiger \"Nina Shahib\" was thought to have been mortally injured.

The tiger was more than {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=off}} long, over {{convert|4|ft|cm|abbr=off}} feet at the shoulder, had strong shoulders and long teeth and claws, and was agile. The lion looked taller at the head than the tiger, and had a large mane, legs and paws. The tiger was seen as \"the personification of graceful strength and supple energy,\" whereas the lion was seen as the \"embodiment of massive power and adamantine muscle\".<ref name=\"Lion against tiger\"/> In the fight, both cats sustained injuries, and although the tiger sometimes retreated from Atlas, it would come back to fight it, and in the end, managed to scratch Atlas to death, though Atlas pushed it off in one final move before dying.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight. They retreated from each other, [[limp]]ing into the [[South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests|forest]].{{efn|As reported by ''St. Landry Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"StLandryDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Eaton Democrat'' (1887),<ref name=\"EatonDemocrat1887\"/> ''The Iola Register'' (1887),<ref name=\"IolaRegister1887\"/> ''The Milan Exchange'' (1887),<ref name=\"MilanExchange1887\"/> and ''[[The Sydney Mail]]'' (1889),<ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\"/> in [[chronological order]].}}\n* Rivalry between the Asiatic lion and \"[[Siberia]]n tiger\"{{efn|Though this term was used,<ref name=\"SanFranciscoCall1911\" /> genetic tests showed that the [[Siberian tiger]] was closely related to the [[Caspian tiger]],<ref name=\"CSG2017\" /><ref name=\"Driscolletal2009\" /> which also inhabited the former [[Soviet Union]] (where Siberia is located), and whose range would have overlapped with that of the lion in places like the Caucasus.<ref name=\"Geptner\" />}} is mentioned in Hamilton M.

As with the lion,<ref name=Geptner/> the tiger's Persian name was used for people and places.<ref name=Humphreys1999/>\n\n=== Economics ===\nThe term \"[[tiger economy]]\" has been applied to Asian countries that have undergone rapid economic growth, and the term \"[[Tiger economy#Similar|lion economy]]\" to their African counterparts. The two sides, nicknamed \"Asian tigers\" and \"African lions\", have also been compared.<ref name=\"Berendsen_al2013\"/><ref name=\"Bowditch1999\"/>\n\n=== Cinema ===\nIn ''[[Paalai]]'', a 2011 [[Tamil language|Tamil]] film, there is dialogue about the characteristics of the tiger and lion. It concludes that the tiger is superior. In the film, the tiger is the symbol and flag of the native Tamil tribal people and the lion is the symbol and flag of non-Tamil [[Singhal]] (literally meaning 'Leonine') people.<ref name=Imbd/>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Animal Face-Off#Episodes|Animal Face-Off]]''\n* [[Baiting (blood sport)|Baiting]]\n* [[Lion-baiting#19th century|Lion-baiting]]\n* ''[[Lions, Tigers and Bears (comics)|Lions, Tigers and Bears]]''\n* ''[[The Jeff Corwin Experience]]'' Episode 10 \u2014 \"India: Between the Tiger and the Lion\"\n* [[Tyavarekoppa Lion and Tiger Safari]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Auguet1994>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aVhXYli82rAC&pg=PA85|title=Cruelty and civilization: the Roman games|author=Roland Auguet|year=1994|isbn=978-0-415-10453-1}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BBC2010>{{cite news|title=Tiger Kills Lion In Turkish Zoo|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12669308|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 March 2011|date=7 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110312010616/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12669308 |archive-date=12 March 2011 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BBC2011GoB>{{cite news|last=Lawson|first=Alastair|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16051168|title=Indian maharajah's daring act of anti-colonial dissent|work=BBC News|date=10 December 2011|accessdate=10 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210174133/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-16051168 |archive-date=10 December 2011 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=BCKM1993>{{cite book|author=Brakefield, Tom|title=Big Cats: Kingdom of Might|publisher=Voyageur Press|url=https://archive.org/details/bigcatskingdomof0000brak|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/bigcatskingdomof0000brak/page/44 44]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-89658-329-0 |access-date=18 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Beatty1941>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yYRCAAAAIAAJ&q=lion+tiger|title=Jungle performers|author=Clyde Beatty, Earl Wilson|year=1941}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Beinglion2005-2014\">{{cite web|title=Barbary Lion Information|url=http://beinglion.com/barbary-lions.php|publisher=Beinglion.com|accessdate=29 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903224800/http://beinglion.com/barbary-lions.php |archive-date=3 September 2013 |url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Berendsen_al2013\">{{cite book|last1=Berendsen|first1=Bernard|last2=Dietz|first2=Ton|last3=Schulte Nordholt|first3=H.

India is the last country with both lions and tigers in the wild. Historically, the modern lion and tiger co-occupied a vast portion of [[Eurasia]],<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/> from India in the east, through northern [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], to the shores of the [[Black Sea]] in the west.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/>]]\n\nHistorically, a comparison of the [[tiger]] (''Panthera tigris'') versus the [[lion]] (''Panthera leo'')<ref name=Geptner /><ref name=CAP /> has been a popular topic of discussion by [[hunter]]s,<ref name=Ortega2007 /><ref name=\"Porter1894\" /> naturalists,<ref name=\"TOTW2010\" /> artists, and poets, and continues to inspire the popular imagination.<ref name=\"Thespokesmanreview1959\" /><ref name=lat /><ref name=Thomas2006 /><ref name=\"PapersPast1900\" /> In the past, lions and tigers reportedly [[#Competition or coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness|competed in the wilderness]],<ref name=minn /><ref name=\"SydneyMail1889\" /> where their ranges overlapped in [[Eurasia]].<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Humphreys1999 /> The most common reported circumstance of their meeting is in [[Captive animal|captivity]],<ref name=\"Beatty1941\" /> either deliberately<ref name=lat/><ref name=\"Auguet1994\" /> or accidentally.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"newspaperarchive.com\" />\n\n== Physical and behavioral comparison ==\n\n=== Behavioral comparison ===\nBoth the lion and the tiger have fearsome reputations in their native areas in relation to prey, [[sympatric]] predators, and people. Both may [[Man-eater|prey on humans]], though rates of man-eating tend to be higher for the [[Tiger attack|tiger]].<ref name=\"Porter1894\"/><ref name=\"BCKM1993\"/> \n\nGeneral differences in behavior:\n\n* The lion is usually a [[social animal]], while the tiger is [[Solitary animal|solitary]]. For this reason, even if tigers had individual advantages over lions, such as in intelligence, lions often killed tigers in captivity by ganging up on them, whereas tigers tended not to form fighting gangs.<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\" />\n* Lions roam in prides of up to 30 individuals headed by a mature male or group of related males, until an incumbent male is killed or driven away by a new male leader. The majority of single roaming lions tend to be males preparing for maturation and assimilation with a new or existing pride. While male lions are generally larger and stronger than female lions, it is the close-knit female pride alliance that typically hunts and provides for the pride. By contrast, tigers are often solitary,<ref name=\"Kirk Bates\"/> though they do socialize.<ref name=CAP/> During a mating tryst, a tiger and tigress are hostile to other creatures, with the same applying to lions.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\nMore specifically, however, the Asiatic lion has similarities and differences with both its African relative and the tiger. For example, Asiatic lions are social like their African relatives, and females may be [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]].<ref name=Schaller1972/> However, the structures of the prides of African and Asiatic lions vary,<ref name=S&S02/> with male Asiatic lions usually associating with females during times of mating,<ref name=\"Joslin1973\" /><ref name=\"Meena2008\" /> similar to tigers,<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Pocock1939/> and whereas Asiatic lionesses and tigresses may practice promiscuity in order to defend their [[Cub (organism)|cub]]s, African lionesses are believed not to do it for that purpose.<ref name=\"HT2016\" />\n\n== Coexistence in the Eurasian wilderness ==\nCurrently, India is the only country confirmed to have both wild lions and tigers, specifically [[Asiatic lion]]s and [[Bengal tiger]]s.<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Partington1835 /><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997 /> Though they do not share the same territory, they did in the past,<ref name=minn/><ref name=ToT1838/><ref name=Pocock1939 /><ref name=Karanth03 /> and there is a project mentioned below that could lead to their meeting in the wild.<ref name=\"cambridge\" /><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\" />\n\nBefore the end of the 20th century, Asiatic lions<ref name=Haas2005 /><ref name=Catsg /> and [[Caspian tiger]]s<ref name=Mazak1981 /><ref name=Luo04 /> had occurred in other [[Asia]]n<ref name=\"Tudge2011\" /> or Eurasian nations, including [[Iran]].<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Shankaranarayananetal1997/><ref name=Pocock1939/> As such, there is a word for 'Lion',<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Humphreys1999/><ref name=Catsg/> which can also mean 'Tiger',<ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Kipling /> and is used in Iran, [[South Asia]] and other areas, that is 'Sher' or 'Shir' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|\u0634\u06cc\u0631}}}}),<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" /> and its significance is discussed below.\n\nAccording to Colin Tudge (2011), given that both cats hunt large [[herbivore]]s, it is likely that they had been in competition in Asia. Despite their social nature, lions might have competed with tigers on an individual basis, as they would with each other.<ref name=\"Tudge2011\"/>\n\nApart from the possibility of competition, there are legends of Asiatic lions and tigers breeding to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] offspring, which would be [[liger]]s or [[tigon]]s.<ref name=messybeast2012 /><ref name=\"ligerfacts.org\" /><ref name=\"krypto\" /><ref name=\"lair\" /><ref name=shi /> From the [[fossil]] record, besides [[genetics]],<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Luo04/><ref name=\"KitchenerDugmore2000\" /> it would appear that the modern lion and tiger were present in Eurasia since the [[Pleistocene]], when now-extinct relatives also existed there.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=Haas2005/><ref name=Mazak1981/> Additionally, in the days before [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]], the [[Maharaja of Gwalior]] introduced African lions into [[Gwalior|his area]], which is a habitat for Bengal tigers.<ref name=\"Jhaletal2011\" />\n\n[[File:Asiatic Lion Gir Forest.jpg|left|thumb|An Asiatic lion in [[Gir Forest]], [[Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests]]' [[ecoregion]], India]]\n[[File:Ranthambore Tiger Reserve (3619932614).jpg|right|thumb|T-12 the Bengal tiger in [[Ranthambore National Park]], Kathiawar-Gir dry deciduous forests' ecoregion, India]]\nThe possibility of conflict between lions and tigers had been raised in relation to India's [[Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project]], which was meant to introduce the Gir Forest's lions to another reserve which is considered to be within the former range of the Asiatic lion, that is [[Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary]] in Madhya Pradesh,<ref name=\"cambridge\"/> before December 2017.<ref name=\"HT 2017\" /><ref name=\"TOI 12-2017\" /> Kuno was reported to contain some tigers that came from Ranthambore Park, including one called 'T-38'.<ref name=minn/><ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2013\"/> Concerns were raised that the co-presence of lions and tigers would \"trigger frequent clashes.\"<ref name=\"Thetimesofindia2006\" /> The [[University of Minnesota]]'s Lion Research Project describes one reason to delay the introduction of lions to Kuno Palpur, is the fear that tigers living there would kill the incoming lions. In a one-on-one encounter, it is believed that a Bengal tiger could beat an Indian lion, given its weight advantage.<ref name=minn/> Despite the fact that the habitats of Indian lions and tigers are similar means that they both live in conditions that favor solitary hunters of prey,<ref name=Kailash1978/> these lions are social like their African relatives,<ref name=S&S02 /> and may form fighting groups, whereas tigers are usually solitary. The american biologist [[Craig Packer]] considers that a group of lions (two to three males) or lionesses (two to four females) is more than a match for a single tiger or tigress. Craig Packer is of the opinion that, in order for Asiatic lions to survive in an area with Bengal tigers, the lions would have to be translocated there as intact groups rather than as individuals.<ref name=minn/>\n\n[[Reginald Innes Pocock]] (1939) mentioned that some people had the opinion that the tiger played a role in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, but he dismissed this view as 'fanciful'. According to him, there was evidence that tigers inhabited the Indian Subcontinent before lions. The tigers likely entered [[Northern India]] from the eastern end of the [[Himalayas]], through [[Burma]], and started spreading throughout the area, before the lions likely entered Northern India from [[Balochistan]] or [[Persia]], and spread to places like the Bengal and the [[Nerbudda River]]. Because of that, before the presence of man could limit the spread of lions, tigers reached parts of India that lions did not reach. However, the presence of tigers throughout India did not stop the spread of lions there, in the first place, so Pocock said that it is unlikely that Bengal tigers played a role, significant or subordinate, in the near-extinction of the Indian lion, rather, that man was responsible for it,<ref name=Pocock1939/> as was the case with the decline in tigers' numbers.<ref name=Geptner/><ref name=CAP/><ref name=Mazak1981/><ref name=Pocock1939/><ref name=Karanth03/> As such, Pocock thought that it was unlikely that serious competition between them regularly occurred, and that even if Indian lions and tigers met, the chance that they would fight for survival was as good as the chance that they would choose to avoid each other, and that their chances of success, if they were to clash, were as good as each other's.<ref name=Pocock1939/>\n\n== Observed fights ==\n[[File:Indischer Maler um 1650 (II) 001.jpg|thumb|A [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] painting of a [[Dervish]] with a lion and tiger]]\n\nIn the [[circus (building)|circuses]] of [[Ancient Rome]], exotic beasts were commonly pitted against each other,<ref name=\"Auguet1994\"/> including [[Barbary lion]]s<ref name=CAP/><ref name=Beinglion2005-2014 /><ref name=Petermaas2000-2011 /> and tigers.<ref name=Hoage8-18 /> A [[mosaic]] in the [[House of the Faun]] in [[Pompeii]] shows a fight between a lion and a tiger.<ref name=\"King2002\" /> There are different accounts of which of these [[animal]]s gained the victory.

Pursuing it, they caught a glimpse of it, but by that time, the tiger had attacked a local. It disappeared with the victim, and after pursuing it for about {{convert|50.0|yard|ft|abbr=on}}, they heard the roar of a lion, and besides it, sounds which suggested that it was in a struggle with the tiger, such as growls. The party not only managed to see the lion and tiger rolling about in their battle, after going through bushes, but also the man who fell victim to the tiger. The author termed both the lion and tiger as \"tyrants of the [[forest]],\" given that they would attack weaker creatures. The tiger was about the same size as the lion, but more agile. As for the lion, it used greater strength, and its mane, which was somewhat deeper than those of its bigger African cousins, could protect its head from the tiger's claws, though not other parts of its body, such as the back. They were as determined and brave as each other, but the lion endured. It caught the tiger's [[throat]], turned it on its back, and killed it by clawing its abdomen open. The lion was thus hailed as the \"King of Beasts.\" Otherwise, the fight had been harsh for both beasts, to the extent that the author felt that it would avenge their victims.<ref name=\"CUL1855\" />\n* ''[[The Sun (New York)]]'' reported that in a [[Population decline|depopulated]] Indian village at the bank of a [[Creek (stream)|creek]] connected to the [[Cauvery River]], about {{convert|30.0|mile|km|abbr=on}} [[Bayalu Seeme|north-west]] of [[Bangalore]], a hunter injured by a [[venom]]ous creature saw a tiger on his left-hand side, and a lion on his right-hand side. The tiger was a \"rousing big fellow, who had seen 15 years of his life,\" and had muscular limbs. The male lion was \"medium-sized.\" Both of them stalked him, but they did not notice each other at first, as they were separated by a wall that was about {{convert|4.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} tall, and their focus was on the witness. When they got closer to him, the tiger scented the lion, and behaved like an angry [[cat]], which included making a noise that startled the latter. The lion showed its teeth in response, and after reaching the end of the wall, roared at its foe. After the lion's head showed around the wall, the crouching tiger pounced on it, and rolled over with it. Tigers often kill victims by biting their throats, and keeping their hold on them for as long as necessary,<ref name=Schaller1967 /> but that was not the case with this struggle. Despite different descriptions of their sizes by the narrator, and that the tiger was more agile than the lion, the tiger's neck was vulnerable to a bite by the lion, and for reasons like these, it was difficult for either cat to defeat the other, overall. After they temporarily retreated from each other, the hunter could see that they were both injured. Still, they were determined to destroy each other. The lion and tiger respectively roared and snarled. The narrator suspected that their hatred for each other may have been because both had been hunting him at the same time, therefore, their respective presences interfered with each other's hunt for him. The tiger pounced on the lion's back, rolling over or falling with it again, and struggling to its feet like it. The lion seemed helpless as the tiger held onto its fore shoulder, before making a move in which it managed to catch the tiger's neck. Now the tiger seemed helpless, before making a move to use its hind claws to force the lion to release its hold on it. Though the tiger was the aggressor this time, their struggle became more like [[Dog fighting|that of dogs]] unable to beat each other. They bled from nose to tail as they moved away from the witness, towards the creek. They fell into the water, which was about {{convert|2.0|ft|cm|abbr=on}} deep, and this stopped the fight.

Lions hunt in prides, so it would be in a group and the tiger as a solitary creature so it would be on its own. A tiger is generally physically larger than a lion. Most experts would favor a Siberian and [[Bengal tiger]] over an [[African lion]].\"<ref name=\"Save China's Tigers\" />\n* [[John Smith Clarke]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] lion tamer, said, in a lecture on the fight between a tiger and a lion given to the Glasgow Zoological Society, while showing the actual fight on the screen, \"in 100 cases out of 100, the tiger would always beat the lion.

He is the son of Jayne (Quinlan), of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and John George Costas, an electrical engineer of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent. His father's ancestry can be traced back to the island of [[Kalymnos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] in Greece. As Costas stated on [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', he had a very poor relationship with his father. Costas graduated from [[Commack School District|Commack High School South]] and attended [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York]]. He graduated with a communications degree in 1974 from their [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]].\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n===Early career===\n\nIn 1973, Costas began his professional career at [[WSYR-TV|WSYR TV]] and [[WSYR (AM)|radio]] in Syracuse while still completing his communications degree at the [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. His sportscasting career began while attending Syracuse University, serving as an announcer for the [[Syracuse Blazers]] minor-league hockey team playing in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] and [[North American Hockey League]].\n\nAfter graduating in 1974 at the age of 22, Costas went to [[KMOX]] radio in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], calling play-by-play for the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] in 1974. He was a prominent contributor to the ABA book ''[[Loose Balls]]: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association''. He is extensively quoted on many topics. The book includes his reflections of ABA life during his tenure as radio voice of the Spirits of St. Louis.\n\nLater, Costas would call [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri Tigers basketball]] and co-host KMOX's ''Open Line'' call-in program. He did play-by-play for [[Chicago Bulls]] broadcasts on [[WGN-TV]] during the [[1979\u201380 Chicago Bulls season|1979\u20131980 NBA season]].<ref>Database (undated).

Game{{nbsp}}2 of the NLCS took place on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night.

Costas's call:\n<blockquote>\n'''A base hit to right! Here comes Richardson, they're waving him home! The throw, it's close but he scores! On a walk off hit by Derek Jeter!'''\n</blockquote>\n\n==Interests==\n===Love of baseball===\n\nCostas is a devoted baseball fan. He's been suggested as a potential [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner]] and wrote ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'' in [[2000 in literature|2000]]. For his 40th birthday, then [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Tony La Russa]] allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend [[Stan Musial]]'s St. Louis eatery, he left a $3.31 tip on a ten dollar tab in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the [[eulogy]] at [[Mickey Mantle]]'s [[funeral]]. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ''\"a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic\".'' Costas has even carried a [[1958 New York Yankees season|1958]] Mickey Mantle [[baseball card]] in his wallet. Costas also delivered the eulogy for Musial after his death in early 2013.\n\nCostas was outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a playoff [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]. Costas believed it diminishes the significance and drama of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to an equal level with teams who outplayed them over a 162-game season. Or, as explained in his book ''Fair Ball'', have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a bye to the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance. With the advent of the second wild card, Costas has said he feels the format has improved, since there is now a greater premium placed on finishing first. He has suggested a further tweak: Make the wild card round a best two of three, instead of a single game, with all three games, if necessary, on the homefield of the wild card of the better record.\n\nHe also has disdained the [[Designated Hitter]] rule, saying baseball would be a better game without it.<ref>https://jugssports.com/blog/is-it-time-to-get-rid-of-the-designated-hitteror-expand-it-to-the-national-league/</ref>\n\nCostas serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.\n\n===Political views===\n\nOn May 26, 2007, Costas discussed the presidency of [[George W. Bush]] on his radio show, stating he liked Bush personally, and had been optimistic about his presidency, but said the course of the Iraq war, and other mis-steps have led him to conclude Bush's presidency had \"tragically failed\" and considered it \"overwhelmingly evident, even if you're a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], if you're honest about it, this is a failed administration.\"<ref>''Costas on the Radio'', May 26, 2007.</ref> The following summer, Costas interviewed Bush during the president's appearance at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.<ref name=\"ostrow2008\">{{cite news|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne| date = August 10, 2008 | title=Bob Costas, redeemed |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2008/08/10/bob-costas-redeemed/215/| publisher = Ostrow Off the Record (blog of [[The Denver Post]]) |accessdate= August 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n===Gun culture controversy===\n\nDuring a segment on the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' halftime show on December 2, 2012, Costas paraphrased [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] columnist [[Jason Whitlock]] in regard to [[Jovan Belcher]]'s murder-suicide the day prior, saying the United States' [[Gun culture#Present-day gun culture in the United States|gun culture]] was causing more [[domestic violence|domestic dispute]]s to result in death, and that it was likely Belcher and his girlfriend would not have died had he not possessed a gun.<ref name=bi-costasbelcher>{{cite web|title=Bob Costas Got Blasted For His Gun-Control Monologue After Jovan Belcher's Murder-Suicide|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bob-costas-gun-control-jovan-belcher-chiefs-murder-suicide-kasandra-perkins-2012-12|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCritics interpreted his remarks as support for [[gun control]], resulting in mostly negative reactions. Many (including former Republican Presidential candidates [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Herman Cain]])<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/> felt Costas should not have used a program typically viewed as entertainment to publicize political views on sensitive topics, [[Lou Dobbs]] criticized his remarks for supporting the abolition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] by quoting a [[sports writer]], while [[Andrew Levy]] remarked that he had been given a civics lecture by someone who had \"gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men's bodies and brains\".<ref name=nydn-costasguns>{{cite news|title=Bob Costas delivers anti-gun message on Sunday Night Football one day after NFL player Jovan Belcher kills girlfriend, himself|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/costas-delivers-anti-gun-message-sunday-night-football-article-1.1212138|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> However, liberal reporter [[Erik Wemple]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised Costas for speaking out for gun control on the broadcast, commenting that the incident's connection to the NFL provided him with an obligation to acknowledge the incident during the halftime show, stating that \"the things that [NFL players] do affect the public beyond whether their teams cover the point spread.

Costas did suggest that more regulation be placed on America's gun culture:<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc>{{cite news|last=Pengelly|first=Martin|title=Bob Costas defends 'gun culture' comments in MSNBC interview|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/bob-costas-gun-comments-msnbc-interview|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2012|location=London|date=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Now, do I believe that we need more comprehensive and more sensible gun control legislation? Yes I do. That doesn't mean repeal the Second Amendment. That doesn't mean a prohibition on someone having a gun to protect their home and their family. It means sensible and more comprehensive gun control legislation. But even if you had that, you would still have the problem of what Jason Whitlock wrote about, and what I agree with. And that is a gun culture in this country.<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/></blockquote>\n\n===2014 Winter Olympics===\n\nDuring his coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], Costas was criticized by some conservative members of the media, including [[Michelle Malkin]] and [[Glenn Beck]] for supposedly praising [[Vladimir Putin]]'s role in defusing tensions surrounding Syria, and Iran.<ref name=\"NBC Steers Clear\">{{cite news|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|title=In coverage of Olympics, NBC has largely steered clear of controversy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/olympics/in-coverage-of-olympics-nbc-has-largely-steered-clear-of-controversy/2014/02/21/5e68a088-99aa-11e3-80ac-63a8ba7f7942_story.html|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=February 21, 2014}}</ref> Several media commentators, including [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Bernard Goldberg]], defended Costas' remarks as factually correct and pointed out that Costas had also voiced considerable criticism of both Russia and Putin while broadcasting from [[Sochi]].

However, the network announced shortly before the game that [[Liam McHugh]] would instead join [[Dan Patrick]] as a co-host, leading to speculation that NBC removed Costas from the NFL's biggest game over his comments.

He is the son of Jayne (Quinlan), of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and John George Costas, an electrical engineer of [[Greek American|Greek]] descent. His father's ancestry can be traced back to the island of [[Kalymnos]] in the [[Aegean Sea]] in Greece. As Costas stated on [[Ken Burns]]' ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', he had a very poor relationship with his father. Costas graduated from [[Commack School District|Commack High School South]] and attended [[Syracuse University]] in [[Syracuse, New York]]. He graduated with a communications degree in 1974 from their [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]].\n\n==Broadcasting career==\n===Early career===\n\nIn 1973, Costas began his professional career at [[WSYR-TV|WSYR TV]] and [[WSYR (AM)|radio]] in Syracuse while still completing his communications degree at the [[S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. His sportscasting career began while attending Syracuse University, serving as an announcer for the [[Syracuse Blazers]] minor-league hockey team playing in the [[Eastern Hockey League]] and [[North American Hockey League]].\n\nAfter graduating in 1974 at the age of 22, Costas went to [[KMOX]] radio in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], calling play-by-play for the [[Spirits of St. Louis]] of the [[American Basketball Association]] in 1974. He was a prominent contributor to the ABA book ''[[Loose Balls]]: The Short, Wild Life of the American Basketball Association''. He is extensively quoted on many topics. The book includes his reflections of ABA life during his tenure as radio voice of the Spirits of St. Louis.\n\nLater, Costas would call [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri Tigers basketball]] and co-host KMOX's ''Open Line'' call-in program. He did play-by-play for [[Chicago Bulls]] broadcasts on [[WGN-TV]] during the [[1979\u201380 Chicago Bulls season|1979\u20131980 NBA season]].<ref>Database (undated).

He was also employed by [[CBS Sports]] as a regional [[NFL on CBS|CBS NFL]] and [[NBA on CBS|CBS NBA]] announcer from 1976 to 1979, after which he moved to NBC.\n\n===NBC Sports===\n\nIn 1980, Costas was hired by NBC.

The game between the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] and [[1984 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in particular was cited for putting [[Ryne Sandberg]] (as well as the [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|1984 Cubs]] in general, who would go on to make their first postseason appearance since [[1945 Chicago Cubs season|1945]]) \"on the map\". In the ninth inning, the Cubs, trailing 9\u20138, faced the premier relief pitcher of the time, [[Bruce Sutter]]. Sandberg, then not known for his power, slugged a home run to left field against the Cardinals' ace closer.<ref name=\"chicagocubsonline1\" /> Despite this dramatic act, the Cardinals scored two runs in the top of the tenth. Sandberg came up again in the tenth inning, facing a determined Sutter with one man on base.

Later (while being interviewed by NBC's [[Marv Albert]]), after the Dodgers had won Game{{nbsp}}4 (en route to a 4\u20131 series victory), Lasorda sarcastically suggested the MVP of the 1988 World Series should be Bob Costas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nBesides calling the [[1989 American League Championship Series]] for NBC, Costas also filled in for a suddenly ill [[Vin Scully]], who had come down with [[laryngitis]], for Game{{nbsp}}2 of the [[1989 National League Championship Series]] alongside [[Tom Seaver]]. Game{{nbsp}}2 of the NLCS took place on Thursday, October 5, which was an off day for the ALCS. NBC then decided to fly Costas from Toronto to Chicago to substitute for Scully on Thursday night. Afterward, Costas flew back to Toronto, where he resumed work on the ALCS the next night.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nCostas anchored NBC's pre- and post-game shows for NFL broadcasts and the pre and post-game shows for numerous World Series and [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]s during the 1980s (the first being for the [[1982 World Series]]). Costas did not get a shot at doing play-by-play (as the games on NBC were previously called by Vin Scully) for an All-Star Game until [[1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1994]] and a World Series until [[1995 World Series|1995]] (when NBC split the coverage with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] under \"[[The Baseball Network]]\" umbrella), when NBC regained Major League Baseball rights after a four-year hiatus (when the broadcast network television contract moved over to [[Major League Baseball on CBS|CBS]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Costas Prepares For (long) Offseason|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-10-07/sports/8902030046_1_bob-costas-broadcast-baseball-baseball-game|author=Jim Sarni|newspaper=Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=October 7, 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Du Brow|first=Rick|date= |title=NBC's Team Player Has His Eye on the Ball : Sportscasting: With CBS' surprise sacking of Brent Musburger, Bob Costas would seem the obvious replacement\u2014but he's sticking with his baseball-less network.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-05/entertainment/ca-1120_1_bob-costas|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|location= |access-date= }}</ref> exclusively).

He also hosted the studio program ''[[NBA Showtime|Showtime]]'' and did play-by-play for the [[1991 NBA All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]]. In [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997]], Costas began a three-year stint as the lead play-by-play man for ''[[NBA on NBC|The NBA on NBC]]''. NBC enlisted Costas' services after they were forced to (temporarily) remove [[Marv Albert]] from their broadcasts due to lingering personal and legal problems at the time. Costas teamed with [[Isiah Thomas]] and [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] for NBA telecasts from [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997]] to [[1999\u20132000 NBA season|2000]]. He stepped aside following the [[2000 NBA Finals]] in favor of a returning Albert.

He also appears in another PBS film, ''[[A Time for Champions]]'', produced by [[St. Louis]]'s [[KETC|Nine Network of Public Media]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeforchampions.org/ |title=Time for Champions |publisher=Time for Champions |date= |accessdate= February 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Notable calls==\n\n'''June 23, 1984:''' Costas called [[Major League Baseball Game of the Week#NBC's Game of the Week|NBC's ''Game of the Week'']] with [[Tony Kubek]], where [[Ryne Sandberg]] hit two separate home runs in the 9th and 10th innings against [[Bruce Sutter]] to tie the game. This game is known as \"The Sandberg Game\".<ref>{{Citation|last=MLB|title=Sandberg's ties the game twice|date=2014-11-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XEp_ElQThU|access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nCostas's call of the first home run:\n<blockquote>Into left center field, and deep.

Costas's call:\n<blockquote>'''A base hit to right! Here comes Richardson, they're waving him home! The throw, it's close but he scores! On a walk off hit by Derek Jeter!'''</blockquote>\n\n==Interests==\n===Love of baseball===\n\nCostas is a devoted baseball fan. He's been suggested as a potential [[Commissioner of Baseball|commissioner]] and wrote ''Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball'' in [[2000 in literature|2000]]. For his 40th birthday, then [[Oakland Athletics]] manager [[Tony La Russa]] allowed Costas to manage the club during a spring training game. The first time Costas visited baseball legend [[Stan Musial]]'s St. Louis eatery, he left a $3.31 tip on a ten dollar tab in homage to Musial's lifetime batting average (.331). Costas delivered the [[eulogy]] at [[Mickey Mantle]]'s [[funeral]]. In eulogizing Mantle, Costas described the baseball legend as ''\"a fragile hero to whom we had an emotional attachment so strong and lasting that it defied logic\".'' Costas has even carried a [[1958 New York Yankees season|1958]] Mickey Mantle [[baseball card]] in his wallet. Costas also delivered the eulogy for Musial after his death in early 2013.\n\nCostas was outspoken about his disdain for Major League Baseball instituting a playoff [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]]. Costas believed it diminishes the significance and drama of winning a divisional championship. He prefers a system in which winning the wild card puts a team at some sort of disadvantage, as opposed to an equal level with teams who outplayed them over a 162-game season. Or, as explained in his book ''Fair Ball'', have only the three division winners in each league go to the postseason, with the team with the best record receiving a bye to the League Championship Series. Once, on the air on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Inside the NFL]]'', he mentioned that the NFL regular season counted for something, but baseball's was beginning to lose significance. With the advent of the second wild card, Costas has said he feels the format has improved, since there is now a greater premium placed on finishing first. He has suggested a further tweak: Make the wild card round a best two of three, instead of a single game, with all three games, if necessary, on the homefield of the wild card of the better record.\n\nHe also has disdained the [[Designated Hitter]] rule, saying baseball would be a better game without it.<ref>https://jugssports.com/blog/is-it-time-to-get-rid-of-the-designated-hitteror-expand-it-to-the-national-league/</ref>\n\nCostas serves as a member of the advisory board of the [[Baseball Assistance Team]], a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to helping former Major League, Minor League, and Negro League players through financial and medical difficulties.\n\n===Political views===\n\nOn May 26, 2007, Costas discussed the presidency of [[George W. Bush]] on his radio show, stating he liked Bush personally, and had been optimistic about his presidency, but said the course of the Iraq war, and other mis-steps have led him to conclude Bush's presidency had \"tragically failed\" and considered it \"overwhelmingly evident, even if you're a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], if you're honest about it, this is a failed administration.\"<ref>''Costas on the Radio'', May 26, 2007.</ref> The following summer, Costas interviewed Bush during the president's appearance at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.<ref name=\"ostrow2008\">{{cite news|last=Ostrow|first=Joanne| date = August 10, 2008 | title=Bob Costas, redeemed |url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/ostrow/2008/08/10/bob-costas-redeemed/215/| publisher = Ostrow Off the Record (blog of [[The Denver Post]]) |accessdate= August 1, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n===Gun culture controversy===\n\nDuring a segment on the ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' halftime show on December 2, 2012, Costas paraphrased [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] columnist [[Jason Whitlock]] in regard to [[Jovan Belcher]]'s murder-suicide the day prior, saying the United States' [[Gun culture#Present-day gun culture in the United States|gun culture]] was causing more [[domestic violence|domestic dispute]]s to result in death, and that it was likely Belcher and his girlfriend would not have died had he not possessed a gun.<ref name=bi-costasbelcher>{{cite web|title=Bob Costas Got Blasted For His Gun-Control Monologue After Jovan Belcher's Murder-Suicide|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bob-costas-gun-control-jovan-belcher-chiefs-murder-suicide-kasandra-perkins-2012-12|website=Business Insider|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCritics interpreted his remarks as support for [[gun control]], resulting in mostly negative reactions. Many (including former Republican Presidential candidates [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Herman Cain]])<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/> felt Costas should not have used a program typically viewed as entertainment to publicize political views on sensitive topics, [[Lou Dobbs]] criticized his remarks for supporting the abolition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] by quoting a [[sports writer]], while [[Andrew Levy]] remarked that he had been given a civics lecture by someone who had \"gotten rich thanks in part to a sport that destroys men's bodies and brains\".<ref name=nydn-costasguns>{{cite news|title=Bob Costas delivers anti-gun message on Sunday Night Football one day after NFL player Jovan Belcher kills girlfriend, himself|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/costas-delivers-anti-gun-message-sunday-night-football-article-1.1212138|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}</ref> However, liberal reporter [[Erik Wemple]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' praised Costas for speaking out for gun control on the broadcast, commenting that the incident's connection to the NFL provided him with an obligation to acknowledge the incident during the halftime show, stating that \"the things that [NFL players] do affect the public beyond whether their teams cover the point spread.

Costas did suggest that more regulation be placed on America's gun culture:<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc>{{cite news|last=Pengelly|first=Martin|title=Bob Costas defends 'gun culture' comments in MSNBC interview|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/05/bob-costas-gun-comments-msnbc-interview|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2012|location=London|date=December 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Now, do I believe that we need more comprehensive and more sensible gun control legislation? Yes I do. That doesn't mean repeal the Second Amendment. That doesn't mean a prohibition on someone having a gun to protect their home and their family. It means sensible and more comprehensive gun control legislation. But even if you had that, you would still have the problem of what Jason Whitlock wrote about, and what I agree with. And that is a gun culture in this country.<ref name=guardian-guncontrolmsnbc/></blockquote>\n\n===2014 Winter Olympics===\n\nDuring his coverage of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], Costas was criticized by some conservative members of the media, including [[Michelle Malkin]] and [[Glenn Beck]] for supposedly praising [[Vladimir Putin]]'s role in defusing tensions surrounding Syria, and Iran.<ref name=\"NBC Steers Clear\">{{cite news|last1=Farhi|first1=Paul|title=In coverage of Olympics, NBC has largely steered clear of controversy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/olympics/in-coverage-of-olympics-nbc-has-largely-steered-clear-of-controversy/2014/02/21/5e68a088-99aa-11e3-80ac-63a8ba7f7942_story.html|accessdate=28 October 2014|work=The Washington Post|date=February 21, 2014}}</ref> Several media commentators, including [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and [[Bernard Goldberg]], defended Costas' remarks as factually correct and pointed out that Costas had also voiced considerable criticism of both Russia and Putin while broadcasting from [[Sochi]].

However, the network announced shortly before the game that [[Liam McHugh]] would instead join [[Dan Patrick]] as a co-host, leading to speculation that NBC removed Costas from the NFL's biggest game over his comments.
