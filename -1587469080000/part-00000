The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:<ref name=\"fordham1\" />\n\n{{quote|Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure.\n\nFor confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.|Nuruddin Salim Jahangir|Letter to James I.}}\n\n== Expansion ==\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da \u00cdndia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] - Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&nbsp;ships.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]].

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" /> The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] also tried to take a share.<ref>{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P & O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}</ref> A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium.

This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India's reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" />\n\n== Regulation of the company's affairs ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Writers ===\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|''The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor'', 1773|alt=Two ships in a harbour, one in the distance.

Several well-known British scholars and literary men had Company writerships, such as [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] in India and [[Charles Lamb]] in England.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York p. 385.</ref> His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a [[Council of Four from India|Council of Four]] appointed by the Crown.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The company had at various stages extended its influence to China, the Philippines, and [[Java island|Java]]. It had solved its critical lack of cash needed to buy tea by exporting Indian-grown opium to China.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

With the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the canton was changed to the new [[Evolution of UK Flag|Union Flag]]\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's cross]]\u2014representing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1800]] that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]].\n\nThere has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag. Historical documents and paintings show variations from 9-to-13&nbsp;stripes, with some images showing the top stripe red and others showing it white.\n\nAt the time of the American Revolution the East India Company flag was nearly identical to the [[Grand Union Flag]].

The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a \"Sign of Four\" atop a heart within which was a [[saltire]] between the lower arms of which were the initials \"EIC\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage<ref>East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.</ref> and forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html|title=Scinde District Dawks|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Ships ==\n{{See also|East Indiaman|List of ports of call of the British East India Company}}\n[[File:Ships in Bombay Harbour, 1731.jpg|thumb|right|Ships in [[Bombay Harbour]], c. 1731]]\nShips of the East India Company were called [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] or simply \"Indiamen\".<ref>Sutton, Jean (1981) ''Lords of the East: The East India Company and Its Ships''.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:<ref name=\"fordham1\" />\n\n{{quote|Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure.\n\nFor confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.|Nuruddin Salim Jahangir|Letter to James I.}}\n\n== Expansion ==\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da \u00cdndia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] - Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

The major factories became the walled forts of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] in Bengal, [[Fort St George]] in Madras, and [[Bombay Castle]].\n\nIn 1634, the Mughal emperor [[Jahangir]] extended his hospitality to the English traders to the region of [[Bengal]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theprint.in/pageturner/excerpt/east-india-company-sent-a-diplomat-to-jahangir-all-the-mughal-emperor-cared-about-was-beer/281255/|title=East India Company sent a diplomat to Jahangir & all the Mughal Emperor cared about was beer|first=William|last=Dalrymple|date=24 August 2019}}</ref> and in 1717 completely waived customs duties for their trade. The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&nbsp;ships.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed ''Interlopers'' by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.<ref name=\"victorianweb.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://victorianweb.org/history/empire/india/eic.html|title=The British East India Company \u2014 the Company that Owned a Nation (or Two)|website=victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. When the East India Company Act 1697 (9 Will. c. 44) was passed in 1697, a new \"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the ''English Company Trading to the East Indies'') was floated under a state-backed indemnity of \u00a32&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Boggart\">{{cite journal |last1=Boggart |first1=Dan |editor1-last=Lamoreaux |editor1-first=Naomi R. |editor2-last=Wallis |editor2-first=John Joseph |title=East Indian Monopoly and Limited Access in England |journal=Organizations, Civil Society, and the Roots of Development |date=2017 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago}}</ref> The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of \u00a3315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body.

The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new ''United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies'' being awarded by the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t0TAAAAQAAJ|title=Charters Relating to the East India Company from 1600 to 1761: Reprinted from a Former Collection with Some Additions and a Preface for the Government of Madras|last=Company|first=East India|last2=Shaw|first2=John|date=1887|publisher=R.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely [[sepoy|Indian troops]] and trained them along European lines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerald Bryant |year=1978 |title=Officers of the East India Company's army in the days of Clive and Hastings |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203\u2013227 |doi=10.1080/03086537808582508}}</ref> The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed into a private corporate armed force used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion instead of its original purpose as a guard force. Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling.

Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York p. 385.</ref> His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a [[Council of Four from India|Council of Four]] appointed by the Crown. Initially, the Council consisted of Lieutenant General Sir [[John Clavering (British Army officer)|John Clavering]], Sir [[George Monson]], Sir [[Richard Barwell]], and Sir [[Philip Francis (English politician)|Philip Francis]].<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\">Anthony, Frank.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company. As stated by Professor Sri Ram Sharma,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.houseofdavid.ca/Ind_uni.htm#Kapur|title=British Ruled India Print Bibliography by David Steinberg|website=www.houseofdavid.ca}}</ref> \"The President of the Board of Control now became Minister for Indian Affairs.\"\n* carried further the ongoing process of administrative centralisation through investing the Governor-General in Council with full power and authority to superintend and control the Presidency Governments in all civil and military matters\n* initiated a machinery for the codification of laws\n* provided that no Indian subject of the company would be debarred from holding any office under the company by reason of his religion, place of birth, descent or colour\n* vested the Island of [[St Helena]] in the Crown<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/3-4/85/section/112|title=Saint Helena Act 1833|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=2017-07-07}}</ref>\n\nBritish influence continued to expand; in 1845, Great Britain purchased the Danish colony of [[Tranquebar]]. The company had at various stages extended its influence to China, the Philippines, and [[Java island|Java]]. It had solved its critical lack of cash needed to buy tea by exporting Indian-grown opium to China. China's efforts to end the trade led to the First Opium War (1839\u20131842).\n\n==== English Education Act 1835 ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|English Education Act 1835}}\n[[File:Charles D'Oyly00.jpg|thumb|View of the Calcutta port in 1848]]\nThe English Education Act by the Council of India in 1835 reallocated funds from the East India Company to spend on education and literature in India.\n\n==== Government of India Act 1853 ====\nThis Act (16 & 17 Vict. c. 95) provided that British India would remain under the administration of the company in trust for the Crown until Parliament should decide otherwise. It also introduced a system of open competition as the basis of recruitment for civil servants of the company and thus deprived the directors of their patronage system.<ref>M. Laxhimikanth, Public Administration, TMH, Tenth Reprint, 2013</ref>\n\nUnder the act, for the first time the legislative and executive powers of the governor-general's council were separated.

[[The Crown]] took over its Indian possessions, its administrative powers and machinery, and its [[presidency armies|armed forces]].\n\nThe company remained in existence in vestigial form, continuing to manage the tea trade on behalf of the British Government (and the supply of [[Saint Helena]]) until the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] came into effect, on 1 January 1874. This Act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock.<ref>East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict. 17) s. 36: \"On the First day of June One thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, and on payment by the East India Company of all unclaimed dividends on East India Stock to such accounts as are herein-before mentioned in pursuance of the directions herein-before contained, the powers of the East India Company shall cease, and the said Company shall be dissolved.\" Where possible, the stock was redeemed through commutation (i.e. exchanging the stock for other securities or money) on terms agreed with the stockholders (ss. 5\u20138), but stockholders who did not agree to commute their holdings had their stock compulsorily redeemed on 30 April 1874 by payment of \u00a3200 for every \u00a3100 of stock held (s. 13).</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' commented on 8 April 1873:<ref>{{cite news |title=Not many days ago the House of Commons passed |newspaper=Times |location=London |date=8 April 1873 |page=9}}</ref>\n{{quote|text=It accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other trading Company ever attempted, and such as none, surely, is likely to attempt in the years to come.}}\n\nIn the 1980s, a group of investors purchased the rights to the moribund corporate brand and founded a clothing company, which lasted until the 1990s.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the [[Hanwell#Healthcare|Royal India Asylum]], at [[Hanwell]], Middlesex.<ref>Farrington 1976, pp. 125\u2013132.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Diane K. |last1=Bolton |first2=Patricia E.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

Historian [[Charles Fawcett (historian)|Charles Fawcett]] argued that the East India Company Flag inspired the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes of America]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-eic2.html |title=The Striped Flag of the East India Company, and its Connexion with the American \"Stars and Stripes\" |first=Charles |last=Fawcett |authorlink=Charles Fawcett (historian) |editor=Rob Raeside |date=30 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n\n | image1 = East India Company arms 1600-1709.svg\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = The original coat of arms of the East India Company\n | image2 = Coat of arms of the East India Company.svg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = The later coat of arms of the East India Company\n\n | footer =\n}}\nThe East India Company's original [[coat of arms]] was granted in 1600.

The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a \"Sign of Four\" atop a heart within which was a [[saltire]] between the lower arms of which were the initials \"EIC\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage<ref>East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.</ref> and forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html|title=Scinde District Dawks|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Ships ==\n{{See also|East Indiaman|List of ports of call of the British East India Company}}\n[[File:Ships in Bombay Harbour, 1731.jpg|thumb|right|Ships in [[Bombay Harbour]], c. 1731]]\nShips of the East India Company were called [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] or simply \"Indiamen\".<ref>Sutton, Jean (1981) ''Lords of the East: The East India Company and Its Ships''. London: Conway Maritime</ref>\n\n[[File:Indiaman Royal George.jpg|thumb|right|{{ship||Royal George|East Indiaman|2}} was one of the five East Indiamen the Spanish fleet captured in 1780]]\n\nDuring the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], the East India Company arranged for [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] for its vessels such as the ''Lord Nelson''. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''. Other examples include:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}\n* {{HMS|Glatton|1795|6}}\n* {{HMS|Hindostan|1795|6}} (1795)\n* {{HMS|Hindostan|1804|6}} (1804)\n* {{HMS|Malabar|1804|6}}\n* {{HMS|Buffalo|1813|6}}\n{{div col end}}\n\nTheir design as merchant vessels meant that their performance in the warship role was underwhelming and the Navy converted them to transports.\n\n== Records ==\n{{Main|India Office Records}}\nUnlike all other British Government records, the records from the East India Company (and its successor the [[India Office]]) are not in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]], London, but are held by the [[British Library]] in London as part of the [[Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections, British Library|Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections]].

When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

|page=108}}</ref> It contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'')\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]])\n\nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not cross over with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

Although many Jews were killed, expelled or sold off into slavery after the AD 66\u201370 and the 123\u2013125 rebellions, the degree to which these transfers affected the Jewish dominance in Palestine is rarely addressed. What is certain is that Palestine did not lose its Jewish component. Goldblatt<ref name=CHJ /> concludes that the Jews may have remained a majority into the 3rd century AD and even beyond. He notes that 'Jewish followers of Jesus' (Jewish Christians) would not have taken part in the rebellions'. Non-Christian conversions from Judaism after the Bar Kochba revolt were not given much attention.<ref>Robert Goldenberg (2008)The destruction of the Jerusalem Temple: its meaning and its consequences.

Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals are known to have turned pagan before the war, and it stands to reason that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion. It is impossible to determine the number who joined the budding Christian movement and the number who disappeared into the polytheist majority.\"</blockquote>\n\nThe highest population of the 3rd to 7th centuries probably occurred in the Byzantine period.<ref name=CHJ/> Most scholars consider that the proportion of Jews decreased during these centuries, a loss of dominance not related to any specific diaspora and at dates not agreed to by historians.

Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees.

It is known that the Arab population of Palestine doubled during the British Mandate era, from 670,000 in 1922 to over 1.2 million in 1948, and there has been considerable debate over the subject on how much of this growth was due to natural increase, as opposed to immigration. Estimates on the scope of Arab immigration to Palestine during this period vary.\n\n===Ottoman Period 1800-1918===\n\nSome Egyptian migration to Palestine happened at the end of the 18th century due to a severe famine in Egypt, and several waves of Egyptian immigrants came even earlier due to escape natural disasters such as droughts and plagues, government oppression, taxes, and military conscription. Although many Palestinian Arabs also moved to Egypt, Egyptian immigration to Palestine was more dominant. In the 19th century, large numbers of Egyptians fled to Palestine to escape the military conscription and forced labor projects in the Nile Delta under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Following the [[Egyptian-Ottoman War (1831-1833)|First Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw the Egyptian conquest of Palestine, more Egyptians were brought to Palestine as forced laborers. Following the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)|Second Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw Egyptian rule in Palestine terminated, massive numbers of soldiers deserted during the Egyptian army's retreat from Palestine to permanently settle there. Egyptians settled mainly in Jaffa, the Coastal plain, Samaria and in Wadi Ara. In the southern plain there were 19 villages with Egyptian populations, while in Jaffa there were some 500 Egyptian families with a population of over 2,000 people. The largest rural concentration of Egyptian immigrants was in the Sharon region.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman, pp. 45-52</ref> According to David Grossman, statistics show the number of Egyptian immigrants to Palestine between 1829 and 1841 exceeded 15,000, and he estimated that it was at least 23,000 and possibly up to 30,000.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman P 60</ref> In 1860, there was significant immigration to [[Safed]] by [[Moors|Moorish]] (i.e. [[Arab-Berber]]) tribes from [[Algeria]] and a small number of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], while some 6,000 Arabs from the [[Beni Sakhr]] tribe immigrated to Palestine from what is now [[Jordan]] to settle in [[Tiberias]]. In addition, considerable numbers of [[Turkish people|Turks]] stationed in Palestine to garrison the land settled there.<ref>Merry, Sidney: ''How the State Controls Society'', p. 220</ref>\n\nIn 1878, following [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], many Bosnian Muslims, apprehensive of living under Christian rule, emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, and significant numbers went to Palestine, where most adopted the surname [[Bushnak]]. Bosnian Muslim immigration continued throughout the following decades and increased after Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia in 1908. To this day, Bushnak remains a common surname among Palestinians of Bosnian origin.<ref>Cohen, Philip J.; Riesman, David (1996). \"Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History\". Texas A&M University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-89096-760-7}}, p. 123</ref> \n\nThe number of Bedouins who started settling the Negev region from the 7th century considerably increased during Ottoman rule as a result of immigration of both Bedouin tribes from south and east and peasant farmers (fellahins) from Egypt. The Egyptian fellahins settled mostly in the region around Gaza and received protection from Bedouins, in return for goods. Bedouins brought African slaves (abid) from Sudan who worked for them. To reduce frictions and to stabilize the boundaries between Bedouin tribes, the Ottomans established an administrative center in Beersheba around 1900, as the first planned settlement in Negev since the Nabatean and Byzantine times.<ref>International Handbook of Research on Indigenous Entrepreneurship By L. -P. Dana P:117</ref> In the beginning of the 20th century, most of the population of Hebron were descendants of Bedouins who migrated to Palestine from Transjordan in the 15th and 16th century.<ref>Hamidian Palestine: Politics and Society in the District of Jerusalem 1872-1908 By Johann B\u00fcssow P.195</ref>\n\nDemographer [[Uziel Schmelz]], in his analysis of Ottoman registration data for 1905 populations of Jerusalem and Hebron ''[[kaza]]s'', found that most Ottoman citizens living in these areas, comprising about one quarter of the population of Palestine, were living at the place where they were born. Specifically, of Muslims, 93.1% were born in their current locality of residence, 5.2% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 1.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Christians, 93.4% were born in their current locality, 3.0% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 3.6% were born outside Palestine. Of Jews (excluding the large fraction who were not Ottoman citizens), 59.0% were born in their current locality, 1.9% were born elsewhere in Palestine, and 39.0% were born outside Palestine.<ref>{{cite book | author = U.

Basing himself on these figures, and including those netted by the border alterations, Joseph Melzer  calculates an upper boundary of 8.5% for Arab growth in the two decades, and interprets it to mean the local Palestinian community's growth was generated primarily by natural increase.<ref>[[Jacob Metzer]],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=OdEryYxCKTMC&pg=PA72 ''The Divided Economy of Mandatory Palestine,''] Cambridge University Press, 1998  pp.31ff.</ref>\n\n[[Martin Gilbert]] estimated that 50,000 Arabs immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] from neighboring lands between 1919 and 1939 \"attracted by the improving agricultural conditions and growing job opportunities, most of them created by the Jews\".<ref>Gilbert, 2005, p. 16.</ref> According to Itzhak Galnoor, although most of the local Arab community's growth was the result of natural increase, Arab immigration to Palestine was significant. Based on his estimates, approximately 100,000 Arabs immigrated to Palestine between 1922 and 1948.<ref>The Partition of Palestine: Decision Crossroads in the Zionist Movement By Itzhak Galnoor P 167</ref>\n\nBased on [[Jewish Agency for Israel|Jewish Agency]] statistics from 1947, Deborah Bernstein estimated that 77% of Arab population growth in Palestine between 1914 and 1945, during which the Arab population doubled, was due to natural increase, while 23% was due to immigration. Bernstein wrote that Arab immigration was primarily from Lebanon, Syria, Transjordan, and Egypt (all countries that bordered Palestine).<ref>Bernstein, Deborah: ''Constructing Boundaries: Jewish and Arab Workers in Mandatory Palestine'', pp. 20-21</ref>\n\nThe overall assessment of several British reports was that the increase in the Arab population was primarily due to natural increase.<ref>{{cite news | author = Paul Blair | title = Special Report: The Origins of the Arab-Jewish Conflict Over Palestine | journal = Capitalism Magazine | date = 19 April 2002 | url = https://www.capitalismmagazine.com/2002/04/from-time-immeroial-natural-increase-and-the-growth-of-palestines-arab-population-part-4-of-6/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100114142226/http://capmag.com/article.asp?ID=2138 | archive-date = 2010-01-14 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>Anglo-American Commission report, Section 4.4. \"Of this Moslem growth by 472,000, only 19,000 was accounted for by immigration.\"</ref> These included the [[Hope Simpson Enquiry]] (1930),<ref name=unispal>[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/E3ED8720F8707C9385256D19004F057C Hope Simpson Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810170235/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/E3ED8720F8707C9385256D19004F057C |date=10 August 2014 }}</ref> the [[Passfield White Paper]] (1930),<ref>Passfield White Paper, para 17. \"the Arab population, while lacking the advantages enjoyed by the Jewish settlers, has, by the excess of births over deaths, increased with great rapidity\"</ref> the [[Peel Commission]] report (1937),<ref>the [[Peel Commission]] report, pp. 125,282. \"unlike the Jewish, the rise has been due in only a slight degree to immigration.\"</ref> and the Survey of Palestine (1945).<ref>Survey of Palestine, p140. \"the expansion of the Moslem and Christian populations is due mainly to natural increase, while that of the Jews is due mainly to immigration.\"</ref> However, the Hope Simpson Enquiry did note that there was significant illegal immigration from the surrounding Arab territories,<ref name=unispal/> while the Peel Commission and Survey of Palestine claimed that immigration played only a minor role in the growth of the Arab population.

This can be compared to the very crude estimate of about 4 per thousand for the \"less developed countries\" of the world (in Asia, Africa, and Latin America) between 1800 and 1910. It is possible that some part of the growth of the Muslim population was due to immigration. However, it seems likely that the dominant determinant of this modest growth was the beginning of some natural increase.\"{{sfn|Bachi|1974|pp=34\u201335}}\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], \"... evidence for Muslim immigration into Palestine is minimal. Because no Ottoman records of that immigration have yet been discovered, one is thrown back on demographic analysis to evaluate Muslim migration.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16, 33}} McCarthy argues that there is no significant Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine:\n<blockquote>\nFrom analyses of rates of increase of the Muslim population of the three Palestinian sanjaks, one can say with certainty that Muslim immigration after the 1870s was small. Had there been a large group of Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=16}}\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=38}}\n</blockquote>\nMcCarthy also concludes that there was no significant internal migration to Jewish areas attributable to better economic conditions:\n<blockquote>\nSome areas of Palestine did experience greater population growth than others, but the explanation for this is simple. Radical economic change was occurring all over the Mediterranean Basin at the time. Improved transportation, greater mercantile activity, and greater industry had increased the chances for employment in cities, especially coastal cities... Differential population increase was occurring all over the Eastern Mediterranean, not just in Palestine... The increase in Muslim population had little or nothing to do with Jewish immigration. In fact the province that experienced the greatest Jewish population growth (by .035 annually), Jerusalem Sanjak, was the province with the lowest rate of growth of Muslim population (.009).{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16\u201317}}\n</blockquote>Fred M. Gottheil has questioned McCarthy's estimates of immigration. Gottheil says that McCarthy didn't give proper weight to the importance of economic incentives at the time, and that McCarthy cites Roberto Bachi's estimates as conclusive numbers, rather than lower bounds based detected illegal immigration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|date=2003-01-01|title=The Smoking Gun: Arab Immigration into Palestine, 1922-1931|url=http://www.meforum.org/522/the-smoking-gun-arab-immigration-into-palestine|journal=Middle East Quarterly|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKRlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|title=Palestine and Israel in the 19th and 20th Centuries|chapter=Arab Immigration into Pre-State Israel 1922-1931|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|editor-last=Kedourie|editor-first=Elie|editor-last2=Haim|editor-first2=Sylvia G.|date=1982-05-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135168148|language=en}}</ref>\n\nGad Gilbar has also concluded that the prosperity of Palestine in the 45\u201350 years before World War I was a result of the modernization and growth of the economy owing to its integration with the world economy and especially with the economies of Europe. Although the reasons for growth were exogenous to Palestine the bearers were not waves of Jewish immigration, foreign intervention nor Ottoman reforms but \"primarily local Arab Muslims and Christians.\"<ref>Gilbar, 1986, p. 188.</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the British turned a blind eye to large-scale Arab illegal immigration, and instead disproportionately focused on Jewish illegal immigration. In particular, Freddy Liebreich claimed that significant undocumented Arab immigration, much of it from the [[Hauran]] region of Syria, did take place during the Mandate era, and that the British authorities largely ignored it. According to Liebreich: \"Jewish illegal immigration was minutely detailed and meticulously recorded but all references to Arab illegal immigration were, perhaps deliberately, obscured.\" He claimed that one major example took place in 1934, when, according to him, approximately 35,000 Arabs illegally immigrated to Palestine from the Hauran, basing this estimate on a claim made by the Governor of the Hauran at the time, who estimated that 30,000-36,000 people from the Hauran had left to settle in Palestine in recent months. By contrast, the British estimated the number of illegal immigrants to Palestine in 1934, both Arab and non-Arab, at 3,000. Liebreich also wrote that many British documents from the beginning of the Mandate era to the 1940s contain references to Syrians from the Hauran being freely admitted into Palestine without a passport or visa, and noted that illegal immigration from the Hauran was mentioned in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] a year before the end of British rule in Palestine.<ref>Liebreich, Freddy: ''Britain's Naval and Political Reaction to the Illegal Immigration of Jews to Palestine, 1945-1949'', pgs. 27-28</ref>\n\n[[Yehoshua Porath]] believes that the notion of \"large-scale immigration of Arabs from the neighboring countries\" is a myth \"proposed by Zionist writers\". He writes:\n<blockquote>\nAs all the research by historian Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers of modern Palestine shows, the Arab population began to grow again in the middle of the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no \"natural\" increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.<ref>Porath, Y. (1986).

''New York Review of Books''. 16 January, 32 (21 & 22).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Daniel Pipes]] responded to Porath by granting that ''[[From Time Immemorial]]'' quoted carelessly, used statistics sloppily, and ignored inconvenient facts. Nonetheless, he explained that:<blockquote>\nMiss Peters's central thesis is that a substantial immigration of Arabs to Palestine took place during the first half of the twentieth century. She supports this argument with an array of demographic statistics and contemporary accounts, the bulk of which have not been questioned by any reviewer, including Porath.\n</blockquote>Porath replied with an array of demographic data to support his position. He also wrote that Peters's demographic statistics were inexplicable: <blockquote>\n...nowhere in her main text or in the methodological appendices (V and VI) did Mrs. Peters bother to explain to her readers how she managed to break down the Ottoman or Cuinet's figures into smaller units than subdistricts. As far as I know no figures for the units smaller than subdistricts (Nahia; the parallel of the French commune), covering the area of Ottoman Palestine, were ever published. Therefore I can't avoid the conclusion that Mrs. Peters's figures were, at best, based on guesswork and an extremely tendentious guesswork at that.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5172 Mrs. Peters's Palestine: An Exchange], ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 33, Number 5, March 27, 1986.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Modern era==\n{{See also|Demographics of Israel|Israelis|Demographics of the Palestinian territories|Palestinian people#Demographics}}\n\n{{as of|2014}}, Israeli and Palestinian statistics for the overall numbers of Jews and Arabs in the area west of the Jordan, inclusive of Israel and the [[Palestinian territories]], are similar and suggest a rough parity in the two populations.

Although many Jews were killed, expelled or sold off into slavery after the AD 66\u201370 and the 123\u2013125 rebellions, the degree to which these transfers affected the Jewish dominance in Palestine is rarely addressed. What is certain is that Palestine did not lose its Jewish component. Goldblatt<ref name=CHJ /> concludes that the Jews may have remained a majority into the 3rd century AD and even beyond. He notes that 'Jewish followers of Jesus' (Jewish Christians) would not have taken part in the rebellions'.

Apostates from Judaism (aside from converts to Christianity) received little notice in antiquity from either Jewish or non-Jewish writers, but ambitious individuals are known to have turned pagan before the war, and it stands to reason that many more did so after its disastrous conclusion.

Of these 235,000 live in the larger towns, 465,000 in the smaller towns and villages. Four-fifths of the whole population are Moslems. A small proportion of these are Bedouin Arabs; the remainder, although they speak Arabic and are termed Arabs, are largely of mixed race. Some 77,000 of the population are Christians, in large majority belonging to the Orthodox Church, and speaking Arabic. The minority are members of the Latin or of the Uniate Greek Catholic Church, or\u2014a small number\u2014are Protestants.\n\nThe Jewish element of the population numbers 76,000. Almost all have entered Palestine during the last 40 years. Prior to 1850 there were in the country only a handful of Jews. In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came to pray and to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/349B02280A930813052565E90048ED1C|title=Mandate for Palestine - Interim report of the Mandatory to the League of Nations/Balfour Declaration text (30 July 1921)|website=unispal.un.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy 1948, the population had risen to 1,900,000, of whom 68% were [[Arabs]], and 32% were [[Jews]] ([[UNSCOP]] report, including [[Bedouin]]).\n\nReport and general abstract of the Jewish agriculture was taken by the Palestine Zionist Executive in April 1927.\n\n<blockquote> '''Object of the Census''':\n\n(p 85) Demography: to enumerate all Jewish inhabitants living in the agricultural and semi-agricultural communities.\n\n(p 86) Number of Settlements: 130 places have been enumerated.

It is known that the Arab population of Palestine doubled during the British Mandate era, from 670,000 in 1922 to over 1.2 million in 1948, and there has been considerable debate over the subject on how much of this growth was due to natural increase, as opposed to immigration. Estimates on the scope of Arab immigration to Palestine during this period vary.\n\n===Ottoman Period 1800-1918===\n\nSome Egyptian migration to Palestine happened at the end of the 18th century due to a severe famine in Egypt, and several waves of Egyptian immigrants came even earlier due to escape natural disasters such as droughts and plagues, government oppression, taxes, and military conscription. Although many Palestinian Arabs also moved to Egypt, Egyptian immigration to Palestine was more dominant. In the 19th century, large numbers of Egyptians fled to Palestine to escape the military conscription and forced labor projects in the Nile Delta under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]. Following the [[Egyptian-Ottoman War (1831-1833)|First Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw the Egyptian conquest of Palestine, more Egyptians were brought to Palestine as forced laborers. Following the [[Egyptian\u2013Ottoman War (1839\u201341)|Second Egyptian-Ottoman War]], which saw Egyptian rule in Palestine terminated, massive numbers of soldiers deserted during the Egyptian army's retreat from Palestine to permanently settle there. Egyptians settled mainly in Jaffa, the Coastal plain, Samaria and in Wadi Ara. In the southern plain there were 19 villages with Egyptian populations, while in Jaffa there were some 500 Egyptian families with a population of over 2,000 people. The largest rural concentration of Egyptian immigrants was in the Sharon region.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman, pp. 45-52</ref> According to David Grossman, statistics show the number of Egyptian immigrants to Palestine between 1829 and 1841 exceeded 15,000, and he estimated that it was at least 23,000 and possibly up to 30,000.<ref>Rural Arab Demography and Early Jewish Settlement in Palestine: Distribution By David Grossman P 60</ref> In 1860, there was significant immigration to [[Safed]] by [[Moors|Moorish]] (i.e. [[Arab-Berber]]) tribes from [[Algeria]] and a small number of [[Kurdish people|Kurds]], while some 6,000 Arabs from the [[Beni Sakhr]] tribe immigrated to Palestine from what is now [[Jordan]] to settle in [[Tiberias]]. In addition, considerable numbers of [[Turkish people|Turks]] stationed in Palestine to garrison the land settled there.<ref>Merry, Sidney: ''How the State Controls Society'', p. 220</ref>\n\nIn 1878, following [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], many Bosnian Muslims, apprehensive of living under Christian rule, emigrated to the Ottoman Empire, and significant numbers went to Palestine, where most adopted the surname [[Bushnak]]. Bosnian Muslim immigration continued throughout the following decades and increased after Austria-Hungary formally annexed Bosnia in 1908. To this day, Bushnak remains a common surname among Palestinians of Bosnian origin.<ref>Cohen, Philip J.; Riesman, David (1996). \"Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History\".

The Egyptian fellahins settled mostly in the region around Gaza and received protection from Bedouins, in return for goods. Bedouins brought African slaves (abid) from Sudan who worked for them. To reduce frictions and to stabilize the boundaries between Bedouin tribes, the Ottomans established an administrative center in Beersheba around 1900, as the first planned settlement in Negev since the Nabatean and Byzantine times.<ref>International Handbook of Research on Indigenous Entrepreneurship By L. -P.

This can be compared to the very crude estimate of about 4 per thousand for the \"less developed countries\" of the world (in Asia, Africa, and Latin America) between 1800 and 1910. It is possible that some part of the growth of the Muslim population was due to immigration. However, it seems likely that the dominant determinant of this modest growth was the beginning of some natural increase.\"{{sfn|Bachi|1974|pp=34\u201335}}\n</blockquote>\n\nAccording to [[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]], \"... evidence for Muslim immigration into Palestine is minimal. Because no Ottoman records of that immigration have yet been discovered, one is thrown back on demographic analysis to evaluate Muslim migration.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16, 33}} McCarthy argues that there is no significant Arab immigration into mandatory Palestine:\n<blockquote>\nFrom analyses of rates of increase of the Muslim population of the three Palestinian sanjaks, one can say with certainty that Muslim immigration after the 1870s was small. Had there been a large group of Muslim immigrants their numbers would have caused an unusual increase in the population and this would have appeared in the calculated rate of increase from one registration list to another... Such an increase would have been easily noticed; it was not there.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=16}}\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nThe argument that Arab immigration somehow made up a large part of the Palestinian Arab population is thus statistically untenable. The vast majority of the Palestinian Arabs resident in 1947 were the sons and daughters of Arabs who were living in Palestine before modern Jewish immigration began. There is no reason to believe that they were not the sons and daughters of Arabs who had been in Palestine for many centuries.{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|p=38}}\n</blockquote>\nMcCarthy also concludes that there was no significant internal migration to Jewish areas attributable to better economic conditions:\n<blockquote>\nSome areas of Palestine did experience greater population growth than others, but the explanation for this is simple. Radical economic change was occurring all over the Mediterranean Basin at the time. Improved transportation, greater mercantile activity, and greater industry had increased the chances for employment in cities, especially coastal cities... Differential population increase was occurring all over the Eastern Mediterranean, not just in Palestine... The increase in Muslim population had little or nothing to do with Jewish immigration. In fact the province that experienced the greatest Jewish population growth (by .035 annually), Jerusalem Sanjak, was the province with the lowest rate of growth of Muslim population (.009).{{sfn|McCarthy|1990|pp=16\u201317}}\n</blockquote>Fred M. Gottheil has questioned McCarthy's estimates of immigration. Gottheil says that McCarthy didn't give proper weight to the importance of economic incentives at the time, and that McCarthy cites Roberto Bachi's estimates as conclusive numbers, rather than lower bounds based detected illegal immigration.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|date=2003-01-01|title=The Smoking Gun: Arab Immigration into Palestine, 1922-1931|url=http://www.meforum.org/522/the-smoking-gun-arab-immigration-into-palestine|journal=Middle East Quarterly|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKRlAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA143|title=Palestine and Israel in the 19th and 20th Centuries|chapter=Arab Immigration into Pre-State Israel 1922-1931|last=Gottheil|first=Fred M.|editor-last=Kedourie|editor-first=Elie|editor-last2=Haim|editor-first2=Sylvia G.|date=1982-05-27|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135168148|language=en}}</ref>\n\nGad Gilbar has also concluded that the prosperity of Palestine in the 45\u201350 years before World War I was a result of the modernization and growth of the economy owing to its integration with the world economy and especially with the economies of Europe. Although the reasons for growth were exogenous to Palestine the bearers were not waves of Jewish immigration, foreign intervention nor Ottoman reforms but \"primarily local Arab Muslims and Christians.\"<ref>Gilbar, 1986, p. 188.</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the British turned a blind eye to large-scale Arab illegal immigration, and instead disproportionately focused on Jewish illegal immigration. In particular, Freddy Liebreich claimed that significant undocumented Arab immigration, much of it from the [[Hauran]] region of Syria, did take place during the Mandate era, and that the British authorities largely ignored it. According to Liebreich: \"Jewish illegal immigration was minutely detailed and meticulously recorded but all references to Arab illegal immigration were, perhaps deliberately, obscured.\" He claimed that one major example took place in 1934, when, according to him, approximately 35,000 Arabs illegally immigrated to Palestine from the Hauran, basing this estimate on a claim made by the Governor of the Hauran at the time, who estimated that 30,000-36,000 people from the Hauran had left to settle in Palestine in recent months. By contrast, the British estimated the number of illegal immigrants to Palestine in 1934, both Arab and non-Arab, at 3,000. Liebreich also wrote that many British documents from the beginning of the Mandate era to the 1940s contain references to Syrians from the Hauran being freely admitted into Palestine without a passport or visa, and noted that illegal immigration from the Hauran was mentioned in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] a year before the end of British rule in Palestine.<ref>Liebreich, Freddy: ''Britain's Naval and Political Reaction to the Illegal Immigration of Jews to Palestine, 1945-1949'', pgs. 27-28</ref>\n\n[[Yehoshua Porath]] believes that the notion of \"large-scale immigration of Arabs from the neighboring countries\" is a myth \"proposed by Zionist writers\". He writes:\n<blockquote>\nAs all the research by historian Fares Abdul Rahim and geographers of modern Palestine shows, the Arab population began to grow again in the middle of the nineteenth century. That growth resulted from a new factor: the demographic revolution. Until the 1850s there was no \"natural\" increase of the population, but this began to change when modern medical treatment was introduced and modern hospitals were established, both by the Ottoman authorities and by the foreign Christian missionaries. The number of births remained steady but infant mortality decreased. This was the main reason for Arab population growth. ... No one would doubt that some migrant workers came to Palestine from Syria and Trans-Jordan and remained there. But one has to add to this that there were migrations in the opposite direction as well. For example, a tradition developed in Hebron to go to study and work in Cairo, with the result that a permanent community of Hebronites had been living in Cairo since the fifteenth century. Trans-Jordan exported unskilled casual labor to Palestine; but before 1948 its civil service attracted a good many educated Palestinian Arabs who did not find work in Palestine itself. Demographically speaking, however, neither movement of population was significant in comparison to the decisive factor of natural increase.<ref>Porath, Y. (1986). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5249 Mrs. Peters's Palestine]. ''New York Review of Books''. 16 January, 32 (21 & 22).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[Daniel Pipes]] responded to Porath by granting that ''[[From Time Immemorial]]'' quoted carelessly, used statistics sloppily, and ignored inconvenient facts. Nonetheless, he explained that:<blockquote>\nMiss Peters's central thesis is that a substantial immigration of Arabs to Palestine took place during the first half of the twentieth century. She supports this argument with an array of demographic statistics and contemporary accounts, the bulk of which have not been questioned by any reviewer, including Porath.\n</blockquote>Porath replied with an array of demographic data to support his position. He also wrote that Peters's demographic statistics were inexplicable: <blockquote>\n...nowhere in her main text or in the methodological appendices (V and VI) did Mrs. Peters bother to explain to her readers how she managed to break down the Ottoman or Cuinet's figures into smaller units than subdistricts. As far as I know no figures for the units smaller than subdistricts (Nahia; the parallel of the French commune), covering the area of Ottoman Palestine, were ever published. Therefore I can't avoid the conclusion that Mrs. Peters's figures were, at best, based on guesswork and an extremely tendentious guesswork at that.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/5172 Mrs. Peters's Palestine: An Exchange], ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 33, Number 5, March 27, 1986.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Modern era==\n{{See also|Demographics of Israel|Israelis|Demographics of the Palestinian territories|Palestinian people#Demographics}}\n\n{{as of|2014}}, Israeli and Palestinian statistics for the overall numbers of Jews and Arabs in the area west of the Jordan, inclusive of Israel and the [[Palestinian territories]], are similar and suggest a rough parity in the two populations.

It is an updated version of 1997's ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'' and was the first game to appear on a [[Sixth generation of video game consoles|sixth-generation]] platform as well as the only ''Mortal Kombat'' game to be released for the Dreamcast console. Critical reaction was mostly average due to the graphics being inferior to the arcade version, the weapons deemed boring or useless, and game-breaking bugs and glitches.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Mortal Kombat Gold's'' gameplay is largely based on that of ''[[Mortal Kombat 4]]'' and includes several additional characters and stages not seen in ''Mortal Kombat 4'', as well as a new weapon selection mechanism. New stages include Church, Ladder, Netherrealm and Soul Chamber. A second revision of the game, identified by a \"Hot! New!\" logo on its box, was released about a month after the initial release, intending to address some of the major issues in it.<ref>{{cite web | title= Mortal Kombat Gold | url= http://www.whipassgaming.com/genesisreviews/mortalkombatgold.html | accessdate=January 6, 2007 | publisher=Whip Ass Gaming}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Revised Mortal Kombat Gold in Stores Now! | publisher = The Realm of Mortal Kombat | date = October 11, 1999 | url = http://www.trmk.org/news/665/revised_mortal_kombat_gold_in_stores_now_.html | accessdate = January 6, 2007}}</ref> This version fixed the most severe bugs and glitches in the game and added the [[VMU]] memory card support, which allowed the save feature to function properly.<ref name=wg/>\n\n==Characters==\n[[File:Mortal_Kombat_Gold,_Kung_Lao_vs_Baraka.png|thumb|[[Kung Lao]] fighting against [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] in the Soul Chamber arena]]\n''Mortal Kombat Gold'' features the same character roster as ''Mortal Kombat 4'', which includes [[Liu Kang]], [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax Briggs]], [[Sonya Blade]], [[Johnny Cage]], [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]], [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Reiko]], [[Jarek]], [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]], [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Tanya]], [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Kai]], [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]], [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Fujin]], [[Shinnok]], [[Quan Chi]], sub-boss [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]], and the secret characters [[Noob Saibot]] and [[List of Mortal Kombat characters|Meat]].

Dedicated to [[Saint Joseph]], it is one of two major [[Catholic]] churches in the city together with the [[Heikese kerk]]. It is located along the square Heuvel, after which it is named. A 1921 statue of the [[Sacred Heart]] is located in front of the building.\n\nConstruction of the church was divided into two phases due to financial constraints. The first part of the Heuvelse kerk was built in the period 1871\u201373, while the second phase took place between 1887 and 1889 and included the current front facade with its two towers. The church was [[consecrated]] in 1889 by the bishop of the [[Diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch]]. It was built in the garden of a [[barracks]] and was meant to accommodate Tilburg's increasing population. The barracks were renovated simultaneously to become a [[clergy house]]. The only major adjustment to the original building, designed by [[Hendrik van Tulder]], was an extension of both [[transept]]s in the 1950s.\n\nThe Heuvelse kerk has the floor plan of a [[cruciform]] [[basilica]]. Its most prominent exterior feature are the two towers with their height of {{convert|72|m}}. Three [[portal (architecture)|portal]]s in the front facade contain entrances, the central one being decorated with a [[relief]] showing the [[flight into Egypt]]. A [[copper]]-[[gilded]] statue of Saint Joseph sits on top of a [[gable]] between the towers. The interior is covered by a four-part [[rib vault]] and includes two organs and a winged altarpiece by Hendrik van der Geld, created between 1878 and 1881. [[Fresco]]s of the [[Stations of the Cross]] were painted two decades after the church's inauguration by Georges de Geetere.\n\nIn 2019, the parish announced plans to sell the Heuvelse kerk, but the bishop has postponed those plans.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Triumphal arch Heuvelse kerk.jpg|thumb|left|The committee that organized the consecration in 1889 posing in front of a triumphal arch resembling the church (located at the end of the Bosscheweg)]]\n=== Construction and consecration ===\nBefore the Heuvelse kerk was built, the area was part of the Tilburg parish \"'t Heike\", of which the [[Heikese kerk]] was the [[parish church]]. Due to a growing population, its management wanted to create a new parish, called \"St. Jozef\" or \"Heuvel\", with a new church at the location of a [[Royal Marechaussee]] [[barracks]] along the Heuvel, a square in the city center. Bishop [[Johannes Zwijsen]] approved the plan in 1870. He put Jan van der Lee, a [[curate]], in charge of the construction process of the Heuvelse kerk. In December of that same year, the parish exchanged lands surrounding the Heikese kerk for the barracks and its garden with the municipal government after the [[municipal council]] and the [[provincial-executive]] had approved the deal.<ref name=\"delpher4\">{{Cite newspaper |title = VIJFTIG JAREN GESCHIEDENIS DER PAROCHIE VAN DEN H.

Dedicated to [[Saint Joseph]], it is one of the two major [[Catholic]] churches in the city together with the [[Heikese kerk]]. It is located along the square Heuvel, after which it is named. A 1921 statue of the [[Sacred Heart]] is located in front of the building.\n\nConstruction of the church was divided into two phases due to financial constraints. The first part of the Heuvelse kerk was built in the period 1871\u201373, while the second phase took place between 1887 and 1889 and included the current front facade with its two towers. The church was [[consecrated]] in 1889 by the bishop of the [[Diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch]]. It was built in the garden of a [[barracks]] and was meant to accommodate Tilburg's increasing population. The barracks were renovated simultaneously to become a [[clergy house]]. The only major adjustment to the original building, designed by [[Hendrik van Tulder]], was an extension of both [[transept]]s in the 1950s.\n\nThe Heuvelse kerk has the floor plan of a [[cruciform]] [[basilica]]. Its most prominent exterior feature are the two towers with their height of {{convert|72|m}}. Three [[portal (architecture)|portal]]s in the front facade contain entrances, the central one being decorated with a [[relief]] showing the [[flight into Egypt]]. A [[copper]]-[[gilded]] statue of Saint Joseph sits on top of a [[gable]] between the towers. The interior is covered by a four-part [[rib vault]] and includes two organs and a winged altarpiece by Hendrik van der Geld, created between 1878 and 1881. [[Fresco]]s of the [[Stations of the Cross]] were painted two decades after the church's inauguration by Georges de Geetere.\n\nIn 2019, the parish announced plans to sell the Heuvelse kerk, but the bishop has postponed those plans.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Triumphal arch Heuvelse kerk.jpg|thumb|left|The committee that organized the consecration in 1889 posing in front of a triumphal arch resembling the church (located at the end of the Bosscheweg)]]\n=== Construction and consecration ===\nBefore the Heuvelse kerk was built, the area was part of the Tilburg parish \"'t Heike\", of which the [[Heikese kerk]] was the [[parish church]]. Due to a growing population, its management wanted to create a new parish, called \"St. Jozef\" or \"Heuvel\", with a new church at the location of a [[Royal Marechaussee]] [[barracks]] along the Heuvel, a square in the city center. Bishop [[Johannes Zwijsen]] approved the plan in 1870. He put Jan van der Lee, a [[curate]], in charge of the construction process of the Heuvelse kerk. In December of that same year, the parish exchanged lands surrounding the Heikese kerk for the barracks and its garden with the municipal government after the [[municipal council]] and the [[provincial-executive]] had approved the deal.<ref name=\"delpher4\">{{Cite newspaper |title = VIJFTIG JAREN GESCHIEDENIS DER PAROCHIE VAN DEN H.

A girl with an orange [[sash]] can be seen next to a little crown and Juliana's date of birth. A few years later, De Geetere also created paintings in two of the church's chapels.<ref name=\"tilburg\"/>\n\nThe two [[transept]]s are located on either side of the crossing. They used to be shallow, but were extended by parts with a lower ceiling in the [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian style]] between 1955 and 1956. The transepts have side aisles, but they are narrower in the extended part.<ref name=\"delpher2\"/><ref name=\"rijks\"/><ref name=\"tilburg\"/> Besides, in that section, the aisles are separated by rounded instead of pointed arches and the windows are arched. The [[choir (architecture)|choir]] has a length of three bays and contains a [[crucifix]] that is hanging from the ceiling. [[Sacristies]] are situated on both sides.<ref name=\"tilburg\"/> The [[apse]] is surrounded by [[Apse chapel|chapels]].<ref name=\"rijks\"/>\n\nThe Chapel of Perpetual Worship (Dutch: ''Kapel van Altijddurende Aanbidding'') is located close to the entrance of the Heuvelse kerk. This chapel has been opened 24/7 since 1991 and is supposed to be always occupied by worshippers, making it one of a few places in the Netherlands where this tradition is continued. However, ''[[Brabants Dagblad]]'' reported attendance is dwindling, and it is sometimes empty. The chapel itself contains chairs, [[prie-dieu]]x, and a [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]].<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.bd.nl/stadsgezicht-tilburg/tilburg-een-van-de-laatste-plekken-met-altijddurende-aanbidding-je-hoeft-de-specie-niet-uit-de-muur-te-bidden~a65fe8b2/ |title = Tilburg \u00e9\u00e9n van de laatste plekken met Altijddurende Aanbidding: 'Je hoeft de specie niet uit de muur te bidden' |date = 6 March 2018 |last = Vermeer |first = Bas |language = Dutch |newspaper = Brabants Dagblad |access-date = 17 December 2019 }}</ref>\n\n=== Altarpiece ===\n[[File:Heuvelse kerk main altar.jpg|thumb|Apse with altarpiece by Hendrik van der Geld (1878\u20131881)]]\nA [[winged altarpiece]] is located in the apse. It was created by Hendrik van der Geld in 1878, costing fl. 4,800. Missing parts were filled in later until it was finished in 1881 except for the wings of the [[predella]]. The altarpiece consists of [[oak]] and is filled with partly gilded reliefs. The left wing contains images of each of the five [[Joyful Mysteries|Joyful Mysteries of the Rosary]], while the middle part depicts the five [[Sorrowful Mysteries]] with the relief of the [[crucifixion of Jesus]] being larger than the other four. The central part is topped by tracery with statues of the [[Mother of God]], [[Jesus]], two [[angel]]s, [[Anthony the Great]], and [[Denis]]. Reliefs of the five [[Glorious Mysteries]] are shown on the right wing.<ref name=\"tilburg\"/>\n\nThe predella is located below the main part and has reliefs of the [[Last Supper]], the [[Passover (Christian holiday)|Passover]] meal, the sacrifice by [[Melchizedek]], and a meal with twelve people, all concerning the [[Eucharist|eucharistic celebration]]. Below that, the base depicts the [[binding of Isaac]], the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], and the rain of [[manna]].<ref name=\"tilburg\"/>\n\n=== Organs ===\n[[File:Interieur, aanzicht orgel, orgelnummer 1465 - Tilburg - 20417829 - RCE.jpg|thumb|The main organ]]\n[[File:Heuvelse kerk organ.jpg|thumb|Choir organ]]\nThe main organ was finished in 1894 and contains around 1,500 pipes.<ref name=\"ency\"/><ref name=\"rijks\"/> It was made by organ builder F.

{"title_page": "Athletic scholarship", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nAn '''athletic scholarship''' is a form of [[scholarship]] to attend a [[college]] or [[university]] or a [[private school|private high school]] awarded to an individual based predominantly on his or her ability to play in a [[sport]]. Athletic scholarships are common in the [[United States]], but in many countries they are rare or non-existent.\n\n==United States==\n\n===Overview===\n\n====Regulation and Organization====\nIn the United States, athletic scholarships are largely regulated by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). There are also [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) and NAIA, the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]].\n\nIn 1973, the NCAA split its membership into three divisions: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Under NCAA rules, Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport. Division III schools may not offer any athletic [[scholarship]]s. Generally, larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III. Most schools give offers to eligible students in most circumstances.\n\nDivision I football is further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly I-A) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly I-AA). The two differ in several ways:\n* Postseason system: FBS does not have a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]] officially sponsored by the NCAA. The four-team [[College Football Playoff]], which began with the 2014 season, is operated by the commissioners of the FBS conferences. Most of the college football postseason involves [[bowl game]]s, both inside and outside the CFP structure. FCS uses an NCAA-operated [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|single elimination playoff]], which has involved 24 teams since [[2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2013]].\n* Number of football scholarships: FBS schools are allowed 85 players receiving athletic aid, while FCS schools are allowed 63 scholarships. The wording is a very important distinction for another reason.\n* Awarding of partial scholarships: Because each player receiving athletic aid for football counts fully against an FBS team's scholarship limit, this effectively means that all players awarded football scholarships at FBS schools receive full scholarships. On the other hand, FCS schools are allowed to divide their 63 scholarships among no more than 85 individual players.\n\nSome schools or leagues permitted by the NCAA to award athletic scholarships nevertheless prohibit them among their students. An example is the [[Ivy League]], which is part of Division I FCS. The three [[United States service academies|service academies]] that participate in Division I FBS football ([[United States Military Academy|Army]], [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]], and [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]]) are effectively exempt from NCAA scholarship limits because all students at those schools, whether or not they are varsity athletes, receive full scholarships from the service branch that operates the academy.\n\nInstitutions that engage in misconduct may be stripped of the ability to award a certain number of athletic scholarships. The ultimate penalty, the suspension of an entire athletic program from participation for a set period of time, is popularly known as [[Death penalty (NCAA)|\"The Death Penalty\"]]; it has only been levied three times against schools now in Division I: against [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky basketball]] in 1952, Southwestern Louisiana (now [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball|Louisiana]]) basketball in 1973, and [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU football]] [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|in 1986]].\n\nIn addition to the regulations imposed by the NCAA on the educational institution, the rules governing the provision of athletic scholarship and financial aid are also exhaustive. As noted above, NCAA bylaws place a cap on the number of student-athletes that participate in a given sport at a particular school, who are eligible to receive institutional aid.<ref name=Hakim>{{cite journal |last=Hakim |first=Louis |title=The Student-Athlete vs. The Athlete Student: Has The Time Arrived For An Extended-Term Scholarship Contract |url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=2+Va.+J.+Sports+%26+L.+145&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=c4487253c74464499615607cf5c5a688 |journal=Va.

Specifically, it must not exceed the cost of the individual's education otherwise it is considered \"pay\", which violates an athlete's amateur status.<ref name=Hakim/>\n\nAcademic eligibility, in addition to the other requirements mentioned, has been a longstanding issue in the history of college athletics. In order to respond to the lack of national academic standards, the NCAA passed the 1.600 GPA rule in 1962 in order for freshmen to receive athletic scholarships.<ref name=Smith>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Ronald A.|title=Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform|year=2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> However, this decision received widespread criticism and was eventually abolished in 1973.<ref name=Smith/> In its wake, the American Council on Education (ACE) presented Proposition 48 to the NCAA conference in 1983.<ref name=Smith/> Instead of a minimum 1.600 freshmen GPA, it recommended that for a student to be eligible they must obtain a 2.0 high school GPA, take 11 core high school courses, and score either a 700 on the [[SAT]] or a 15 on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]].<ref name=Smith/> However, just as the 1.600 rule generated controversy, so to did Proposition 48. Joseph B. Johnson, the president of [[Grambling State University]] and a representative of the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education argued that it \"[discriminated] against student-athletes from low-income and minority-group families by introducing arbitrary SAT and ACT cut off scores as academic criteria for eligibility.\"<ref name=Smith/> To address this, the NCAA added a partial qualifier to the suggested guidelines. Thus, under the revision, an athlete who met either the 2.0 high school GPA or 700 SAT/15 ACT score would be eligible to receive a scholarship, but would be unable to practice with or play for the team for one academic year.<ref name=Smith/> This partial qualifier was subsequently overturned in 1989 following the passage of Prop 42.<ref name=Smith/> However, amendments to Prop 42 restored it after much protest.<ref name=Smith/> The newest amendment to Proposition 48, Prop 16, was passed in 1992 and later revised in 2008. As of 2008, under Prop 16, a sliding scale for standardized test scores was expanded to allow for a zero score to be allowed in a test, as long as the high school GPA was sufficient to balance it out. Moreover, the number of core high school courses required was increased to 14.<ref name=Smith/>\n\nOnce a high school senior is deemed eligible to receive an athletic scholarship for their participation on a sports team, they must then follow a number of explicit steps in order to participate at the collegiate level. In particular, the NCAA mandates that they sign a [[National Letter of Intent]] (NLI), which is effectively an agreement that binds the student-athlete to institution in which they have chosen to enroll.<ref name=Hakim/>\n\nSome applicants choose commercial third parties to act as intermediaries which seek out scholarships and facilitate the application process.\n\n===Division I===\n\n==== Origin of athletic scholarships in the U.S. ====\n{{One source|section|date=March 2015}}\nPrior to the late 19th century, college athletics consisted largely of informal gatherings orchestrated by students.<ref name=Hakim/> The first college game ever played took place on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers defeated Princeton 6\u20134 in football.<ref name=Branch>{{cite news |last=Branch |first=Taylor |title=The Shame of College Sports |newspaper=The Atlantic |date=October 2011 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/10/the-shame-of-college-sports/308643/ |accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> Following this monumental game, a movement swept across American colleges that increased the number of schools participating in athletics. As the popularity of sports grew, colleges also began to actively recruit individuals, as well as to offer scholarships.<ref name=Hakim/> As early as the 1870s, both colleges and universities were providing financial support and incentives to athletes.<ref name=Hakim/> It was not an uncommon practice at this time for non-students to participate in order to increase the success of a team.<ref name=Hakim/> In fact, one story tells of a farm boy recruited to play football at the [[University of Kansas]] in 1895.<ref name=Hakim/> As a result of these practices, numerous concerns were raised, including the desire to regulate college athletics. In 1905, the NCAA was created with the intention of \"the regulation and supervision of college athletics throughout the United States, in order that the athletic activities in colleges and universities of the United States may be maintained on an ethical plan in keeping with the dignity and high purpose of education.\"<ref name=Hakim/> Right from the start, the NCAA expressed a commitment to preserving both education and amateurism within college athletics. Toward this goal, the NCAA was forced to address student funding, specifically alumni sponsorship. Thus, in 1939 the NCAA delivered a statement which emphasized the [[Amateurism|amateur]] status of student-athletes and stated that financial awards would be needs based and independent of the individual's continued athletic participation.<ref name=Hakim/> Then, in 1950, under the governance of the NCAA, colleges developed the athletic scholarship, as a way to pay prospective student-athletes. As a consequence, prospective students would be awarded financially on the basis of athletic ability.<ref name=Hakim/> For the next twenty years, there were no limits, as set by the NCAA, on the number of scholarships that an educational institution could award players, as well as no limit on the length of the scholarship term.<ref name=Hakim/> Moreover, if an athlete withdrew participation from his sport, his scholarship could not be revoked.<ref name=Hakim/> However, this all changed at the NCAA's annual convention in 1973.\n\n==== NCAA bylaws governing Division I athletic scholarships ====\nOn January 13, 1973 the NCAA revised the scholarship system, and voted to institute a one-year scholarship as opposed to the four-year scholarship already in place.<ref name=Hakim/><ref name=Smith/> Today, Article 15 of the NCAA Manual Bylaws governs the regulations regarding financial aid grants and athletic scholarships for student athletes.<ref name=Hakim/> As of 2010, Bylaw 15.3.3.1. for Division I athletic programs differs little from the one-year rule invoked in 1973, as it reads, \"If a student's athletics ability is considered in any degree in awarding financial aid, such aid shall neither be awarded for a period in excess of one academic year nor for a period less than one academic year.\"<ref name=NCAA>{{cite journal|title=NCAA Divisions I and II Period of Award Legislation|journal=The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)|date=September 1, 2010}}</ref> In addition to the \"One-Year Period\", the Bylaws also address recommendations made to extend the one-year term, as well as the policies surrounding injury or illness. Specifically, Bylaw 15.3.3.1.3 states that \"It is not permissible for an institution to assure the prospective student-athlete that it automatically will continue a grant-in-aid past the one-year period if the recipient sustains an injury that prevents him or her from competing in intercollegiate athletics, but an institutional representative may inform the prospective student-athlete of the regular institutional policy related to renewal or continuation of aid past the one-year period for recipients who become ill or injured during their participation.\"<ref name=NCAA/> Moreover, Bylaw 15.3.4 addresses the instances in which an award may be reduced or canceled during the period of the award. According to the NCAA, this applies if a student-athlete becomes ineligible to compete, engages in fraudulent behavior (i.e. provides false information on their application, letter of intent, or financial aid agreement), engages in misconduct that results in disciplinary action, or voluntarily ends participation in the sport.<ref name=NCAA/> However, the NCAA asserts that the student-athlete must be awarded a hearing before the reduction or cancellation occurs.<ref name=NCAA/> In addition to the circumstances in which reduction or cancellation of an award is permissible, there are circumstances in which such action cannot be taken during the term period. Specifically, financial aid cannot be withdrawn or reduced during the award period based on athletic ability, performance, or contribution to success. This is true also in the event of injury, illness, or the result of a physical or mental condition.<ref name=NCAA/>\n\n==== Future directions ====\nAs a consequence of the complaints voiced and involvement by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], in August 2011 the Division I Board of Directors adopted multiyear scholarship legislation to allow Division I schools to provide scholarships for a period greater than one year<ref name=Hosick>{{cite web|last=Hosick |first=Michelle |title=Multiyear scholarship rule narrowly upheld |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/February/Multiyear+scholarship+rule+narrowly+upheld |accessdate=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221001303/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest%2Bnews/2012/february/multiyear%2Bscholarship%2Brule%2Bnarrowly%2Bupheld |archivedate=21 February 2012 }}</ref> This legislation was one of many steps the Board of Directors took after the NCAA President Mark Emmert organized a meeting to discuss issues with the operation of Division I athletics.<ref name=\"Division I\">{{cite web |title=Division I opens override voting on multiyear scholarships |url=http://dailycomplianceitem.wordpress.com/category/scholarships/ |accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> Voting to override Proposal No 2011-97 (as it was named) was open until Friday, February 17, 2012.<ref name=\"Division I\"/> By a very narrow margin, the multiyear scholarship legislation was upheld.

Rather, the decision, provides coaches and universities with the option to extend the scholarship term if they so choose.<ref name= \"Associated Press\"/> By spring 2012, a number of sports programs had declared their intent to offer multiyear scholarships including Ohio State, Auburn, Michigan, Michigan State, Florida, and Nebraska.<ref name= \"Associated Press\"/>\n\nIn June 2014, the [[Big Ten Conference]] school presidents endorsed a proposal for four-year guaranteed scholarships that covered the full cost of attendance, although it had not yet moved to implement this proposal.

Alternatively, the athlete is eligible to receive an award at the end of their first year at a university (spring or summer) if they satisfy [[U Sports]] academic requirements with at least a 65% average or equivalent. Thereafter, the athlete is eligible to receive an award at the beginning of any year if they satisfy U Sports academic requirements with at least a 65% average or equivalent in the preceding year.\n\nMany Canadian student/athletes decide to go to NCAA Division 1 programs based on the illusion that they are receiving a better deal from these schools with regards to finances and athletics. A typical Canadian university program could cost between $5,000-$6,000 Canadian per year, where as an NCAA school charges between $25,000 to $40,000 US to attend their programs. Compounding this is the cost of travel to and from the university for both student and family and the associated costs of living away from home. Based on the information above, Canadian schools have less tuition to cover and also do not have to include substantial federal/provincial scholarships and academic scholarships in their scholarship declarations.\n\nWhile the competitive standard for some sports may be higher in some Division I (and sometimes Division II) schools, this does vary. In general, this difference would not materialize until the play-off portion of the season, where the standard is much higher overall than the general standard of NCAA competition.\n\nThe academic standard for athletes is lower in United States and leaves many Canadian students returning to Canada having to take extra courses and in some cases, extra years of study in order to have their academic qualifications recognized.\n\nU Sports schools are also not bound by the tight NCAA rules surrounding contacts with athletes and in reality, means that U Sports coaches have the potential to develop their athletes to a higher standard, while also maintaining higher academics due to the above-mentioned differences in academic standards.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom entrance scholarships based on sporting ability <!--in the UK context \"athletic scholarship\" would only cover track and field (and sports would be American English in this context.--> are not traditional, though contrary to popular belief they are not actually banned. Sporting ability may be taken into account in admission for places on degrees in subjects such as [[sports science]], and at the discretion of admissions staff sporting achievements may be taken into account on choosing candidates based on their ability to make an all round contribution to the institution in the same way as achievements in any other non-academic area. Students who are elite standard sports competitors are eligible for financial support from bodies such as [[UK Sport]] on the same basis as anyone else. Certain universities have a strong emphasis on sport, including [[Loughborough University]], [[University of Bath]] and [[Richmond, The American International University in London]] each of which hosts a number of nationally funded training facilities. Some universities may make [[bursaries]] available to top student athletes, though these are generally not large. Some British students take athletic scholarships at American universities, a trend which is particularly noticeable in golf. Many top British golfers are graduates of American universities including [[Colin Montgomerie]], [[Luke Donald]] and [[Paul Casey]]. Many young individuals use sports scholarships agencies such [[Athletes USA, Ltd|Athletes USA]] to help them gain a sports scholarship.\n\n===New Zealand===\nSome secondary schools in New Zealand, mainly private ones, offer entrance scholarships based on sporting ability. However, these have been restricted in recent years by the New Zealand Secondary School Sports Council's (NZSSSC) anti-poaching rules.\n\nThe NZSSSC introduced a quota system in 2007 on the number of new-to-school and international students a school can field at national championships.<ref name=\"NZSSSC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsground.co.nz/nzsssc/71311/3 |title=Regulations and Eligibility |publisher=New Zealand Secondary School Sports Council |accessdate=5 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106033126/http://www.sportsground.co.nz/nzsssc/71311/3 |archivedate=6 January 2014 }}</ref> Some regional secondary school sporting bodies have also enacted the NZSSSC's rules to first teams in local competitions.<ref name=\"CSWgtn\">{{cite web|title=COLLEGE SPORT WELLINGTON INCORPORATED BY LAWS |publisher=College Sport Wellington |date=November 2012 |url=http://www.collegesport.org.nz/upload/usermedia/files/35900/2013%20by%20laws.pdf |accessdate=5 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207123339/http://www.collegesport.org.nz/upload/usermedia/files/35900/2013%20by%20laws.pdf |archivedate=7 February 2013 }}</ref> A new-to-school student is a student who has enrolled at the school in the 24 months prior to the event, excluding students who enrolled at the school in [[Year Nine|Year 9]] (the first year/grade of secondary school) or below. An international student is a student who is not a New Zealand citizen, Australian citizen, or the holder of a New Zealand residence class visa or domestic-endorsed student visa. The quota depends on the sport, for example, [[rugby union]] teams (15-a-side) are only allowed six new-to-school and international students, and only two of those six students may be international students.\n\nIn addition to the quota system, schools are not permitted to induce a student to change schools for sporting purposes, other than by way of a publicly advertised sporting scholarship.

The theory is that while most academic scholarships are predominantly awarded to students of middle and upper-class backgrounds (thought of as counter-intuitive, as they are typically considered more affluent), many feel the tendency does, in fact, lean toward athletic scholarships being awarded to less-privileged students, who are, in many cases, members of a minority. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes NCAA Website: Student Athletes]\n*[http://www.finaid.org/educators/20110505athleticscholarships.pdf Backgrounder: Athletic Scholarships]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325055907/http://www.recruiticus.com/athletic-scholarship-faq/athletic-scholarship-faq Athletic Scholarship F.A.Q.]*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325054251/http://www.ncaapublications.com/p-4236-2013-14-ncaa-guide-for-the-college-bound-student-athlete-sold-as-a-packages-of-25-due-summer-2013.aspx NCAA Guide for Student Athletes]*\n\n[[Category:Student sport]]\n[[Category:Scholarships]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n\nAn '''athletic scholarship''' is a form of [[scholarship]] to attend a [[college]] or [[university]] or a [[private school|private high school]] awarded to an individual based predominantly on his or her ability to play in a [[sport]]. Athletic scholarships are common in the [[United States]], but in many countries they are rare or non-existent. \n\n==United States==\n\n===Overview===\n\n====Regulation and Organization====\nIn the United States, athletic scholarships are largely regulated by the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). There are also [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] (NJCAA) and NAIA, the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]].\n\nIn 1973, the NCAA split its membership into three divisions: [[NCAA Division I|Division I]], [[NCAA Division II|Division II]], and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]]. Under NCAA rules, Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport. Division III schools may not offer any athletic [[scholarship]]s. Generally, larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III. Most schools give offers to eligible students in most circumstances.\n\nDivision I football is further divided into the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS, formerly I-A) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS, formerly I-AA). The two differ in several ways:\n* Postseason system: FBS does not have a [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]] officially sponsored by the NCAA. The four-team [[College Football Playoff]], which began with the 2014 season, is operated by the commissioners of the FBS conferences. Most of the college football postseason involves [[bowl game]]s, both inside and outside the CFP structure. FCS uses an NCAA-operated [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|single elimination playoff]], which has involved 24 teams since [[2013 NCAA Division I FCS football season|2013]].\n* Number of football scholarships: FBS schools are allowed 85 players receiving athletic aid, while FCS schools are allowed 63 scholarships. The wording is a very important distinction for another reason.\n* Awarding of partial scholarships: Because each player receiving athletic aid for football counts fully against an FBS team's scholarship limit, this effectively means that all players awarded football scholarships at FBS schools receive full scholarships. On the other hand, FCS schools are allowed to divide their 63 scholarships among no more than 85 individual players.\n\nSome schools or leagues permitted by the NCAA to award athletic scholarships nevertheless prohibit them among their students. An example is the [[Ivy League]], which is part of Division I FCS. The three [[United States service academies|service academies]] that participate in Division I FBS football ([[United States Military Academy|Army]], [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]], and [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force]]) are effectively exempt from NCAA scholarship limits because all students at those schools, whether or not they are varsity athletes, receive full scholarships from the service branch that operates the academy.\n\nInstitutions that engage in misconduct may be stripped of the ability to award a certain number of athletic scholarships. The ultimate penalty, the suspension of an entire athletic program from participation for a set period of time, is popularly known as [[Death penalty (NCAA)|\"The Death Penalty\"]]; it has only been levied three times against schools now in Division I: against [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky basketball]] in 1952, Southwestern Louisiana (now [[Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's basketball|Louisiana]]) basketball in 1973, and [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU football]] [[Southern Methodist University football scandal|in 1986]].\n\nIn addition to the regulations imposed by the NCAA on the educational institution, the rules governing the provision of athletic scholarship and financial aid are also exhaustive. As noted above, NCAA bylaws place a cap on the number of student-athletes that participate in a given sport at a particular school, who are eligible to receive institutional aid.<ref name=Hakim>{{cite journal |last=Hakim |first=Louis |title=The Student-Athlete vs. The Athlete Student: Has The Time Arrived For An Extended-Term Scholarship Contract |url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&crawlid=1&doctype=cite&docid=2+Va.+J.+Sports+%26+L.+145&srctype=smi&srcid=3B15&key=c4487253c74464499615607cf5c5a688 |journal=Va.

Specifically, it must not exceed the cost of the individual's education otherwise it is considered \"pay\", which violates an athlete's amateur status.<ref name=Hakim/>\n\nAcademic eligibility, in addition to the other requirements mentioned, has been a longstanding issue in the history of college athletics. In order to respond to the lack of national academic standards, the NCAA passed the 1.600 GPA rule in 1962 in order for freshmen to receive athletic scholarships.<ref name=Smith>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Ronald A.|title=Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform|year=2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Chicago, IL}}</ref> However, this decision received widespread criticism and was eventually abolished in 1973.<ref name=Smith/> In its wake, the American Council on Education (ACE) presented Proposition 48 to the NCAA conference in 1983.<ref name=Smith/> Instead of a minimum 1.600 freshmen GPA, it recommended that for a student to be eligible they must obtain a 2.0 high school GPA, take 11 core high school courses, and score either a 700 on the [[SAT]] or a 15 on the [[ACT (test)|ACT]].<ref name=Smith/> However, just as the 1.600 rule generated controversy, so to did Proposition 48. Joseph B. Johnson, the president of [[Grambling State University]] and a representative of the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education argued that it \"[discriminated] against student-athletes from low-income and minority-group families by introducing arbitrary SAT and ACT cut off scores as academic criteria for eligibility.\"<ref name=Smith/> To address this, the NCAA added a partial qualifier to the suggested guidelines. Thus, under the revision, an athlete who met either the 2.0 high school GPA or 700 SAT/15 ACT score would be eligible to receive a scholarship, but would be unable to practice with or play for the team for one academic year.<ref name=Smith/> This partial qualifier was subsequently overturned in 1989 following the passage of Prop 42.<ref name=Smith/> However, amendments to Prop 42 restored it after much protest.<ref name=Smith/> The newest amendment to Proposition 48, Prop 16, was passed in 1992 and later revised in 2008. As of 2008, under Prop 16, a sliding scale for standardized test scores was expanded to allow for a zero score to be allowed in a test, as long as the high school GPA was sufficient to balance it out. Moreover, the number of core high school courses required was increased to 14.<ref name=Smith/>\n\nOnce a high school senior is deemed eligible to receive an athletic scholarship for their participation on a sports team, they must then follow a number of explicit steps in order to participate at the collegiate level. In particular, the NCAA mandates that they sign a [[National Letter of Intent]] (NLI), which is effectively an agreement that binds the student-athlete to institution in which they have chosen to enroll.<ref name=Hakim/>\n\nSome applicants choose commercial third parties to act as intermediaries which seek out scholarships and facilitate the application process.\n\n===Division I===\n\n==== Origin of athletic scholarships in the U.S. ====\n{{One source|section|date=March 2015}}\nPrior to the late 19th century, college athletics consisted largely of informal gatherings orchestrated by students.<ref name=Hakim/> The first college game ever played took place on November 6, 1869, when Rutgers defeated Princeton 6-4 in football.<ref name=Branch>{{cite news |last=Branch |first=Taylor |title=The Shame of College Sports |newspaper=The Atlantic |date=October 2011 |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/10/the-shame-of-college-sports/308643/ |accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> Following this monumental game, a movement swept across American colleges that increased the number of schools participating in athletics. As the popularity of sports grew, colleges also began to actively recruit individuals, as well as to offer scholarships.<ref name=Hakim/> As early as the 1870s, both colleges and universities were providing financial support and incentives to athletes.<ref name=Hakim/> It was not an uncommon practice at this time for non-students to participate in order to increase the success of a team.<ref name=Hakim/> In fact, one story tells of a farm boy recruited to play football at the [[University of Kansas]] in 1895.<ref name=Hakim/> As a result of these practices, numerous concerns were raised, including the desire to regulate college athletics. In 1905, the NCAA was created with the intention of \"the regulation and supervision of college athletics throughout the United States, in order that the athletic activities in colleges and universities of the United States may be maintained on an ethical plan in keeping with the dignity and high purpose of education.\"<ref name=Hakim/> Right from the start, the NCAA expressed a commitment to preserving both education and amateurism within college athletics. Toward this goal, the NCAA was forced to address student funding, specifically alumni sponsorship. Thus, in 1939 the NCAA delivered a statement which emphasized the [[Amateurism|amateur]] status of student-athletes and stated that financial awards would be needs based and independent of the individual's continued athletic participation.<ref name=Hakim/> Then, in 1950, under the governance of the NCAA, colleges developed the athletic scholarship, as a way to pay prospective student-athletes. As a consequence, prospective students would be awarded financially on the basis of athletic ability.<ref name=Hakim/> For the next twenty years, there were no limits, as set by the NCAA, on the number of scholarships that an educational institution could award players, as well as no limit on the length of the scholarship term.<ref name=Hakim/> Moreover, if an athlete withdrew participation from his sport, his scholarship could not be revoked.<ref name=Hakim/> However, this all changed at the NCAA's annual convention in 1973.\n\n==== NCAA bylaws governing Division I athletic scholarships ====\nOn January 13, 1973 the NCAA revised the scholarship system, and voted to institute a one-year scholarship as opposed to the four-year scholarship already in place.<ref name=Hakim/><ref name=Smith/> Today, Article 15 of the NCAA Manual Bylaws governs the regulations regarding financial aid grants and athletic scholarships for student athletes.<ref name=Hakim/> As of 2010, Bylaw 15.3.3.1. for Division I athletic programs differs little from the one-year rule invoked in 1973, as it reads, \"If a student's athletics ability is considered in any degree in awarding financial aid, such aid shall neither be awarded for a period in excess of one academic year nor for a period less than one academic year.\"<ref name=NCAA>{{cite journal|title=NCAA Divisions I and II Period of Award Legislation|journal=The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)|date=September 1, 2010}}</ref> In addition to the \"One-Year Period\", the Bylaws also address recommendations made to extend the one-year term, as well as the policies surrounding injury or illness. Specifically, Bylaw 15.3.3.1.3 states that \"It is not permissible for an institution to assure the prospective student-athlete that it automatically will continue a grant-in-aid past the one-year period if the recipient sustains an injury that prevents him or her from competing in intercollegiate athletics, but an institutional representative may inform the prospective student-athlete of the regular institutional policy related to renewal or continuation of aid past the one-year period for recipients who become ill or injured during their participation.\"<ref name=NCAA/> Moreover, Bylaw 15.3.4 addresses the instances in which an award may be reduced or canceled during the period of the award. According to the NCAA, this applies if a student-athlete becomes ineligible to compete, engages in fraudulent behavior (i.e. provides false information on their application, letter of intent, or financial aid agreement), engages in misconduct that results in disciplinary action, or voluntarily ends participation in the sport.<ref name=NCAA/> However, the NCAA asserts that the student-athlete must be awarded a hearing before the reduction or cancellation occurs.<ref name=NCAA/> In addition to the circumstances in which reduction or cancellation of an award is permissible, there are circumstances in which such action cannot be taken during the term period. Specifically, financial aid cannot be withdrawn or reduced during the award period based on athletic ability, performance, or contribution to success. This is true also in the event of injury, illness, or the result of a physical or mental condition.<ref name=NCAA/>\n\n==== Future directions ====\nAs a consequence of the complaints voiced and involvement by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], in August 2011 the Division I Board of Directors adopted multiyear scholarship legislation to allow Division I schools to provide scholarships for a period greater than one year<ref name=Hosick>{{cite web|last=Hosick |first=Michelle |title=Multiyear scholarship rule narrowly upheld |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/February/Multiyear+scholarship+rule+narrowly+upheld |accessdate=20 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221001303/http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/latest%2Bnews/2012/february/multiyear%2Bscholarship%2Brule%2Bnarrowly%2Bupheld |archivedate=21 February 2012 }}</ref> This legislation was one of many steps the Board of Directors took after the NCAA President Mark Emmert organized a meeting to discuss issues with the operation of Division I athletics.<ref name=\"Division I\">{{cite web |title=Division I opens override voting on multiyear scholarships |url=http://dailycomplianceitem.wordpress.com/category/scholarships/ |accessdate=17 April 2013}}</ref> Voting to override Proposal No 2011-97 (as it was named) was open until Friday, February 17, 2012.<ref name=\"Division I\"/> By a very narrow margin, the multiyear scholarship legislation was upheld.

Rather, the decision, provides coaches and universities with the option to extend the scholarship term if they so choose.<ref name= \"Associated Press\"/> By spring 2012, a number of sports programs had declared their intent to offer multiyear scholarships including Ohio State, Auburn, Michigan, Michigan State, Florida, and Nebraska.<ref name= \"Associated Press\"/>\n\nIn June 2014, the [[Big Ten Conference]] school presidents endorsed a proposal for four-year guaranteed scholarships that covered the full cost of attendance, although it had not yet moved to implement this proposal. This followed a policy statement by the school presidents of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] that stopped just short of endorsing the same.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/24596437/big-ten-presidents-endorse-four-year-full-cost-scholarships |title=Big Ten presidents endorse four-year, full-cost scholarships |first=Jerry |last=Hinnen |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |date=June 24, 2014 |accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first school known to have actually implemented a four-year guarantee was the [[University of South Carolina]], which announced on September 25, 2014 that athletes in [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|football]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|men's]] and [[South Carolina Gamecocks women's basketball|women's]] basketball, and women's [[South Carolina Gamecocks women's tennis|tennis]] and [[South Carolina Gamecocks volleyball|volleyball]] would receive guaranteed scholarships effective immediately.

The bill also stated that students should pay this fee from their own means, meaning that no federal or state grants would cover this fee. Only students on full-ride academic or athletic scholarships would have been exempt from this fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov//FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/legtext/50leg/2r/bills/hb2675p.htm&Session_ID=107|title=Format Document|author=|date=|website=www.azleg.gov|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> The bill had been scheduled for a vote by the full House, but was then withdrawn by the legislator who had originally introduced it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/index.php/article/2012/03/kavanagh_withdraws_tuition_bill |title=Kavanagh withdraws tuition bill |first=Eliza |last=Molk |newspaper=[[Arizona Daily Wildcat]] |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=November 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Other countries==\nIn other countries athletic scholarships are far more restricted.\n\n===Canada===\nA common misconception is that Canadian schools do not offer athletic scholarship money for their athletes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.cis-sic.ca/information/student-athlete_info/athletes_guide |title=CIS: Athletes Guide |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621103354/http://english.cis-sic.ca/information/student-athlete_info/athletes_guide |archivedate=2012-06-21 }}</ref>\n* Tuition and compulsory fees is the maximum amount an athlete can receive for athletic-related awards in an academic year, including athletic-related bursaries. \n* The value and quantity of athletic-related awards and bursaries available varies from institution to institution. \n* Specific awards and bursaries may have additional conditions, such as academic success and citizenship\n* Many awards, such as academic awards or awards provided by Sport Governing Bodies or the Federal and Provincial Governments, are not included within the tuition and compulsory fees maximum\n* The athlete is eligible to receive an award or bursary at the beginning of their first year (September) at a university if they have a minimum entering average of 80% or equivalent. Alternatively, the athlete is eligible to receive an award at the end of their first year at a university (spring or summer) if they satisfy [[U Sports]] academic requirements with at least a 65% average or equivalent. Thereafter, the athlete is eligible to receive an award at the beginning of any year if they satisfy U Sports academic requirements with at least a 65% average or equivalent in the preceding year.\n\nMany Canadian student/athletes decide to go to NCAA Division 1 programs based on the illusion that they are receiving a better deal from these schools with regards to finances and athletics. A typical Canadian university program could cost between $5,000-$6,000 Canadian per year, where as an NCAA school charges between $25,000 to $40,000 US to attend their programs. Compounding this is the cost of travel to and from the university for both student and family and the associated costs of living away from home. Based on the information above, Canadian schools have less tuition to cover and also do not have to include substantial federal/provincial scholarships and academic scholarships in their scholarship declarations.\n\nWhile the competitive standard for some sports may be higher in some Division I (and sometimes Division II) schools, this does vary. In general, this difference would not materialize until the play-off portion of the season, where the standard is much higher overall than the general standard of NCAA competition.\n\nThe academic standard for athletes is lower in United States and leaves many Canadian students returning to Canada having to take extra courses and in some cases, extra years of study in order to have their academic qualifications recognized.\n\nU Sports schools are also not bound by the tight NCAA rules surrounding contacts with athletes and in reality, means that U Sports coaches have the potential to develop their athletes to a higher standard, while also maintaining higher academics due to the above-mentioned differences in academic standards.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom entrance scholarships based on sporting ability <!--in the UK context \"athletic scholarship\" would only cover track and field (and sports would be American English in this context.--> are not traditional, though contrary to popular belief they are not actually banned. Sporting ability may be taken into account in admission for places on degrees in subjects such as [[sports science]], and at the discretion of admissions staff sporting achievements may be taken into account on choosing candidates based on their ability to make an all round contribution to the institution in the same way as achievements in any other non-academic area. Students who are elite standard sports competitors are eligible for financial support from bodies such as [[UK Sport]] on the same basis as anyone else. Certain universities have a strong emphasis on sport, including [[Loughborough University]], [[University of Bath]] and [[Richmond, The American International University in London]] each of which hosts a number of nationally funded training facilities. Some universities may make [[bursaries]] available to top student athletes, though these are generally not large. Some British students take athletic scholarships at American universities, a trend which is particularly noticeable in golf. Many top British golfers are graduates of American universities including [[Colin Montgomerie]], [[Luke Donald]] and [[Paul Casey]]. Many young individuals use sports scholarships agencies such [[Athletes USA, Ltd|Athletes USA]] to help them gain a sports scholarship.\n\n===New Zealand===\nSome secondary schools in New Zealand, mainly private ones, offer entrance scholarships based on sporting ability. However, these have been restricted in recent years by the New Zealand Secondary School Sports Council's (NZSSSC) anti-poaching rules.\n\nThe NZSSSC introduced a quota system in 2007 on the number of new-to-school and international students a school can field at national championships.<ref name=\"NZSSSC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsground.co.nz/nzsssc/71311/3 |title=Regulations and Eligibility |publisher=New Zealand Secondary School Sports Council |accessdate=5 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106033126/http://www.sportsground.co.nz/nzsssc/71311/3 |archivedate=6 January 2014 }}</ref> Some regional secondary school sporting bodies have also enacted the NZSSSC's rules to first teams in local competitions.<ref name=\"CSWgtn\">{{cite web|title=COLLEGE SPORT WELLINGTON INCORPORATED BY LAWS |publisher=College Sport Wellington |date=November 2012 |url=http://www.collegesport.org.nz/upload/usermedia/files/35900/2013%20by%20laws.pdf |accessdate=5 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207123339/http://www.collegesport.org.nz/upload/usermedia/files/35900/2013%20by%20laws.pdf |archivedate=7 February 2013 }}</ref> A new-to-school student is a student who has enrolled at the school in the 24 months prior to the event, excluding students who enrolled at the school in [[Year Nine|Year 9]] (the first year/grade of secondary school) or below. An international student is a student who is not a New Zealand citizen, Australian citizen, or the holder of a New Zealand residence class visa or domestic-endorsed student visa. The quota depends on the sport, for example, [[rugby union]] teams (15-a-side) are only allowed six new-to-school and international students, and only two of those six students may be international students.\n\nIn addition to the quota system, schools are not permitted to induce a student to change schools for sporting purposes, other than by way of a publicly advertised sporting scholarship. The penalties for breaking either rule is loss of competition points and/or disqualification of the athletes, teams, coaches and/or managers involved.<ref name=\"NZSSSC\" /><ref name=\"CSWgtn\" />\n\n==Arguments for and against sports scholarships==\nCritics have labeled the term to be an [[oxymoron]], stating that physically talented persons selected for their ability to run, jump, throw, kick or hit a ball are retained to staff a school's teams, and paid for their services while being classified as \"scholars\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Some critics of the athletic scholarship system have coined the term \"jockship\" to describe the awards.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The term is based on the word ''[[Jock (subculture)|jock]]'', a mildly derisive American slang term that plays on the [[stereotype]] of the \"dumb athlete\".\n\nSuch scholarships have been characterized as [[salaries]] paid to the persons selected in order to induce them to perform for the hiring school.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} (The characterization of the salary as a \"scholarship\" is deemed necessary because, generally, at most American colleges, participation as a member of the school's athletic teams is a privilege accorded exclusively to enrolled students, and team members are, in theory, amateurs.)\n\nSupporters contend that many students would be unable to receive a [[higher education]] at all, but for the availability of athletic scholarships, due to the prohibitive costs associated with university education. The theory is that while most academic scholarships are predominantly awarded to students of middle and upper-class backgrounds (thought of as counter-intuitive, as they are typically considered more affluent), many feel the tendency does, in fact, lean toward athletic scholarships being awarded to less-privileged students, who are, in many cases, members of a minority. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ncaa.org/student-athletes NCAA Website: Student Athletes]\n*[http://www.finaid.org/educators/20110505athleticscholarships.pdf Backgrounder: Athletic Scholarships]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325055907/http://www.recruiticus.com/athletic-scholarship-faq/athletic-scholarship-faq Athletic Scholarship F.A.Q.]*\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325054251/http://www.ncaapublications.com/p-4236-2013-14-ncaa-guide-for-the-college-bound-student-athlete-sold-as-a-packages-of-25-due-summer-2013.aspx NCAA Guide for Student Athletes]*\n\n[[Category:Student sport]]\n[[Category:Scholarships]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: 6-4 \u2192 6\u20134", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_scholarship"}

Are you finished with all that now?''' No, I did two weeks helping a buddy finish a job before Christmas. He'll call on me now and again if I'm not gigging and ask me if I want to come out and do a day. We wouldn't be carving gravestones or anything. We'd do the fronts of houses, entrance walls, stuff like that. '''Using a lump hammer and chisel?''' Yeah. It's hard work, especially in the winter. But, I'll tell you, when I left it to do music . . . it was weird at first. In stonemasonry, you'd do a long day's work and sleep soundly at night because you're properly tired. When you're doing gigs, you're more mentally tired than anything else. You have a couple of drinks and try and get to sleep. But it's not the same. So getting back to stonemasonry for a day or two when I can is always nice. [...] '''It's a bit of a culture shock then, isn't it, moving from that into the world of media or public relations?''' God yeah, there's so much nonsense. Take MySpace and Facebook and all of that, for example. I don't get on a computer often, but I have people working on those sites on my behalf. From time to time, they'd send out messages to people. So then these people approach me at gigs to thank me for wishing them a happy birthday and I have no idea what they're talking about. I find that really sick, you know? [...] '''Your third album is mostly written. Do you have particular ambitions for it?''' I'm not hung up about record sales, but I've always wanted to record one of those albums that lodges itself in the public consciousness, that has its own stamp creatively, rather than commercially. Something like Tom Wait's ''Closing Time'', Bruce Springsteen's ''Nebraska'' or Bob Dylan's ''Blood on the Tracks''. That's what I aspire to.}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===''Evening Train''===\nWhile undergoing a music and management course at Col\u00e1iste Stiof\u00e1in Naofa in Cork, Flannery commenced writing the album that would become ''Evening Train'', an eleven-track [[concept album]] about the exploits of two brothers.<ref name=\"Other Voices\"/><ref name=\"Programme 1: Mick Flannery\"/> His original intention had been to write a musical but this endeavour proved unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Other Voices\"/>\n\nBefore its release Flannery and a friend who worked alongside him in the stonemasonry business embarked on a three-month trip to the United States, living in [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn]].<ref name=\"Interview: Mick Flannery\"/><ref name=\"Q&A: Mick Flannery\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/day-and-night/features/qampa-mick-flannery-1949521.html|title=Q&A: Mick Flannery|author=Ed Power|date=20 November 2009|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|accessdate=9 January 2010}}</ref> Flannery spent his time performing in New York.<ref name=\"Interview: Mick Flannery\"/> His sister was present for one of the months and assisted him with organising his performances.<ref name=\"Q&A: Mick Flannery\"/>\n\n''Evening Train'' was received positively by critics in Ireland and the United States.<ref name=\"Other Voices\"/> Reviewers noted its \"astute and sophisticated lyrics\", its \"strong, imaginative melodies\", its [[Tom Waits]] sound.<ref name=\"Top artists to pay a festive visit to the INEC\"/><ref name=\"Programme 1: Mick Flannery\"/><ref name=\"Mick Flannery -

Are you finished with all that now?''' No, I did two weeks helping a buddy finish a job before Christmas. He'll call on me now and again if I'm not gigging and ask me if I want to come out and do a day. We wouldn't be carving gravestones or anything. We'd do the fronts of houses, entrance walls, stuff like that. '''Using a lump hammer and chisel?''' Yeah. It's hard work, especially in the winter. But, I'll tell you, when I left it to do music . . . it was weird at first. In stonemasonry, you'd do a long day's work and sleep soundly at night because you're properly tired. When you're doing gigs, you're more mentally tired than anything else. You have a couple of drinks and try and get to sleep. But it's not the same. So getting back to stonemasonry for a day or two when I can is always nice. [...] '''It's a bit of a culture shock then, isn't it, moving from that into the world of media or public relations?''' God yeah, there's so much nonsense. Take MySpace and Facebook and all of that, for example. I don't get on a computer often, but I have people working on those sites on my behalf. From time to time, they'd send out messages to people. So then these people approach me at gigs to thank me for wishing them a happy birthday and I have no idea what they're talking about. I find that really sick, you know? [...] '''Your third album is mostly written. Do you have particular ambitions for it?''' I'm not hung up about record sales, but I've always wanted to record one of those albums that lodges itself in the public consciousness, that has its own stamp creatively, rather than commercially. Something like Tom Wait's ''Closing Time'', Bruce Springsteen's ''Nebraska'' or Bob Dylan's ''Blood on the Tracks''.
