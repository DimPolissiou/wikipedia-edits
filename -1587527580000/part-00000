Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes).

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

In other words, there is a polynomial-time [[algorithm]] that transforms instances of one to instances of the other with the same answer.  {{Sans-serif|EXPSPACE-complete}} problems might be thought of as the hardest problems in {{Sans-serif|EXPSPACE}}.\n\n{{Sans-serif|EXPSPACE}} is a strict superset of {{Sans-serif|[[PSPACE]]}}, {{Sans-serif|[[NP (complexity)|NP]]}}, and {{Sans-serif|[[P (complexity)|P]]}} and is believed to be a strict superset of {{Sans-serif|[[EXPTIME]]}}.\n\n== Formal definition ==\nIn terms of {{Sans-serif|[[DSPACE]]}} and {{Sans-serif|[[NSPACE]]}},\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{EXPSPACE} = \\bigcup_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}} \\mathsf{DSPACE}(2^{n^k}) = \\bigcup_{k\\in\\mathbb{N}} \\mathsf{NSPACE}(2^{n^k})</math>\n\n== Examples of problems ==\nAn example of an {{Sans-serif|EXPSPACE-complete}} problem is the problem of recognizing whether two [[regular expression]]s represent different languages, where the expressions are limited to four operators: union, [[concatenation]], the [[Kleene star]] (zero or more copies of an expression), and squaring (two copies of an expression).<ref>Meyer, A.R. and [[Larry Stockmeyer|L. Stockmeyer]]. [http://people.csail.mit.edu/meyer/rsq.pdf The equivalence problem for regular expressions with squaring requires exponential space]. ''13th IEEE Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory'', Oct 1972, pp.125&ndash;129.</ref>\n\nIf the Kleene star is left out, then that problem becomes {{Sans-serif|[[NEXPTIME]]-complete}}, which is like {{Sans-serif|EXPTIME-complete}}, except it is defined in terms of [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s rather than deterministic.\n\nIt has also been shown by L. Berman in 1980 that the problem of verifying/falsifying any [[first-order logic|first-order]] statement about [[real number]]s that involves only [[addition]] and comparison (but no [[multiplication]]) is in {{Sans-serif|EXPSPACE}}.\n\nAlur and Henzinger extended Linear temporal logic with times (integer) and prove that the validity problem of their logic is EXPSPACE-complete<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alur|first=Rajeev|last2=Henzinger|first2=Thomas A.|date=1994-01-01|title=A Really Temporal Logic|journal=J.

Rachmaninoff wrote the work at his summer home, the [[Villa Senar]] in Switzerland, according to the score, from July 3 to August 18, 1934.  Rachmaninoff himself, a noted interpreter of his own works, played the solo piano part at the piece's premiere at the [[Lyric Opera House]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], on November 7, 1934 with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[conducting|conducted]] by [[Leopold Stokowski]].  Rachmaninoff, Stokowski, and the Philadelphia Orchestra made the first recording, on December 24, 1934, at [[RCA Victor]]'s Trinity Church Studio in [[Camden, New Jersey]].\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\nThe piece is scored for solo piano and the following romantic period orchestra:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Rhapsody_on_a_Theme_of_Paganini,_Op.43_(Rachmaninoff,_Sergei)|title=International Music Score Library Project \u2013 Rachmaninoff:Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op.43|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> [[piccolo]], 2 [[flutes]], 2 [[oboes]], [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinets]] in B{{music|b}}, 2 [[bassoons]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 2 [[trumpets]] in C, 3 [[trombones]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbals]], [[bass drum]], [[glockenspiel]], [[harp]] and [[String section|strings]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe piece is a set of 24 [[Variation (music)|variations]] on the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|twenty-fourth and last]] of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'s ''[[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|Caprices]]'' for solo [[violin]], which has inspired [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)#Variations on the theme|works by several composers]]. The whole composition takes about 22\u201324 minutes to perform. All variations are in [[A minor]] except where noted. \n* Section 1:\n** Introduction: Allegro vivace \n** Variation 1: (Precedente)\n** Theme: L'istesso tempo\n** Variation 2: L'istesso tempo\n** Variation 3: L'istesso tempo\n** Variation 4: Pi\u00f9 vivo\n** Variation 5: Tempo precedente\n** Variation 6: L'istesso tempo\n** Variation 7: Meno mosso, a tempo moderato\n** Variation 8: Tempo I\n** Variation 9: L'istesso tempo\n** Variation 10: L'istesso tempo\n* Section 2:\n** Variation 11: Moderato\n** Variation 12: Tempo di minuetto ([[D minor]])\n** Variation 13: Allegro (D minor)\n** Variation 14: L'istesso tempo ([[F major]])\n** Variation 15: Pi\u00f9 vivo scherzando (F major)\n** Variation 16: Allegretto ([[B-flat minor|B{{music|b}} minor]])\n** Variation 17: (Allegretto) (B{{music|b}} minor)\n** Variation 18: Andante cantabile ([[D-flat major|D{{music|b}} major]])\n* Section 3:\n** Variation 19: A tempo vivace\n** Variation 20: Un poco pi\u00f9 vivo\n** Variation 21: Un poco pi\u00f9 vivo\n** Variation 22: Marziale.

These correspond to the three movements of a [[concerto]]: up to variation 10 corresponds to the first movement, variations 11 to 18 are the equivalent of a slow movement, and the remaining variations make a finale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Programme_Notes/rach_rhappag.htm|title=Rachmaninov \u2013 Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini notes|author=Serotsky, Paul|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nAfter a brief introduction, the first variation is played ''before'' the theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/rhapsody-on-a-theme-of-paganini-introduction-and-24-variations-in-a-minor-for-piano-orchestra-op-43|title=Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini|author=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate= 18 December 2008}}</ref> Paganini's theme is stated on strings with the piano picking out salient notes, ''after'' the first variation. Rachmaninoff likely got the idea of having a variation before the theme from the finale of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|''Eroica'' symphony]].<ref name=\"steinberg\">[[Michael Steinberg (music critic)|Steinberg, Michael]]. \"The Concerto: a listeners guide\". p. 367-370. Oxford University Press, 1998.</ref> Variations II to VI recombine elements of the theme. The pauses and rhetorical flourishes for the piano in variation VI herald a change of tempo and tone.

The piece is one of several by Rachmaninoff to quote the Dies Irae plainchant melody.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victoryvinny.com/svr_and_di/RachmaninovandDiesIrae-Version03.pdf|title=Rachmaninoff and Dies Irae|author=Pallaver, Vincent|date=February 2004|accessdate=18 December 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705074311/http://www.victoryvinny.com/svr_and_di/RachmaninovandDiesIrae-Version03.pdf|archivedate=5 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:RahmaninovPaganiniInverzija-eng.PNG|thumb|300px|Inversion of the melody]]\nThe slow eighteenth variation is by far the best known, and it is often included on classical music compilations without the rest of the work. It is based on an [[Melodic inversion|inversion of the melody]] of Paganini's theme. In other words, the A minor Paganini theme is literally played \"upside down\" in D{{music|b}} major, with a few other changes. Rachmaninoff himself recognized the appeal of this variation, saying \"This one, is for my agent.\"<ref name=\"steinberg\"/>\n\nThe 24th variation is more playful in tone than most of the other variations, ending with a [[glissando]] sweep of the keyboard, before quoting the original theme in the last bar. <ref>https://imslp.org/wiki/Rhapsody_on_a_Theme_of_Paganini,_Op.43_(Rachmaninoff,_Sergei)</ref> Due to the speed and the large leaps on the piano, the 24th and last variation of the rhapsody presents considerable technical difficulty for the pianist. Shortly before the  world premi\u00e8re performance, Rachmaninoff - a sufferer of performance anxiety <ref>https://www.roh.org.uk/news/rachmaninoffs-dark-side-can-great-artistry-exist-without-the-agony-of-perfectionism</ref> - confessed trepidation over his ability to play it. Upon the suggestion of his friend [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]], Rachmaninoff broke his usual rule against drinking alcohol and had a glass of [[cr\u00e8me de menthe]] to steady his nerves, which he reputedly kept beneath the piano <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33q87s03h4</ref>. His performance was a spectacular success, and prior to every subsequent performance of the Rhapsody, he drank cr\u00e8me de menthe. This led to Rachmaninoff nicknaming the twenty-fourth the \"Cr\u00e8me de Menthe Variation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rimm|first=Robert|title=The Composer-Pianists: Hamelin and the Eight|year=2002|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, Oregon|isbn=1574670727|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yglj7pFb9UoC&lpg=PA142&pg=PA142#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Balletic interpretations==\nIn 1939, [[Michel Fokine]] wrote to Rachmaninoff from [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], where he was touring, seeking the composer's approval to use ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'' for his [[ballet]] ''Paganini'', which he had almost finished [[Choreography|choreographing]].  Fokine wanted to make a minor change to the score, involving the reuse of 12 earlier measures as a more theatrically effective introduction to the 18th Variation, which he wanted to play in the key of A major, rather than D{{music|b}} major.  Rachmaninoff agreed to the extra measures, although he said A major would not work and asked that the 18th Variation be played in D major, to provide greater tension.  He also wondered why [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] had been turned into a [[guitar]] player in Fokine's scenario, but did not object.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KM-dgfOaIIkC&pg=PA346&lpg=PA346&dq=rachmaninoff+music+ballet&source=bl&ots=ATD5bAiSOl&sig=a9ly90Y3WYyiGAwekMFKnPoGJ1I&hl=en&ei=SJv0SfSOC5GCkQXx1aD3Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA348,M1|title=Sergei Rachmaninoff|work=google.com.au|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>  ''Paganini'' was premiered in 1939 by [[The Royal Ballet]] at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].  The ballet was a success, which pleased Rachmaninoff, and he wrote his ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'' in 1940 with Fokine in mind.  He played the piano version for Fokine, but both died before the idea got any further.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/30/arts/dance-is-there-a-ballet-in-rachmaninoff-s-symphonic-dances.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/D/Dancing|title=DANCE -  Is There a Ballet In Rachmaninoff's Symphonic Dances? - NYTimes.com|date=30 January 1994|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rhapsody has also been used for ballets by Lavrovsky ([[Bolshoi Ballet]], Moscow, 1960), [[Frederick Ashton]] (Royal Ballet, London, 1980)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/sergei-vasilievich-rachmaninov-2|title=Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninov|work=Answers.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> and Ivo van Zwieten.<ref>[http://www.slovenia.info/?kulturne_prireditve=37105 I Feel Slovenia]</ref>\n\n==Selected recordings==\n<!--NOTE TO FUTURE EDITORS:\nThe recordings have been arranged in chronological order.

It is written for solo [[piano]] and [[symphony orchestra]], closely resembling a [[piano concerto]], albeit in a single movement. The work was written at his summer home, the [[Villa Senar]] in Switzerland, according to the score, from July 3 to August 18, 1934.  Rachmaninoff himself, a noted interpreter of his own works, played the solo piano part at the piece's premiere at the [[Lyric Opera House]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], on November 7, 1934 with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[conducting|conducted]] by [[Leopold Stokowski]].  Rachmaninoff, Stokowski, and the Philadelphia Orchestra made the first recording, on December 24, 1934, at [[RCA Victor]]'s Trinity Church Studio in [[Camden, New Jersey]].\n\n==Instrumentation==\n\nThe piece is scored for solo piano and the following romantic period orchestra:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imslp.org/wiki/Rhapsody_on_a_Theme_of_Paganini,_Op.43_(Rachmaninoff,_Sergei)|title=International Music Score Library Project \u2013 Rachmaninoff:Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op.43|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref> [[piccolo]], 2 [[flutes]], 2 [[oboes]], [[English horn]], 2 [[clarinets]] in B{{music|b}}, 2 [[bassoons]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 2 [[trumpets]] in C, 3 [[trombones]], [[tuba]], [[timpani]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbals]], [[bass drum]], [[glockenspiel]], [[harp]] and [[String section|strings]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe piece is a set of 24 [[Variation (music)|variations]] on the [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)|twenty-fourth and last]] of [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]]'s ''[[24 Caprices for Solo Violin (Paganini)|Caprices]]'' for solo [[violin]], which has inspired [[Caprice No. 24 (Paganini)#Variations on the theme|works by several composers]]. The whole composition takes about 22\u201324 minutes to perform.

These correspond to the three movements of a [[concerto]]: up to variation 10 corresponds to the first movement, variations 11 to 18 are the equivalent of a slow movement, and the remaining variations make a finale.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Programme_Notes/rach_rhappag.htm|title=Rachmaninov \u2013 Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini notes|author=Serotsky, Paul|accessdate=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nAfter a brief introduction, the first variation is played ''before'' the theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/rhapsody-on-a-theme-of-paganini-introduction-and-24-variations-in-a-minor-for-piano-orchestra-op-43|title=Rhapsody on a theme of Paganini|author=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate= 18 December 2008}}</ref> Paganini's theme is stated on strings with the piano picking out salient notes, ''after'' the first variation.

It is based on an [[Melodic inversion|inversion of the melody]] of Paganini's theme. In other words, the A minor Paganini theme is literally played \"upside down\" in D{{music|b}} major, with a few other changes. Rachmaninoff himself recognized the appeal of this variation, saying \"This one, is for my agent.\"<ref name=\"steinberg\"/>\n\nThe 24th variation is more playful in tone than most of the other variations, ending with a [[glissando]] sweep of the keyboard, before quoting the original theme in the last bar. <ref>https://imslp.org/wiki/Rhapsody_on_a_Theme_of_Paganini,_Op.43_(Rachmaninoff,_Sergei)</ref> Due to the speed and the large leaps on the piano, the 24th and last variation of the rhapsody presents considerable technical difficulty for the pianist. Shortly before the  world premi\u00e8re performance, Rachmaninoff - a sufferer of performance anxiety <ref>https://www.roh.org.uk/news/rachmaninoffs-dark-side-can-great-artistry-exist-without-the-agony-of-perfectionism</ref> - confessed trepidation over his ability to play it. Upon the suggestion of his friend [[Benno Moiseiwitsch]], Rachmaninoff broke his usual rule against drinking alcohol and had a glass of [[cr\u00e8me de menthe]] to steady his nerves, which he reputedly kept beneath the piano <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33q87s03h4</ref>. His performance was a spectacular success, and prior to every subsequent performance of the Rhapsody, he drank cr\u00e8me de menthe. This led to Rachmaninoff nicknaming the twenty-fourth the \"Cr\u00e8me de Menthe Variation\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Rimm|first=Robert|title=The Composer-Pianists: Hamelin and the Eight|year=2002|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, Oregon|isbn=1574670727|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yglj7pFb9UoC&lpg=PA142&pg=PA142#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Balletic interpretations==\nIn 1939, [[Michel Fokine]] wrote to Rachmaninoff from [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], where he was touring, seeking the composer's approval to use ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'' for his [[ballet]] ''Paganini'', which he had almost finished [[Choreography|choreographing]].  Fokine wanted to make a minor change to the score, involving the reuse of 12 earlier measures as a more theatrically effective introduction to the 18th Variation, which he wanted to play in the key of A major, rather than D{{music|b}} major.  Rachmaninoff agreed to the extra measures, although he said A major would not work and asked that the 18th Variation be played in D major, to provide greater tension.  He also wondered why [[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] had been turned into a [[guitar]] player in Fokine's scenario, but did not object.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KM-dgfOaIIkC&pg=PA346&lpg=PA346&dq=rachmaninoff+music+ballet&source=bl&ots=ATD5bAiSOl&sig=a9ly90Y3WYyiGAwekMFKnPoGJ1I&hl=en&ei=SJv0SfSOC5GCkQXx1aD3Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#PPA348,M1|title=Sergei Rachmaninoff|work=google.com.au|accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>  ''Paganini'' was premiered in 1939 by [[The Royal Ballet]] at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]], [[London]].  The ballet was a success, which pleased Rachmaninoff, and he wrote his ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'' in 1940 with Fokine in mind.

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] as a [[first baseman]], most notably for the [[Chicago Cubs]]; he was also a sometime radio [[sports commentator]], and a popular goodwill ambassador for baseball. He played for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] early in his career, but was traded to the Cubs in 1925 and worked mostly for the Cubs for the rest of his career. Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to parents of German extraction, Grimm was known for being outgoing and chatty, even singing old-fashioned songs while accompanying himself on a left-handed [[banjo]].<ref>[https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/c008379d Society of Baseball Research / SABR] \"Grimm\u2019s German-born father wanted him to join the family painting business, but young Charlie had other ideas.\"</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zPi2BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA172&dq=german+baseball+players&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi7qpvNmb3kAhXptlkKHeOqAqkQ6AEwAXoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=german%20baseball%20players&f=false Major League Baseball Players of 1916: A Biographical Dictionary]</ref>\n\n==Manager==\n===Managerial career===\nWhile still playing as first baseman, Grimm was enlisted to replace [[Rogers Hornsby]] as manager after his dismissal on August 2, 1932.<ref>https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/b5854fe4</ref> The team was 53-46 at the time, five games back in the standings in second place. In the 55 games that Grimm managed for the Cubs, he rallied them to a 37-18 record for an overall record of 90-64, winning the [[National League]] pennant for the first time since 1929. The Cubs were subsequently swept by the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[1932 World Series|World Series]]. The team regressed in the following two seasons, winning 86 games each and finishing in third place. However, Grimm's team made a dramatic improvement in 1935, going 100-54. It was the first time the Cubs had won 100 games since 1910 and it was the last until 2016 (along with Grimm's only 100-win season as manager). They were bolstered by a 21-game winning streak in September that carried them to a second league pennant in four seasons. In the [[1935 World Series|World Series]] that year against the [[Detroit Tigers]], they won the first game in Detroit before losing the next three. They rallied to win Game 5 at Wrigley Field, but the Tigers won a walk-off hit from [[Goose Goslin]] to win 4-3 and seal the Series. The Cubs went 87-67 for a third place finish the following year (which was Grimm's last as a player-manager), but they improved to 93-61 and second place the year after. 1938 was his last season of his first tenure as manager of the Cubs. The team was 45-36 when he was replaced by catcher [[Gabby Hartnett]]. As Grimm had done six years earlier, the newly installed player-manager led the Cubs to a dramatic comeback to win the league pennant that season.\n\nAfter a sluggish start by the Cubs in 1944 in which the team lost ten in a row after winning the Opening Day game, Grimm was hired to manage the club again. The team finished fourth in the standings with a 75-79 record (the fifth straight losing season for the team). However, Grimm led them to a dramatic improvement the following year, going 98-56 to win the league pennant for the first time since 1938. In the [[1945 World Series|World Series]] that year, Grimm's team faced off against the Tigers once again. It was a hard-fought series, going down to the decisive seventh game at [[Wrigley Field]]. The Cubs were trounced 9-3, with six of the Tiger runs coming in the first two innings. It was the last pennant for the Cubs for 71 years. The Cubs went 82-71 the following year, finishing 3rd in the standings. It was the last time the team had a record of .500 until 1963. Grimm finished his last three seasons with losing record (69-85, 64-90, 19-31) before resigning in 1949.\n\nAfter his resignation from being manager, he served as the Cubs' Director of Player Personnel, then the club's title for [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]], doing so until February 1950 due to not feeling comfortable in his front-office post. He subsequently was hired to manage a [[minor league baseball|Double A]] team, the [[Dallas Rangers|Dallas Eagles]] of the [[Texas League]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Grimm to Pilot Dallas; Quits Cub Front Office |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23759021/charlie_grimm/ |work=Daily News |agency=Associated Press |date=January 7, 1950 |location=New York, New York City |page=42|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 15, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n[[File:CharlieGrimmGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|160px|left|A 1933 Goudey baseball card of Charlie Grimm as a member of the Chicago Cubs.]]\n\nGrimm was also a major baseball figure in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. He was hired by [[Bill Veeck]] to manage his [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]], then the Cubs' top farm team, during World War II. He returned to the Brewers in 1951 when they were a farm team of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. He was highly successful as a manager during each term, winning the regular season [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] title in 1943 and 1951, and the playoff championship in 1951. On May 30, 1952, Grimm was promoted from Milwaukee to manager of the big league Braves; he would prove to be the last skipper in the history of the Boston NL club. He went 51-67 (with two ties) as the Braves finished seventh place.\n\nHe then managed the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]] for their first three years after their move to [[Wisconsin]] in March 1953. Being of German extraction, he was popular in the Beer City. The following year, the Braves went 92-62 (with three ties), finishing 13 games behind in second place to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. It was the first time the Braves had won over 90 games since 1948. The next year, they regressed a bit as a team with an 89-65 record for a third place finish (eight games back), but it was the first time that they had consecutive winning seasons since 1947-48. The next year, they went 85-69, finishing 13.5 games back of the Dodgers. The 1956 season proved to be a nail-biter for the team, but Grimm was not to be a big part of said season. He was dismissed after a 24\u201322 start to the season, replaced by [[Fred Haney]]. Haney led them to a 68\u201340 record while losing the league pennant to the Dodgers by one game. Haney led the team to a [[1957 World Series|World Series]] championship the following year.\n\nHe was brought out of retirement to direct the Cubs again in early 1960, but the team got off to a slow start, and owner [[P.K. Wrigley]] made the novel move of swapping Grimm with another former manager, [[Lou Boudreau]], who was doing Cubs radiocasts at that time. Grimm had done play-by-play in the past, so he gave it one more go in 1960, before stepping back to the ranks of coaching and then front office duties.\n\nIt was in 1961 that Wrigley began his \"[[College of Coaches]]\", of which Grimm was a part but was never designated \"Head Coach\". One of the Cubs' coaches during that 5-year experiment was baseball's first black coach, [[Buck O'Neil]].\n\nGrimm finished with a record of 1,287 wins and 1,067 losses in the regular season and five wins and 12 losses in the post-season. His 946 wins as Cubs manager rank second behind [[Cap Anson]].<ref name=\"managerial record\">{{cite web|title=Charlie Grimm|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/grimmch01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial record===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team!!rowspan=\"2\"|From!!rowspan=\"2\"|To!!colspan=\"4\"|Regular season record!!colspan=\"4\"|Post\u2013season record\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}!!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n|[[Chicago Cubs]]||[[1932 Chicago Cubs season|1932]]||[[1938 Chicago Cubs season|1938]]\n|903|||{{WinLossPct|534|369}}\n|10||{{WinLossPct|2|8}}\n|-\n|Chicago Cubs||[[1944 Chicago Cubs season|1944]]||[[1949 Chicago Cubs season|1949]]\n|808||{{WinLossPct|406|402}}\n|7||{{WinLossPct|3|4}}\n|-\n|[[Atlanta Braves|Boston/Milwaukee Braves]]||[[1952 Boston Braves season|1952]]||[[1956 Milwaukee Braves season|1956]]\n|626||{{WinLossPct|341|285}}\n|colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\"|\u2014\n|-\n|Chicago Cubs||[[1960 Chicago Cubs season|1960]]||1960\n|17||{{WinLossPct|6|11}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Total\n!2354!!{{WinLossPct|1287|1067}}\n!17!!{{WinLossPct|5|12}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"11\"|{{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}:<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|}\n\n===Career Major League Statistics===\nIn 2166 games over 20 seasons, spanning from 1916-1936, Grimm posted a .290 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (2299-for-7917) with 908 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 394 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 108 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 79 [[home runs]], 1077 [[RBI]], 57 [[stolen bases]], 578 [[bases on balls]], .341 [[on-base percentage]] and .397 [[slugging percentage]].

In the [[1945 World Series|World Series]] that year, Grimm's team faced off against the Tigers once again. It was a hard-fought series, going down to the decisive seventh game at [[Wrigley Field]]. The Cubs were trounced 9-3, with six of the Tiger runs coming in the first two innings. It was the last pennant for the Cubs for 71 years. The Cubs went 82-71 the following year, finishing 3rd in the standings. It was the last time the team had a record of .500 until 1963. Grimm finished his last three seasons with losing record (69-85, 64-90, 19-31) before resigning in 1949.\n\nAfter his resignation from being manager, he served as the Cubs' Director of Player Personnel, then the club's title for [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]], doing so until February 1950 due to not feeling comfortable in his front-office post. He subsequently was hired to manage a [[minor league baseball|Double A]] team, the [[Dallas Rangers|Dallas Eagles]] of the [[Texas League]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Grimm to Pilot Dallas; Quits Cub Front Office |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/23759021/charlie_grimm/ |work=Daily News |agency=Associated Press |date=January 7, 1950 |location=New York, New York City |page=42|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = September 15, 2018}} {{Open access}}</ref>\n[[File:CharlieGrimmGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|160px|left|A 1933 Goudey baseball card of Charlie Grimm as a member of the Chicago Cubs.]]\n\nGrimm was also a major baseball figure in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]. He was hired by [[Bill Veeck]] to manage his [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]], then the Cubs' top farm team, during World War II. He returned to the Brewers in 1951 when they were a farm team of the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. He was highly successful as a manager during each term, winning the regular season [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] title in 1943 and 1951, and the playoff championship in 1951. On May 30, 1952, Grimm was promoted from Milwaukee to manager of the big league Braves; he would prove to be the last skipper in the history of the Boston NL club. He went 51-67 (with two ties) as the Braves finished seventh place.\n\nHe then managed the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]] for their first three years after their move to [[Wisconsin]] in March 1953. Being of German extraction, he was popular in the Beer City. The following year, the Braves went 92-62 (with three ties), finishing 13 games behind in second place to the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]]. It was the first time the Braves had won over 90 games since 1948. The next year, they regressed a bit as a team with an 89-65 record for a third place finish (eight games back), but it was the first time that they had consecutive winning seasons since 1947-48. The next year, they went 85-69, finishing 13.5 games back of the Dodgers. The 1956 season proved to be a nail-biter for the team, but Grimm was not to be a big part of said season. He was dismissed after a 24\u201322 start to the season, replaced by [[Fred Haney]]. Haney led them to a 68\u201340 record while losing the league pennant to the Dodgers by one game. Haney led the team to a [[1957 World Series|World Series]] championship the following year.\n\nHe was brought out of retirement to direct the Cubs again in early 1960, but the team got off to a slow start, and owner [[P.K. Wrigley]] made the novel move of swapping Grimm with another former manager, [[Lou Boudreau]], who was doing Cubs radiocasts at that time. Grimm had done play-by-play in the past, so he gave it one more go in 1960, before stepping back to the ranks of coaching and then front office duties.\n\nIt was in 1961 that Wrigley began his \"[[College of Coaches]]\", of which Grimm was a part but was never designated \"Head Coach\". One of the Cubs' coaches during that 5-year experiment was baseball's first black coach, [[Buck O'Neil]].\n\nGrimm finished with a record of 1,287 wins and 1,067 losses in the regular season and five wins and 12 losses in the post-season. His 946 wins as Cubs manager rank second behind [[Cap Anson]].<ref name=\"managerial record\">{{cite web|title=Charlie Grimm|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/grimmch01.shtml|website=Baseball Reference|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 13, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial record===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team!!rowspan=\"2\"|From!!rowspan=\"2\"|To!!colspan=\"4\"|Regular season record!!colspan=\"4\"|Post\u2013season record\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}!!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n|[[Chicago Cubs]]||[[1932 Chicago Cubs season|1932]]||[[1938 Chicago Cubs season|1938]]\n|903|||{{WinLossPct|534|369}}\n|10||{{WinLossPct|2|8}}\n|-\n|Chicago Cubs||[[1944 Chicago Cubs season|1944]]||[[1949 Chicago Cubs season|1949]]\n|808||{{WinLossPct|406|402}}\n|7||{{WinLossPct|3|4}}\n|-\n|[[Atlanta Braves|Boston/Milwaukee Braves]]||[[1952 Boston Braves season|1952]]||[[1956 Milwaukee Braves season|1956]]\n|626||{{WinLossPct|341|285}}\n|colspan=\"4\" rowspan=\"2\"|\u2014\n|-\n|Chicago Cubs||[[1960 Chicago Cubs season|1960]]||1960\n|17||{{WinLossPct|6|11}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Total\n!2354!!{{WinLossPct|1287|1067}}\n!17!!{{WinLossPct|5|12}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"11\"|{{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}:<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|}\n\n===Career Major League Statistics===\nIn 2166 games over 20 seasons, spanning from 1916-1936, Grimm posted a .290 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (2299-for-2917) with 908 [[run (baseball)|runs]], 394 [[double (baseball)|doubles]], 108 [[triple (baseball)|triples]], 79 [[home runs]], 1077 [[RBI]], 57 [[stolen bases]], 578 [[bases on balls]], .341 [[on-base percentage]] and .397 [[slugging percentage]].

Set in an [[alternate timeline]] of [[World War II]], players engage in side-scrolling shooter gameplay, using female [[moe anthropomorphism|moe anthropomorphic]] characters based on [[warships]] from the war's major participants. Other gameplay elements, like customizing a home and marrying in-game characters, are also present.\n\nFirst launched in China in May and in Japan in September 2017, ''Azur Lane'' has briefly become very popular, especially in Japan where the player count reached five million within four months after its release. Successive [[Comiket]] numbers have yet to confirm long-term popularity of the game in Japan, with Azur Lane ranking around 10th below franchises and genres like ''[[Fate Grand Order]]'', ''[[Kantai Collection]]'' or Virtual YouTubers. Players have voted the game among the top five on [[Google Play]]'s Best Game of 2017 list for the region. Critics have attributed the game's popularity to its original and well-designed gameplay system. An English-language version started open beta in August 2018 and was formally released in May 2019. Later, on December 18, English version was expanded to Latin American region. PWB Play simultaneously released it to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] on October 4, 2019.\n\nThe game has been adapted into several manga and novelizations. ''Azur Lane Crosswave'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] adaptation for [[PlayStation 4]], was published by [[Compile Heart]] on August 29, 2019 with mixed reception. ''Crosswave''<nowiki/>'s English localization was released on February 13, 2020 for PlayStation 4 and PC. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Bibury Animation Studio]] premiered on October 3, 2019 and aired in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] until March 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/09/15-1/ship-girl-smart-phone-game-azur-lane-sets-sail-as-a-tv-anime|title=Ship Girl Smart Phone Game Azur Lane Sets Sail as a TV Anime|access-date=April 1, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Azur Lane main screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Main interface, with the character ''[[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|Long Island]]''.

[[Destroyer]]s, [[light cruiser]]s, and [[heavy cruiser]]s can be allotted to the front row, while the back row is reserved for [[battleship]]s, [[aircraft cruiser]], [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s, [[repair ship]]s, [[battlecruiser]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. Different combinations of ships are required to achieve victory in different battle situations. Players may then select and enter a [[level (video gaming)|map]].<ref name=rpgsarticle/>\n\nOn entering a map, the player's fleet is placed on a grid-like map similar to that in the game [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]. The map contains nodes, which are either combat nodes which are enemy fleets, some immobile and others that pursue the player, or non-combat nodes which provides ammunition or mystery nodes which can provide supplies such as repair kits, upgrade materials or can spawn a special combat node called a Treasure Fleet. Players must navigate optimally and assemble their fleets tactically, to clear obstructing enemies and, using minimal movements, reach the map's [[boss (video gaming)|boss]]. When the player moves their fleet across the map, they can be ambushed in [[random encounter]]s from which they may take damage, or they can be forced to engage the enemy, using fuel and ammo. Fuel is one of the two in-game resources. Ammo points are assigned to player fleets at each map, with one ammo point deducted at each battle. Fleets that run out of ammo can still fight but may only deal half damage.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\n[[File:Azur Lane battle screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle interface of ''Azur Lane''.]]\nWhen battling an enemy, players can use a virtual [[joystick]] to control the front row, which can automatically fire shells at targets and manually launch torpedoes. While stationary, the back row can send [[Barrage (artillery)|shell barrages]] and the player can manually call in airstrikes. These will activate a bullet-clearing effect, removing all projectiles and torpedoes on screen. Players have an auto mode option to give up this control to the game's AI. Characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] is fully replenished when completing or exiting a map. Morale points are deducted for each fleet character in a battle. Should a character fall in battle, they cannot join in further action on the map and a larger number of morale points are deducted for the fallen character at the end of the battle. Sustained low morale for a character decreases their stats and affection points. Low affection points lead the character to greet the player with vocals reflecting their disappointment.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\nThe game features a [[player versus player]] mode. The player may prepare a defence fleet and organize an offence fleet to challenge opposing players' defence fleets. In this mode, battles are controlled entirely by AI, and the bullet-clearing effect of airstrikes is disabled. Tokens can be gained and the player's ranking can rise through victory in this mode. Players receive no penalty if they lose a challenge or their defence fleet is defeated by other players. Exclusive characters and other items can be obtained using tokens.

The game features an eponymous military alliance, \"Azur Lane\", formed by nations of Eagle Union ([[United States]]), Royal Navy ([[United Kingdom]]), Sakura Empire ([[Empire of Japan]]) and Iron Blood ([[Nazi Germany]]).<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" /> The alliance split in two because of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien intervention]] with Iron Blood and Sakura Empire form an opposing faction, \"Crimson [[Axis powers|Axis]]\", using technology provided by the aliens to invade \"Azur Lane\" countries. The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the United States naval engagements in the [[Pacific War]]. Chapters represent several decisive battles of the war including the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]].\n\n== Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character!!Japanese<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azurlane-anime.jp/character/|title=CHARACTER|website=Azur Lane Official Website|accessdate=October 25, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>!!English<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19202/master-thread-azur-lane-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] AZUR LANE (Dubbed)|last=Funimation|first=|date=|website=www.funimation.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]||[[Yui Ishikawa]]||Rachael Messer\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]||[[Mai Nakahara]]||[[Amber Lee Connors]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Unicorn (I72)|Unicorn]]||[[Ai Kakuma]]||[[Alexis Tipton]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Javelin (F61)|Javelin]]||Nozomi Yamane||Madeleine Morris\n|-\n|[[USS Laffey (DD-459)|Laffey]]||[[Maria Naganawa]]||[[Tia Ballard]]\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]||[[Ai Kayano]]||Dawn M.

Enterprise remains on watch, despite her repairs only being partially complete. Akagi and Kaga are also recovering from the battle when they are met by [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|Prinz Eugen]]. Akagi sends [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|Zuikaku]] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|Shoukaku]] to ambush an Azur Lane fleet and asks Prinz Eugen to assist them. Prinz Eugen agrees, bringing [[German destroyer Z23|Z23]] and Ayanami with her.

Enterprise mobilizes to help them despite her damage, with Cleveland, Javelin, and Laffey following her. While Enterprise battles Zuikaku and Shoukaku and Cleveland assists damaged shipgirls, Javelin and Laffey remain reluctant to fight Z23 and Ayanami. As the Azur Lane and Red Axis forces battle each other, the main Royal Navy fleet led by [[HMS Queen Elizabeth (1913)|Queen Elizabeth]] arrives. Enterprise manages to gain the upper hand on Zuikaku but her unrepaired damage causes her equipment to fail at a critical moment.

Meanwhile, [[USS Vestal|Vestal]] arrives on the base and is immediately upset at the poor state Enterprise's rig is in. Enterprise is met by Belfast and Unicorn, who convince her to attend a beach party the other shipgirls are holding. Unicorn thanks Enterprise for saving her, and Enterprise reveals she feels shipgirls are only meant to be weapons, and the ocean is only a source of conflict. As Unicorn leaves to play with Javelin and Laffey, Belfast confronts Enterprise directly, warning her that if she continues to fight like she did in the previous battle, she'll eventually forget her reason for fighting in the first place. The base then receives a distress call, with Enterprise, Cleveland, Hammann, and Belfast leaving to investigate. They find [[Chinese cruiser Ning Hai|Ning Hai]] and [[Chinese cruiser Ping Hai|Ping Hai]] of the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Dragon Empery]]. They explain they were ambushed by Siren ships when a damaged Siren ship attacks. Enterprise uses herself as a distraction to draw the Siren's attention, but ends up being saved by Belfast when her rig malfunctions again.

Javelin and Laffey take a bath with Unicorn, who reveals she's self conscious about her large breasts despite her small size.

Set in an [[alternate timeline]] of [[World War II]], players engage in side-scrolling shooter gameplay, using female [[moe anthropomorphism|moe anthropomorphic]] characters based on [[warships]] from the war's major participants. Other gameplay elements, like customizing a home and marrying in-game characters, are also present.\n\nFirst launched in China in May and in Japan in September 2017, ''Azur Lane'' has briefly become very popular, especially in Japan where the player count reached five million within four months after its release. Successive [[Comiket]] numbers have yet to confirm long-term popularity of the game in Japan, with Azur Lane ranking around 10th below franchises and genres like ''[[Fate Grand Order]]'', ''[[Kantai Collection]]'' or Virtual YouTubers. Players have voted the game among the top five on [[Google Play]]'s Best Game of 2017 list for the region. Critics have attributed the game's popularity to its original and well-designed gameplay system. An English-language version started open beta in August 2018 and was formally released in May 2019. Later, on December 18, English version was expanded to Latin American region. PWB Play simultaneously released it to [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], and [[Taiwan]] on October 4, 2019.\n\nThe game has been adapted into several manga and novelizations. ''Azur Lane Crosswave'', a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] adaptation for [[PlayStation 4]], was published by [[Compile Heart]] on August 29, 2019 with mixed reception. ''Crosswave''<nowiki/>'s English localization was released on February 13, 2020 for PlayStation 4 and PC. An [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Bibury Animation Studio]] premiered on October 3, 2019 and aired in [[Japan]] and the [[United States]] until March 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2018/09/15-1/ship-girl-smart-phone-game-azur-lane-sets-sail-as-a-tv-anime|title=Ship Girl Smart Phone Game Azur Lane Sets Sail as a TV Anime|access-date=April 1, 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Azur Lane main screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Main interface, with the character ''[[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|Long Island]]''.

[[Destroyer]]s, [[light cruiser]]s, and [[heavy cruiser]]s can be allotted to the front row, while the back row is reserved for [[battleship]]s, [[aircraft cruiser]], [[monitor (warship)|monitor]]s, [[repair ship]]s, [[battlecruiser]]s and [[aircraft carrier]]s. Different combinations of ships are required to achieve victory in different battle situations. Players may then select and enter a [[level (video gaming)|map]].<ref name=rpgsarticle/>\n\nOn entering a map, the player's fleet is placed on a grid-like map similar to that in the game [[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]. The map contains nodes, which are either combat nodes which are enemy fleets, some immobile and others that pursue the player, or non-combat nodes which provides ammunition or mystery nodes which can provide supplies such as repair kits, upgrade materials or can spawn a special combat node called a Treasure Fleet. Players must navigate optimally and assemble their fleets tactically, to clear obstructing enemies and, using minimal movements, reach the map's [[boss (video gaming)|boss]]. When the player moves their fleet across the map, they can be ambushed in [[random encounter]]s from which they may take damage, or they can be forced to engage the enemy, using fuel and ammo. Fuel is one of the two in-game resources. Ammo points are assigned to player fleets at each map, with one ammo point deducted at each battle. Fleets that run out of ammo can still fight but may only deal half damage.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\n[[File:Azur Lane battle screen.png|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Battle interface of ''Azur Lane''.]]\nWhen battling an enemy, players can use a virtual [[joystick]] to control the front row, which can automatically fire shells at targets and manually launch torpedoes. While stationary, the back row can send [[Barrage (artillery)|shell barrages]] and the player can manually call in airstrikes. These will activate a bullet-clearing effect, removing all projectiles and torpedoes on screen. Players have an auto mode option to give up this control to the game's AI. Characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] is fully replenished when completing or exiting a map. Morale points are deducted for each fleet character in a battle. Should a character fall in battle, they cannot join in further action on the map and a larger number of morale points are deducted for the fallen character at the end of the battle. Sustained low morale for a character decreases their stats and affection points. Low affection points lead the character to greet the player with vocals reflecting their disappointment.<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" />\n\nThe game features a [[player versus player]] mode. The player may prepare a defence fleet and organize an offence fleet to challenge opposing players' defence fleets. In this mode, battles are controlled entirely by AI, and the bullet-clearing effect of airstrikes is disabled. Tokens can be gained and the player's ranking can rise through victory in this mode. Players receive no penalty if they lose a challenge or their defence fleet is defeated by other players. Exclusive characters and other items can be obtained using tokens. The ranking is refreshed every 15 days.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Exercise|title=Exercise|work=Azur Lane Wiki|access-date=October 28, 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nAdditional mechanics were introduced after the game's release. [[Submarine warfare|Submarine]] and [[anti-submarine warfare]] systems were introduced in May 2018. This included anti-submarine campaign maps, and characters based on German [[U-Boat]]s, and American and Japanese submarines.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.inside-games.jp/article/2018/05/28/114983.html|title=\u300e\u30a2\u30ba\u30fc\u30eb\u30ec\u30fc\u30f3\u300f5\u670831\u65e5\u3088\u308a\u958b\u50ac\u306e\u91cd\u685c\u30a4\u30d9\u30f3\u30c8\u60c5\u5831\u3084\u3001\u65b0\u305f\u306a\u8266\u7a2e\u300c\u6f5c\u6c34\u8266\u300d\u304c\u516c\u958b\uff01\u30a2\u30ba\u30ec\u30f3TV\u307e\u3068\u3081 {{!}} \u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|work=\u30a4\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|access-date=June 22, 2018|language=ja}}</ref> A [[ship's cat]] system was introduced in September 2018.

Furniture and decorations raise the rate experience is gained. They can be arranged freely. Players may increase Dormitory character capacity, unlock a second floor which recovers morale, and buy special interactive furniture using the in-game currency.  As well, monuments can be awarded by clearing event stages. Players may inspect other players' Dormitories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://criticalindex.net/first-impressions-an-initial-look-at-azur-lane-31b7d2a443e|title=First Impressions: An Initial Look at Azur Lane|last=Ana|first=Ren|date=December 27, 2017|website=Critical Index|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\nWhen a character's affection points are raised to 100 through battle, secretary, or Dormitory, players may choose to give a \"promise ring\" to this character. A \"promise ring\" can be obtained through quests once. Additional rings can be purchased using in-game currency in the items shop, essentially allowing [[polygamy]].<ref name=Siliconera_20171009/> Players may also give customized names to married characters but may only do so every 30 days for each character.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mmorpg.news/2018/09/azur-lane-oath-marriage-and-first-event.html|title=Azur Lane - Oath (Marriage) and First Event on Global|website=www.mmorpg.news|access-date=October 17, 2018}}</ref> Furthermore, a few of the most popular characters will also gain unique wedding dress costumes for the wedding. They will also gain additional stat bonuses after being married.<ref name=\"Siliconera_20171009\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe start of the game features an anthropomorphic recreation of the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], where the personification of famed British battlecruiser [[HMS Hood|HMS ''Hood'']] is sunk by characters representing the German forces. The game features an eponymous military alliance, \"Azur Lane\", formed by nations of Eagle Union ([[United States]]), Royal Navy ([[United Kingdom]]), Sakura Empire ([[Empire of Japan]]) and Iron Blood ([[Nazi Germany]]).<ref name=\"rpgsarticle\" /> The alliance split in two because of [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien intervention]] with Iron Blood and Sakura Empire form an opposing faction, \"Crimson [[Axis powers|Axis]]\", using technology provided by the aliens to invade \"Azur Lane\" countries. The rest of the game's main plot partially follows the United States naval engagements in the [[Pacific War]]. Chapters represent several decisive battles of the war including the [[Battle of Midway]], the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], and the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]].\n\n== Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Character!!Japanese<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://azurlane-anime.jp/character/|title=CHARACTER|website=Azur Lane Official Website|accessdate=October 25, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>!!English<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.funimation.com/forum/topic/19202/master-thread-azur-lane-dubbed|title=[Master Thread] AZUR LANE (Dubbed)|last=Funimation|first=|date=|website=www.funimation.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|Enterprise]]||[[Yui Ishikawa]]||Rachael Messer\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]||[[Mai Nakahara]]||[[Amber Lee Connors]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Unicorn (I72)|Unicorn]]||[[Ai Kakuma]]||[[Alexis Tipton]]\n|-\n|[[HMS Javelin (F61)|Javelin]]||Nozomi Yamane||Madeleine Morris\n|-\n|[[USS Laffey (DD-459)|Laffey]]||[[Maria Naganawa]]||[[Tia Ballard]]\n|-\n|[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]||[[Ai Kayano]]||Dawn M.

Meanwhile, [[USS Vestal|Vestal]] arrives on the base and is immediately upset at the poor state Enterprise's rig is in. Enterprise is met by Belfast and Unicorn, who convince her to attend a beach party the other shipgirls are holding. Unicorn thanks Enterprise for saving her, and Enterprise reveals she feels shipgirls are only meant to be weapons, and the ocean is only a source of conflict. As Unicorn leaves to play with Javelin and Laffey, Belfast confronts Enterprise directly, warning her that if she continues to fight like she did in the previous battle, she'll eventually forget her reason for fighting in the first place. The base then receives a distress call, with Enterprise, Cleveland, Hammann, and Belfast leaving to investigate.

When Enterprise touches it, she receives a brief vision what appears to be an alternate version of herself. Returning her attention to the base, Enterprise is surprised at how lively it is with new arrivals like Akashi, Ping Hai, and Ning Hai setting up shops. Belfast reminds Enterprise that shipgirls are humans as well, which is something she must learn to embrace. Javelin and Laffey take a bath with Unicorn, who reveals she's self conscious about her large breasts despite her small size. They reassure her that every shipgirl's body is different, and she should be proud of her own. That night, the three of them reaffirm their desire to befriend Ayanami. At the Sakura Empire, Prinz Eugen tries to sow distrust between Kaga and Akagi by suggesting to Kaga that Akagi has differing motives from hers. Akagi meanwhile expresses her desire to reunite with [[Amagi-class battlecruiser|Amagi]].\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = DEADLINE - For Determination, For Love\n| TranslitTitle       =\u3010Shisen\u3011 Ketsui to, Ai no Tame ni\n| NativeTitle         =\u3010\u6b7b\u7dda\u3011\u6c7a\u610f\u3068\u3001\u611b\u306e\u305f\u3081\u306b\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|21}} (Japan)<br>{{Start date|2019|12|12}} (US)\n| ShortSummary        = Azur Lane and the Sakura Empire prepare to face each other in a decisive naval battle, sending their largest fleets.

However, Orochi is protected by an impenetrable shield, and the shipgirls are unable to inflict any damage. While unconscious, Enterprise encounters her alternate self again, who warns her conflict between shipgirls is inevitable since they are manifestations of human will like Orochi, but Enterprise decides to keep fighting to protect everybody important to her.

He has a son, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]], with ex-girlfriend [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Shannon Keene|Shannon Keene]], but he abandoned them both the day Robby was born after Johnny's mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Laura|Laura]] died the same day. Johnny, self-admittedly, has never recovered from the breakup with his high school girlfriend, [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]].\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor [[Miguel Diaz (character)|Miguel Diaz]] from a gang of bullies using [[karate]]. Miguel, an [[asthmatic]] raised by his [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]] single mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen]], asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate [[dojo]] in a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with [[Daniel LaRusso]]. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership, is married to [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda]] and has two children: [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha]] and [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Anthony LaRusso|Anthony]]. Finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda, but after his friend and mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] passed away, his struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille]], his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]] and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by [[John Kreese]]. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries very hard to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] who is Sam's rival.\n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n\n===Main===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Xolo Maridue\u00f1a]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Miguel Diaz|Miguel Diaz]]\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda LaRusso]]\n* [[Tanner Buchanan]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]]\n* [[Mary Mouser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha LaRusso]]\n* [[Jacob Bertrand]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Eli Moskowitz/Hawk|Eli Moskowitz/Hawk]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* Gianni Decenzo as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Demetri|Demetri]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] (guest season 1, main season 2)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Nichole Brown as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Aisha Robinson|Aisha Robinson]]\n* Vanessa Rubio as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen Diaz]]\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] (season 2)\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Raymond/Stingray|Raymond AKA \"Stingray]]\" (season 2)\n* [[Aedin Mincks]] as Mitch (season 2)\n* Khalil Everage as Chris (season 2)\n* Rose Bianco as Rosa Diaz\n* Hannah Kepple as Moon\n* Griffin Santopietro as Anthony LaRusso\n* [[Bret Ernst]] as Louie LaRusso Jr. (season 1)\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Shannon Keene\n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[Ed Asner]] as  [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Sid Weinberg|Sid Weinberg]] (season 1)\n* [[Dan Ahdoot]] as Anoush Norouzi\n* Owen Morgan as Bert\n* Nathaniel Oh as Nathaniel (season 2)\n* Joe Seo as Kyler (season 1)\n* Annalisa Cochrane as Yasmine (season 1)\n* Bo Mitchell as Brucks (season 1)\n* Jonathan Mercedes as A.

He has a son, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]], with ex-girlfriend [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Shannon Keene|Shannon Keene]], but he abandoned them both the day Robby was born after Johnny's mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Laura|Laura]] died the same day. Johnny, self-admittedly, has never recovered from the breakup with his high school girlfriend, [[Ali Mills (character)|Ali Mills]].\n\nAfter losing his job, a down-and-out Johnny rescues his teenage neighbor [[Miguel Diaz (character)|Miguel Diaz]] from a gang of bullies using [[karate]]. Miguel, an [[asthmatic]] raised by his [[Ecuadorian Americans|Ecuadorian]] single mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Carmen Diaz|Carmen]], asks Johnny to teach him. Initially reluctant, Johnny finally agrees and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate [[dojo]] in a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with [[Daniel LaRusso]]. Daniel, now the owner of a highly successful car dealership, is married to [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda]] and has two children: [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha]] and [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Anthony LaRusso|Anthony]]. Finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a child when he lived in Reseda, but after his friend and mentor [[Mr. Miyagi]] passed away, his struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, his mother [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille]], his other source of support, has a complicated relationship with his wife Amanda.\n\nJohnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tommy|Tommy]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Bobby Brown|Bobby]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Dutch|Dutch]], [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Jimmy|Jimmy]] and Johnny were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by [[John Kreese]]. Johnny develops a bond with his first and best student, Miguel, in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries very hard to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. Thus, Miguel develops into a very different kind of student than Daniel, or even Johnny, was; he also begins dating Samantha.\n\nAs a means of revenge against his estranged father, Robby convinces Amanda to hire him for a position at the LaRusso auto dealership and develops a close friendship with Daniel (although Daniel is unaware of Robby's lineage). He even studies Mr. Miyagi's form of Karate with Daniel and becomes friendly with Samantha. She eventually joins her father's dojo, which ultimately leads to her breaking up with Miguel. Miguel later begins dating another Cobra Kai student, [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Tory|Tory]] who is Sam's rival. \n\nThe developing story revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that are ultimately the product of Daniel and Johnny's inability to move away from the past.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Karate Kid characters}}\n\n===Main===\n{{div col}}\n* [[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Daniel LaRusso]]\n* [[William Zabka]] as [[Johnny Lawrence (character)|Johnny Lawrence]]\n* [[Xolo Maridue\u00f1a]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Miguel Diaz|Miguel Diaz]]\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Amanda LaRusso|Amanda LaRusso]]\n* [[Tanner Buchanan]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Robby Keene|Robby Keene]]\n* [[Mary Mouser]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Samantha LaRusso|Samantha LaRusso]]\n* [[Jacob Bertrand]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Eli Moskowitz/Hawk|Eli Moskowitz/Hawk]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* Gianni Decenzo as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Demetri|Demetri]] (recurring season 1, main season 2)\n* [[Martin Kove]] as [[John Kreese]] (guest season 1, main season 2)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Recurring===\n{{div col}}\n* Nichole Brown as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Aisha_Robinson|Aisha Robinson]]\n* Vanessa Rubio as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Carmen_Diaz|Carmen Diaz]]\n* [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton List]] as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Tory|Tory]] (season 2)\n* [[Paul Walter Hauser]] as [[List_of_The_Karate_Kid_characters#Raymond/Stingray|Raymond AKA \"Stingray]]\" (season 2)\n* [[Aedin Mincks]] as Mitch (season 2)\n* Khalil Everage as Chris (season 2)\n* Rose Bianco as Rosa Diaz\n* Hannah Kepple as Moon\n* Griffin Santopietro as Anthony LaRusso\n* [[Bret Ernst]] as Louie LaRusso Jr. (season 1)\n* [[Diora Baird]] as Shannon Keene\n* [[Randee Heller]] as [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Lucille LaRusso|Lucille LaRusso]]\n* [[Ed Asner]] as  [[List of The Karate Kid characters#Sid Weinberg|Sid Weinberg]] (season 1)\n* [[Dan Ahdoot]] as Anoush Norouzi\n* Owen Morgan as Bert\n* Nathaniel Oh as Nathaniel (season 2)\n* Joe Seo as Kyler (season 1)\n* Annalisa Cochrane as Yasmine (season 1)\n* Bo Mitchell as Brucks (season 1)\n* Jonathan Mercedes as A.

Released from police custody, Johnny is visited by his wealthy stepfather Sid Weinberg, who gives Johnny a check before officially disowning him. Getting drunk, Johnny drives to the All Valley Sports Arena and relives his last encounter with his former sensei John Kreese, before his car is wrecked in a hit-and-run. Despite Johnny\u2019s protests, his car is towed to one of Daniel's dealerships for repairs. The next day, he goes to the dealership in an attempt to take the car back, only to run into Daniel. Johnny reluctantly accepts a free car repair from Daniel, who considers Johnny an old friend. While at the dealership, Johnny realizes that Daniel's daughter Samantha was one of the passengers in the hit-and-run. After Daniel says they're all better off without Cobra Kai, Johnny returns home and tells Miguel that he will be his sensei, and opens his own Cobra Kai dojo with the money from Sid.\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = Strike First\n |DirectedBy      = Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg\n |WrittenBy       = Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Miguel begins his karate training with Johnny, who bullys him for his [[asthma]] and low self-esteem.

Meanwhile, Daniel and his wife Amanda argue after Daniel scolds Samantha for inviting her friends over for a pool party without her parents' permission. Reconciling with Samantha, Daniel learns she is romantically interested in a boy named Kyler and offers to invite him to a family dinner. At school, Miguel befriends social outcasts Dimitri and Eli. During lunch, they talk about the rich girls Samantha hangs out with and discover that Kyler is one of the bullies who attacked Miguel. Johnny is informed that his son, Robby Keene, has been caught with drugs at school. During dinner, Daniel notices Kyler's bruises and learns he received his injuries from Johnny.

Daniel embarrasses Samantha during the dance by finding her and Kyler alone in a suggestive scene. Later, Miguel overhears Kyler and his friends sexually objectifying Samantha. Remembering Johnny's teachings, Miguel attacks Kyler, but is overpowered and severely beaten by the bullies.

When Johnny tells him not to throw his life away, Robby rejects him and points out that Johnny left him as a child and that Johnny's own life is wasted. After seeing a father happily sharing a milkshake with his young son, Johnny pleads for Carmen to let him continue Miguel's training, vowing not to fail him again.

When Kyler embarrasses Samantha, Miguel stands up for her and attacks him and his friends, defeating them all in an impressive display and gaining Samantha's respect. Robby decides to reconcile with his father, but sees Johnny acting in a fatherly way with Miguel and feels he has been replaced. Amanda notices the changes in Daniel's behavior since the reopening of Cobra Kai, leading Daniel to visit the grave of Mr. Miyagi to reflect and ask for wisdom. As Daniel prepares to drive away, he suddenly recalls the discussion with Miyagi after he gifted Daniel his yellow [[1941 Ford#1948|1948 Ford Super De Luxe convertible]] on his seventeenth birthday, that the lessons on maintaining balance didn't just apply to karate, but to one's entire life.<br />''Note'': This episode is dedicated in memory of [[Pat Morita|Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita]].\n |LineColor       = FFD700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n |Title           = Quiver\n |DirectedBy      = Josh Heald\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay |s=Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg |ex1=Joe Piarulli & Luan Thomas |ex1label=Story and teleplay by}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|2}}\n |ShortSummary    = Daniel tries unsuccessfully to persuade Samantha to take up karate again.

Johnny admits that he has been tough and cruel to his remaining students, but refuses to apologize, telling them that life is not fair and they must overcome the challenges that life will throw at them. Eli returns to the dojo with a distinctive mohawk haircut, for which Johnny nicknames him \"Hawk\". Robby gets a job at LaRusso Auto to get back at his father, and Miguel and Samantha slowly become friends at school.

At a meeting of the athletic committee, Johnny tries to persuade them to reverse the ban, but is opposed by Daniel, a committee member. Johnny tells the committee that his teachings are different from those of Kreese and Silver, revealing that Kreese himself is dead. He says that he has learned from his past mistakes and that his dojo is now a place where people who get bullied are taught self confidence and how to stand up for themselves.

Miguel finds a picture of Robby in Johnny's refrigerator, and realizes that Robby is Johnny's son. Miguel tells Hawk, and when they confront Johnny, he admits the truth, but refuses to elaborate more on the matter. Johnny later takes Miguel to eat hamburgers and fries, and confides in him that on the day Robby was born, he wasn't there for him because his mother (at the time the only person Johnny cared about) had passed away.

Kreese is making Cobra Kai be more ruthless, telling Tory to finish one dojomate. Miguel calls Kreese out on it, and Kreese says that mercy may be beneficial during a tournament, but in real life they must finish the fight in order to win. While talking to Tory, Tory reveals that her mother had to work as a waitress to support Tory and her brother, and her mom would take leftovers to feed them. Her mom's boss found out, and fired Tory's mom, which caused Tory to decide that since the world shows no mercy, she shouldn't either.

At the end of the day, Miguel goes to the LaRusso\u2019s house and gives Robby the Medal of Honor, asking him to give it to Daniel, and also to tell Sam that he's sorry before leaving.

Simultaneously, Miguel arrives at the scene and sees Robby restraining Tory and kicking the Cobra Kai member, which leads to Miguel tackling Robby. An all-out karate war between Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do erupts. The fight ends in disaster, with Miguel on lifesupport and Sam in the hospital from her injuries. Robby flees after his fighting leads to Miguel's fall. Miguel's accident results in Johnny losing Carmen and control of Cobra Kai after his remaining students turn on him and join Kreese, who tells Johnny that the landlord allowed him take over and have full ownership of the dojo when Johnny was in San Bernardino. The aftermath of the fight also provokes Amanda to demand Daniel to stop Miyagi-Do and karate.  A guilt-ridden Johnny goes to the beach, where he throws his new cell phone into the sand.
