'''Sunwoo Hwan''' ([[Lee Seung-gi]]), who was also studying in New York, was ordered to return to Korea by his grandmother, Jang Sook-ja ([[Ban Hyo-jung]]), to learn how to manage her food company. Eun-sung and Hwan, who were on the same flight back home, accidentally had their luggage bags exchanged, which led to several misunderstandings between the two.\n\nGo Pyung-joong (Jeon In-taek), Eun-sung's father, was struggling to save his company from going bankrupt. One day, his wallet and valuables were stolen by a thief who subsequently died in a gas explosion accident. The police, upon finding Pyung-joong's belongings on the thief, mistakenly identified the thief as him and a death certificate for Pyung-joong was promptly issued. He decided to lie low and not tell his family that he was alive so that his family could claim his life insurance money and use it to clear the debts. However his second wife, Baek Sung-hee ([[Kim Mi-sook]]), kicked her stepchildren, Eun-sung and Eun-woo, out of the house after collecting the insurance money and moved into a new home with her daughter, '''Yoo Seung-mi''' ([[Moon Chae-won]]). Seung-mi was also Hwan's longtime best friend, hoping to be something more.\n\nEun-sung asked for help from several of her friends, including Hyung-jin, who avoided her because she was no longer rich. She managed to find a job at a nightclub with the help of her friend, Hye-ri. At the nightclub, Eun-sung met Hyung-jin's upperclassman, '''Park Joon-se''' ([[Bae Soo-bin]]), who was shocked to see her working there. She also met Hwan, who caused her to lose contact with Eun-woo. Realizing that Eun-woo was missing, Eun-sung was devastated and tried searching for her brother but to no avail. With the help of Hye-ri and Joon-se, Eun-sung rented a small room and started a small dumplings stall while continuing her search for Eun-woo.\n\nMeanwhile, Sook-ja became deeply disappointed in her grandson as Hwan had no direction in life and did not know how to cherish her company and employees. While pondering over what to do about her grandson, Sook-ja visited a neighborhood that she used to live in when she was poor and encountered Eun-sung, who was selling dumplings. Sook-ja encountered an accident and received help from Eun-sung. Seeing that Eun-sung tried her best to take care of her even when she could not afford her own daily expenses, Sook-ja was touched by Eun-sung's compassion. She brought Eun-sung home, then announced to her family that Eun-sung was going to live with them and that she was going to appoint Eun-sung as the heir of her food company, if she could raise the profits of the sinking second branch by 20%.\n\n==Cast==\n===Go family===\n* [[Han Hyo-joo]] as Go Eun-sung<ref>{{cite web|title=Han Hyo-joo: 'Good People Deserve to be Happy'|url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/hallyu/entertainment_news_view.html?No=7036|work=KBS Global|date=5 June 2009}}</ref> \n* Jeon In-taek as Go Pyung-joong (father)\n* [[Kim Mi-sook]] as Baek Sung-hee (stepmother)\n* [[Moon Chae-won]] as Yoo Seung-mi (stepsister)\n* [[Yeon Joon-seok]] as Go Eun-woo (younger brother)\n\n===Sunwoo family===\n* [[Lee Seung-gi]] as Sunwoo Hwan<ref>{{cite web|title=Lee Seung-gi Branches Out|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/07/04/2009070400162.html|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=4 July 2009}}</ref> \n* [[Ban Hyo-jung]] as Jang Sook-ja (grandmother)\n* [[Yu Ji-in]] as Oh Young-ran (mother)\n* Han Ye-won as Sunwoo Jung (younger sister)\n* [[Lee Seung-hyung]] as Pyo Sung-chul\n\n===Park family===\n* [[Bae Soo-bin]] as Park Joon-se\n* [[Choi Jung-woo]] as Park Tae-soo (father)\n\n===Extended cast===\n* [[Min Young-won]] as Lee Hye-ri (Eun-sung's friend)\n* [[Jung Suk-won]] as Jin Young-seok (Hwan's friend)\n* [[Son Yeo-eun]] as Jung In-young (Eun-sung and Seung-mi's friend)\n* Kim Jae-seung as Lee Hyung-jin (Joon-se's junior colleague)\n* [[Baek Seung-hyeon]] as Lee Joon-young / Manager Lee (store manager)\n* Park Sang-hyun as Han Soo-jae (store worker)\n\n==Original soundtrack==\n# Only You (\ub108 \ud558\ub098\ub9cc) \u2013 Kang Ha-ni (Opening Title)\n# The Person Living in My Heart (\ub0b4 \uac00\uc2b4\uc5d0 \uc0ac\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c) \u2013 Isu\n# Crazy in Love (\uc0ac\ub791\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uccd0\uc11c) \u2013 [[Loveholic|Ji-sun]]\n# Love is Punishment (\uc0ac\ub791\uc740 \ubc8c\uc774\ub2e4) \u2013 [[K.Will]]\n# Spring Rain \u2013 Ji-hye\n# Dear Sister (\uadf8\ub9ac\uc6b4 \ub204\ub098)\n# Catch Hwan (\ud658\uc774\ub97c \uc7a1\uc544\ub77c)\n# Are We Family?

'''Sunwoo Hwan''' ([[Lee Seung-gi]]), who was also studying in New York, was ordered to return to Korea by his grandmother, Jang Sook-ja ([[Ban Hyo-jung]]), to learn how to manage her food company. Eun-sung and Hwan, who were on the same flight back home, accidentally had their luggage bags exchanged, which led to several misunderstandings between the two.\n\nGo Pyung-joong (Jeon In-taek), Eun-sung's father, was struggling to save his company from going bankrupt. One day, his wallet and valuables were stolen by a thief who subsequently died in a gas explosion accident. The police, upon finding Pyung-joong's belongings on the thief, mistakenly identified the thief as him and a death certificate for Pyung-joong was promptly issued. He decided to lie low and not tell his family that he was alive so that his family could claim his life insurance money and use it to clear the debts. However his second wife, Baek Sung-hee ([[Kim Mi-sook]]), kicked her stepchildren, Eun-sung and Eun-woo, out of the house after collecting the insurance money and moved into a new home with her daughter, '''Yoo Seung-mi''' ([[Moon Chae-won]]). Seung-mi was also Hwan's longtime best friend, hoping to be something more.\n\nEun-sung asked for help from several of her friends, including Hyung-jin, who avoided her because she was no longer rich. She managed to find a job at a nightclub with the help of her friend, Hye-ri. At the nightclub, Eun-sung met Hyung-jin's upperclassman, '''Park Joon-se''' ([[Bae Soo-bin]]), who was shocked to see her working there. She also met Hwan, who caused her to lose contact with Eun-woo. Realizing that Eun-woo was missing, Eun-sung was devastated and tried searching for her brother but to no avail. With the help of Hye-ri and Joon-se, Eun-sung rented a small room and started a small dumplings stall while continuing her search for Eun-woo.\n\nMeanwhile, Sook-ja became deeply disappointed in her grandson as Hwan had no direction in life and did not know how to cherish her company and employees. While pondering over what to do about her grandson, Sook-ja visited a neighborhood that she used to live in when she was poor and encountered Eun-sung, who was selling dumplings. Sook-ja encountered an accident and received help from Eun-sung. Seeing that Eun-sung tried her best to take care of her even when she could not afford her own daily expenses, Sook-ja was touched by Eun-sung's compassion. She brought Eun-sung home, then announced to her family that Eun-sung was going to live with them and that she was going to appoint Eun-sung as the heir of her food company, if she could raise the profits of the sinking second branch by 20%.\n\n==Cast==\n===Go family===\n* [[Han Hyo-joo]] as Go Eun-sung<ref>{{cite web|title=Han Hyo-joo: 'Good People Deserve to be Happy'|url=http://english.kbs.co.kr/hallyu/entertainment_news_view.html?No=7036|work=KBS Global|date=5 June 2009}}</ref> \n* Jeon In-taek as Go Pyung-joong (father)\n* [[Kim Mi-sook]] as Baek Sung-hee (stepmother)\n* [[Moon Chae-won]] as Yoo Seung-mi (stepsister)\n* [[Yeon Joon-seok]] as Go Eun-woo (younger brother)\n\n===Sunwoo family===\n* [[Lee Seung-gi]] as Sunwoo Hwan<ref>{{cite web|title=Lee Seung-gi Branches Out|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/07/04/2009070400162.html|work=[[The Chosun Ilbo]]|date=4 July 2009}}</ref> \n* [[Ban Hyo-jung]] as Jang Sook-ja (grandmother)\n* [[Yu Ji-in]] as Oh Young-ran (mother)\n* Han Ye-won as Sunwoo Jung (younger sister)\n* [[Lee Seung-hyung]] as Pyo Sung-chul\n\n===Park family===\n* [[Bae Soo-bin]] as Park Joon-se\n* [[Choi Jung-woo]] as Park Tae-soo (father)\n\n===Extended cast===\n* [[Min Young-won]] as Lee Hye-ri (Eun-sung's friend)\n* [[Jung Suk-won]] as Jin Young-seok (Hwan's friend)\n* [[Son Yeo-eun]] as Jung In-young (Eun-sung and Seung-mi's friend)\n* Kim Jae-seung as Lee Hyung-jin (Joon-se's junior colleague)\n* [[Baek Seung-hyeon]] as Lee Joon-young / Manager Lee (store manager)\n* Park Sang-hyun as Han Soo-jae (store worker)\n\n==Original soundtrack==\n# Only You (\ub108 \ud558\ub098\ub9cc) \u2013 Kang Ha-ni (Opening Title)\n# The Person Living in My Heart (\ub0b4 \uac00\uc2b4\uc5d0 \uc0ac\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c) \u2013 Isu\n# Crazy in Love (\uc0ac\ub791\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uccd0\uc11c) \u2013 [[Loveholic|Ji-sun]]\n# Love is Punishment (\uc0ac\ub791\uc740 \ubc8c\uc774\ub2e4) \u2013 [[K.Will]]\n# Spring Rain \u2013 Ji-hye\n# Dear Sister (\uadf8\ub9ac\uc6b4 \ub204\ub098)\n# Catch Hwan (\ud658\uc774\ub97c \uc7a1\uc544\ub77c)\n# Are We Family?

16 June until 24 June. As usual, the race began with a short prologue and featured a long individual time trial. Besides, riders also had to face several mountain stages in the [[Swiss Alps]], including the [[Grimselpass]], a 12.1 kilometres long climb with an average gradient of 6.6% and slopes at 10%. The race also visited the neighbouring countries of [[Liechtenstein]] and Austria.\n\nThe four top finishers of the [[2006 Tour de Suisse|2006 edition]], [[Jan Ullrich]], [[Koldo Gil]], [[J\u00f6rg Jaksche]] and [[\u00c1ngel Vicioso]] did not take part in 2007, as in one way or another they were all affected by the ''[[Operaci\u00f3n Puerto]]'' affair. [[Koldo Gil]] was the only one of these riders who was not left without a team, after Ullrich was fired by his {{ct|THR|2007a}} and Vicioso and Jaksche's team {{ct|ONC|2006a}} folded.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty-one teams of eight riders started the race:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/jun07/suisse07?id=startlist|title=Start list|work=Cycling News|accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|style=margin-right:20%;}}\n* {{ct|TMO|2007a}}\n* {{ct|CSC|2007}}\n* {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n* {{ct|ALM|2007}}\n* {{ct|SDV|2007}}\n* {{ct|DSC|2007}}\n* {{ct|RAB|2007}}\n* {{ct|AST|2007}}\n* {{ct|MOV|2007}}\n* {{ct|QST|2007}}\n* {{ct|LOT|2007}}\n* {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n* {{ct|GST|2007}}\n* {{ct|C.A|2007}}\n* {{ct|DEN|2007}}\n* {{ct|EUS|2007}}\n* {{ct|FDJ|2007}}\n* {{ct|COF|2007}}\n* {{ct|UNI|2007}}\n* {{ct|MRM|2007}}\n* {{ct|VOL|2007}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Route==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Stage characteristics and winners<ref>{{cite news|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/jun07/suisse07?id=stages|title=71st Tour de Suisse -

{"title_page": "Battle of Helm's Deep", "text_new": "The '''Battle of Helm's Deep''', also called the '''Battle of the Hornburg''', is a fictional battle in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', that saw the total destruction of the forces of the [[Wizard (Middle-Earth)|Wizard]] [[Saruman]] by the army of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], assisted by a forest of tree-like [[Huorns]]. \n\n[[File:Cheddar Gorge 1890s.jpg|thumb|upright|Helm's Deep is based on the [[Cheddar Gorge]], a steep-sided [[limestone]] valley in the West of England, seen here in the 1890s<ref name=\"Cheddar\"/>]]\n\nHelm's Deep was a valley in the north-western [[Ered Nimrais|White Mountains]] of [[Middle-earth]]. Helm's Deep, with its fortress the Hornburg, becomes the refuge of some of the army of Rohan, the Rohirrim, under King [[Th\u00e9oden]], from assault by the forces of Saruman. Although Th\u00e9oden says that \"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,\" in the battle a massive army of [[Uruk-hai]] and Dunlendings sent by Saruman almost overwhelms the defences. Saruman's [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] breach the fortress wall that blocks the valley by setting off an explosion in a [[culvert]]; [[Aragorn]] names it \"Saruman's devilry\" and \"the fire of [[Orthanc]]\"; the critic [[Tom Shippey]] calls it \"a kind of gunpowder\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|page=194}} The defenders hold out in the fortress until dawn, when Th\u00e9oden and Aragorn lead a [[cavalry charge]] that drives the Orcs from the fortress. They are surprised to see the valley to the enemy's rear blocked by a forest of tree-like Huorns that have walked from [[Fangorn]] in the night. On the sides of the valley are relieving forces assembled by [[Gandalf]] and Erkenbrand, a Rohirrim leader. These attack, driving the Orcs into the angry Huorn forest, from which the Orcs never emerge; the Huorns bury the Orcs's bodies in an earthen mound known as \"Death's Down\".\n\n[[Peter Jackson]]'s 2002 [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|film ''The Two Towers'']] makes the battle dramatic, following Tolkien's account quite closely, but with changes to the forces involved: the attackers do not include men or [[Warg#Tolkien|wargs]] (battle-wolves), and the defenders include a group of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-warriors sent by [[Elrond]], but except in the Extended DVD version do not include the Huorns.\n\nTolkien based Helm's Deep on England's [[Cheddar Gorge]], and its Glittering Caves of Aglarond on the cave complex that he had visited there.\n\n==Fictional geography==\n{{anchor|Glittering Caves of Aglarond}}\n[[File:Miniature reflections in Gough's Cave - geograph.org.uk - 1232463.jpg|thumb|left|The caves in Cheddar Gorge inspired Tolkien's Glittering Caves of Aglarond, at the head of the gorge of Helm's Deep.<ref name=\"Cheddar\"/>]]\n\nHelm's Deep is based on the [[Cheddar Gorge]], a [[limestone]] gorge 400 feet deep in the [[Mendip Hills]], with a large cave complex that Tolkien visited on his honeymoon in 1916 and revisited in 1940, and which he acknowledged as the original of the Glittering Caves of Aglarond at the head of Helm's Deep, behind the fortress.<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J.R.R.

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarf]] [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], who like all dwarves is well versed in geology, horrified that the caves are used only as a refuge, describes them lyrically:\n\n{{quote|... immeasurable halls, filled with everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools, as fair as [[Kheled-z\u00e2ram]] in the starlight. ... when torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then ... gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen [[Galadriel]]. There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose... fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they spring up from many-coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains fine as frozen clouds; spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! Still lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass; cities such as the mind of [[Durin the Deathless|Durin]] could scarce have imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, or into the dark recesses where no light can come...<ref name=\"Road to Isengard\" group=T>{{harvnb|''Two Towers''|loc=book III, ch. 8 \"Road to Isengard\"|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1954}}}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Gondor sketch map.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|Sketch map of [[Rohan (Middle-earth)|Rohan]], [[Gondor]], and [[Mordor]] in the Third Age.

[[Isengard]], [[Saruman]]'s fortress, is across the Gap of Rohan to the north, as is [[Fangorn]] forest, home to the [[Ent]]s and [[Huorn]]s.]]\n\nThe mouth of the gorge, Helm's Gate, was closed by the battlemented Deeping Wall, 20 feet (6 metres) tall, and wide enough for four men to stand abreast, with a [[culvert]] for the Deeping-stream which flowed down the valley. At one end of the wall the Hornburg castle stood on a spur of the mountain; a long stair led to its rear gate, and a long causeway led down forwards from its main gate. About two furlongs (400 metres) down from the gate was an outer trench and rampart, Helm's Dike, built right across the Deeping-coomb. Tolkien drew detailed sketches of the fortifications.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=Wayne G. |authorlink1=Wayne G.

He then set out to the Fords of Isen, where his marshal Erkenbrand was fighting Saruman's forces. However, Th\u00e9oden found out that his forces had been scattered. Gandalf advised him to take refuge in the Hornburg fortress of Helm's Deep. Gandalf then left on an unexplained errand. Th\u00e9oden's army went to the area, where local people were commanded by a captain called Gamling the Old. Many of the men there were very old or young. The women and children of Th\u00e9oden's capital [[Edoras]] were safe in [[Dunharrow]], led by the King's niece [[\u00c9owyn]].<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nThe garrison of Helm's Deep consisted of some 1,000 men, but around 1,000 more defenders had arrived from across Rohan by the time of the battle.<ref>K.

Fonstad, ''The Atlas of Middle-earth'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1981, {{ISBN|0-395-28665-4}} p. 132</ref> The enemy, [[Saruman]]'s army, consisted of at least 10,000 Orcs and men, most marching from [[Isengard]] to Helm's Deep, and others heading to the Fords of Isen.<ref name=\"Helm's Deep\" group=T/><ref group=T>{{harvnb|''Unfinished Tales''|loc=Part 3, ch. 5 \"The Battles of the Fords of Isen\"<!--p. 363-->|ref={{harvid|Tolkien|1980}}}}</ref> An additional force of [[Men (Middle-earth)|Men]] of Dunland joined the enemy.<ref name=\"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\n===The battle===\n[[File:Odo bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Tolkien stated that the styles of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (detail shown) fitted the [[Rohirrim]] \"well enough\".<ref name=\"Letter 211\" group=T>{{harvnb|''Letters''|loc=No. 211|ref={{harvid|Carpenter|1981}}}}</ref>]]\n\nThe forces of Saruman, common Orcs, large Uruk-hai, \"half-orcs and goblin-men\", and Dunlendings (Men of Dunland), arrived at Helm's Deep on a stormy night. They stormed the first defence, Helm's Dike, forcing the defenders to fall back to the fortress. They attempted to break down the gate with a [[battering ram]], but a sortie led by [[Aragorn]] and [[\u00c9omer]] briefly scattered the attackers.<ref name=\"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nThe Orcs and Dunlendings raised ladders to scale the wall, but were held back by the Men of Rohan atop the wall. Orcs crept into the culvert and made a breach in the wall using a \"blasting-fire\" from Orthanc, perhaps \"a kind of [[gunpowder]]\";{{sfn|Shippey|2005|page=194}} Saruman's army rushed in. Some defenders retreated to the Glittering Caves of Aglarond, while others retreated to the Hornburg.<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nSaruman's forces broke through the Hornburg gate just before dawn. At this moment, Helm's horn was sounded, and Th\u00e9oden and Aragorn rode out, followed by all the Rohirrim left inside. They cut their way through the Orcs and drove them back from the fortress walls to Helm's Dike.<ref name= \"Helm's Deep\" group=T/>\n\nAs day dawned, both armies saw that a forest of angry, tree-like [[Huorns]] now filled the valley, trapping Saruman's army. Above them, Gandalf appeared on [[Shadowfax (Middle-earth)|Shadowfax]], with Erkenbrand and a thousand footsoldiers who had escaped from the Fords of Isen. They charged into the fray.

Helm's Deep, with its fortress the Hornburg, becomes the refuge of some of the army of Rohan, the Rohirrim, under King [[Th\u00e9oden]], from assault by the forces of Saruman. Although Th\u00e9oden says that \"the Hornburg has never fallen to assault,\" in the battle a massive army of [[Uruk-hai]] and Dunlendings sent by Saruman almost overwhelms the defences. Saruman's [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]] breach the fortress wall that blocks the valley by setting off an explosion in a [[culvert]]; [[Aragorn]] names it \"Saruman's devilry\" and \"the fire of [[Orthanc]]\"; the critic [[Tom Shippey]] calls it \"a kind of gunpowder\".{{sfn|Shippey|2005|page=194}} The defenders hold out in the fortress until dawn, when Th\u00e9oden and Aragorn lead a [[cavalry charge]] that drives the Orcs from the fortress. They are surprised to see the valley to the enemy's rear blocked by a forest of tree-like Huorns that have walked from [[Fangorn]] in the night. On the sides of the valley are relieving forces assembled by [[Gandalf]] and Erkenbrand, a Rohirrim leader. These attack, driving the Orcs into the angry Huorn forest, from which the Orcs never emerge; the Huorns bury the Orcs's bodies in an earthen mound known as \"Death's Down\".\n\n[[Peter Jackson]]'s 2002 [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|film ''The Two Towers'']] makes the battle dramatic, following Tolkien's account quite closely, but with changes to the forces involved: the attackers do not include men or [[Warg#Tolkien|wargs]] (battle-wolves), and the defenders include a group of [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-warriors sent by [[Elrond]], but except in the Extended DVD version do not include the Huorns.\n\nTolkien based Helm's Deep on England's [[Cheddar Gorge]], and its Glittering Caves of Aglarond on the cave complex that he had visited there.\n\n==Fictional geography==\n{{anchor|Glittering Caves of Aglarond}}\n[[File:Miniature reflections in Gough's Cave - geograph.org.uk - 1232463.jpg|thumb|left|The caves in Cheddar Gorge inspired Tolkien's Glittering Caves of Aglarond, at the head of the gorge of Helm's Deep.<ref name=\"Cheddar\"/>]]\n\nHelm's Deep is based on the [[Cheddar Gorge]], a [[limestone]] gorge 400 feet deep in the [[Mendip Hills]], with a large cave complex that Tolkien visited on his honeymoon in 1916 and revisited in 1940, and which he acknowledged as the original of the Glittering Caves of Aglarond at the head of Helm's Deep, behind the fortress.<ref group=T>''[[Letters of J.R.R.

Soon after, however, a large group of the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]] of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]] join the defences, sent by [[Elrond]], at Galadriel's prompting. The defenders suffer heavy losses, but hold out until dawn, when Gandalf arrives with 2,000 riders led by \u00c9omer, who turn the tide of the battle and rout Saruman's forces.<ref>\"The Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers (Extended Edition)\", Ch. 23; Aragorn states that \u00c9omer is heading north with 2,000 riders.</ref> In the original script of the film, Elrond and [[Arwen]] had gone to see Galadriel in person, and it was Arwen who led the Elves to fight alongside the Rohan defenders. Jackson rejected Arwen's involvement, revising her character from a \"warrior princess\" to a role closer to that of the book, but kept the Elves in the battle.<ref>''The Two Towers: Extended Edition'', \"From Book to Screen\".
