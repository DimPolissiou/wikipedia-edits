There were few alterations and adjustments made as the army grew from a limited peacetime defense force of 100,000 men to a war-fighting force of several million men.\n\nThese ranks and insignia were specific to the Heer and in special cases to senior Wehrmacht officers in the independent services; the uniforms and rank systems of the other branches of the ''Wehrmacht'', the [[Ranks and insignia of the Luftwaffe (1935\u20131945)|''Luftwaffe'']] (Air Force) and [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']] (Navy), were different, as were those of the [[uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS]] which was a Party organization outside the ''Wehrmacht.'' The [[Nazi Party]] also had its own series of [[Nazi Germany paramilitary ranks|paramilitary uniforms and insignia]].\n\n==Insignia==\n\n===National Emblem (breast eagle): ''Hoheitszeichen'' or ''Wehrmachtsadler''===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal \n| align     = right\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Wehrmachtsadler\n| image1    = Wehrmachtsadler-1935.svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Wehrmachtsadler-1939.svg\n| caption2  = 1939\n| image3    = Wehrmachtsadler-1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Wehrmachtsadler-1944.svg\n| caption4  = 1944\n| image5    = Wehrmachtsadler-Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichswehr]]'s'' visual acknowledgement of the new [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] reality came on 17 February 1934, when the Commander-in-Chief, [[Werner von Blomberg]], ordered the Nazi Party eagle-and-swastika, now [[Germany]]'s National Emblem, to be worn on uniform blouses and headgear effective 1 May.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} The design adopted, in silver for the ''Reichsheer'' (army) and in gold for the ''Reichsmarine'' (navy), was a stylized eagle with outstretched, beveled wings clutching a wreathed mobile ''Hakenkreuz'', later to be called the ''Wehrmachtsadler'' (\"armed forces eagle\").{{efn|The ''Luftwaffe'', although a branch of the ''Wehrmacht'', would use its own eagle design.}} On tunics this took the form of a cloth patch about 9&nbsp;cm (3\u215d\") wide worn on the right breast, above the pocket. For enlisted uniforms it was jacquard-woven (\"BeVo\") or sometimes machine-embroidered in silver-grey rayon, for officers machine- or hand-embroidered in white silk or bright aluminum wire, and for generals hand-embroidered in gold bullion.{{efn|\"Gold bullion\" in this context does not (usually) refer to actual gold, but to gold-colored wire, typically a bronze alloy}} The backing was \"badge-cloth\" (''Abzeichentuch''), a close-woven velvetish fabric; this was originally ''Reichsheer'' grey, but in late 1935 the renamed ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht Heer]]'' changed its ''Abzeichentuch'' color to a dark blue-green called ''flaschengr\u00fcn'' (bottle-green).\n\nThe war brought several variations to the breast eagle, although it should be kept in mind that none of them was replaced or de-authorized, and all were being worn side by side at war's end. When hostilities began in 1939, on the enlisted ''Feldbluse'' or [[World War II German uniform#Field Tunic (Feldbluse) Model 1936|field blouse]] the eagle was changed from silver-white to matte grey for reduced visibility; and in 1940 backings began to be produced in field-grey (''feldgrau'').

By the middle of World War I these ornate collars had been reduced to an embroidered representation of short lengths of braid joined at the ends, sewn to patches worn at the front of the collar. When the ''Reichsheer'' was established in 1921 as Germany's first national army{{efn|The German Army of Imperial times comprised in wartime the armies of the Kingdoms of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg under the Prussian General Staff (''Generalstab'').}} ''Litzen'' were prescribed as the universal collar device for all personnel other than generals, and the Third Reich continued the practice.\n\nHowever, for clarification it has to be distinguished between \"collar patch\" ({{lang-de|Kragenpatte or Kragenspiegel}}), and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] braid (Unteroffizierslitze or Kragenlitze) \u2013 the status symbol of all German NCO ranks \u2013 encircling the collar of the uniform tunic. An NCO wore both, collar patches, and the collar encircling braid. [[Commissioned officer]]s wore only collar patches.\n\n==== Design and versions ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)}}\nOn both collar points of any uniform jacket there was a collar patch. Each patch consisted of the padding, and two parallel facings ({{lang-de|Patten}}), the so-called ''Litzenspiegel'', symbolising the double braid of the 19th century.\n\nThe padding of full-dress collar patches showed the wearer's ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'' (corps color). The dress tunic version was embroidered in fine aluminum thread on a patch of ''badge cloth'' ({{lang-de|Abzeichentuch}}). The backing also showed through in the space between the two parallel facings of the collar patch, and formed so a colour center stripe.\n\nOn field \u2013 and service uniforms, beginning in late 1935, the collar patch was dark bottle-green to match the collar; the ''Waffenfarbe'' \"showed through\" (in fact colored cord was sewn into) the center strip of each braid, the ''Litzenspiegel.''\n\nFor enlisted men, service ''collar patches'' were machine-woven in silver-grey rayon; COs' were embroidered more elaborately in white silk or aluminium thread, and were somewhat larger to match their higher collars.\n\nNCOs ({{lang-de|Unteroffiziere}}) wore standard enlisted collar patches but were distinguished by a strip of 9mm silver-grey diamond-woven rayon braid (Unteroffoziers-Tressen, NCO-Tressen), sewn around the collar, except on the dress, where the NCO-Tresse was bright aluminum. However, the aluminum-embroidered NCO-Tressen on dress uniforms ({{lang-de|Ausgangsuniform, Paradeuniform}}) encircled the collar's upper edge, the simpler NCO-Tressen on service \u2013 or field uniform encircled the collar's lower edge.{{Clear}}\n\n====Universal design from 1938====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted versions\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption1  = <center>Dress</center>\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = <center>Field, 1938</center>\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = <center>Field, 1940</center>\n}}\n\n[[File:Feldgendarmerie.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Field tunic with collar patches, NCO-Tressen and [[Gorget]], post 1940.]]\n\nBy 1938 the fast-growing ''Heer'' had found that it was impractical, for the enlisted field uniform, to manufacture and stock a multitude of collar patches in assorted ''Waffenfarben'' which also had to be sewn on and frequently changed by unit tailors. Accordingly, new universal collar patches were introduced with the ''Litzenspiegel'' and ''Mittelstreifen''{{Explain|date=March 2018}} woven in dark green to match the backing patch, and which could be applied at the factory; ''Waffenfarbe'' was now displayed on the shoulder-straps, which simply buttoned on and were easily switched.\n\nWith the wartime change to lower-visibility insignia enlisted collar patches were woven in matte \"mouse-grey\" with field-grey stripes, which were at first sewn to green collar patches as before but increasingly directly to the collar, which beginning in 1940 was made in ''feldgrau'' like the uniform; grey collar patches were never produced. The troops however preferred the green patches (and collars) if they had or could get them, especially on \"clean\" uniforms for walking-out; and long-service veterans took particular pride in pre-38 versions.\n\nIn contrast, officers' service uniform collar patches never changed. While most officers in the front lines wore the enlisted field uniform as per wartime regulations, many opted to have their green-and-silver collar patches added instead of (or on top of) the factory versions. \n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>field & service</small></center>\n| header    = Enlisted versions, tropic\n}}\n\nOn olive tropical uniforms the collar patches were tan with dull grey-blue ''Litzenspiegel'' for all personnel; officers again sometimes added their green collar patches.

When the ''[[Panzertruppe]]'' were established in 1935 they were issued a [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform|distinctive black uniform]] and as a badge the ''Totenkopf'' or Death's-head, versions of which had formerly been worn by the Imperial tank corps and [[Media:AugustvonMackensen.jpg|various cavalry units]]. These skulls took the form of white-metal pins attached to black ''Kragenpatten'' which were edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn mid-1940 crews of assault guns (''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]en'') received a uniform of their own, identical in cut to the ''Panzerjacke'' but in standard field-grey, which they wore with red artillery piping. Over the course of the war a bewildering and changing series of regulations governed the uniforms and insignia for assault guns, tank destroyers, armored cars and self-propelled guns (SPG). Depending on the unit and the date either the black or grey wrap or the standard ''Feldbluse'' might be authorized, and on the grey \"assault gun\" jacket the regulation collar patches could be black with skulls, or grey with skulls, ''Litzen'', or no device at all. The result in practice was chaos; wartime photos show a mix of uniforms and insignia worn not only in the same battalion, but even in the same vehicle.\n\nOfficially both colours of panzer wrap were working and field uniforms to be worn only in or around the vehicle; this regulation was universally ignored. ''Panzertruppen'' were issued standard uniforms for service-dress and walking out but rarely wore them, much preferring their unique jackets.\n\nIn North Africa, [[Armored fighting vehicle|AFV crews]] wore the same tropical uniform as the other branches, including collar patches; many tankers however pinned their ''Totenkopf'' badges to their lapels.{{Clear}}\n\n====Infanterie Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"====\n[[File:Special Single Litzen for NCO ranks of Gro\u00dfdeutschland IR.jpg|thumb|left|200px|NCOs' collar patch and ''Tressen'' of I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]\n\nIn June 1939, the Wehrmacht Heer wanted to renew its ties with the Old Army tradition by introducing a new uniform for its most prestigious unit: ''Wachregiment \"Berlin\"'' which was renamed [[Infantry Regiment Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Infantry Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]. The new dress uniform for I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\" had an elongated collar patch with single ''Litzenspiegel'' for NCOs and two for enlisted.

They ranked from ''Hauptmann im Generalstab'' (captain) through ''Oberst i.G.'' (colonel). All were, before 1939, graduates of the Military Academy, the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]''. On division staffs they held the position of '''Ia''' (operational chief of staff) or '''Ib''' (chief of the rear echelon). In the higher echelons, the intelligence and training staff sections were most of the time in the personal charge of General Staff Corps officers. The General Staff Officers had their own distinctive Litzen called ''alt-Preu\u00dfische'' (old Prussian), or ''Kolbenstickerei'' (\"lobe-embroidery\"). These were the same whether on carmine dress ''Kragenpatten'' or green service patches; colored ''Litzenspiegel'' were unnecessary. General Staff officers assigned to the supreme headquarters (the ''Reichskriegsministerium'', later the [[OKH]] and the [[OKW]]), the Kriegsakademie, and military attaches were further distinguished by having their Litzen in gold rather than silver. These Generalstaboffiziere were called \"des Generalstabs\", Oberst d.G., etc. The special golden Litzen were abolished in November 1942. Only Military attaches kept their Litzen as long as they were in their present position. The F\u00fchrer wanted a closer union between the front and the OKW and OKH.\n\nIn addition to their collar patches, General Staff Officers wore trouser-stripes, of the same design as generals' but in carmine rather than scarlet.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:WMacht arabesques OF10toOF6-hor 1945.jpg|left|120px]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0408-503, Walter v.

These devices, sometimes called ''Arabesken'' (arabesques), were embroidered in gold bullion or golden synthetic ''Celleon'' on ''Hochrot'' (scarlet) backing.\nField Marshals wore the same ''Arabesken'' as generals until April 1941, when they were authorized a longer variant with three rather than two iterations of the repeating pattern, for a total of six \"prongs\".{{sfn|Rosignoli|1975|p=209}} In some cases GFM did not bother to replace their generals' tabs, or did so only on their dress uniforms.\n\nGeneral officers of the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' \u2013 TDS) and of the specialist careers (medical, veterinary, ordnance, and motor park) wore the same insignia until April 1944, when they were ordered to exchange their scarlet ''Kragenpatten'' for ''alt-Larisch'' tabs backed in their respective ''[[Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)|Waffenfarbe:]]''\n\n* {{Farbindex|93CCEA|bright blue}} \u2013 TDS administrative;\n* {{Farbindex|6495ED|cornflower blue}} \u2013 medical;\n* {{Farbindex|FF7538|orange}} \u2013 ordnance;{{efn|Before June 1944 their Waffenfarbe was bright red.}}\n* {{Farbindex|FFC0CB|pink}} \u2013 motor park;\n* {{Farbindex|960018|carmine}} \u2013 veterinary;\n* {{Farbindex|900020|wine red}} \u2013 TDS judiciary.\n\nIn October 1944, the wear-out period of the scarlet backing color for Generals of the specialist careers was extended for an undetermined period.\n\nThese [[Gorget patches|arabesque collar patches]] are still worn today by general officers of the present-day [[Bundeswehr]].\n\n=====Chief=====\n[[File:VonRundstedt-Shoulderboards-alt-Larisch.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Gorget patch|Kragenpatte]] & [[Epaulette]] of von Rundstedt]]\nIn the Wehrmacht Heer, upon retirement, certain senior German generals were awarded the honorary post of ''Chef'' (Chief) of a regiment, much like the [[Honorary Colonel]] in the British Army. It was a German custom dating from the late 18th century.  These generals were authorized to wear the tunic and insignia of an officer of the regiment, including ordinary officers' ''Litzen.'' Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Chef'' of the {{ill|18th Infantry Regiment (Germany)|lt=18th Infantry Regiment|de|18. Infanterie-Regiment (Reichswehr)}}, wore a big 18 on his shoulderboards, and for everyday wear favored the ornamented tunic of an infantry officer with white piping rather than a general's uniform.\n\nHitler appointed first Generaloberst [[Hans von Seeckt]], ancient \"Chef der Heeresleitung\", to be Chef of the 67th Infanterie Regiment on his 70th birthday in April 1936, a few months before he died. Only seven German generals were appointed Chefs: in addition to Seeckt and Rundstedt they were General der Infanterie [[Franz Ritter von Epp|Ritter von Epp]] (Chef of the 61st Infanterie Regiment in Munich); Generalfeldmarschall [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] (Chef of the 5th Kavallerie Regiment in [[Stolp]]); Generaloberst [[Werner von Fritsch|von Fritsch]] (Chef of the 12th Artillerie Regiment in Schwerin); and Generalfeldmarschall [[Eduard von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli|von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli]] (Chef of the 28th Infanterie Regiment in [[Troppau]]). Generalfeldmarschall [[von Blomberg]] was appointed Chef of Infanterie Regiment 73 and wore a big 73 superimposed over the crossed batons of his shoulder board, but on 4 February 1938 he was dismissed and his name was deleted from the seniority list.\n\n===Shoulder-straps (''Schulterklappen'') and shoulderboards (''Schulterst\u00fccke'')===\n\n====Enlisted men====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 80\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n\n}}\n\nThe ''Reichsheer's'' shoulder-straps were very similar to those of World War I, made of ''feldgrau'' uniform cloth with pointed or \"gable\" button ends. In December 1934 the material was changed to grey badge-cloth (''Abzeichentuch'') and in September 1935 changed again to dark bottle-green (''flaschengr\u00fcn''). These \"first pattern\" shoulder-straps were not edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn 1938, simultaneous with the removal of ''Waffenfarbe'' from field-uniform collar patches, new shoulder-straps were issued. These \"second pattern\" straps had round rather than pointed ends, and were edged on three sides with wool (later rayon) piping in ''Waffenfarbe.''  This pattern would be used through the end of the war, although in 1940 manufacture reverted to field-grey uniform cloth, and as usual alternate versions were made to go with the Panzer uniform (black), tropical uniform (olive cotton) and [[World War II German uniform#HBT fatigue and summer uniforms (Drillichanzug/Sommerfeldanzug)|HBT summer uniform]] (reed-green twill). ''Schulterklappen'' were not worn with the fatigue uniform, nor with camouflage smocks and parkas which used an [[Ranks and Insignia of the German Army in World War II#Smock/parka rank insignia|alternate system of rank insignia]].\n\nFor junior enlisted men (''Mannschaften''), rank insignia if any was worn on the left sleeve. However the epaulettes did indicate the wearer's unit (usually regiment or independent battalion) together with his sub-branch if any, machine-embroidered in branch-color. For example, a ''Schulterklappe'' with rose-pink piping and number \"4\" would indicate the 4th Panzer Regiment; but if it carried a pink number \"4\" and letter \"A\" it would indicate the 4th Armored Reconnaissance (''Aufkl\u00e4rungs'') Battalion. The German Army used a very large assortment of Latin initials, Gothic initials, script ciphers, Arabic numerals, Roman numerals and symbols to designate all its various service branches and installations. Before the war, shoulder-buttons were embossed with the number of the wearer's company as well, this practice was discontinued \"for the duration.\"\n[[File:Trop Oberwachtmeister epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Cavalry ''Oberwachtmeister'', tropical]]\nBeginning in January 1940, shoulder-straps with unit insignia were (supposed to be) phased out as a security measure, and removable fabric loops with devices were issued instead. In May 1944 the embroidery was changed from ''waffenfarbe'' to light gray.\n\nNon-commissioned officers wore their rank insignia on their shoulder-straps, consisting of braid and pips (pyramidal \"stars\"). An ''Unteroffizier's'' (corporal's) epaulette was edged with ''Tresse'' on three sides and an ''Unterfeldwebel's'' (sergeant's) on all four. Senior NCO's (''Unteroffiziere mit Portepee'') added one to three pips; in addition, their unit identifiers took the form of white-metal pins rather than embroidery.\n\nShoulder-straps were made in both a standard width (4.5&nbsp;cm, 1\u00be\") and a wider one for three-digit unit numbers (5.3&nbsp;cm, 2\"), and in three lengths depending on the size of the man. There was in addition an extra-large size for the overcoat (''Mantel'').\n\n====Officers====\n\n[[File:Hauptmann Epaulette.jpg|thumb|left|90px]]\nOfficers' shoulderboards were constructed from \"Russia\" braid, an aluminum-thread double piping. Company-grade officers (''Leutnant'' through ''Hauptmann/Rittmeister'') wore epaulettes constructed by wrapping two side-by-side lengths of braid around the buttonhole and back, giving the appearance of eight parallel cords; the whole was sewn to an underlay (''Unterlagen'') of ''Waffenfarbe'' badge-cloth. Until 1938 the underlay was of the same outer dimensions as the braid, and only visible edge-on; in that year the underlay was made wider, so as to create the impression of edge piping like the enlisted shoulder-strap. Rank was indicated by zero to two gilt-metal pips; unit designators were also of gilt metal.\n[[File:Major Epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|95px]]\nField-grade officer (''Stabsoffizier'') shoulderboards were made by plaiting together double widths of Russia braid and looping them to form a buttonhole, sewn to a ''Waffenfarbe'' underlay; rank again was displayed by zero to two gilt pips.\n\nOnce the war began, dull grey aluminum braid appeared, but bright aluminum continued in use.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalsrangabzeichen.jpg|thumb|300px|Generals' shoulderboards, Wehrmacht (Heer)]]\n*'''1''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] ([[OF-10]], [[five-star rank]], shoulder strap from April 1941)\n*'''2''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (OF-10, five-star rank, shoulder strap prior to April 1941)\n*'''3''' [[Generaloberst]] (OF-9, [[four-star rank]])\n*'''4''' [[General of the branch]] (OF-8, [[three-star rank]])\n*'''5''' [[Generalleutnant]] (OF-7, [[two-star rank]])\n*'''6''' [[Generalmajor]] (OF-6, [[one-star rank]])\n\nGenerals' shoulderboards were constructed similarly to those of field-grade officers, but comprised a length of silver Russia braid between two braided cords of gold bullion or ''Celleon.'' Since the resulting combination was wider, generals' boards were plaited in four 'loops' rather than five. Their buttons were gilt, and rank was indicated by zero to three silver pips, or crossed batons in the case of field marshals. The underlay was scarlet, except (from 1944) for generals of staff corps, who were instructed to wear ''Waffenfarbe'' instead.\n\nIn April 1941, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' epaulettes were changed to incorporate a central gold cord instead of silver.\n\nColonels-in-chief wearing that uniform wore gold generals' shoulderboards underlaid with the ''Waffenfarbe'' of the regiment rather than scarlet; GFM von Rundstedt sometimes simply pinned his crossed batons to an infantry colonel's epaulettes.\n\n====Retired personnel====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalmajor (a.D.).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Generalmajor a.D.]]\nBy order of Marshal Hindenburg in March 1932, soldiers who retired after 15 years of service received the right to wear the uniform of the unit they left. The shoulderboards and shoulder straps of retired soldiers had a bridle 1.5&nbsp;cm wide attached under the middle.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Schirmmutze cap badges.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eagle/swastika and wreathed cockade used on the peaked cap (Schirmm\u00fctze).]] [[File:Insignias casco.svg|thumb|Decals of Heer used on various helmets.]]\nCaps and helmets bore two common insignia elements, in various forms: the [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|National Emblem]] and the national colors. World War I caps had carried dual [[cockades]] or roundels, one in Imperial black-white-red and one in the colors of the particular State within the Empire. The ''[[Reichswehr]]'' changed this to a single cockade in the Weimar Republic's black, red and gold; almost as soon as Hitler took power he restored the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1866\u20131918)|pre-1919 tricolor flag]], and ordered the Army to return to black-white-red.\n\n===Belt buckles (''Koppelschl\u00f6sser'')===\n[[File:Koppelschloss Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Enlisted ''Koppelschlo\u00df'']]\nBelt buckles for enlisted men were of box type, made of aluminum or stamped steel and bearing a circular device with a version of the ''Hoheitszeichen'' called the Army eagle or ''Heeresadler'' (an eagle with downswept wings clutching an unwreathed swastika) surmounted by the motto ''[[Gott mit uns]]'', or \"God with us.\" For field wear these were usually painted field-grey to reduce visibility and had a smooth finish; on the other hand, dress buckles were silver-washed with a pebbled surface surrounding the Hoheitszeichen.\n\nOfficers' field and service buckles were of a two-pronged frame type. With dress uniform officers wore a belt of silver braid with a circular silver-washed or -plated aluminum buckle, in the form of an oakleaf wreath surrounding a ''Heeresadler.''

He was therefore roughly analogous to a Company Sergeant-Major or First Sergeant, although his duties did not usually involve combat leadership. ''Der Spie\u00df''{{efn|\"The spear.\" This may refer to the sergeant of a flintlock-era company having carried a [[polearm]] rather than a musket, or it may relate to Latin ''pilus prior'' \"leading spear,\" the senior centurion in a cohort.}} or ''die Kompanie-Mutter'', as he was called, was not necessarily the ranking ''Unteroffizier'' in the company, especially since typically two of the platoons were commanded by senior NCOs rather than officers. A ''Hauptfeldwebel'' however had to be \nof ''Portepee'' grade; a junior NCO filling the role was a ''Hauptfeldwebeldiensttuer,'' \"one doing ''Hauptfeldwebel'' duties.\"\n\nThe insignia for a ''Hauptfeldwebel'' was a pair of NCO ''Tressen'' encircling each lower sleeve, nicknamed \"piston rings;\" he also carried a leather ''Meldetasche'' or report-case tucked into his tunic front.\n\n====Senior non-commissioned specialist officers====\nIn two specialist career paths it was possible to attain rank above ''Stabsfeldwebel'': fortifications engineers (''Festungspioniere'') and farriers (''Hufbeschlagschmieder'').{{efn|Farriers, blacksmiths specializing in the shoeing and care of horses, were a very important component of the WWII German army, 70\u201380% of which depended on horse-drawn transport. A standard infantry division had nearly 5,000 horses, one for every three soldiers.}} They were actual NCOs with command authority, not ''Heeresbeamten'' (uniformed Army civil servants).

They consist of civil service personnel performing functions within the Armed Forces and are recruited, in part, from former professional non-commissioned officers who became military candidates for civil service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4ranw\u00e4rter}}) at the end of their 12-year contractual period of active military service.\n\nUp to 1944, none of these officials were classified as soldiers; in that year certain groups were converted into officers in the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' or TSD). These were the higher administrative officers (''Intendanten'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general; the lower administrative officers (''Zahlmeister'') in the ranks of first and second lieutenant, and the judge advocates (''Richter'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general. At this time all personnel of the Field Post Office were made soldiers as well, but formed a corps of their own rather than belonging to the TSD. It was also made possible for qualified reserve technical service officials to become reserve officers of the motor maintenance troops.\n\nThe officials had titles, not ranks: ''Intendant, Direktor, Rat, Vorsteher, Inspektor, Meister, Assistent''. This is a complex subject as each branch had its own titles.\n\n=== Military officials ===\n==== Shoulderboards ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)#Corps colours of the Heeresverwaltung}}\nWith certain exceptions, military officials ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4r-Beamte}}) wore shoulderboards similar to those of soldiers of equivalent rank, but distinguished by the addition of dark green elements: those equivalent to generals had a central cord in their braided shoulderboards which incorporated green chevrons, and those equivalent to officers wore a narrow green stripe between the rows of braid. WO-equivalent ''officials'' wore a complex braided shoulderboard made of green, black and silver cords. In nearly all cases the shoulderboard underlay was a double layer of dark green under ''Nebenfarbe'', and metal pins with the '''HV''' (German abbreviation of ''Heeresverwaltung'', \"Army Administration\") cipher were worn.\n\nCertain services had insignia of their own: for example the ''Feldpost'' (\"Field Post Office\") wore shoulderboards with gold rather than green elements and the initials '''FP'''; and musical officials wore silver-and-red shoulderboards with a lyre insignia. ''Beamten'' in the employ of a military administration authority in the occupied territories wore '''MV''' (German abbreviation of ''Milit\u00e4rverwaltung'', \"Military Administration\") pins rather than '''HV''' ciphers.\n\nMost officials wore in addition to their dark green Waffenfarbe a secondary colour (''Nebenfarbe'') denoting their branch:\n\nIn March 1940 distinct ''Nebenfarben'' were abolished and replaced with light grey.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1''' to '''3''') and [[Officer rank]]s ('''4''' to '''6''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 400\n| image2   =\n| caption2  = <center><small>Officer ranks ('''7''' to '''9'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''10-11'''1)</small></center>\n| width2     = 345\n| header    = Rank insignias to officials of the Milit\u00e4rverwaltung (MV)\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps </center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1-2'''), [[Officer rank]]s ('''3''' to '''7'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''8-9''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 600\n| header    = File 2: Rank insignias to officials on the \"Reich\u00b4s court-martial\" <small>([[Reichskriegsgericht]])</small>\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps 1935 until 1945</center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Collar patches ====\n''Heeresbeamten'' wore distinctive collar patches; these tabs indicated not the official's rank or title, but rather the \"grade\" of the service in which the official was employed. These were classified by the minimum educational requirement, and ranged from ''Einfacher Dienst'' (Basic Services), for which a grade-school education was sufficient, through ''Mitteler'' (Middle) and ''Gehobener'' (Elevated) ''Dienst'', to ''H\u00f6herer Dienst'' (Higher Services) which required a university degree.\n\nOfficials in the Basic Services wore collar patches similar to (but larger than) enlisted soldiers', grey ''Litzen'' on dark green ''Patten'', but the patch was piped on three sides in ''Nebenfarbe''; similarly officials in the Middle and Elevated services wore officer-pattern ''Litzen'', again with ''Nebenfarbe''-piped patches. Officials of the Higher Services wore unique ''Kragenpatten'' with ''alt-Preussische Litzen'' in gold like ''Offiziere des Generalstabs'', but on dark green with, again, ''Nebenfarbe'' piping. General officer-equivalents wore green patches with generals' arabesques, similarly bordered.\n\n=== ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer'' ===\nIn addition to the career ''Beamten'', wartime needs led to the creation of \"Officials for the duration of the war,\" or ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer''. These men had needed skills but either did not possess all the qualifications to become full-fledged ''Beamten,'' or were effectively drafted from civilian jobs. The matter was further confused by the fact that Beamter a. K. did the same jobs and held the same titles as career officials.\n\nNonetheless, Beamter a. K. wore entirely distinct collar patches. The backing patch was large and piped on three sides like that worn by career ''Beamten'', but was light grey edged in green. The device was a rectangle pointed at the upper end with braid down the center, much like a British general's [[gorget patch]], the colors indicating the degree of the ''Beamter's'' service: grey with green braid for basic services, silver with green braid for middle and elevated services, and gold on gold for higher services.\n\n=== Military Supreme Court officials (''Wehrmachtbeamte beim Reichskriegsgericht'') ===\nOfficials of the Wehrmacht who worked in Military Supreme Courts wore shoulder straps without the \"HV\" and had the secondary colour of Bordeaux red (''Bordorot'').\n\n=== ''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' ===\n{{Main|Sonderf\u00fchrer}}\n''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' (short: '''Sdf'''; or '''Sf''' \u2013 in the meaning of '''specialist leader''' (literal: ''special leader'') \u2013 introduced to the [[Wehrmacht]] in the year 1937,<ref>{{cite book |author1=''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' |title=Mobilmachungsplan f\u00fcr das Heer vom 12.

There were few alterations and adjustments made as the army grew from a limited peacetime defense force of 100,000 men to a war-fighting force of several million men.\n\nThese ranks and insignia were specific to the Heer and in special cases to senior Wehrmacht officers in the independent services; the uniforms and rank systems of the other branches of the ''Wehrmacht'', the [[Ranks and insignia of the Luftwaffe (1935\u20131945)|''Luftwaffe'']] (Air Force) and [[Uniforms and insignia of the Kriegsmarine|''Kriegsmarine'']] (Navy), were different, as were those of the [[uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS]] which was a Party organization outside the ''Wehrmacht.'' The [[Nazi Party]] also had its own series of [[Nazi Germany paramilitary ranks|paramilitary uniforms and insignia]].\n\n==Insignia==\n\n===National Emblem (breast eagle): ''Hoheitszeichen'' or ''Wehrmachtsadler''===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = horizontal \n| align     = right\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Wehrmachtsadler\n| image1    = Wehrmachtsadler-1935.svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Wehrmachtsadler-1939.svg\n| caption2  = 1939\n| image3    = Wehrmachtsadler-1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Wehrmachtsadler-1944.svg\n| caption4  = 1944\n| image5    = Wehrmachtsadler-Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\nThe ''[[Reichswehr]]'s'' visual acknowledgement of the new [[Nazi Party|National Socialist]] reality came on 17 February 1934, when the Commander-in-Chief, [[Werner von Blomberg]], ordered the Nazi Party eagle-and-swastika, now [[Germany]]'s National Emblem, to be worn on uniform blouses and headgear effective 1 May.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|1967|p=312}} The design adopted, in silver for the ''Reichsheer'' (army) and in gold for the ''Reichsmarine'' (navy), was a stylized eagle with outstretched, beveled wings clutching a wreathed mobile ''Hakenkreuz'', later to be called the ''Wehrmachtsadler'' (\"armed forces eagle\").{{efn|The ''Luftwaffe'', although a branch of the ''Wehrmacht'', would use its own eagle design.}} On tunics this took the form of a cloth patch about 9&nbsp;cm (3\u215d\") wide worn on the right breast, above the pocket. For enlisted uniforms it was jacquard-woven (\"BeVo\") or sometimes machine-embroidered in silver-grey rayon, for officers machine- or hand-embroidered in white silk or bright aluminum wire, and for generals hand-embroidered in gold bullion.{{efn|\"Gold bullion\" in this context does not (usually) refer to actual gold, but to gold-colored wire, typically a bronze alloy}} The backing was \"badge-cloth\" (''Abzeichentuch''), a close-woven velvetish fabric; this was originally ''Reichsheer'' grey, but in late 1935 the renamed ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Wehrmacht Heer]]'' changed its ''Abzeichentuch'' color to a dark blue-green called ''flaschengr\u00fcn'' (bottle-green).\n\nThe war brought several variations to the breast eagle, although it should be kept in mind that none of them was replaced or de-authorized, and all were being worn side by side at war's end. When hostilities began in 1939, on the enlisted ''Feldbluse'' or [[World War II German uniform#Field Tunic (Feldbluse) Model 1936|field blouse]] the eagle was changed from silver-white to matte grey for reduced visibility; and in 1940 backings began to be produced in field-grey (''feldgrau''). Another version appeared with the advent of the [[World War II German uniform#Field Blouse Model 1944|Model 1944 Field Blouse]], which used a triangular backing for speed and simplicity of manufacture. Very late in the war some ''Hoheitszeichen'' were simply printed on thin fabric.\n\nThere were also versions for other uniforms: both white and grey variants on black for the [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform (Sonderbekleidung der Panzertruppen)|Panzer uniform]], and in dull grey-blue on tan backing for the [[World War II German uniform#Tropical uniform|tropical]] (''[[Afrikakorps]]'') uniform.

By the middle of World War I these ornate collars had been reduced to an embroidered representation of short lengths of braid joined at the ends, sewn to patches worn at the front of the collar. When the ''Reichsheer'' was established in 1921 as Germany's first national army{{efn|The German Army of Imperial times comprised in wartime the armies of the Kingdoms of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg under the Prussian General Staff (''Generalstab'').}} ''Litzen'' were prescribed as the universal collar device for all personnel other than generals, and the Third Reich continued the practice.\n\nHowever, for clarification it has to be distinguished between \"collar patch\" ({{lang-de|Kragenpatte or Kragenspiegel}}), and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] braid (Unteroffizierslitze or Kragenlitze) \u2013 the status symbol of all German NCO ranks \u2013 encircling the collar of the uniform tunic. An NCO wore both, collar patches, and the collar encircling braid. [[Commissioned officer]]s wore only collar patches.\n\n==== Design and versions ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)}}\nOn both collar points of any uniform jacket there was a collar patch. Each patch consisted of the padding, and two parallel facings ({{lang-de|Patten}}), the so-called ''Litzenspiegel'', symbolising the double braid of the 19th century.\n\nThe padding of full-dress collar patches showed the wearer's ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'' (corps color). The dress tunic version was embroidered in fine aluminum thread on a patch of ''badge cloth'' ({{lang-de|Abzeichentuch}}). The backing also showed through in the space between the two parallel facings of the collar patch, and formed so a colour center stripe.\n\nOn field \u2013 and service uniforms, beginning in late 1935, the collar patch was dark bottle-green to match the collar; the ''Waffenfarbe'' \"showed through\" (in fact colored cord was sewn into) the center strip of each braid, the ''Litzenspiegel.''\n\nFor enlisted men, service ''collar patches'' were machine-woven in silver-grey rayon; COs' were embroidered more elaborately in white silk or aluminium thread, and were somewhat larger to match their higher collars.\n\nNCOs ({{lang-de|Unteroffiziere}}) wore standard enlisted collar patches but were distinguished by a strip of 9mm silver-grey diamond-woven rayon braid (Unteroffoziers-Tressen, NCO-Tressen), sewn around the collar, except on the dress, where the NCO-Tresse was bright aluminum. However, the aluminum-embroidered NCO-Tressen on dress uniforms ({{lang-de|Ausgangsuniform, Paradeuniform}}) encircled the collar's upper edge, the simpler NCO-Tressen on service \u2013 or field uniform encircled the collar's lower edge.{{Clear}}\n\n====Universal design from 1938====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted versions\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption1  = <center>Dress</center>\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = <center>Field, 1938</center>\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = <center>Field, 1940</center>\n}}\n\n[[File:Feldgendarmerie.JPG|thumb|right|120px|Field tunic with collar patches, NCO-Tressen and [[Gorget]], post 1940.]]\n\nBy 1938 the fast-growing ''Heer'' had found that it was impractical, for the enlisted field uniform, to manufacture and stock a multitude of collar patches in assorted ''Waffenfarben'' which also had to be sewn on and frequently changed by unit tailors. Accordingly, new universal collar patches were introduced with the ''Litzenspiegel'' and ''Mittelstreifen''{{Explain|date=March 2018}} woven in dark green to match the backing patch, and which could be applied at the factory; ''Waffenfarbe'' was now displayed on the shoulder-straps, which simply buttoned on and were easily switched.\n\nWith the wartime change to lower-visibility insignia enlisted collar patches were woven in matte \"mouse-grey\" with field-grey stripes, which were at first sewn to green collar patches as before but increasingly directly to the collar, which beginning in 1940 was made in ''feldgrau'' like the uniform; grey collar patches were never produced. The troops however preferred the green patches (and collars) if they had or could get them, especially on \"clean\" uniforms for walking-out; and long-service veterans took particular pride in pre-38 versions.\n\nIn contrast, officers' service uniform collar patches never changed. While most officers in the front lines wore the enlisted field uniform as per wartime regulations, many opted to have their green-and-silver collar patches added instead of (or on top of) the factory versions. \n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption1  = <center><small>field & service</small></center>\n| header    = Enlisted versions, tropic\n}}\n\nOn olive tropical uniforms the collar patches were tan with dull grey-blue ''Litzenspiegel'' for all personnel; officers again sometimes added their green collar patches. Tropical NCO collar ''Tressen'' were copper-brown, or sometimes olive drab.{{Clear}}\n\n====Armored vehicle uniforms====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| width     = 45\n| header    = [[Armoured fighting vehicle|AFV]] crew collar insignia\n| image1    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption1  =\n| image2    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten mit Litzen.jpg\n| caption2  =\n| image3    = Sturmartillerie Kragenpatten ohne Abzeichen.jpg\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (assault artillery)</small></center>\n| footer_background = red\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     =\n| image3    = Panzer Totenkopf.jpg\n| caption3  = <center><small>Death's-head</small></center>\n| width3    = 60\n| image1    = Panzersonderbekleidung Kragenpatten.jpg\n| caption1  = <center><small>collar patch</small></center>\n| width1    = 40\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption2  = <center><small>shoulder strap</small></center>\n| width2    = 120\n| header    = rank insignias armored troops\n| footer    = <center><small>[[Waffenfarbe]] (armored corps)</small></center>\n| footer_background = #FF99CC\n}}\n\nA major exception to the wearing of ''Litzen'' was the \"panzer wrap\" ({{lang-de|Panzerjacke}}), the double-breasted jacket worn by crews of tanks and other armored vehicles. When the ''[[Panzertruppe]]'' were established in 1935 they were issued a [[World War II German uniform#Panzer uniform|distinctive black uniform]] and as a badge the ''Totenkopf'' or Death's-head, versions of which had formerly been worn by the Imperial tank corps and [[Media:AugustvonMackensen.jpg|various cavalry units]]. These skulls took the form of white-metal pins attached to black ''Kragenpatten'' which were edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn mid-1940 crews of assault guns (''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]en'') received a uniform of their own, identical in cut to the ''Panzerjacke'' but in standard field-grey, which they wore with red artillery piping. Over the course of the war a bewildering and changing series of regulations governed the uniforms and insignia for assault guns, tank destroyers, armored cars and self-propelled guns (SPG). Depending on the unit and the date either the black or grey wrap or the standard ''Feldbluse'' might be authorized, and on the grey \"assault gun\" jacket the regulation collar patches could be black with skulls, or grey with skulls, ''Litzen'', or no device at all. The result in practice was chaos; wartime photos show a mix of uniforms and insignia worn not only in the same battalion, but even in the same vehicle.\n\nOfficially both colours of panzer wrap were working and field uniforms to be worn only in or around the vehicle; this regulation was universally ignored. ''Panzertruppen'' were issued standard uniforms for service-dress and walking out but rarely wore them, much preferring their unique jackets.\n\nIn North Africa, [[Armored fighting vehicle|AFV crews]] wore the same tropical uniform as the other branches, including collar patches; many tankers however pinned their ''Totenkopf'' badges to their lapels.{{Clear}}\n\n====Infanterie Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"====\n[[File:Special Single Litzen for NCO ranks of Gro\u00dfdeutschland IR.jpg|thumb|left|200px|NCOs' collar patch and ''Tressen'' of I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]\n\nIn June 1939, the Wehrmacht Heer wanted to renew its ties with the Old Army tradition by introducing a new uniform for its most prestigious unit: ''Wachregiment \"Berlin\"'' which was renamed [[Infantry Regiment Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Infantry Regiment \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\"]]. The new dress uniform for I.R. \"Gro\u00dfdeutschland\" had an elongated collar patch with single ''Litzenspiegel'' for NCOs and two for enlisted. Although shown to the press, this new uniform was not provided to the unit due to the outbreak of World War II and was placed in depot storage.{{Clear}}\n\n==== General Staff Corps Officers ====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-51, Rudolf-Christoph v.

They ranked from ''Hauptmann im Generalstab'' (captain) through ''Oberst i.G.'' (colonel). All were, before 1939, graduates of the Military Academy, the ''[[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]]''. On division staffs they held the position of '''Ia''' (operational chief of staff) or '''Ib''' (chief of the rear echelon). In the higher echelons, the intelligence and training staff sections were most of the time in the personal charge of General Staff Corps officers. The General Staff Officers had their own distinctive Litzen called ''alt-Preu\u00dfische'' (old Prussian), or ''Kolbenstickerei'' (\"lobe-embroidery\"). These were the same whether on carmine dress ''Kragenpatten'' or green service patches; colored ''Litzenspiegel'' were unnecessary. General Staff officers assigned to the supreme headquarters (the ''Reichskriegsministerium'', later the [[OKH]] and the [[OKW]]), the Kriegsakademie, and military attaches were further distinguished by having their Litzen in gold rather than silver. These Generalstaboffiziere were called \"des Generalstabs\", Oberst d.G., etc. The special golden Litzen were abolished in November 1942. Only Military attaches kept their Litzen as long as they were in their present position. The F\u00fchrer wanted a closer union between the front and the OKW and OKH.\n\nIn addition to their collar patches, General Staff Officers wore trouser-stripes, of the same design as generals' but in carmine rather than scarlet.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:WMacht arabesques OF10toOF6-hor 1945.jpg|left|120px]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0408-503, Walter v.

These devices, sometimes called ''Arabesken'' (arabesques), were embroidered in gold bullion or golden synthetic ''Celleon'' on ''Hochrot'' (scarlet) backing.\nField Marshals wore the same ''Arabesken'' as generals until April 1941, when they were authorized a longer variant with three rather than two iterations of the repeating pattern, for a total of six \"prongs\".{{sfn|Rosignoli|1975|p=209}} In some cases GFM did not bother to replace their generals' tabs, or did so only on their dress uniforms.\n\nGeneral officers of the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' \u2013 TDS) and of the specialist careers (medical, veterinary, ordnance, and motor park) wore the same insignia until April 1944, when they were ordered to exchange their scarlet ''Kragenpatten'' for ''alt-Larisch'' tabs backed in their respective ''[[Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)|Waffenfarbe:]]''\n\n* {{Farbindex|93CCEA|bright blue}} \u2013 TDS administrative;\n* {{Farbindex|6495ED|cornflower blue}} \u2013 medical;\n* {{Farbindex|FF7538|orange}} \u2013 ordnance;{{efn|Before June 1944 their Waffenfarbe was bright red.}}\n* {{Farbindex|FFC0CB|pink}} \u2013 motor park;\n* {{Farbindex|960018|carmine}} \u2013 veterinary;\n* {{Farbindex|900020|wine red}} \u2013 TDS judiciary.\n\nIn October 1944, the wear-out period of the scarlet backing color for Generals of the specialist careers was extended for an undetermined period.\n\nThese [[Gorget patches|arabesque collar patches]] are still worn today by general officers of the present-day [[Bundeswehr]].\n\n=====Chief=====\n[[File:VonRundstedt-Shoulderboards-alt-Larisch.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Gorget patch|Kragenpatte]] & [[Epaulette]] of von Rundstedt]]\nIn the Wehrmacht Heer, upon retirement, certain senior German generals were awarded the honorary post of ''Chef'' (Chief) of a regiment, much like the [[Honorary Colonel]] in the British Army. It was a German custom dating from the late 18th century.  These generals were authorized to wear the tunic and insignia of an officer of the regiment, including ordinary officers' ''Litzen.'' Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], ''Chef'' of the {{ill|18th Infantry Regiment (Germany)|lt=18th Infantry Regiment|de|18. Infanterie-Regiment (Reichswehr)}}, wore a big 18 on his shoulderboards, and for everyday wear favored the ornamented tunic of an infantry officer with white piping rather than a general's uniform.\n\nHitler appointed first Generaloberst [[Hans von Seeckt]], ancient \"Chef der Heeresleitung\", to be Chef of the 67th Infanterie Regiment on his 70th birthday in April 1936, a few months before he died. Only seven German generals were appointed Chefs: in addition to Seeckt and Rundstedt they were General der Infanterie [[Franz Ritter von Epp|Ritter von Epp]] (Chef of the 61st Infanterie Regiment in Munich); Generalfeldmarschall [[August von Mackensen|von Mackensen]] (Chef of the 5th Kavallerie Regiment in [[Stolp]]); Generaloberst [[Werner von Fritsch|von Fritsch]] (Chef of the 12th Artillerie Regiment in Schwerin); and Generalfeldmarschall [[Eduard von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli|von B\u00f6hm-Ermolli]] (Chef of the 28th Infanterie Regiment in [[Troppau]]). Generalfeldmarschall [[von Blomberg]] was appointed Chef of Infanterie Regiment 73 and wore a big 73 superimposed over the crossed batons of his shoulder board, but on 4 February 1938 he was dismissed and his name was deleted from the seniority list.\n\n===Shoulder-straps (''Schulterklappen'') and shoulderboards (''Schulterst\u00fccke'')===\n\n====Enlisted men====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 80\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n\n}}\n\nThe ''Reichsheer's'' shoulder-straps were very similar to those of World War I, made of ''feldgrau'' uniform cloth with pointed or \"gable\" button ends. In December 1934 the material was changed to grey badge-cloth (''Abzeichentuch'') and in September 1935 changed again to dark bottle-green (''flaschengr\u00fcn''). These \"first pattern\" shoulder-straps were not edged in ''Waffenfarbe'' piping.\n\nIn 1938, simultaneous with the removal of ''Waffenfarbe'' from field-uniform collar patches, new shoulder-straps were issued. These \"second pattern\" straps had round rather than pointed ends, and were edged on three sides with wool (later rayon) piping in ''Waffenfarbe.''  This pattern would be used through the end of the war, although in 1940 manufacture reverted to field-grey uniform cloth, and as usual alternate versions were made to go with the Panzer uniform (black), tropical uniform (olive cotton) and [[World War II German uniform#HBT fatigue and summer uniforms (Drillichanzug/Sommerfeldanzug)|HBT summer uniform]] (reed-green twill). ''Schulterklappen'' were not worn with the fatigue uniform, nor with camouflage smocks and parkas which used an [[Ranks and Insignia of the German Army in World War II#Smock/parka rank insignia|alternate system of rank insignia]].\n\nFor junior enlisted men (''Mannschaften''), rank insignia if any was worn on the left sleeve. However the epaulettes did indicate the wearer's unit (usually regiment or independent battalion) together with his sub-branch if any, machine-embroidered in branch-color. For example, a ''Schulterklappe'' with rose-pink piping and number \"4\" would indicate the 4th Panzer Regiment; but if it carried a pink number \"4\" and letter \"A\" it would indicate the 4th Armored Reconnaissance (''Aufkl\u00e4rungs'') Battalion. The German Army used a very large assortment of Latin initials, Gothic initials, script ciphers, Arabic numerals, Roman numerals and symbols to designate all its various service branches and installations. Before the war, shoulder-buttons were embossed with the number of the wearer's company as well, this practice was discontinued \"for the duration.\"\n[[File:Trop Oberwachtmeister epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|80px|Cavalry ''Oberwachtmeister'', tropical]]\nBeginning in January 1940, shoulder-straps with unit insignia were (supposed to be) phased out as a security measure, and removable fabric loops with devices were issued instead. In May 1944 the embroidery was changed from ''waffenfarbe'' to light gray.\n\nNon-commissioned officers wore their rank insignia on their shoulder-straps, consisting of braid and pips (pyramidal \"stars\"). An ''Unteroffizier's'' (corporal's) epaulette was edged with ''Tresse'' on three sides and an ''Unterfeldwebel's'' (sergeant's) on all four. Senior NCO's (''Unteroffiziere mit Portepee'') added one to three pips; in addition, their unit identifiers took the form of white-metal pins rather than embroidery.\n\nShoulder-straps were made in both a standard width (4.5&nbsp;cm, 1\u00be\") and a wider one for three-digit unit numbers (5.3&nbsp;cm, 2\"), and in three lengths depending on the size of the man. There was in addition an extra-large size for the overcoat (''Mantel'').\n\n====Officers====\n\n[[File:Hauptmann Epaulette.jpg|thumb|left|90px]]\nOfficers' shoulderboards were constructed from \"Russia\" braid, an aluminum-thread double piping. Company-grade officers (''Leutnant'' through ''Hauptmann/Rittmeister'') wore epaulettes constructed by wrapping two side-by-side lengths of braid around the buttonhole and back, giving the appearance of eight parallel cords; the whole was sewn to an underlay (''Unterlagen'') of ''Waffenfarbe'' badge-cloth. Until 1938 the underlay was of the same outer dimensions as the braid, and only visible edge-on; in that year the underlay was made wider, so as to create the impression of edge piping like the enlisted shoulder-strap. Rank was indicated by zero to two gilt-metal pips; unit designators were also of gilt metal.\n[[File:Major Epaulette.jpg|thumb|right|95px]]\nField-grade officer (''Stabsoffizier'') shoulderboards were made by plaiting together double widths of Russia braid and looping them to form a buttonhole, sewn to a ''Waffenfarbe'' underlay; rank again was displayed by zero to two gilt pips.\n\nOnce the war began, dull grey aluminum braid appeared, but bright aluminum continued in use.\n\n====Generals====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalsrangabzeichen.jpg|thumb|300px|Generals' shoulderboards, Wehrmacht (Heer)]]\n*'''1''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] ([[OF-10]], [[five-star rank]], shoulder strap from April 1941)\n*'''2''' [[Generalfeldmarschall]] (OF-10, five-star rank, shoulder strap prior to April 1941)\n*'''3''' [[Generaloberst]] (OF-9, [[four-star rank]])\n*'''4''' [[General of the branch]] (OF-8, [[three-star rank]])\n*'''5''' [[Generalleutnant]] (OF-7, [[two-star rank]])\n*'''6''' [[Generalmajor]] (OF-6, [[one-star rank]])\n\nGenerals' shoulderboards were constructed similarly to those of field-grade officers, but comprised a length of silver Russia braid between two braided cords of gold bullion or ''Celleon.'' Since the resulting combination was wider, generals' boards were plaited in four 'loops' rather than five. Their buttons were gilt, and rank was indicated by zero to three silver pips, or crossed batons in the case of field marshals. The underlay was scarlet, except (from 1944) for generals of staff corps, who were instructed to wear ''Waffenfarbe'' instead.\n\nIn April 1941, ''Generalfeldmarschall'' epaulettes were changed to incorporate a central gold cord instead of silver.\n\nColonels-in-chief wearing that uniform wore gold generals' shoulderboards underlaid with the ''Waffenfarbe'' of the regiment rather than scarlet; GFM von Rundstedt sometimes simply pinned his crossed batons to an infantry colonel's epaulettes.\n\n====Retired personnel====\n[[File:Wehrmacht Generalmajor (a.D.).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Generalmajor a.D.]]\nBy order of Marshal Hindenburg in March 1932, soldiers who retired after 15 years of service received the right to wear the uniform of the unit they left. The shoulderboards and shoulder straps of retired soldiers had a bridle 1.5&nbsp;cm wide attached under the middle.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Schirmmutze cap badges.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eagle/swastika and wreathed cockade used on the peaked cap (Schirmm\u00fctze).]] [[File:Insignias casco.svg|thumb|Decals of Heer used on various helmets.]]\nCaps and helmets bore two common insignia elements, in various forms: the [[Coat of arms of Germany#Nazi Germany|National Emblem]] and the national colors. World War I caps had carried dual [[cockades]] or roundels, one in Imperial black-white-red and one in the colors of the particular State within the Empire. The ''[[Reichswehr]]'' changed this to a single cockade in the Weimar Republic's black, red and gold; almost as soon as Hitler took power he restored the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1866\u20131918)|pre-1919 tricolor flag]], and ordered the Army to return to black-white-red.\n\n===Belt buckles (''Koppelschl\u00f6sser'')===\n[[File:Koppelschloss Wehrmacht.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Enlisted ''Koppelschlo\u00df'']]\nBelt buckles for enlisted men were of box type, made of aluminum or stamped steel and bearing a circular device with a version of the ''Hoheitszeichen'' called the Army eagle or ''Heeresadler'' (an eagle with downswept wings clutching an unwreathed swastika) surmounted by the motto ''[[Gott mit uns]]'', or \"God with us.\" For field wear these were usually painted field-grey to reduce visibility and had a smooth finish; on the other hand, dress buckles were silver-washed with a pebbled surface surrounding the Hoheitszeichen.\n\nOfficers' field and service buckles were of a two-pronged frame type. With dress uniform officers wore a belt of silver braid with a circular silver-washed or -plated aluminum buckle, in the form of an oakleaf wreath surrounding a ''Heeresadler.'' Generals' were the same but gilt or gold-plated.\n\nWith the tropical uniform and its belt of cotton webbing, officers wore a buckle identical to the dress buckle but painted olive-drab.\n\n==Ranks and rank insignia==\n\n===Rank tables===\n\n====Enlisted personnel (''Mannschaften'')====\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted collar ''Litzen''\n| footer    = Red ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': artillery\n| image1    = Mannschaft Litzen 1934.svg\n| alt1      = Mannschaft Litzen 1935\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaft Litzen 1938.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaft Litzen 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaft Litzen Dress.svg\n| caption4  = Dress\n| image5    = Mannschaft Litzen Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = center\n| width     = 100\n| header    = Enlisted ''Schulterklappen''\n| footer    = White ''[[Waffenfarbe]]'': infantry, rose pink: armor\n| image1    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1936).svg\n| caption1  = 1935\n| image2    = Mannschaften Epaulette (1938-1940) vertical.svg\n| caption2  = 1938\n| image3    = Mannschaften Epaulette 1940.svg\n| caption3  = 1940\n| image4    = Mannschaften Epaulette Panzer.svg\n| caption4  = Panzer uniform\n| image5    = Mannschaften Epaulette Trop.svg\n| caption5  = Tropical\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He was therefore roughly analogous to a Company Sergeant-Major or First Sergeant, although his duties did not usually involve combat leadership. ''Der Spie\u00df''{{efn|\"The spear.\" This may refer to the sergeant of a flintlock-era company having carried a [[polearm]] rather than a musket, or it may relate to Latin ''pilus prior'' \"leading spear,\" the senior centurion in a cohort.}} or ''die Kompanie-Mutter'', as he was called, was not necessarily the ranking ''Unteroffizier'' in the company, especially since typically two of the platoons were commanded by senior NCOs rather than officers. A ''Hauptfeldwebel'' however had to be \nof ''Portepee'' grade; a junior NCO filling the role was a ''Hauptfeldwebeldiensttuer,'' \"one doing ''Hauptfeldwebel'' duties.\"\n\nThe insignia for a ''Hauptfeldwebel'' was a pair of NCO ''Tressen'' encircling each lower sleeve, nicknamed \"piston rings;\" he also carried a leather ''Meldetasche'' or report-case tucked into his tunic front.\n\n====Senior non-commissioned specialist officers====\nIn two specialist career paths it was possible to attain rank above ''Stabsfeldwebel'': fortifications engineers (''Festungspioniere'') and farriers (''Hufbeschlagschmieder'').{{efn|Farriers, blacksmiths specializing in the shoeing and care of horses, were a very important component of the WWII German army, 70\u201380% of which depended on horse-drawn transport.

They consist of civil service personnel performing functions within the Armed Forces and are recruited, in part, from former professional non-commissioned officers who became military candidates for civil service ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4ranw\u00e4rter}}) at the end of their 12-year contractual period of active military service.\n\nUp to 1944, none of these officials were classified as soldiers; in that year certain groups were converted into officers in the Special Troop Service (''Truppensonderdienst'' or TSD). These were the higher administrative officers (''Intendanten'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general; the lower administrative officers (''Zahlmeister'') in the ranks of first and second lieutenant, and the judge advocates (''Richter'') in ranks from captain to lieutenant general. At this time all personnel of the Field Post Office were made soldiers as well, but formed a corps of their own rather than belonging to the TSD. It was also made possible for qualified reserve technical service officials to become reserve officers of the motor maintenance troops.\n\nThe officials had titles, not ranks: ''Intendant, Direktor, Rat, Vorsteher, Inspektor, Meister, Assistent''. This is a complex subject as each branch had its own titles.\n\n=== Military officials ===\n==== Shoulderboards ====\n{{main|Corps colours of the German Army (1935\u20131945)#Corps colours of the Heeresverwaltung}}\nWith certain exceptions, military officials ({{lang-de|Milit\u00e4r-Beamte}}) wore shoulderboards similar to those of soldiers of equivalent rank, but distinguished by the addition of dark green elements: those equivalent to generals had a central cord in their braided shoulderboards which incorporated green chevrons, and those equivalent to officers wore a narrow green stripe between the rows of braid. WO-equivalent ''officials'' wore a complex braided shoulderboard made of green, black and silver cords. In nearly all cases the shoulderboard underlay was a double layer of dark green under ''Nebenfarbe'', and metal pins with the '''HV''' (German abbreviation of ''Heeresverwaltung'', \"Army Administration\") cipher were worn.\n\nCertain services had insignia of their own: for example the ''Feldpost'' (\"Field Post Office\") wore shoulderboards with gold rather than green elements and the initials '''FP'''; and musical officials wore silver-and-red shoulderboards with a lyre insignia. ''Beamten'' in the employ of a military administration authority in the occupied territories wore '''MV''' (German abbreviation of ''Milit\u00e4rverwaltung'', \"Military Administration\") pins rather than '''HV''' ciphers.\n\nMost officials wore in addition to their dark green Waffenfarbe a secondary colour (''Nebenfarbe'') denoting their branch:\n\nIn March 1940 distinct ''Nebenfarben'' were abolished and replaced with light grey.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = \n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1''' to '''3''') and [[Officer rank]]s ('''4''' to '''6''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 400\n| image2   =\n| caption2  = <center><small>Officer ranks ('''7''' to '''9'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''10-11'''1)</small></center>\n| width2     = 345\n| header    = Rank insignias to officials of the Milit\u00e4rverwaltung (MV)\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps </center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = \n| caption1  = <center><small>[[General officer]] ranks ('''1-2'''), [[Officer rank]]s ('''3''' to '''7'''), and [[Warrant officer]] ranks ('''8-9''')</small></center>\n| width1     = 600\n| header    = File 2: Rank insignias to officials on the \"Reich\u00b4s court-martial\" <small>([[Reichskriegsgericht]])</small>\n| footer    = <center>Shoulder straps 1935 until 1945</center>\n| footer_background = \n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Collar patches ====\n''Heeresbeamten'' wore distinctive collar patches; these tabs indicated not the official's rank or title, but rather the \"grade\" of the service in which the official was employed. These were classified by the minimum educational requirement, and ranged from ''Einfacher Dienst'' (Basic Services), for which a grade-school education was sufficient, through ''Mitteler'' (Middle) and ''Gehobener'' (Elevated) ''Dienst'', to ''H\u00f6herer Dienst'' (Higher Services) which required a university degree.\n\nOfficials in the Basic Services wore collar patches similar to (but larger than) enlisted soldiers', grey ''Litzen'' on dark green ''Patten'', but the patch was piped on three sides in ''Nebenfarbe''; similarly officials in the Middle and Elevated services wore officer-pattern ''Litzen'', again with ''Nebenfarbe''-piped patches. Officials of the Higher Services wore unique ''Kragenpatten'' with ''alt-Preussische Litzen'' in gold like ''Offiziere des Generalstabs'', but on dark green with, again, ''Nebenfarbe'' piping. General officer-equivalents wore green patches with generals' arabesques, similarly bordered.\n\n=== ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer'' ===\nIn addition to the career ''Beamten'', wartime needs led to the creation of \"Officials for the duration of the war,\" or ''Beamter auf Kriegsdauer''. These men had needed skills but either did not possess all the qualifications to become full-fledged ''Beamten,'' or were effectively drafted from civilian jobs. The matter was further confused by the fact that Beamter a. K. did the same jobs and held the same titles as career officials.\n\nNonetheless, Beamter a. K. wore entirely distinct collar patches. The backing patch was large and piped on three sides like that worn by career ''Beamten'', but was light grey edged in green. The device was a rectangle pointed at the upper end with braid down the center, much like a British general's [[gorget patch]], the colors indicating the degree of the ''Beamter's'' service: grey with green braid for basic services, silver with green braid for middle and elevated services, and gold on gold for higher services.\n\n=== Military Supreme Court officials (''Wehrmachtbeamte beim Reichskriegsgericht'') ===\nOfficials of the Wehrmacht who worked in Military Supreme Courts wore shoulder straps without the \"HV\" and had the secondary colour of Bordeaux red (''Bordorot'').\n\n=== ''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' ===\n{{Main|Sonderf\u00fchrer}}\n''Sonderf\u00fchrer'' (short: '''Sdf'''; or '''Sf''' \u2013 in the meaning of '''specialist leader''' (literal: ''special leader'') \u2013 introduced to the [[Wehrmacht]] in the year 1937,<ref>{{cite book |author1=''[[Oberkommando des Heeres]]'' |title=Mobilmachungsplan f\u00fcr das Heer vom 12.

Each carbon is [[covalent bond|bound]] to three neighbouring carbon atoms and to a [[hydrogen]] atom. This compound is one of the three possible [[Platonic hydrocarbons]], the other two being [[cubane]] and [[tetrahedrane]].\n\nDodecahedrane does not occur in nature and has no significant uses. It was synthesized by [[Leo Paquette]] in 1982, primarily for the \"aesthetically pleasing [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of the dodecahedral framework\".<ref name=paquette1982/> \n\nFor many years, dodecahedrane was the simplest real carbon-based [[molecule]] with full [[icosahedral symmetry]]. [[Buckminsterfullerene]] ({{chem2|C60}}), discovered in 1985, also has the same symmetry, but has three times as many carbons and 50% more atoms overall. The synthesis of the [[C20 fullerene|C<sub>20</sub> fullerene]] {{chem2|C20}} in 2000, from [[bromine|brominated]] dodecahedrane,<ref name=prinz2000/> may have demoted {{chem2|C20H20}} to second place.\n\n==Structure==\nThe angle between the C-C bonds in each carbon atom is 108\u00b0, which is the angle between adjacent sides of a [[regular pentagon]] That is quite close to the 109.5\u00b0, the angle between vertices of a [[regular tetrahedron]] as seen from the center, which is the ideal angle between the bonds of a carbon atom (sp<sup>3</sup>  [[orbital hybridisation|hybridised]] orbitals). \n\nThe molecule has perfect icosahedral (I<sub>h</sub>) [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]], as evidenced by its [[proton NMR]] spectrum in which all hydrogen atoms appear at a single [[chemical shift]] of 3.38&nbsp;ppm.  Unlike buckminsterfullerene, dodecahedrane has no [[delocalized electron]]s and hence has no [[aromaticity]].\n\n==History==\nFor over 30 years, several research groups actively pursued the [[total synthesis]] of dodecahedrane. A review article published in 1978 described the different strategies that existed up to then.<ref name=eaton1979/> The first attempt was initiated in 1964 by [[Robert Burns Woodward|R.B. Woodward]] with the synthesis of the compound [[triquinacene]] which was thought to be able to simply dimerize to dodecahedrane.  Other groups were also in the race, for example that of [[Philip Eaton]] and [[Paul von Ragu\u00e9 Schleyer]].\n\nLeo Paquette's group at [[Ohio State University]]  was the first to succeed, by a complex 29-step route that mostly builds the dodecahedral skeleton one ring at a time, and finally closes the last hole.<ref name=paquette1982/> \n\nIn 1987, more versatile alternative synthesis route was found by the [[Horst Prinzbach]]'s group.<ref name=fessner/><ref name=bulusu/> Their approach was based on the isomerization [[pagodane]], obtained from [[isodrin]] as starting material i.a. through [6+6][[cycloaddition|photocycloaddition]]. Schleyer had followed a similar approach in his synthesis of [[adamantane]]. \n\nFollowing that idea, joint efforts of the Prinzbach team and the Schleyer group succeeded but obtained only 8% yield for the conversion at best. In the following decade the group greatly optimized that route, so that dodecahedrane could be obtained in multi-gram quantities.  The new  route also made it easier to obtain derivatives with selected substitutions and [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds]]. Two significative developments were the discovery of [[\u03c3-bishomoaromaticity]] <ref name=prakash/> and the formation of [[C20 fullerene|C<sub>20</sub> fullerene]] from highly brominated dodecahedrane species.<ref name=prinz2000/><ref name=prinz2006/>\n\n==Synthesis==\n===Original route===\nPaquette's 1982 [[organic synthesis]] takes about 29 steps with raw materials [[cyclopentadiene]] (2 equivalents 10 carbon atoms), [[dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate]] (4 carbon atoms) and [[allyltrimethylsilane]] (2 equivalents, 6 carbon atoms).\n\nIn the first leg of the procedure <ref name=paquette1974/> two molecules of [[cyclopentadiene]] '''1''' are [[coupling reaction|coupled]] together by reaction with elemental [[sodium]] (forming the [[cyclopentadienyl complex]]) and [[iodine]] to [[fulvalene|dihydrofulvalene]] '''2'''. Next up is a [[tandem reaction|tandem]] [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]] with [[dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate]] '''3''' with desired sequence pentadiene-acetylene-pentadiene as in symmetrical adduct '''4'''. An equal amount of asymmetric pentadiene-pentadiene-acetylene compound ('''4b''') is formed and discarded.\n\n:{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:small\"\n|[[Image:DodecahedranePrecursorSynthesis.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part I]]\n|valign=top |[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisStepII.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part I]]\n|-\n| Dodecahedrane synthesis part I||Dodecahedrane synthesis part II\n|-\n|}\n\nIn the next step of the sequence <ref name=wyvratt/> iodine is temporarily introduced via an [[iodolactonization]] of the diacid of '''4''' to dilactone '''5'''. The [[ester]] group is cleaved next by [[methanol]] to the [[halohydrin]] '''6''', the [[alcohol]] groups converted to [[ketone]] groups in '''7''' by [[Jones oxidation]] and the iodine groups reduced by a [[zinc-copper couple]] in '''8'''.\n\n:{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:small\"\n|[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisStepIII.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part III]]\n|valign=top |[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisPartIV.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part IV]]\n|-\n| Dodecahedrane synthesis part III||Dodecahedrane synthesis part IV\n|-\n|}\n\nThe final 6 carbon atoms are inserted in a [[nucleophilic addition]] to the ketone groups of the [[carbanion]] '''10''' generated from [[allyltrimethylsilane]] '''9''' and [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]]. In the next step the  [[vinyl silane]] '''11''' reacts with [[peracetic acid]] in [[acetic acid]] in a [[radical substitution]] to the dilactone '''12''' followed by an [[Intramolecular reaction|intramolecular]] [[Friedel-Crafts alkylation]] with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] to diketone '''13'''. This molecule contains all required 20 carbon atoms and is also symmetrical which facilitates the construction of the remaining 5 [[carbon-carbon bond]]s.\n\nReduction of the [[double bond]]s in '''13''' to '''14''' is accomplished with [[hydrogenation]] with [[palladium on carbon]] and that of the ketone groups to alcohol groups in '''15''' by [[sodium borohydride]]. Replacement of hydroxyl by [[chlorine]] in '''17''' via [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]] takes place through the dilactone '''16''' ([[tosyl chloride]]). The first C\u2013C bond forming reaction is a kind of [[Birch alkylation]] ([[lithium]], [[ammonia]]) with the immediate reaction product trapped with [[chloromethyl phenyl ether]],<ref name=Paquette/> the other chlorine atom in '''17''' is simply reduced. This temporary appendix will in a later stage prevent unwanted [[enolization]]. The newly formed [[ketone]] group then forms another C\u2013C bond by [[photochemical]] [[Norrish reaction]] to '''19''' whose alcohol group is induced to [[elimination reaction|eliminate]] with [[TsOH]] to [[alkene]] '''20'''.\n\n:{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:small\"\n|[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisPartV.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part V]]\n|valign=top |[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisPartVI.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part VI]]\n|-\n| Dodecahedrane synthesis part V||Dodecahedrane synthesis part VI\n|-\n|}\n\nThe double bond is reduced with [[hydrazine]] and sequential [[diisobutylaluminum hydride]] reduction and [[pyridinium chlorochromate]] oxidation of '''21''' forms the [[aldehyde]] '''22'''. A second Norrish reaction then adds another C\u2013C bond to alcohol '''23''' and having served its purpose the phenoxy tail is removed in several steps: a [[Birch reduction]] to diol '''24''', oxidation with [[pyridinium chlorochromate]] to ketoaldehyde '''25''' and a reverse [[Claisen condensation]] to ketone '''26'''. A third Norrish reaction produces alcohol '''27''' and a second [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] '''28''' and another reduction '''29''' at which point the synthesis is left completely without [[functional group]]s. The missing C-C bond is put in place by hydrogen pressurized [[dehydrogenation]] with [[palladium on carbon]] at 250&nbsp;\u00b0C to dodecahedrane '''30'''.\n\n===Pagodane route===\nIn Prinzbach's optimized route from pagodane to dodecahedrane, the original low-yielding isomerization of parent pagodane to dodecahedrane is replaced by a longer but higher yielding sequence - which nevertheless still relies heavily on pagodane derivatives.  In the scheme below, the divergence from the original happens after compound 16.\n\n:[[File:Optimized Dodecahedrane Synthesis en.png|thumb|left|800px|Optimized route to dodecahedrane]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Derivatives==\nA variety of dodecahedrane derivatives have been synthesized and reported in the literature. \n===Hydrogen substitution===\nSubstitution of all 20 hydrogens by [[fluorine]] atoms yields the relatively unstable [[perfluorododecahedrane]] C<sub>20</sub>F<sub>20</sub>, which was obtained in milligram quantities.  Trace amounts of the analogous  [[perchlorododecahedrane]] C<sub>20</sub>Cl<sub>20</sub> were obtained, among other partially chlorinated derivatives, by reacting {{chem2|C20H20}} dissolved in liquid [[chlorine]] under pressure at about 140&nbsp;\u00b0C and under intense light for five days.  Complete replacement by heavier [[halogen]]s seems increasingly difficult due to their larger size.  Half or more of the hydrogen atoms can be substituted by [[hydroxyl]] groups to yield [[polyols]], but the extreme compound C<sub>20</sub>(OH)<sub>20</sub> remained elusive as of 2006.<ref name=prinz20062/> Amino-dodecahedranes comparable to [[amantadine]] have been prepared, but were more toxic and with weaker antiviral effects.<ref>Weber JC, Paquette LA.

Those insertions are not chemically bonded to the caging compound, but merely mechanically trapped in it.  \n\nCross, Saunders and Prinzbach succeeded in encapsulating [[helium]] atoms in dodecahedrane by shooting ions He<sup>+</sup> at a film of the compound. They obtained [[microgram]] quantities of He@{{chem2|C20H20}} (the \"@\" being the standard notation for encapsulation), which they described as a quite stable substance.<ref name=cross/> The molecule has been described as \"the world's smallest [[helium balloon]]\".{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em\n |refs=\n<ref name=paquette1982>{{cite journal|title=Dodecahedrane\n|first1=Robert J.|last1= Ternansky|first2= Douglas W.|last2= Balogh|first3= Leo A.|last3= Paquette\n|journal=[[J.

Each carbon is [[covalent bond|bound]] to three neighbouring carbon atoms and to a [[hydrogen]] atom. This compound is one of the three possible [[Platonic hydrocarbons]], the other two being [[cubane]] and [[tetrahedrane]].\n\nDodecahedrane does not occur in nature and has no significant uses. It was synthesized by [[Leo Paquette]] in 1982, primarily for the \"aesthetically pleasing [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]] of the dodecahedral framework\".<ref name=paquette1982/> \n\nFor many years, dodecahedrane was the simplest real carbon-based [[molecule]] with full [[icosahedral symmetry]]. [[Buckminsterfullerene]] ({{chem2|C60}}), discovered in 1985, also has the same symmetry, but has three times as many carbons and 50% more atoms overall. The synthesis of the [[C20 fullerene|C<sub>20</sub> fullerene]] {{chem2|C20}} in 2000, from [[bromine|brominated]] dodecahedrane,<ref name=prinz2000/> may have demoted {{chem2|C20H20}} to second place.\n\n==Structure==\nThe angle between the C-C bonds in each carbon atom is 108\u00b0, which is the angle between adjacent sides of a [[regular pentagon]] That is quite close to the 109.5\u00b0, the angle between vertices of a [[regular tetrahedron]] as seen from the center, which is the ideal angle between the bonds of a carbon atom (sp<sup>3</sup>  [[orbital hybridisation|hybridised]] orbitals). \n\nThe molecule has perfect icosahedral (I<sub>h</sub>) [[molecular symmetry|symmetry]], as evidenced by its [[proton NMR]] spectrum in which all hydrogen atoms appear at a single [[chemical shift]] of 3.38&nbsp;ppm.  Unlike buckminsterfullerene, dodecahedrane has no [[delocalized electron]]s and hence has no [[aromaticity]].\n\n==History==\nFor over 30 years, several research groups actively pursued the [[total synthesis]] of dodecahedrane. A review article published in 1978 described the different strategies that existed up to then.<ref name=eaton1979/> The first attempt was initiated in 1964 by [[Robert Burns Woodward|R.B. Woodward]] with the synthesis of the compound [[triquinacene]] which was thought to be able to simply dimerize to dodecahedrane.  Other groups were also in the race, for example that of [[Philip Eaton]] and [[Paul von Ragu\u00e9 Schleyer]].\n\nLeo Paquette\u00b4s group at [[Ohio State University]]  was the first to succeed, by a complex 29-step route that mostly builds the dodecahedral skeleton one ring at a time, and finally closes the last hole.<ref name=paquette1982/> \n\nIn 1987, more versatile alternative synthesis route was found by the [[Horst Prinzbach]]'s group.<ref name=fessner/><ref name=bulusu/> Their approach was based on the isomerization [[pagodane]], obtained from [[isodrin]] as starting material i.a. through [6+6][[cycloaddition|photocycloaddition]]. Schleyer had followed a similar approach in his synthesis of [[adamantane]]. \n\nFollowing that idea, joint efforts of the Prinzbach team and the Schleyer group succeeded but obtained only 8% yield for the conversion at best. In the following decade the group greatly optimized that route, so that dodecahedrane could be obtained in multi-gram quantities.  The new  route also made it easier to obtain derivatives with selected substitutions and [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds]]. Two significative developments were the discovery of [[\u03c3-bishomoaromaticity]] <ref name=prakash/> and the formation of [[C20 fullerene|C<sub>20</sub> fullerene]] from highly brominated dodecahedrane species.<ref name=prinz2000/><ref name=prinz2006/>\n\n==Synthesis==\n===Original route===\nPaquette's 1982 [[organic synthesis]] takes about 29 steps with raw materials [[cyclopentadiene]] (2 equivalents 10 carbon atoms), [[dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate]] (4 carbon atoms) and [[allyltrimethylsilane]] (2 equivalents, 6 carbon atoms).\n\nIn the first leg of the procedure <ref name=paquette1974/> two molecules of [[cyclopentadiene]] '''1''' are [[coupling reaction|coupled]] together by reaction with elemental [[sodium]] (forming the [[cyclopentadienyl complex]]) and [[iodine]] to [[fulvalene|dihydrofulvalene]] '''2'''. Next up is a [[tandem reaction|tandem]] [[Diels\u2013Alder reaction]] with [[dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate]] '''3''' with desired sequence pentadiene-acetylene-pentadiene as in symmetrical adduct '''4'''. An equal amount of asymmetric pentadiene-pentadiene-acetylene compound ('''4b''') is formed and discarded.\n\n:{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:small\"\n|[[Image:DodecahedranePrecursorSynthesis.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part I]]\n|valign=top |[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisStepII.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part I]]\n|-\n| Dodecahedrane synthesis part I||Dodecahedrane synthesis part II\n|-\n|}\n\nIn the next step of the sequence <ref name=wyvratt/> iodine is temporarily introduced via an [[iodolactonization]] of the diacid of '''4''' to dilactone '''5'''. The [[ester]] group is cleaved next by [[methanol]] to the [[halohydrin]] '''6''', the [[alcohol]] groups converted to [[ketone]] groups in '''7''' by [[Jones oxidation]] and the iodine groups reduced by a [[zinc-copper couple]] in '''8'''.\n\n:{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:small\"\n|[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisStepIII.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part III]]\n|valign=top |[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisPartIV.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part IV]]\n|-\n| Dodecahedrane synthesis part III||Dodecahedrane synthesis part IV\n|-\n|}\n\nThe final 6 carbon atoms are inserted in a [[nucleophilic addition]] to the ketone groups of the [[carbanion]] '''10''' generated from [[allyltrimethylsilane]] '''9''' and [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]]. In the next step the  [[vinyl silane]] '''11''' reacts with [[peracetic acid]] in [[acetic acid]] in a [[radical substitution]] to the dilactone '''12''' followed by an [[Intramolecular reaction|intramolecular]] [[Friedel-Crafts alkylation]] with [[phosphorus pentoxide]] to diketone '''13'''. This molecule contains all required 20 carbon atoms and is also symmetrical which facilitates the construction of the remaining 5 [[carbon-carbon bond]]s.\n\nReduction of the [[double bond]]s in '''13''' to '''14''' is accomplished with [[hydrogenation]] with [[palladium on carbon]] and that of the ketone groups to alcohol groups in '''15''' by [[sodium borohydride]]. Replacement of hydroxyl by [[chlorine]] in '''17''' via [[nucleophilic aliphatic substitution]] takes place through the dilactone '''16''' ([[tosyl chloride]]). The first C\u2013C bond forming reaction is a kind of [[Birch alkylation]] ([[lithium]], [[ammonia]]) with the immediate reaction product trapped with [[chloromethyl phenyl ether]],<ref name=Paquette/> the other chlorine atom in '''17''' is simply reduced. This temporary appendix will in a later stage prevent unwanted [[enolization]]. The newly formed [[ketone]] group then forms another C\u2013C bond by [[photochemical]] [[Norrish reaction]] to '''19''' whose alcohol group is induced to [[elimination reaction|eliminate]] with [[TsOH]] to [[alkene]] '''20'''.\n\n:{|align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:small\"\n|[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisPartV.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part V]]\n|valign=top |[[Image:DodecahedraneSynthesisPartVI.png|350px|Dodecahedrane synthesis part VI]]\n|-\n| Dodecahedrane synthesis part V||Dodecahedrane synthesis part VI\n|-\n|}\n\nThe double bond is reduced with [[hydrazine]] and sequential [[diisobutylaluminum hydride]] reduction and [[pyridinium chlorochromate]] oxidation of '''21''' forms the [[aldehyde]] '''22'''. A second Norrish reaction then adds another C\u2013C bond to alcohol '''23''' and having served its purpose the phenoxy tail is removed in several steps: a [[Birch reduction]] to diol '''24''', oxidation with [[pyridinium chlorochromate]] to ketoaldehyde '''25''' and a reverse [[Claisen condensation]] to ketone '''26'''. A third Norrish reaction produces alcohol '''27''' and a second [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] '''28''' and another reduction '''29''' at which point the synthesis is left completely without [[functional group]]s. The missing C-C bond is put in place by hydrogen pressurized [[dehydrogenation]] with [[palladium on carbon]] at 250&nbsp;\u00b0C to dodecahedrane '''30'''.\n\n===Pagodane route===\nIn Prinzbach's optimized route from pagodane to dodecahedrane, the original low-yielding isomerization of parent pagodane to dodecahedrane is replaced by a longer but higher yielding sequence - which nevertheless still relies heavily on pagodane derivatives.  In the scheme below, the divergence from the original happens after compound 16.\n\n:[[File:Optimized Dodecahedrane Synthesis en.png|thumb|left|800px|Optimized route to dodecahedrane]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Derivatives==\nA variety of dodecahedrane derivatives have been synthesized and reported in the literature. \n===Hydrogen substitution===\nSubstitution of all 20 hydrogens by [[fluorine]] atoms yields the relatively unstable [[perfluorododecahedrane]] C<sub>20</sub>F<sub>20</sub>, which was obtained in milligram quantities.  Trace amounts of the analogous  [[perchlorododecahedrane]] C<sub>20</sub>Cl<sub>20</sub> were obtained, among other partially chlorinated derivatives, by reacting {{chem2|C20H20}} dissolved in liquid [[chlorine]] under pressure at about 140&nbsp;\u00b0C and under intense light for five days.  Complete replacement by heavier [[halogen]]s seems increasingly difficult due to their larger size.  Half or more of the hydrogen atoms can be substituted by [[hydroxyl]] groups to yield [[polyols]], but the extreme compound C<sub>20</sub>(OH)<sub>20</sub> remained elusive as of 2006.<ref name=prinz20062/> Amino-dodecahedranes comparable to [[amantadine]] have been prepared, but were more toxic and with weaker antiviral effects.<ref>Weber JC, Paquette LA.

Those insertions are not chemically bonded to the caging compound, but merely mechanically trapped in it.  \n\nCross, Saunders and Prinzbach succeeded in encapsulating [[helium]] atoms in dodecahedrane by shooting ions He<sup>+</sup> at a film of the compound. They obtained [[microgram]] quantities of He@{{chem2|C20H20}} (the \"@\" being the standard notation for encapsulation), which they described as a quite stable substance.<ref name=cross/> The molecule has been described as \"the world's smallest [[helium balloon]]\".{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em\n |refs=\n<ref name=paquette1982>{{cite journal|title=Dodecahedrane\n|first1=Robert J.|last1= Ternansky|first2= Douglas W.|last2= Balogh|first3= Leo A.|last3= Paquette\n|journal=[[J.

After the mission is successful, his plane gets detached from the rest of the squadron due to bad weather. With low fuel, he is forced to go to China's [[Zhejiang Province]]. Due to malfunctioning autopilot, he is forced to fly the plane manually while his crew parachutes out and he jumps out in the last moment before the plane crashes.\n\nThe next day, his unconscious body is discovered by a local widow named Ying, who lives with her daughter Nunu weaving silk. She hides him in a nearby cave with the help of her childhood friend and village head Kai. Soon after, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (who already have captured and executed the rest of Jack's crew) come in search of Jack and capture the village, holding Kai at gunpoint to tell where the pilot is hiding. Kai refuses to do so and is executed. Nunu insists Ying to tell what she knows to her grandparents but Ying does not, remembering Kai's advice not to tell it to anyone. The next day, she goes to the cave with some food and seeing Jack conscious, leaves it there and returns promptly before he can confront her.\n\nThe Japanese army sends search patrols in the jungle and Ying is forced to bring Jack into her house. Although distant at first, Jack quickly befriends Nunu by whistling [[Yankee Doodle]] to her. Jack is able to convey to Ying that he has to go to [[Chongqing]] where the US Army base is. She hides him in the basement, while she to find a way to contact the Chinese guerrillas to get him a safe passage. One day, while Nunu is in her school, the IJA Captain Shimamoto comes into Ying's house and attempts to rape her, only to be shot in the head by Jack. They hide the body in the basement and as Jack consoles Ying, they form an intimate bond.\n\nIn school, Nunu accidentally  whistles Yankee Doodle which is noticed by her teacher. The teacher then rushes to Ying's house with Nunu and on confronting Jack, reveals that he is with the Chinese guerrillas. When Jack shows him the Captain's body, he tells Ying and Nunu to escape along with Jack, as the IJA will execute them once they find out. While they make their escape, the IJA find out the body and pursue the group after torching the village. They eventually catch up and fire on them and the teacher stays behind with a few guerrillas to slow them down, only to be killed while killing some back. As the group is only a few metres away from the escape boat, Ying is shot in the chest by a sniper. Devastated, Jack kills the sniper and barely escapes with Nunu and the rest of the guerrillas.\n\nIn Chongqing, he reports to General [[Jimmy Doolittle]], also expressing his wish to adopt Nunu.

After the mission is successful, his plane gets detached from the rest of the squadron due to bad weather. With low fuel, he is forced to go to China's [[Zhejiang Province]]. Due to malfunctioning autopilot, he is forced to fly the plane manually while his crew parachutes out and he jumps out in the last moment before the plane crashes.\n\nThe next day, his unconscious body is discovered by a local widow named Ying, who lives with her daughter Nunu weaving silk. She hides him in a nearby cave with the help of her childhood friend and village head Kai. Soon after, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (who already have captured and executed the rest of Jack's crew) come in search of Jack and capture the village, holding Kai at gunpoint to tell where the pilot is hiding. Kai refuses to do so and is executed. Nunu insists Ying to tell what she knows to her grandparents but Ying does not, remembering Kai's advice not to tell it to anyone. The next day, she goes to the cave with some food and seeing Jack conscious, leaves it there and returns promptly before he can confront her.\n\nThe Japanese army sends search patrols in the jungle and Ying is forced to bring Jack into her house. Although distant at first, Jack quickly befriends Nunu by whistling [[Yankee Doodle]] to her. Jack is able to convey to Ying that he has to go to [[Chongqing]] where the US Army base is. She hides him in the basement, while she to find a way to contact the Chinese guerrillas to get him a safe passage. One day, while Nunu is in her school, the IJA Captain Shimamoto comes into Ying's house and attempts to rape her, only to be shot in the head by Jack. They hide the body in the basement and as Jack consoles Ying, they form an intimate bond.\n\nIn school, Nunu accidentally  whistles Yankee Doodle which is noticed by her teacher. The teacher then rushes to Ying's house with Nunu and on confronting Jack, reveals that he is with the Chinese guerrillas. When Jack shows him the Captain's body, he tells Ying and Nunu to escape along with Jack, as the IJA will execute them once they find out. While they make their escape, the IJA find out the body and pursue the group after torching the village. They eventually catch up and fire on them and the teacher stays behind with a few guerrillas to slow them down, only to be killed while killing some back. As the group is only a few metres away from the escape boat, Ying is shot in the chest by a sniper. Devastated, Jack kills the sniper and barely escapes with Nunu and the rest of the guerrillas.\n\nIn Chongqing, he reports to General [[Jimmy Doolittle]], also expressing his wish to adopt Nunu. The General rejects it by saying that Jack cannot be a soldier and her father at the same time. Instead, Nunu will be given to a Chinese family living in [[Los Angeles]]. Jack reluctantly accepts and bids Nunu a tearful goodbye. 50 years later, an elderly Jack writes a letter to a grown-up Nunu saying that he was truly in love with her mother and despite missing her everyday, he has come to peace with himself.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Liu Yifei]] as Ying\n*[[Emile Hirsch]] as Jack\n*Li Fangcong as Nunu\n*[[Yan Yikuan]] as Kai\n*Yu Shaoqun as teacher\n*Tsukagoshi Hirotaka as Captain Shimamoto\n*[[Vincent Riotta]] as [[Jimmy Doolittle]]\n*[[Gong Hanlin]] as Ying's father-in-law\n*Jin Zhu as Ying's mother-in-law\n*[[Gallen Lo]] as Captain Xu\n*Gong Tiankuo as Lieutenant Sun\n*Shu Yaoxuan as hawker\n*[[Vivian Wu]] as elderly Nunu (the character did not appear in the final cut of the film but was credited with a special acknowledgment.)\n\n==Release==\nThe film was released in [[China]] (10 November 2017), the [[United States]] (2 November 2018) and [[France]] (14 November 2018).
