Lansdale]].  Hall plays a man who kills a burglar, whose father (Shepard) subsequently seeks revenge.  The plot is further complicated when a private investigator (Johnson) shows up.\n\nThe project had a long gestation, and production did not begin until seven years after Mickle read the novel.  Mickle and Damici had previously written about feminist themes in ''[[We Are What We Are (2013 film)|We Are What We Are]]'' (2013) and wanted to cover more masculine themes.  Filming took place over 25 days in the [[Hudson Valley]] area of [[New York (state)|New York]].  It premiered at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]].  [[IFC Films]] theatrically released the film in North America on May 23, 2014, where it grossed $427,418.  The film is \"Certified Fresh\" at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and has an approval rating of 85%. It was released on DVD on September 30, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nAnn Dane, startled by the sound of a door window breaking, wakes her husband, Richard.  He accidentally shoots the intruder, identified as Freddy Russell, a wanted felon.  Richard is shaken by the experience.  Richard visits the cemetery on the day of Freddy's burial where Freddy's father, Ben\u2014a paroled convict\u2014accosts Richard in his car, making a veiled reference to Richard's son, Jordan.  Alarmed, Richard picks up Jordan from school and arranges for Ann to meet them at the police station.  Though Ben follows him to his son's school, the police decline Richard's request for help.  However, when the Danes arrive home to find their front door broken in, the family is put under police protection.\n\nPolice are posted around the house, including one guard inside, hoping to catch Ben when he returns.  It turns out that Ben never left and has been hiding in the house's crawlspace since the initial break-in. He emerges and knocks out the guard, goes into Jordan's room, and locks the door. When Richard is alerted to Ben's presence inside the house by the sound of water dripping from the open crawlspace hatch, he alerts the observing police and breaks down Jordan's bedroom door.  Ben has already escaped out the window and to a nearby river, however, and is tracked to Mexico\u2014where he is apprehended.  The police invite Richard to the station to close the case, and, while there, Richard notices a wanted poster for \"Frederick Russell\", who looks different from the man he shot.  Richard repeatedly attempts to point out the contradiction to officer Ray Price, but Ray dismisses this as a trick of memory due to shock and refuses to discuss the issue.\n\nRichard sees Ben taken away in an unmarked police car, which he follows.  He sees the police forcibly remove Ben from the car, and inject him with an unknown substance, splash him with alcohol, and leave him on train tracks to die.  Richard saves Ben from an approaching train.  Ben at first does not believe Richard's claims that the man he shot was not Freddy.  The two exhume Freddy's grave and Ben confirms that the body In the coffin is not his son.  Ben notes that the man's finger tips have been cut off to prevent identification.\n\nRay Price visits Richard at work and claims that Freddy changed his appearance to avoid capture, explaining the discrepancy in the wanted poster. Richard is visited by Jim Bob Luke\u2014a  private investigator known by Ben\u2014who says the name Fred Russell is tied to several widely circulated news stories about the killing of a burglar.  Jim theorizes that after Freddy became involved with the [[Dixie Mafia]], he was caught by Federal investigators, who faked Freddy's death and placed him in Witness Protection in exchange for information.\n\nJim, Richard, and Ben learn that Freddy might be living in [[Houston]] under the name \"Frank Miller\".  When they attempt to meet him at his new home, they instead find a number of home videos which turn out to be [[snuff film]]s, one of which features Freddy Russell beating a woman to death with a baseball bat.  Richard wants to take the tape to the police.  Jim believes the police already know about the videos but are unconcerned because Freddy is far more valuable as an informant against the Dixie Mafia while the victims are illegal immigrants whom few will miss.  Ben is so enraged by his sons actions that he is resolved to kill him at any cost.\n\nThey track Freddy to a remote mansion where he and his associates are making another snuff film.  They infiltrate the mansion and begin killing everyone they encounter.  When Freddy is the last survivor, Ben hesitates to kill him, and Jim is shot.  Freddy shoots both Richard and Ben before Ben finally wounds him.  Ben declares himself as Freddy's father, shoots his son in the head, and dies from his own wounds shortly after.  Jim and Richard set the mansion ablaze and escape with the hostage.  The next morning Richard returns home to his family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael C.

The first draft of the script, a verbatim copy of the novel, was 220 pages long; from there, Mickle and Damici edited the script down to a more manageable size.  The final script was also the furthest from the novel, but they felt it was closest in spirit.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-sundance-2014-cold-in-july-main-stage-20140118,0,5742103.story| title=Sundance 2014: 'Cold In July' Jumps Genre Onto Fest's Main Stage| last=Olsen| first=Mark| work=[[Los Angeles Times]]| date=January 18, 2014| accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>  Lansdale said that he saw all the revisions of the script except for the last and \"felt respected through the entire process.\"<ref name=den>{{cite web | last=Buxton| first=Marc| title=Cold in July Author Joe R.

Eventually, they were able to edit it down by removing unnecessary dialog that could be replaced through body language.  Changing the time period was never considered, as Mickle considered the themes of masculinity and manhood to come from a previous era that would not work in a more modern setting.<ref name=fearnet/>  Shepard also contributed to the script.  Mickle and Damici had struggled with one particularly difficult scene and debated removing it entirely.  When Shepard offered to rewrite it, Mickle gratefully accepted.  Shepard returned with a single typewritten page and offered to run it by Damici, but Mickle said it was not necessary and accepted it as-is.<ref name=paste/>\n\nMickle and Damici were drawn to Lansdale's cross-genre style, as their own films were also cross-genre.  Although primarily known for their work in horror films, Damici and Mickle said that they were more interested in storytelling and making good films, and Damici said that they can return to making horror films at any time.<ref name=latimes/>  Mickle used Hall's character to ground the film so that audiences would not feel lost as the film crossed genres.  Mickle wanted to avoid obvious genre categorization and predictability, as he felt that genre films needed to be shaken up.  Buyers had previously encouraged him to re-cut one of his films so that audiences could easily identify the genre, limited to six subgenres, in the first ten minutes.  Mickle said their advice \"blew [his] mind\".<ref name=fearnet/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn September 2013, Sam Shepard, Don Johnson, and Vinessa Shaw joined Michael C.

''Cold in July'' was filmed after ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' ended, and Hall was drawn to the role based on his desire to play a more normal character; Hall called the role therapeutic, as it allowed him to move on from playing the iconic serial killer [[Dexter Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/michael-c-hall-moves-on-from-dexter-with-a-new-killer-role| title=Michael C.

Lansdale]].  Hall plays a man who kills a burglar, whose father (Shepard) subsequently seeks revenge.  The plot is further complicated when a private investigator (Johnson) shows up.\n\nThe project had a long gestation, and production did not begin until seven years after Mickle read the novel.  Mickle and Damici had previously written about feminist themes in ''[[We Are What We Are (2013 film)|We Are What We Are]]'' (2013) and wanted to cover more masculine themes.  Filming took place over 25 days in the [[Hudson Valley]] area of [[New York (state)|New York]].  It premiered at the [[2014 Sundance Film Festival]].  [[IFC Films]] theatrically released the film in North America on May 23, 2014, where it grossed $427,418.  The film is \"Certified Fresh\" at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and has an approval rating of 85%. It was released on DVD on September 30, 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nAnn Dane, startled by the sound of a door window breaking, wakes her husband, Richard.  He accidentally shoots the intruder, identified as Freddy Russell, a wanted felon.  Richard is shaken by the experience.  Richard visits the cemetery on the day of Freddy's burial where Freddy's father, Ben\u2014a paroled convict\u2014accosts Richard in his car, making a veiled reference to Richard's son, Jordan.  Alarmed, Richard picks up Jordan from school and arranges for Ann to meet them at the police station.  Though Ben follows him to his son's school, the police decline Richard's request for help.  However, when the Danes arrive home to find their front door broken in, the family is put under police protection.\n\nPolice are posted around the house, including one guard inside, hoping to catch Ben when he returns.  It turns out that Ben never left and has been hiding in the house's crawlspace since the initial break-in. He emerges and knocks out the guard, goes into Jordan's room, and locks the door. When Richard is alerted to Ben's presence inside the house by the sound of water dripping from the open crawlspace hatch, he alerts the observing police and breaks down Jordan's bedroom door.  Ben has already escaped out the window and to a nearby river, however, and is tracked to Mexico\u2014where he is apprehended.  The police invite Richard to the station to close the case, and, while there, Richard notices a wanted poster for \"Frederick Russell\", who looks different from the man he shot.  Richard repeatedly attempts to point out the contradiction to officer Ray Price, but Ray dismisses this as a trick of memory due to shock and refuses to discuss the issue.\n\nRichard sees Ben taken away in an unmarked police car, which he follows.  He sees the police forcibly remove Ben from the car, and inject him with an unknown substance, splash him with alcohol, and leave him on train tracks to die.  Richard saves Ben from an approaching train.  Ben at first does not believe Richard's claims that the man he shot was not Freddy.  The two exhume Freddy's grave and Ben confirms that the body In the coffin is not his son.  Ben notes that the man's finger tips have been cut off to prevent identification.\n\nRay Price visits Richard at work and claims that Freddy changed his appearance to avoid capture, explaining the discrepancy in the wanted poster. Richard is visited by Jim Bob Luke\u2014a  private investigator known by Ben\u2014who says the name Fred Russell is tied to several widely circulated news stories about the killing of a burglar.  Jim theorizes that after Freddy became involved with the [[Dixie Mafia]], he was caught by Federal investigators, who faked Freddy's death and placed him in Witness Protection in exchange for information.\n\nJim, Richard, and Ben learn that Freddy might be living in [[Houston]] under the name \"Frank Miller\".  When they attempt to meet him at his new home, they instead find a number of home videos which turn out to be [[snuff film]]s, one of which features Freddy Russell beating a woman to death with a baseball bat.  Richard wants to take the tape to the police.  Jim believes the police already know about the videos but are unconcerned because Freddy is far more valuable as an informant against the Dixie Mafia while the victims are illegal immigrants whom few will miss.  Ben is so enraged by his sons actions that he resolves to kill Freddy at any cost.\n\nThey track Freddy to a remote mansion where he and his associates are making another snuff film.  They infiltrate the mansion and begin killing everyone they encounter.  When Freddy is the last survivor, Ben hesitates to kill him, and Jim is shot.  Freddy shoots both Richard and Ben before Ben finally wounds him.  Ben declares himself as Freddy's father, shoots his son in the head, and dies from his own wounds shortly after.  Jim and Richard set the mansion ablaze and escape with the hostage.  The next morning Richard returns home to his family.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael C.

The first draft of the script, a verbatim copy of the novel, was 220 pages long; from there, Mickle and Damici edited the script down to a more manageable size.

Eventually, they were able to edit it down by removing unnecessary dialog that could be replaced through body language.  Changing the time period was never considered, as Mickle considered the themes of masculinity and manhood to come from a previous era that would not work in a more modern setting.<ref name=fearnet/>  Shepard also contributed to the script.  Mickle and Damici had struggled with one particularly difficult scene and debated removing it entirely.  When Shepard offered to rewrite it, Mickle gratefully accepted.  Shepard returned with a single typewritten page and offered to run it by Damici, but Mickle said it was not necessary and accepted it as-is.<ref name=paste/>\n\nMickle and Damici were drawn to Lansdale's cross-genre style, as their own films were also cross-genre.  Although primarily known for their work in horror films, Damici and Mickle said that they were more interested in storytelling and making good films, and Damici said that they can return to making horror films at any time.<ref name=latimes/>  Mickle used Hall's character to ground the film so that audiences would not feel lost as the film crossed genres.  Mickle wanted to avoid obvious genre categorization and predictability, as he felt that genre films needed to be shaken up.  Buyers had previously encouraged him to re-cut one of his films so that audiences could easily identify the genre, limited to six subgenres, in the first ten minutes.  Mickle said their advice \"blew [his] mind\".<ref name=fearnet/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nIn September 2013, Sam Shepard, Don Johnson, and Vinessa Shaw joined Michael C. Hall, who had already been cast.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/shepard-johnson-shaw-join-cold-in-july-exclusive-1200597423/| title=Shepard, Johnson, Shaw Join 'Cold in July' (Exclusive)| last=Hopewell| first=John| work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]| date=September 3, 2013| accessdate=February 3, 2014}}</ref>  Because he played a killer on ''Dexter'', Hall said that the script quieted any concerns he had about being typecast.  ''Cold in July'' was filmed after ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' ended, and Hall was drawn to the role based on his desire to play a more normal character; Hall called the role therapeutic, as it allowed him to move on from playing the iconic serial killer [[Dexter Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/erinlarosa/michael-c-hall-moves-on-from-dexter-with-a-new-killer-role| title=Michael C.

Hall further impressed Mickle with his off-screen personality, which was surprisingly normal and completely unlike his TV characters.<ref name=fearnet>{{cite web | url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/exclusive-interview-jim-mickles-cold-july-shakes-sundance-competition| title=Exclusive Interview: Jim Mickle's 'Cold in July' Shakes Up Sundance Competition| last=Tellerico| first=Brian| work=[[Fearnet]]| date=January 21, 2014| accessdate=January 23, 2014}}</ref>  Once Hall had been cast, Mickle said that the rest of the casting \"fell in place from there.\"<ref name=paste>{{cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/01/sundance-preview-director-jeff-mickle-on-cold-in-j.html| title=Sundance Preview: Director Jeff Mickle on ''Cold in July''| last=Dunaway| first=Michael| work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]| date=January 18, 2014| accessdate=February 3, 2014}}</ref>  Mickle had reached out to Shepard seven years earlier but heard that Shepard was retiring from acting.

Under conditions of backwardness, the spur of money and the accumulation of wealth has led to a massive growth in industry and technology. [...] It seems an odd argument to say that a capitalist will only be efficient in producing use-value of a good quality when trying to make more money than the next capitalist. It would seem easier to rely on the planning of use-values in a rational way, which because there is no duplication, would be produced more cheaply and be of a higher quality. [...] Although money, and so monetary calculation, will disappear in socialism this does not mean that there will no longer be any need to make choices, evaluations and calculations. [...] Wealth will be produced and distributed in its natural form of useful things, of objects that can serve to satisfy some human need or other. Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value. In socialism their value, in the normal non-economic sense of the word, will not be their selling price nor the time needed to produce them but their usefulness.

Engels wrote about this at length in the book ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'', which was based on the unpublished notes of Marx on the work of [[Lewis Henry Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/origin-of-the-family-engels-morgan.htm|author=Rob Sewell|title=Origin of the Family: In Defence of Engels and Morgan|publisher=Marxist.com|date=December 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nValues of ''socialism'' have roots in pre-capitalist institutions such as the religious communes, reciprocal obligations, and communal charity of Mediaeval Europe, the development of its economic theory primarily reflects and responds to the monumental changes brought about by the dissolution of feudalism and the emergence of specifically capitalist social relations.<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel ''Historical Capitalism''</ref> As such it is commonly regarded as a movement belonging to the modern era. Many socialists have considered their advocacy as the preservation and extension of the radical humanist ideas expressed in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] doctrine such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''Discourse on Inequality'', [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s ''Limits of State Action'', or [[Immanuel Kant]]'s insistent defense of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Chomsky, Noam ''Perspectives on Power''</ref>\n\n[[Capitalism]] appeared in mature form as a result of the problems raised when an industrial factory system requiring long-term investment and entailing corresponding risks was introduced into an internationalized commercial (mercantilist) framework. Historically speaking, the most pressing needs of this new system were an assured supply of the elements of industry (land, elaborate machinery, and labour) and these imperatives led to the [[commodification]] of these elements.<ref>[[Karl Polanyi]] ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies''.</ref>\n\nAccording to influential socialist economic historian [[Karl Polanyi]]'s classic account, the forceful transformation of land, money and especially labour into commodities to be allocated by an autonomous market mechanism was an alien and inhuman rupture of the pre-existing social fabric. Marx had viewed the process in a similar light, referring to it as part of the process of \"primitive accumulation\" whereby enough initial capital is amassed to begin capitalist production. The dislocation that Polyani and others describe, triggered natural counter-movements in efforts to re-embed the economy in society.  These counter-movements, that included, for example, the [[Luddite]] rebellions, are the incipient socialist movements. Over time such movements gave birth to or acquired an array of intellectual defenders who attempted to develop their ideas in theory.\n\nAs Polanyi noted, these counter-movements were mostly reactive and therefore not full-fledged socialist movements. Some demands went no further than a wish to mitigate the capitalist market's worst effects. Later, a full socialist program developed, arguing for systemic transformation. Its theorists believed that even if markets and private property could be tamed so as not to be excessively \"exploitative\", or crises could be effectively mitigated, capitalist social relations would remain significantly unjust and anti-democratic, suppressing  universal human needs for fulfilling, empowering and creative work, diversity and solidarity.\n\nWithin this context, socialism has undergone four periods: the first in the 19th century was a period of utopian visions (1780s\u20131850s); then occurred the rise of revolutionary socialist and communist movements in the 19th century as the primary opposition to the rise of corporations and industrialization (1830\u20131916); the polarisation of socialism around the question of the [[Soviet Union]] and adoption of socialist or social democratic policies in response (1916\u20131989); and the response of socialism in the [[neoliberal]] era (1970s\u2013present). As socialism developed, so did the socialist system of economics.\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\nThe first theories which came to hold the term \"socialism\" began to be formulated in the late 18th century and were termed \"socialism\" early in the 19th century. The central beliefs of the socialism of this period rested on the exploitation of those who labored by those who owned capital or rented land and housing. The abject misery, poverty and disease to which laboring classes seemed destined was the inspiration for a series of schools of thought which argued that life under a class of masters or \"capitalists\", as they were then becoming to be called, would consist of working classes being driven down to subsistence wages (see the [[iron law of wages]]).\n\nSocialist ideas found expression in utopian movements, which often formed agricultural communes aimed at being self-sufficient on the land. These included many religious movements, such as the [[Christian socialism]] of the [[Shakers]] in America and the [[Hutterites]]. The [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[kibbutz]]im and [[commune]]s of the [[counterculture]] are also manifestations of utopian socialist ideas.\n\n[[Utopian socialism]] had little to offer in terms of a systematic theory of economic phenomena{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. In theory, economic problems were dissolved by a utopian society which had transcended material scarcity. In practice, small communities with a common spirit could sometimes resolve allocation problems.\n\n=== Socialism and classical political economy ===\nThe first organized theories of socialist economics were significantly impacted by classical economic theory, including elements in [[Adam Smith]], [[Robert Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]]. In Smith there is a conception of a common good not provided by the market, a [[class analysis]], a concern for the dehumanizing aspects of the factory system, and the concept of rent as being [[Productive and unproductive labour|unproductive]]. Ricardo argued that the renting class was parasitic. This, and the possibility of a \"[[general glut]]\", an over accumulation of capital to produce goods for sale rather than for use, became the foundation of a rising critique of the concept that free markets with competition would be sufficient to prevent disastrous downturns in the economy, and whether the need for expansion would inevitably lead to war.\n\n=== Socialist political economy before Marx ===\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential early French socialist thinker]]\nA key early socialist theorist of political economy was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. He was the most well-known of nineteenth century [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] theorists and the first thinker to refer to himself as an anarchist. Others were: [[Technocrats]] like Henri de Saint-Simon, [[agrarianism|agrarian]] radicals like [[Thomas Spence]], [[William Ogilvie of Pittensear|William Ogilvie]] and [[William Cobbett]]; anti-capitalists like [[Thomas Hodgskin]]; [[communitarian]] and [[utopian]] socialists like [[Robert Owen]], [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] and [[Charles Fourier]]; anti-market socialists like [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]] and [[John Francis Bray]]; the [[Christian mutualism|Christian mutualist]] [[William Batchelder Greene]]; as well as the theorists of the [[Chartist movement]] and early proponents of [[syndicalism]].<ref>Noel Thomson ''The Real Rights of Man: Political Economies for the Working Class 1775\u20131850'', 1998, Pluto Press</ref>\n\nThe first advocates of socialism promoted social leveling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based upon individual talent.

Marx transformed the [[labor theory of value]], which had been worked upon by [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]], into his  \"[[law of value]]\", and used it for the purpose of revealing how [[commodity fetishism]] obscures the reality of capitalist society.\n\nHis approach, which [[Friedrich Engels]] would call \"[[scientific socialism]]\", would stand as the branching point in economic theory. In one direction went those who rejected the capitalist system as fundamentally anti-social, arguing that it could never be harnessed to effectively realize the fullest development of human potentialities wherein \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougdowd.org/NewFiles/articles/lebowitzhi.html|title=Karl Marx: The Needs of Capital vs. The Needs of Human Beings|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218151908/http://dougdowd.org/NewFiles/articles/lebowitzhi.html |archivedate=February 18, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMarx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'' is an incomplete work of economic theory; he had planned four volumes but completed two and left his collaborator Engels to complete the third. In many ways, the work is modelled on Smith's ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', seeking to be a comprehensive logical description of production, consumption, and finance in relation to morality and the state. The work of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, and economics includes the following topics:\n* [[Law of value]]: capitalist production is the production of \"an immense multitude of commodities\" or generalised commodity production. A commodity has two essential qualities firstly, they are useful, they satisfy some human want, \"the nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference\"<ref name=\"marxists1\">{{cite web|author=Karl Marx |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm |title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter One |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> and secondly they are sold on a market or exchanged. Critically the exchange value of a commodity \"is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities\".<ref name=\"marxists1\"/> However, rather depends on the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it. All commodities are sold at their value, so the origin of the capitalist profit is not in cheating or theft, but in the fact that the cost of reproduction of labour power, or the worker's wage, is less than the value created during their time at work, enabling the capitalists to yield a surplus value or profit on their investments.\n* Historical property relations: historical capitalism represents a process of momentous social upheaval where rural masses were separated from the land and ownership of the [[means of production]] by force, deprivation, and legal manipulation, creating an urban [[proletariat]] based on the institution of [[wage-labour]]. Moreover, capitalist property relations aggravated the artificial separation between city and country, which is a key factor in accounting for the [[metabolic rift]] between human beings in capitalism and their natural environment, which is at the root of our current ecological dilemmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/0902foster.htm |title=Capitalism and Ecology: The Nature of the Contradiction |publisher=Monthlyreview.org |date= September 2002|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Commodity fetishism]]: Marx adapted previous value-theory to show that in capitalism phenomena involved with the price system (markets, competition, supply and demand) constitute a powerful ideology that obscures the underlying social relations of capitalist society. \"Commodity fetishism\" refers to this distortion of appearance. The underlying social reality is one of economic exploitation.\n* [[Exploitation of labour|Economic exploitation]]: workers are the fundamental creative source of new value. Property relations affording the right of usufruct and despotic control of the workplace to capitalists are the devices by which the [[surplus value]] created by workers is appropriated by the capitalists.\n* [[Capital accumulation]]: inherent to capitalism is the incessant drive to accumulate as a response to the competitive forces acting upon all capitalists. In such a context the accumulated wealth which is the source of the capitalist's social power derives itself from being able to repeat the circuit of Money\u2192Commodity\u2192Money, where the capitalist receives an increment or \"surplus value\" higher than their initial investment, as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Moreover, this driving imperative leads capitalism to its expansion on a worldwide scale.\n* Crises: Marx identified natural and historically specific (i.e. structural) barriers to accumulation that were interrelated and interpenetrated one another in times of crises. Different types of crises, such as realization crises and overproduction crises, are expressions of capitalism's inability to constructively overcome such barriers. Moreover, the upshot of crises is increased centralization, the expropriation of the many capitalists by the few.\n* Centralization: the interacting forces of competition, endemic crises, intensive and extensive expansion of the scale of production, and a growing interdependency with the state apparatus, all promote a strong developmental tendency towards the centralization of capital.\n* Material development: as a result of its constant drive to optimize profitability by increasing the [[productivity]] of labour, typically by revolutionizing technology and production techniques, capitalism develops so as to progressively reduce the objective need for work, suggesting the potential for a new era of creative forms of work and expanded scope for leisure.\n* Socialization and the pre-conditions for social revolution: by socializing the labour process, concentrating workers into urban settings in large-scale production processes and linking them in a worldwide market, the agents of a potential revolutionary change are created. Thus Marx felt that in the course of its development capitalism was at the same time developing the preconditions for its own negation. However, although the objective conditions for change are generated by the capitalist system itself, the subjective conditions for social revolution can only come about through the apprehension of the objective circumstances by the agents themselves and the transformation of such understanding into an effective revolutionary program.<ref>Petras, James and Veltmeyer, Henry ''Globalization Unmasked: Imperialism in the 21st Century''</ref>\n\n=== Anarchist economics ===\n{{main|Anarchist economics}}\n[[Anarchist economics]] is the set of theories and practices of [[economics]] and economic activity within the political philosophy of [[anarchism]].\n\n[[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe [[Mutualism (economic theory)|his own teachings]].<ref>Woodcock, George.

In most socialist theories, economic planning only applies to the [[factors of production]] and not to the allocation of goods and services produced for consumption, which would be distributed through a market.

A socialist form of organization would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals.<ref name=\"The Political Economy of Socialism, 1982.

The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organization; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labor.

Many different proposals for socialist economic systems call for a type of mixed economy, where multiple forms of ownership over the means of production co-exist with one another.\n* Public enterprise employee managed market economies, another form of [[market socialism]] in which publicly owned, employee-managed production units engage in free market exchange of goods and services with one another as well as with final consumers, e.g. mid twentieth century Yugoslavia, Two more theoretical models are [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]'s [[Progressive Utilization Theory]] and [[Economic democracy]].\n* Public enterprise participatory planning, an economy featuring social ownership of the means of production with allocation based on an integration of decentralized democratic planning, e.g. [[stateless communism]], [[libertarian socialism]]. An incipient historical forebear is that of Catalonia during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]]. More developed theoretical models include those of [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Participatory Economics]], [[Inclusive Democracy]] and the negotiated coordination model of [[Pat Devine]], as well as in [[Cornelius Castoriadis]]'s pamphlet \"Workers' Councils and the Economics of a Self-Managed Society\".<ref>{{cite web|author=rasputin@point-of-departure.org |url=http://www.lust-for-life.org/Lust-For-Life/WorkersCouncilsAndEconomics/WorkersCouncilsAndEconomics.htm |title=Workers' Councils and the Economics of a Self-Managed Society |publisher=Lust-for-life.org |date=2006-11-05 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\n[[J\u00e1nos Kornai]] identifies five distinct types of socialism:\n* Classical/Marxist conception, where socialism is a stage of economic development in which wage labour, private property in the means of production and monetary relations have been made redundant through the development of the productive forces, so that capital accumulation has been superseded by [[economic planning]]. Economic planning in this definition means conscious allocation of economic inputs and the means of production by the associated producers to directly maximise use-values as opposed to exchange-values, in contrast to the \"anarchy of production\" of capitalism.\n* Walrasian/Market Socialist which defines socialism as public-ownership or cooperative-enterprises in a market economy, with prices for producer goods set through a trial-and-error method by a central planning board. In this view, socialism is defined in terms of de jure public property rights over major enterprises.\n* Leninist conception, which includes a form of political organisation based on control of the means of production and government by a single political party apparatus that claims to act in the interest of the working class, and an ideology hostile toward markets and political dissent, with coordination of economic activity through centralised economic planning (a \"command economy\").\n* Social democratic concept, based on the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], which defines socialism as a set of values rather than a specific type of social and economic organisation. It includes unconditional support for parliamentary democracy, gradual and reformist attempts to establish socialism and support for socially progressive causes. Social democrats are not opposed to the market or private property; instead they try to ameliorate the effects of capitalism through a welfare state, which relies on the market as the fundamental coordinating entity in the economy and a degree of public ownership/public provision of public goods in an economy otherwise dominated by private enterprise.\n* East Asian model, or [[socialist market economy]], based on a largely free-market, capital accumulation for profit and substantial private ownership along with state-ownership of strategic industries monopolised by a single political party. J\u00e1nos Kornai ultimately leaves the classification of this model (as either socialist or capitalist) to the reader.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bm.ust.hk/~ced/iea/Hong_Kong_Yingyinek_kikuldott_05june2.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183831/http://www.bm.ust.hk/~ced/iea/Hong_Kong_Yingyinek_kikuldott_05june2.doc |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSocialism can be divided into market socialism and planned socialism based on their dominant mechanism of resource allocation. Another distinction can be made between the type of property structures of different socialist systems (public, [[cooperative]] or [[Common ownership|common]]) and on the dominant form of economic management within the economy (hierarchical or [[Self-managed economy|self-managed]]).\n\n=== Economic democracy ===\n[[Economic democracy]] is a model of market socialism primarily developed by the American economist [[David Schweickart]]. In Schweickart's model, enterprises and natural resources are owned by society in the form of public banking, and management is elected by the workers within each firm. Profits would be distributed among the workers of the respective enterprise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schweickart|first=David |title=After Capitalism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWy9JbWvjywC&pg=PA156&dq=%22Economic+Democracy+is+a+market+economy.+Hence+stimulating+consumer+demand+is+in+the+immediate+interest+of+every+enterprise%22&hl=en&ei=ADzZTePwLMiZOoSFweEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Economic%20Democracy%20is%20a%20market%20economy.%20Hence%20stimulating%20consumer%20demand%20is%20in%20the%20immediate%20interest%20of%20every%20enterprise%22&f=false|date=July 23, 2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|chapter=Chapter 5: Economic Democracy: Why We Need It; 5.7: Ecology, p. 156}}</ref>\n\n=== Lange\u2013Lerner model ===\nThe [[Lange model|Lange\u2013Lerner model]] involves public ownership of the means of production and the utilization of a trial-and-error approach to achieving equilibrium prices by a central planning board. The Central Planning Board would be responsible for setting prices through a trial-and-error approach to establish equilibrium prices, effectively acting as the abstract ''Walrasian auctioneer'' in Walrasian economics. Managers of the state-owned firms would be instructed to set prices to equal marginal cost (P=MC), so that economic equilibrium and [[Pareto efficiency]] would be achieved. The Lange model was expanded upon by the American economist [[Abba Lerner]] and became known as the Lange\u2013Lerner theorem, particularly the role of the social dividend. Forerunners of the Lange model include the neoclassical economists [[Enrico Barone]] and [[Fred M. Taylor]].\n\n=== Self-managed economy ===\nThe [[self-managed economy]] is a form of socialism where enterprises are owned and managed by their employees, effectively negating the employer-employee (or [[wage labor]]) dynamic of capitalism and emphasizing the opposition to [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], self-managing and cooperative aspect of socialism. Members of cooperative firms are relatively free to manage their own affairs and work schedules. This model was developed most extensively by the Yugoslav economists [[Branko Horvat]], [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and the American economist Benjamin Ward.\n\n=== Worker self-directed enterprise ===\n[[Workers' self-management|Worker self-directed enterprise]] is a recent proposal advocated by the American [[Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]]. This model shares many similarities with the model of socialist self-management in that employees own and direct their enterprises, but places a greater role on democratically elected management within a market economy.\n\n=== Democratic planned socialism ===\nDemocratic planned socialism is a form of [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planned economy]].<ref name=\"Democratic Planned Socialism, 2002\">{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Al|title=Democratic Planned Socialism: Feasible Economic Procedures|journal=Science & Society|date=March 2002|volume=66|issue=1|pages=29\u201342|doi=10.1521/siso.66.1.29.21009|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/586a7aeeaa92eb204314dd0390e7644ab378a76b}}</ref>\n\n=== Feasible socialism ===\nFeasible socialism was the name [[Alec Nove]] gave his outline for socialism in his work ''The Economics of Feasible Socialism''. According to Nove, this model of socialism is \"feasible\" because it can be realized within the lifetime of anyone living today. It involves a combination of publicly owned and centrally directed enterprises for large-scale industries, autonomous publicly owned enterprises, consumer and worker-owned cooperatives for the majority of the economy, and private ownership for small businesses. It is a market-based mixed economy that includes a substantial role for macroeconomic interventionism and indicative economic planning.<ref>{{cite book|last= Nove|first= Alec|title= The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited|publisher= Routledge|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0043350492|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove}}</ref>\n\n=== Pragmatic market socialism ===\nThe American economist James Yunker detailed a model where social ownership of the means of production is achieved the same way private ownership is achieved in modern capitalism through the shareholder system that separates management functions from ownership. Yunker posits that social ownership can be achieved by having a public body, designated the Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO), owning the shares of publicly listed firms without affecting market-based allocation of capital inputs. Yunker termed this model pragmatic market socialism because it does not require massive changes to society and would leave the existing management system intact, and would be at least as efficient as modern-day capitalism while providing superior social outcomes as public ownership of large and established enterprises would enable profits to be distributed among the entire population in a social dividend rather than going largely to a class of inheriting [[Economic rent|rentiers]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Yunker|first= James|title= Socialism Revised and Modernized: The Case for Pragmatic Market Socialism|publisher= Praeger|date= April 1992|isbn= 978-0275941345|pages= [https://archive.org/details/socialismrevised00yunk/page/29 29\u201331]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/socialismrevised00yunk/page/29}}</ref>\n\n=== Participatory economy ===\n[[Participatory economics]] utilizes participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society.\n\n=== Computer-managed allocation ===\nProposals for utilizing computer-based coordination and information technology for the coordination and optimization of resource allocation (also known as [[cybernetics]]) within an economy have been outlined by various socialists, economists and computer scientists, including [[Oskar Lange]], the Soviet engineer [[Viktor Glushkov]], and more recently [[Paul Cockshott]] and Allin Cottrell.\n\n=== Peer-to-peer economy and open source ===\nThe \"networked information age\" has enabled the development and emergence of new forms of organizing the production of value in non-market arrangements that have been termed [[commons-based peer production]] along with the negation of ownership and the concept of property in the development of software in the form of [[open source]] and [[open design]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Schmitt and Anton|first= Richard and Anatole |title= Taking Socialism Seriously|publisher= Lexington Books|date=March 2012|isbn= 978-0739166352|page = 160|quote=Commons-based peer production bears a close family resemblance to the familiar vision of socialism sketched in the first paragraph of this chapter\u2026In commons-based peer production a critical mass of inputs, and all outputs, are distributed within information networks as free goods rather than as commodities to be sold for profit by capitalist firms.}}</ref>\n\n=== Negotiated coordination ===\nEconomist [[Pat Devine]] has created a model of coordination called \"negotiated coordination\", which is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved, with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gesd.free.fr/devine.pdf |title=Participatory Planning Through Negotiated Coordination |date= |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Elements of socialism in practice ==\nAlthough a number of economic systems have existed with various socialist attributes, or have been deemed socialist by their proponents, almost all of the economic systems listed below have largely retained elements of capitalism such as [[wage labor]], the [[accumulation of capital]], and [[commodity]] production. Nonetheless, various elements of a socialist economy have been implemented or experimented with in various economies throughout history.\n\nVarious forms of socialist organizational attributes have existed as minor modes of production within the context of a capitalist economy throughout history\u2014examples of this include [[Worker co-operative|cooperative enterprises]] in a capitalist economy, and the emerging free-software movement based on social [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer production]].\n\n=== Centrally planned economies ===\nA centrally planned economy combines public ownership of the means of production with [[Planned economy#Planned versus command economies|centralized state planning]]. This model is usually associated with the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type command economy]]. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. In the early years of Soviet central planning, the planning process was based upon a selected number of physical flows with inputs mobilized to meet explicit production targets measured in natural or technical units. This [[Material balance planning|material balances]]&nbsp;method of achieving plan coherence was later complemented and replaced by value planning, with money provided to enterprises so that they could recruit labour and procure materials and intermediate production goods and services. The Soviet economy was brought to balance by the interlocking of three sets of calculation, namely the setting up of a model incorporating balances of production, manpower and finance. The exercise was undertaken annually and involved a process of iteration (the \"method of successive approximation\").<ref>[[Michael Kaser]], ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 150\u201351 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref> Although nominally a \"centrally planned\" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process as information was relayed from enterprises to planning ministries. Aside from the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] economies, this economic model was also utilized by the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]], [[Republic of Cuba]] and [[North Korea]].\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\n<!-- Linked from Soviet economics. -->\n{{main|Economy of the Soviet Union}}\n{{see also|Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Gosplan|Ministry of Finance (Soviet Union)}}\nThe [[Soviet Union]] and some of its European satellites aimed for a fully centrally [[planned economy]]. They dispensed almost entirely with private ownership over the means of production. However, workers were still effectively paid a wage for their labour. Some believe that according to Marxist theory this should have been a step towards a genuine workers' state. However, some Marxists consider this a misunderstanding of Marx's views of [[historical materialism]] and his views of the process of socialization.\n\nThe characteristics of this model of economy were:\n* Production quotas for every productive unit. A farm, mine or factory was judged on the basis of whether its production met the quota. It would be provided with a quota of the inputs it needed to start production, and then its quota of output would be taken away and given to downstream production units or distributed to consumers.\n* Allocation through political control. In contrast with systems where prices ''determined'' allocation of resources, in the Soviet Union, allocation, particularly of means of production was determined by the bureaucracy. The prices that were constructed were done so ''after'' the formulation of the economy plan, and such prices did not factor into choices about what was produced and how it was produced in the first place.\n* Full employment. Every worker was ensured employment. However workers were generally not directed to jobs. The central planning administration adjusted relative wages rates to influence job choice in accordance with the outlines of the current plan.\n* Clearing goods by planning: if a surplus of a product was accumulated, then the central planning authority would either reduce the quota for its production or increase the quota for its use.\n* [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-year plans]] for the long-term development of key industries.\n\nThe planning system in the Soviet Union was introduced under Stalin between 1928 and 1934.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 102 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref> Following the Second World War, in the seven countries with communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, central planning with five- (or six-) year plans on the Soviet model had been introduced by 1951. The common features were the nationalization of industry, transport and trade, compulsory procurement in farming (but not collectivization) and a monopoly on foreign trade.<ref>Kaser, M C in ''Economic Reforms in the Socialist World'', 1989, edited by Gomulka, Stanislav, Ha, Yong-Chool and Kim, Cae-One, New York: M E Sharpe, pp. 97\u201398.</ref> Prices were largely determined on the basis of the costs of inputs, a method derived from the labour theory of value. Prices did not therefore incentivize production enterprises whose inputs were instead purposely rationed by the central plan. This \"taut planning\" began around 1930 in the Soviet Union and was only attenuated after the economic reforms in 1966\u20131968 when enterprises were encouraged to make profits.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 172, 222 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the communist party, the stated purpose of planning was to enable the people through the party and state institutions to undertake activities that would have been frustrated by a market economy, including the rapid expansion of universal education and health care, urban development with mass good quality housing and industrial development of all regions of the country. Nevertheless, markets continued to exist in Soviet-type planned economies. Even after the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, members of the collective farm and anyone with a private garden plot were free to sell their own produce (farm workers were often paid in kind). Licensed markets operated in every town and city borough where non-state-owned enterprises (such as cooperatives and collective farms) were able to offer their products and services. From 1956 and 1959 onwards, all wartime controls over manpower were removed and people could apply and quit jobs freely in the Soviet Union. The use of market mechanisms went furthest in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. From 1975, Soviet citizens had the right to engage in private handicraft and collective farmers could raise and sell livestock privately in 1981. It should also be noted that households were free to dispose of their income as they chose and incomes were lightly taxed.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 94\u201395, 107, 111\u201312, 127, 148, 165 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref>\n\n===== Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism =====\nVarious scholars and political economists have criticized the claim that the centrally planned economy and specifically the Soviet model of economic development constitutes a form of socialism. They argue that the Soviet economy was structured upon the [[accumulation of capital]] and the extraction of [[surplus value]] from the working class by the planning agency in order to reinvest this surplus into the economy and to distribute to managers and senior officials, indicating the Soviet Union and other Soviet-style economies were [[state capitalist]] economies.<ref>Chomsky, Noam (1986).

Wages were set at a level that permitted a decent standard of living and rewarded specialist skills and educational qualifications. In macroeconomic terms, the plan allocated the whole national product to workers in the form of wages for the workers' own use, with a fraction withheld for investment and imports from abroad. The difference between the average value of wages and the value of national output per worker did not imply the existence of surplus value since it was part of a consciously formulated plan for the development of society.<ref>John Eaton, ''Political Economy: A Marxist Textbook'', 1949, London: Lawrence and Wishart, pp. 182\u201383.</ref> The presence of inequality in the socialist planned economies did not imply that an exploiting class existed. In the Soviet Union, communist party members were able to buy scarce goods in special shops and the leadership elite took advantage of state property to live in more spacious accommodation and sometimes luxury. Although they received privileges not commonly available and some additional income in kind, there was no difference in their official remuneration in comparison to their non-party peers. Enterprise managers and workers received only the wages and bonuses related to the production targets that had been set by the planning authorities.

This analysis is consistent with Lenin's [[April Theses]] in which he stated that the goal of the Bolshevik revolution was not the introduction of socialism which could only be established on a worldwide scale, but that it was intended to bring production and the state under the control of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies. Furthermore, these communist states often do not claim to have achieved [[socialism]] in their countries; on the contrary, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries.

From Article 5: \"The Communist Party of Cuba, a follower of Mart\u00ed\u2019s ideas and of Marxism-Leninism, and the organized vanguard of the Cuban nation, is the highest leading force of society and of the state, which organizes and guides the common effort toward the goals of the construction of socialism and the progress toward a communist society,\"</ref>\n\nThis view is challenged by [[Stalinists]] and their followers, who claim that socialism was established in the Soviet Union after [[Joseph Stalin]] came to power and instituted the system of five year plans. The [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union]], known as the Fundamental Law of Victorious Socialism, embodied the claim that the foundations for socialism had been laid.<ref>V Kashin and N Cherkasov, ''What is the Transition Period?'', 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 140\u201341.</ref> Stalin introduced the theory of [[socialism in one country]] which argued that socialism can be built in a single country, despite existing in a global capitalist economic system. Nevertheless, it was recognized that the stage during which developed socialism would be built would be a lengthy one and would not be achieved by the Soviet Union on its own. According to the official textbooks, the first stage of the transition period from capitalism to socialism had been completed by the 1970s in the European socialist countries (except Poland and Yugoslavia) and in Mongolia and Cuba. The next stage of developed socialism would not be reached until \"the economic integration of the socialist states becomes a major factor of their economic progress\" and social relations had been reconstructed on \"collectivist principles\".<ref>V Kashin and N Cherkasov, ''What is the Transition Period?'', 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 142\u201344; Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, ''What is Political Economy?'', 1986 Moscow: Progress Publishers, p. 325.</ref> Communist writers accepted that during these earlier stages in constructing socialism the exchange of commodities on the basis of the average socially necessary labour embodied within them occurred and involved the mediation of money. Socialist planned economies were systems of commodity production but this was directed in a conscious way towards meeting the needs of the people and not left to the \"anarchy of the market\".<ref>John Eaton, ''Political Economy: A Marxist Textbook'', 1949, London: Lawrence and Wishart, pp. 179\u201382; Stalin, J V, ''Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR'' (1952) in ''Selected Works Volume 1'', 2012, Kolkata: Prometheus, pp. 317\u201325.</ref> At the stage of developed socialism, \"the state of dictatorship of the proletariat changes into a state of all people reflecting the increasing homogeneity of society\" and the \"evening out of economic development levels\" within and between socialist countries. It would provide the foundations for a further stage of perfected socialist society, where an abundance of goods permitted their distribution according to need. Only then could the world socialist system progress towards the higher phase of communism.<ref>V Kashin and N Cherkasov, ''What is the Transition Period?'', 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, p. 144; Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, ''What is Political Economy?'', 1986 Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 323\u201326, 330.</ref>\n\n==== World socialist economic system ====\nBy the 1980s, the world economic socialist system embraced one-third of the world\u2019s population but generated no more than 15 percent of global economic output. At its height in the mid-1980s, the world socialist system could be said to comprise the following countries with a \"socialist orientation\", though not all were allies of the Soviet Union: Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Ethiopia, Hungary, Mozambique, Nicaragua, North Korea, Laos, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Vietnam, South Yemen, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.<ref>Marie Lavigne, ''International Political Economy and Socialism'', 1991, Cambridge University Press, pp. 54\u201355 {{ISBN|0-521-33427-6}}.</ref> The system co-existed alongside the world capitalist system but was founded upon the principles of cooperation and mutual assistance rather than upon competition and rivalry The countries involved aimed to even-out the level of economic development and to play an equal part in the international division of labour. An important role was played by the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) or [[Comecon]], an international body set up to promote economic development. It involved joint planning activity, the establishment of international economic, scientific and technical bodies and methods of cooperation between state agencies and enterprises, including joint ventures and projects.<ref>Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, ''What is Political Economy?'', 1986, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 322\u201324.</ref> Allied to the CMEA were the International Development Bank, established in 1971; and the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, founded in 1963, which had their parallel in the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund in the non-socialist world.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Comecon: Integration problems of the planned economies'', 1967, Oxford University Press, p. 170 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe main tasks of the CMEA were plan coordination, production specialization and regional trade. In 1961 Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, put forward proposals for establishing an integrated, centrally planned socialist commonwealth in which each geographic region would specialize production in line with its set of natural and human resources. The resulting document, the \"Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour\" was adopted at the end of 1961, despite objections from Romania on certain aspects. The \"Basic Principles\" were never implemented fully and were replaced in 1971 by the adoption of the \"Comprehensive Programme for Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and Development of Socialist Economic Integration\". As a result, many specialization agreements were made between CMEA member states for investment programmes and projects. The importing country pledged to rely on the exporting country for its consumption of the product in question. Production specialization occurred in engineering, automotive, chemicals, computers and automation, telecommunications and biotechnology. Scientific and technical cooperation between CMEA member states was facilitated by the establishment in 1969 of the International Centre for Scientific and Technical Information  in Moscow.<ref>Jenny Brine, ''Comecon: The rise and fall of an international socialist organization'', 1992, New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University/Transaction, p. xii {{ISBN|1-56000-080-5}}.</ref>\n\nTrade between CMEA member states was divided into \"hard goods\" and \"soft goods\". The former could be sold on world markets and the latter could not. Commodities such as food, energy products and raw materials tended to be hard goods and were traded within the CMEA area at world market prices. Manufactures tended to be soft goods and their prices were negotiable and often adjusted to make bilateral payment flows balance.<ref>Philip Hanson, ''The rise and fall of the Soviet economy: An economic history of the USSR'', 2003, Harlow: Pearson Education, pp. 121, 131 {{ISBN|0-582-29958-6}}.</ref>\n\nOther countries with privileged affiliation with the CMEA were Algeria, Benin, Burma, Congo, Finland, Madagascar, Mali, Mexico, Nigeria, Seychelles, Syria, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. The Soviet Union also provided substantial economic aid and technical assistance to developing countries including Egypt, India, Iraq, Iran, Somalia and Turkey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://photius.com/countries/soviet_union_former/government/soviet_union_former_government_countries_of_sociali~1817.html|title=Soviet Union (former) Countries of Socialist Orientation|website=Photius|accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref> It supported developing countries in calling for a [[New International Economic Order]] and backed the UN Charter of Economic Rights and Obligations of States adopted by the General Assembly in 1974.<ref>Padma Desai, ''The Soviet Economy: Problems and Prospects'', 1990, Oxford: Basil Blackwell, pp. 258\u201363 {{ISBN|0-631-17183-5}}</ref>\n\n==== Achievements of the socialist planned economies ====\nIn the officially sanctioned textbooks describing the socialist planned economies as they existed in the 1980s, it was claimed as follows:\n* Class and national oppression had been totally eradicated.\n* Unemployment, hunger, poverty, illiteracy and uncertainty about the future had been eliminated.\n* Every citizen had a guaranteed  right to work, rest, education, health care, abode and security in old age and maintenance in the event of disability.\n* Material standards of living were rising steadily and everyone had free access to knowledge and to the values of world and national culture.\n* Every citizen had a right in practice to take part in discussing and solving any problems in the life of the enterprise, region, republic and the country they lived in, including the rights to free speech, of assembly and to demonstrate.<ref>Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, ''What is Political Economy?'', 1986, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 271\u201372.</ref>\n\nData collected by the United Nations of indicators of human development in the early 1990s show that a high level of social development was achieved in the former socialist planned economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CEE/CIS).

The proportion of people changing jobs was between 6 and 13 percent of the labour force a year according to employment data during the 1970s and 1980s in Central and Eastern Europe and the USSR. Labour exchanges were established in the USSR in 1967 to help enterprises re-allocate workers and provide information on job vacancies. Compulsory unemployment insurance schemes operated in Bulgaria, Eastern Germany and Hungary but the numbers claiming support as a result of losing their job through no fault of their own numbered a few hundred a year.<ref>Brown, A, Kaser, M C, Smith, G S (editors), ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Russia and the Former Soviet Union'', 1994, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp. 431, 464 {{ISBN|0-521-35593-1}}; and Porket, J L, ''Unemployment in Capitalist, Communist and Post-Communist Economies'', 1995, London: Macmillan pp. 32\u201336 {{ISBN|0-312-12484-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 1988, GDP per person, measured at purchasing power parity in US dollars, was $7,519 in Russia and $6,304 for the USSR.

However, in practice this meant that investment was shifted towards new branches of industry, including the electronics, computing, automotive and nuclear power sectors, leaving the traditional heavy industries dependent upon older technologies. Despite the rhetoric about modernization, innovation remained weak as enterprise managers preferred routine production that was easier to plan and brought them predictable bonuses. Embargoes on high technology exports organized through the US-supported [[CoCom]] arrangement hampered technology transfer. Enterprise managers also ignored inducements to introduce labour-saving measures as they wished to retain a reserve of personnel to be available to meet their production target by working at top speed when supplies were delayed.<ref>[[Archie Brown]], and [[Michael Kaser]], ''Soviet Policy for the 1980s'', 1982, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, pp. 188, 194, 200, 208 {{ISBN|0-253-35412-9}}; Simon Clarke (editor), ''Structural Adjustment without Mass Unemployment?

Enterprises faced a resource constraint and hoarded labour and other inputs and avoided sub-contracting intermediate production activities, preferring to retain the work in-house. The enterprise, according to the theory promulgated by [[J\u00e1nos Kornai]], was constrained by its resources not by the demand for its goods and services; nor was it constrained by its finances since the government was not likely to shut it down if it failed to meet its financial targets. Enterprises in socialist planned economies operated within a \"soft\" budget constraint, unlike enterprises in capitalist market economies which are demand-constrained and operate within \"hard\" budget constraints, as they face bankruptcy if their costs exceed their sales. As all producers were working in a resource-constrained economy they were perpetually in short supply and the shortages could never be eliminated, leading to chronic disruption of production schedules. The effect of this was to preserve a high level of employment.<ref>J\u00e1nos Kornai, \u2018\u2019Economics of Shortage\u2019\u2019, Amsterdam: North Holland; Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 60, 130\u201335, 248 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref>\n\nAs the supply of consumer goods failed to match rising incomes (because workers still received their pay even if they were not fully productive), household savings accumulated, indicating, in the official terminology, \"postponed demand\". Western economists called this \"[[monetary overhang]]\" or \"repressed inflation\". Prices on the black market were several times higher than in the official price-controlled outlets, reflecting the scarcity and possible illegality of the sale of these items. Therefore, although consumer welfare was reduced by shortages, the prices households paid for their regular consumption were lower than would have been the case had prices been set at market-clearing levels.<ref>Brown, A, and Kaser, M C, ''The Soviet Union Since the Fall of Khrushchev'', 1978, London: Macmillan, pp. 212\u201314 {{ISBN|0-333-23337-9}}; Brown, A, and Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Policy for the 1980s'', 1982, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, p. 193 {{ISBN|0-253-35412-9}}; Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 61, 130\u201335 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the 1980s it became clear that the CMEA area was \"in crisis\", although it remained viable economically and was not expected to collapse.<ref>Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 76 and 248 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref> The \"extensive\" growth model was retarding growth in the CMEA as a whole, with member countries dependent upon supplies of raw materials from the USSR and upon the Soviet market for sales of goods. The decline in growth rates reflected a combination of diminishing returns to capital accumulation and low innovation as well as micro-economic inefficiencies, which a high rate of saving and investment was unable to counter. The CMEA was supposed to ensure coordination of national plans but it failed even to develop a common methodology for planning which could be adopted by its member states. As each member state was reluctant to give up national self-sufficiency the CMEA\u2019s efforts to encourage specialization was thwarted. There were very few joint ventures and therefore little intra-enterprise technology transfer and trade, which in the capitalist world was often undertaken by trans-national corporations. The International Bank for Economic Cooperation had no means of converting a country\u2019s trade surplus into an option to buy goods and services from other CMEA members.<ref>Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 52\u201354 and 75\u201376 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Transition to market economies ===\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, many of the remaining [[socialist state]]s presiding over centrally planned economies began introducing reforms that shifted their economies away from centralized planning. In Central and Eastern Europe and the USSR the transition from a planned economy to a market economy was accompanied by the transformation of the socialist [[mode of production]] to a capitalist mode of production. In Asia (China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam) and in Cuba market mechanisms were introduced by the ruling communist parties and the planning system was reformed without systemic transformation.\n\nThe transformation from socialism to capitalism involved a political shift: from a people\u2019s democracy (see [[People's Republic]] and [[Communist state]]) with a constitutionally entrenched \"leading role\" for the communist and workers\u2019 parties in society to a liberal [[representative democracy]] with a separation of legislative, executive and judicial authorities and centres of private power that can act as a brake on the state\u2019s activity.<ref>Boris Putrin, ''Political Terms: A short guide'', 1982, Moscow: Novosti, p. 63; Samuel E Finer, ''Comparative Government'', 1974, Harmondsworth: Penguin, pp. 66\u201371 {{ISBN|0-140-21170-5}}.</ref>\n\nVietnam adopted an economic model it formally titled the ''socialist-oriented market economy''.

In several countries property was restored to its former owners or their legal successors. If the actual property could not be returned the former owners received compensation. This occurred in Eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Estonia. In all the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the government decided against restoration or compensation on the grounds that too much time had elapsed and in many cases compensation had already been made through bilateral treaties between the USSR and foreign governments representing the former owners. [[Voucher privatization]] in which citizens and workers in the enterprises received free or cheap shares was undertaken in most of the transition economies.<ref>[[Michael Kaser]] on ''Privatization in the CIS'' in Alan Smith (editor), ''Challenges for Russian Economic Reform'', 1995, London: Royal Institute for International Affairs and Washington DC: The Brookings Institution, pp. 118\u201327.</ref> \n* The decision-making system was de-centralized through the ending of central planning and the privatization of enterprises. Work collectives and trade unions lost much of their influence in enterprise decision-making.\n* Markets became the dominant coordination mechanism following price liberalization and the de-control of foreign trade that permitted more or less unrestricted importation of goods in 1990/92. Queues at retail outlets disappeared as did hoarded inventories at factories. Stock exchanges were established between 1990 and 1995.

Private property and private ownership of capital were abolished, and various forms of wealth made subject to state control or to workers' councils. The Chinese economy broadly adopted a similar system of production quotas and full employment by fiat to the Russian model. The [[Great Leap Forward]] saw a remarkably large-scale experiment with rapid collectivisation of agriculture, and other ambitious goals. Results were less than expected, (e.g., there were food shortages and mass starvation) and the program was abandoned after  three years.

These include Britain (mixed economy and welfare state) from 1945 to 1979, France (state capitalism and indicative planning) from 1945 to 1982 under dirigisme, Sweden (social democratic welfare state) and Norway (state social democratic mixed economy) to the present. They are regarded as [[social democratic]] and [[reformist socialist]] experiments because they universally retained a wage-based economy and private ownership and control of the decisive means of production.\n\nNevertheless, these western European countries tried to restructure their economies away from a [[Laissez-faire|purely private]] capitalist model. Variations range from social democratic [[welfare states]], such as in Sweden, to [[mixed economies]] where a major percentage of GDP comes from the state sector, such as in Norway, which ranks among the highest countries in quality of life and equality of opportunity for its citizens.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8290550.stm | work=BBC News | title=Norway 'the best place to live' | date=2009-10-05 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref> Elements of these efforts persist throughout Europe, even if they have repealed some aspects of public control and ownership. They are typically characterized by:\n* [[Nationalization]] of key industries such as mining, oil, steel, energy and transportation. A common model is for a sector to be taken over by the state and then one or more [[state-owned enterprise]]s set up for its day-to-day running. Advantages of nationalization include the ability of the state to direct [[investment]] in key industries, the distribution of state [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from nationalized industries for the overall national good, the ability to direct producers to social rather than market goals, greater control of the industries by and for the workers, and the benefits and burdens of publicly funded research and development are extended to the wider populace.\n* [[Redistribution of wealth]], through both tax and spending policies that aim to reduce economic inequalities. Social democracies typically employ various forms of [[progressive taxation]] regarding wage and business income, wealth, inheritance, capital gains and property. On the spending side, a set of social policies typically provides free access to public services such as education, health care and child care, while subsidized access to housing, food, pharmaceutical goods, water supply, waste management and electricity is also common.\n* [[Social security]] schemes where workers contribute to a mandatory public insurance program. The insurance typically include monetary provisions for retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent and temporary disabilities, unemployment and [[parental leave]]. Unlike private insurance, governmental schemes are based on public statutes and not contracts, so that contributions and benefits may change in time and are based on solidarity among participants. Its funding is done on an ongoing basis, without direct relationship with future liabilities.\n* [[Minimum wages]], employment protection and [[trade union]] recognition rights for the benefit of workers. The objectives of these policies are to guarantee living wages and help produce [[full employment]]. There are a number of different models of trade union protection which evolved, but they all guarantee the right of workers to form unions, negotiate benefits and participate in strikes. Germany, for instance, appointed union representatives at high levels in all corporations and had much less industrial strife than the UK, whose laws encouraged [[Strike action|strikes]] rather than negotiation.\n* [[Indicative planning|National planning]] for industrial development.\n* [[Demand management]] in a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] fashion to help ensure economic growth and employment.\n\n==== State capitalism ====\n{{main|State capitalism}}\nVarious social democratic mixed economies are state capitalist, consisting of large commercial [[state enterprise]]s that operate according to the laws of capitalism and pursue profits, that have evolved in countries which have been influenced by various [[Socialist party|elected socialist political parties]] and their economic reforms. While these policies and reforms did not change the fundamental aspect of capitalism and non-socialist elements within these countries supported or often implemented many of these reforms themselves, the result has been a set of economic institutions that were at least partly influenced by socialist ideology.\n\n===== India =====\n{{main|Economy of India}}\nAfter gaining independence from Britain, [[India]] adopted a broadly socialist-inspired approach to economic growth. Like other countries with a democratic transition to a [[mixed economy]], it did not abolish private property in capital. India proceeded by nationalizing various large privately run firms, creating state-owned enterprises and redistributing income through progressive taxation in a manner similar to social democratic Western European nations than to planned economies such as the Soviet Union or China. Today, India is often characterized as having a [[free-market economy]] that combines economic planning with the [[free-market]]. However, it did adopt a very firm focus on [[Indicative planning|national planning]] with a series of broad [[Five-Year Plans of India|five-year plans]].\n\n===== Norway =====\nModern Norwegian state capitalism has its origins in public ownership of the country's oil reserves and in the country's [[post-World War II]] [[social democratic]] reforms.

New forms of socialist institutional arrangements began to take form at the end of the 20th century with the advancement and proliferation of the internet and other tools that allow for collaborative decision-making.\n\n[[Michel Bauwens]] identifies the emergence of the open software movement and [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer production]] as an emergent alternative [[mode of production]] to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital.<ref name=\"Ctheory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499|title=The Political Economy of Peer Production|date=2005-01-12|author=|publisher=CTheory}}</ref>\n\n[[Commons-based peer production]] generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code.

Rather than implementing a centrally planned economy, Yugoslavia developed a market socialist system where enterprises and firms were [[Cooperative|socially owned]] rather than publicly owned by the state. In these organizations, the management was elected directly by the workers in each firm, and were later organized according to [[Edvard Kardelj]]'s theory of associated labor.\n\n==== Self-managed enterprises ====\n{{see also|Cooperative}}\nThe [[Mondragon Corporation]], a federation of cooperatives in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] region of Spain, organizes itself as an employee-owned, employee-managed enterprise. Similar styles of decentralized management, which embrace cooperation and collaboration in place of traditional hierarchical management structures, have been adopted by various private corporations such as [[Cisco Systems]], inc.<ref>{{cite web|last=McGirt |first=Ellen |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/131/revolution-in-san-jose.html |title=How Cisco's CEO John Chambers Is Turning the Tech Giant Socialist &#124; Fast Company &#124; Business + Innovation |publisher=Fast Company |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> But unlike Mondragon, Cisco remains firmly under private ownership.

But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power.

Much of [[Spain's economy]] was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like [[Catalonia]], the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] influence, as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied party actively resisted attempts at [[collectivization]] enactment.

Besides this, some socialist economic theories are criticized by other socialists. Libertarian socialist, mutualist and other market socialist economists criticize centralized economic planning and propose [[participatory economics]] and decentralized socialism.\n\nMarket economists generally criticize socialism for eliminating the free market and its [[price signal]]s which they consider necessary for rational economic calculation. They also consider that it causes a lack of incentive and believe that these problems lead to a slower rate of technological advance and a slower rate of growth of GDP.\n\nAustrian School economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] have argued that the elimination of private ownership of the [[means of production]] would inevitably create worse economic conditions for the general populace than those that would be found in market economies. They argue that without the price signals of the market it is impossible to calculate rationally how to allocate resources. Mises called this the [[economic calculation problem]]. Polish economist [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]] responded to Mises' argument by developing the [[Lange Model]] during the [[economic calculation debate]]. The Lange model argues that an economy in which all production is performed by the state, where there is a functioning price mechanism, has similar properties to a market economy under perfect competition in that it achieves [[Pareto efficiency]].\n\nThe neoclassical view is that there is a lack of incentive, not a lack of information in a planned economy. They argue that within a socialist planned economy there is a lack of incentive to act on information. Therefore, the crucial missing element is not so much information as the Austrian School argued as it is the motivation to act on information.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heilbroner|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Heilbroner|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Socialism.html|title=Socialism|series=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|date=2008|edition=2nd|accessdate=18 June 2017}}<!-- Note: This is an original essay for the CEE, not available from other sources. --></ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{too many see alsos|date=July 2019}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarcho-communism]]\n* [[Basic income]]\n* [[Collectivist anarchism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Complexity economics]]\n* [[Collectivism]]\n* [[Economic calculation debate]]\n* [[Economic democracy]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Evolutionary economics]]\n* [[Fair trade]]\n* [[Feminist economics]]\n* [[Gandhian economics]]\n* [[History of economic thought]]\n* [[Indicative planning]]\n* [[Job guarantee]]\n* [[Labour economics]]\n* [[List of socialist economists]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Cooperative|Cooperative stock market]]\n* [[Nationalization]]\n* [[Participatory economics]]\n* [[Planned economy]]\n* [[Post-capitalism]]\n* [[Production for use]]\n* [[Public banking]]\n* [[Ricardian socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n* [[Social dividend]]\n* [[Socialist market economy]]\n* [[Socialism (Marxism)|Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialization (economics)]]\n* [[Welfare economics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Michael Albert|Albert, Michael]]; Hahnel, Robin: ''[https://zcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/zbooks/www/books/polpar.htm The Political Economy of Participatory Economics]'', Princeton University Press, 1991.

Not being produced for sale on a market, items of wealth will not acquire an exchange-value in addition to their use-value.

Engels wrote about this at length in the book ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'', which was based on the unpublished notes of Marx on the work of [[Lewis Henry Morgan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/origin-of-the-family-engels-morgan.htm|author=Rob Sewell|title=Origin of the Family: In Defence of Engels and Morgan|publisher=Marxist.com|date=December 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nValues of ''socialism'' have roots in pre-capitalist institutions such as the religious communes, reciprocal obligations, and communal charity of Mediaeval Europe, the development of its economic theory primarily reflects and responds to the monumental changes brought about by the dissolution of feudalism and the emergence of specifically capitalist social relations.<ref>Wallerstein, Immanuel ''Historical Capitalism''</ref> As such it is commonly regarded as a movement belonging to the modern era. Many socialists have considered their advocacy as the preservation and extension of the radical humanist ideas expressed in [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] doctrine such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s ''Discourse on Inequality'', [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]]'s ''Limits of State Action'', or [[Immanuel Kant]]'s insistent defense of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Chomsky, Noam ''Perspectives on Power''</ref>\n\n[[Capitalism]] appeared in mature form as a result of the problems raised when an industrial factory system requiring long-term investment and entailing corresponding risks was introduced into an internationalized commercial (mercantilist) framework. Historically speaking, the most pressing needs of this new system were an assured supply of the elements of industry (land, elaborate machinery, and labour) and these imperatives led to the [[commodification]] of these elements.<ref>[[Karl Polanyi]] ''Primitive, Archaic and Modern Economies''.</ref>\n\nAccording to influential socialist economic historian [[Karl Polanyi]]'s classic account, the forceful transformation of land, money and especially labour into commodities to be allocated by an autonomous market mechanism was an alien and inhuman rupture of the pre-existing social fabric. Marx had viewed the process in a similar light, referring to it as part of the process of \"primitive accumulation\" whereby enough initial capital is amassed to begin capitalist production. The dislocation that Polyani and others describe, triggered natural counter-movements in efforts to re-embed the economy in society.  These counter-movements, that included, for example, the [[Luddite]] rebellions, are the incipient socialist movements. Over time such movements gave birth to or acquired an array of intellectual defenders who attempted to develop their ideas in theory.\n\nAs Polanyi noted, these counter-movements were mostly reactive and therefore not full-fledged socialist movements. Some demands went no further than a wish to mitigate the capitalist market's worst effects. Later, a full socialist program developed, arguing for systemic transformation. Its theorists believed that even if markets and private property could be tamed so as not to be excessively \"exploitative\", or crises could be effectively mitigated, capitalist social relations would remain significantly unjust and anti-democratic, suppressing  universal human needs for fulfilling, empowering and creative work, diversity and solidarity.\n\nWithin this context, socialism has undergone four periods: the first in the 19th century was a period of utopian visions (1780s\u20131850s); then occurred the rise of revolutionary socialist and communist movements in the 19th century as the primary opposition to the rise of corporations and industrialization (1830\u20131916); the polarisation of socialism around the question of the [[Soviet Union]] and adoption of socialist or social democratic policies in response (1916\u20131989); and the response of socialism in the [[neoliberal]] era (1970s\u2013present). As socialism developed, so did the socialist system of economics.\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\n{{main|Utopian socialism}}\nThe first theories which came to hold the term \"socialism\" began to be formulated in the late 18th century and were termed \"socialism\" early in the 19th century. The central beliefs of the socialism of this period rested on the exploitation of those who labored by those who owned capital or rented land and housing. The abject misery, poverty and disease to which laboring classes seemed destined was the inspiration for a series of schools of thought which argued that life under a class of masters or \"capitalists\", as they were then becoming to be called, would consist of working classes being driven down to subsistence wages (see the [[iron law of wages]]).\n\nSocialist ideas found expression in utopian movements, which often formed agricultural communes aimed at being self-sufficient on the land. These included many religious movements, such as the [[Christian socialism]] of the [[Shakers]] in America and the [[Hutterites]]. The [[Zionism|Zionist]] [[kibbutz]]im and [[commune]]s of the [[counterculture]] are also manifestations of utopian socialist ideas.\n\n[[Utopian socialism]] had little to offer in terms of a systematic theory of economic phenomena{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. In theory, economic problems were dissolved by a utopian society which had transcended material scarcity. In practice, small communities with a common spirit could sometimes resolve allocation problems.\n\n=== Socialism and classical political economy ===\nThe first organized theories of socialist economics were significantly impacted by classical economic theory, including elements in [[Adam Smith]], [[Robert Malthus]] and [[David Ricardo]]. In Smith there is a conception of a common good not provided by the market, a [[class analysis]], a concern for the dehumanizing aspects of the factory system, and the concept of rent as being [[Productive and unproductive labour|unproductive]]. Ricardo argued that the renting class was parasitic. This, and the possibility of a \"[[general glut]]\", an over accumulation of capital to produce goods for sale rather than for use, became the foundation of a rising critique of the concept that free markets with competition would be sufficient to prevent disastrous downturns in the economy, and whether the need for expansion would inevitably lead to war.\n\n=== Socialist political economy before Marx ===\n[[File:Hw-fourier.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Charles Fourier]], influential early French socialist thinker]]\nA key early socialist theorist of political economy was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]]. He was the most well-known of nineteenth century [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]] theorists and the first thinker to refer to himself as an anarchist. Others were: [[Technocrats]] like Henri de Saint-Simon, [[agrarianism|agrarian]] radicals like [[Thomas Spence]], [[William Ogilvie of Pittensear|William Ogilvie]] and [[William Cobbett]]; anti-capitalists like [[Thomas Hodgskin]]; [[communitarian]] and [[utopian]] socialists like [[Robert Owen]], [[William Thompson (philosopher)|William Thompson]] and [[Charles Fourier]]; anti-market socialists like [[John Gray (19th century socialist)|John Gray]] and [[John Francis Bray]]; the [[Christian mutualism|Christian mutualist]] [[William Batchelder Greene]]; as well as the theorists of the [[Chartist movement]] and early proponents of [[syndicalism]].<ref>Noel Thomson ''The Real Rights of Man: Political Economies for the Working Class 1775\u20131850'', 1998, Pluto Press</ref>\n\nThe first advocates of socialism promoted social leveling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based upon individual talent. Count [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] was the first individual to coin the term \"socialism\".<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html |title=Adam Smith |publisher=Fsmitha.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology, which led him to advocate a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism and which would be based upon equal opportunities.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://sa.org.au/marxism_page/intros/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|chapter=Birth of the Socialist Idea|first=David|last= McNally|title=Socialism from Below|year= 1980}}</ref> Saint-Simon advocated a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organized economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress, which embodied a desire for a semi-[[planned economy]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nOther early socialist thinkers were influenced by the classical economists. The [[Ricardian socialists]], such as Thomas Hodgskin and Charles Hall, were based on the work of [[David Ricardo]] and reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated producer prices when those commodities were in elastic supply, and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labor. The Ricardian socialists viewed profit, interest and rent as deductions from this exchange-value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |accessdate=2 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416232455/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/utopia.htm |archivedate=|title=Utopians and Socialists |archive-date=16 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\n=== Karl Marx and ''Das Kapital'' ===\n{{main|Das Kapital}}\n[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Karl Marx]], influential German socialist thinker and economist]]\n[[Karl Marx]] employed systematic analysis in an attempt to elucidate capitalism's contradictory laws of motion, as well as to expose the specific mechanisms by which it exploits and alienates. He radically modified classical political economic theories. Marx transformed the [[labor theory of value]], which had been worked upon by [[Adam Smith]] and [[David Ricardo]], into his  \"[[law of value]]\", and used it for the purpose of revealing how [[commodity fetishism]] obscures the reality of capitalist society.\n\nHis approach, which [[Friedrich Engels]] would call \"[[scientific socialism]]\", would stand as the branching point in economic theory. In one direction went those who rejected the capitalist system as fundamentally anti-social, arguing that it could never be harnessed to effectively realize the fullest development of human potentialities wherein \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dougdowd.org/NewFiles/articles/lebowitzhi.html|title=Karl Marx: The Needs of Capital vs. The Needs of Human Beings|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218151908/http://dougdowd.org/NewFiles/articles/lebowitzhi.html |archivedate=February 18, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nMarx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'' is an incomplete work of economic theory; he had planned four volumes but completed two and left his collaborator Engels to complete the third. In many ways, the work is modelled on Smith's ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'', seeking to be a comprehensive logical description of production, consumption, and finance in relation to morality and the state. The work of philosophy, anthropology, sociology, and economics includes the following topics:\n* [[Law of value]]: capitalist production is the production of \"an immense multitude of commodities\" or generalised commodity production. A commodity has two essential qualities firstly, they are useful, they satisfy some human want, \"the nature of such wants, whether, for instance, they spring from the stomach or from fancy, makes no difference\"<ref name=\"marxists1\">{{cite web|author=Karl Marx |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm |title=Economic Manuscripts: Capital Vol. I \u2013 Chapter One |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> and secondly they are sold on a market or exchanged. Critically the exchange value of a commodity \"is independent of the amount of labour required to appropriate its useful qualities\".<ref name=\"marxists1\"/> However, rather depends on the amount of socially necessary labour required to produce it. All commodities are sold at their value, so the origin of the capitalist profit is not in cheating or theft, but in the fact that the cost of reproduction of labour power, or the worker's wage, is less than the value created during their time at work, enabling the capitalists to yield a surplus value or profit on their investments.\n* Historical property relations: historical capitalism represents a process of momentous social upheaval where rural masses were separated from the land and ownership of the [[means of production]] by force, deprivation, and legal manipulation, creating an urban [[proletariat]] based on the institution of [[wage-labour]]. Moreover, capitalist property relations aggravated the artificial separation between city and country, which is a key factor in accounting for the [[metabolic rift]] between human beings in capitalism and their natural environment, which is at the root of our current ecological dilemmas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/0902foster.htm |title=Capitalism and Ecology: The Nature of the Contradiction |publisher=Monthlyreview.org |date= September 2002|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Commodity fetishism]]: Marx adapted previous value-theory to show that in capitalism phenomena involved with the price system (markets, competition, supply and demand) constitute a powerful ideology that obscures the underlying social relations of capitalist society. \"Commodity fetishism\" refers to this distortion of appearance. The underlying social reality is one of economic exploitation.\n* [[Exploitation of labour|Economic exploitation]]: workers are the fundamental creative source of new value. Property relations affording the right of usufruct and despotic control of the workplace to capitalists are the devices by which the [[surplus value]] created by workers is appropriated by the capitalists.\n* [[Capital accumulation]]: inherent to capitalism is the incessant drive to accumulate as a response to the competitive forces acting upon all capitalists. In such a context the accumulated wealth which is the source of the capitalist's social power derives itself from being able to repeat the circuit of Money\u2192Commodity\u2192Money, where the capitalist receives an increment or \"surplus value\" higher than their initial investment, as rapidly and efficiently as possible. Moreover, this driving imperative leads capitalism to its expansion on a worldwide scale.\n* Crises: Marx identified natural and historically specific (i.e. structural) barriers to accumulation that were interrelated and interpenetrated one another in times of crises. Different types of crises, such as realization crises and overproduction crises, are expressions of capitalism's inability to constructively overcome such barriers. Moreover, the upshot of crises is increased centralization, the expropriation of the many capitalists by the few.\n* Centralization: the interacting forces of competition, endemic crises, intensive and extensive expansion of the scale of production, and a growing interdependency with the state apparatus, all promote a strong developmental tendency towards the centralization of capital.\n* Material development: as a result of its constant drive to optimize profitability by increasing the [[productivity]] of labour, typically by revolutionizing technology and production techniques, capitalism develops so as to progressively reduce the objective need for work, suggesting the potential for a new era of creative forms of work and expanded scope for leisure.\n* Socialization and the pre-conditions for social revolution: by socializing the labour process, concentrating workers into urban settings in large-scale production processes and linking them in a worldwide market, the agents of a potential revolutionary change are created. Thus Marx felt that in the course of its development capitalism was at the same time developing the preconditions for its own negation. However, although the objective conditions for change are generated by the capitalist system itself, the subjective conditions for social revolution can only come about through the apprehension of the objective circumstances by the agents themselves and the transformation of such understanding into an effective revolutionary program.<ref>Petras, James and Veltmeyer, Henry ''Globalization Unmasked: Imperialism in the 21st Century''</ref>\n\n=== Anarchist economics ===\n{{main|Anarchist economics}}\n[[Anarchist economics]] is the set of theories and practices of [[economics]] and economic activity within the political philosophy of [[anarchism]].\n\n[[Pierre Joseph Proudhon]] was involved with the Lyons mutualists and later adopted the name to describe [[Mutualism (economic theory)|his own teachings]].<ref>Woodcock, George.

Production in a socialist economy is therefore \"planned\" or \"coordinated\", and does not suffer from the [[business cycle]] inherent to capitalism. In most socialist theories, economic planning only applies to the [[factors of production]] and not to the allocation of goods and services produced for consumption, which would be distributed through a market. [[Karl Marx]] stated that \"lower-stage communism\" would consist of compensation based on the amount of labor one contributes to the social product.<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm ''Karl Marx''&nbsp;\u2013 Critique of the Gotha Programme. 1875] Full Text.

But as far as the distribution of the latter among the individual producers is concerned, the same principle prevails as in the exchange of commodity equivalents: a given amount of labor in one form is exchanged for an equal amount of labor in another form.\"</ref>\n\nThe ownership of the [[means of production]] varies in different socialist theories. It can either be based on [[public ownership]] by a state apparatus; direct ownership by the users of the productive property through [[worker cooperative]]; or [[common ownership|commonly owned]] by all of society with management and control delegated to those who operate/use the means of production.\n\nManagement and control over the activities of enterprises is based on [[Socialism#Self-managed economy|self-management]] and self-governance, with equal power-relations in the workplace to maximize occupational autonomy. A socialist form of organization would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains. Every member would have decision-making power in the firm and would be able to participate in establishing its overall policy objectives. The policies/goals would be carried out by the technical specialists that form the coordinating hierarchy of the firm, who would establish plans or directives for the work community to accomplish these goals.<ref name=\"The Political Economy of Socialism, 1982. P.197\">''The Political Economy of Socialism'', by Horvat, Branko. 1982. (p. 197): \"The sandglass (socialist) model is based on the observation that there are two fundamentally different spheres of activity or decision making. The first is concerned with value judgments, and consequently each individual counts as one in this sphere. In the second, technical decisions are made on the basis of technical competence and expertise. The decisions of the first sphere are policy directives; those of the second, technical directives. The former are based on political authority as exercised by all members of the organization; the latter, on professional authority specific to each member and growing out of the division of labor. Such an organization involves a clearly defined coordinating hierarchy but eliminates a power hierarchy.\"</ref>\n\nHowever, the economies of the former [[Socialist states]], excluding Yugoslavia, were based on bureaucratic, top-down administration of economic directives and micromanagement of the worker in the workplace inspired by capitalist models of [[Taylorism|scientific management]]. As a result, some socialist movements have argued that said economies were not socialist due to the lack of equal power-relations in the workplace, the presence of a new \"elite\", and because of the commodity production that took place in these economies. These economic and social systems have been classified as being either \"[[bureaucratic collectivist]]\", \"[[state capitalist]]\" or \"[[deformed workers' state]]s\" by its critics. The exact nature of the [[USSR]] ''et al'' remains unresolved within said socialist movements. However, other socialist movements defend the systems that were in place in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, remembering, as said above, that public ownership of the means of production can signify many variants. In the case of the Soviet Union and its satellites, it was the State which controlled and managed almost all of the economy as a big huge enterprise. Furthermore, the products that were manufactured in Soviet-type economies were produced directly for use, given the fact that all of them were sold to the public at below-market prices (i.e. they were sold in deficit to satisfy the needs of the population).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/what-was-the-ussr-aufheben-1 |title=What was the USSR?

Decision-making is carried out by workers and consumers on the enterprise-level.\n\nEconomic planning is not synonymous with the concept of a ''[[command economy]]'', which existed in the [[Soviet Union]], and was based on a highly bureaucratic administration of the entire economy in accordance to a comprehensive plan formulated by a central planning agency, which specified output requirements for productive units and tried to micromanage the decisions and policies of enterprises. The command economy is based on the organizational model of a capitalist firm, but applies it to the entire economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/c/o.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: Co |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nVarious advocates of economic planning have been staunch critics of command economies and centralized planning. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and understand the local conditions and rapid changes in the economy.

Free access to the means of subsistence is a requisite for liberty, because it ensures that all work is voluntary and no class or individual has the power to coerce others into performing [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienating]] work.\n\nThe ultimate goal for [[Marxist]] socialists is the emancipation of labor from alienating work{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}, and therefore freedom from having to perform such labor to receive access to the material necessities for life. It is argued that freedom from necessity would maximize individual liberty, as individuals would be able to pursue their own interests and develop their own talents without being coerced into performing labor for others (the power-elite or ruling class in this case) via mechanisms of social control, such as the [[Wage labor|labor market]] and the state{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

Market socialists that base their models on [[neoclassical economics]], and thus [[marginal utility]], such as [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]], have proposed that publicly owned enterprises set their price to equal marginal cost, thereby achieving [[pareto efficiency]].

Many different proposals for socialist economic systems call for a type of mixed economy, where multiple forms of ownership over the means of production co-exist with one another.\n* Public enterprise employee managed market economies, another form of [[market socialism]] in which publicly owned, employee-managed production units engage in free market exchange of goods and services with one another as well as with final consumers, e.g. mid twentieth century Yugoslavia, Two more theoretical models are [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]'s [[Progressive Utilization Theory]] and [[Economic democracy]].\n* Public enterprise participatory planning, an economy featuring social ownership of the means of production with allocation based on an integration of decentralized democratic planning, e.g. [[stateless communism]], [[libertarian socialism]]. An incipient historical forebear is that of Catalonia during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]].

Economic planning in this definition means conscious allocation of economic inputs and the means of production by the associated producers to directly maximise use-values as opposed to exchange-values, in contrast to the \"anarchy of production\" of capitalism.\n* Walrasian/Market Socialist which defines socialism as public-ownership or cooperative-enterprises in a market economy, with prices for producer goods set through a trial-and-error method by a central planning board. In this view, socialism is defined in terms of de jure public property rights over major enterprises.\n* Leninist conception, which includes a form of political organisation based on control of the means of production and government by a single political party apparatus that claims to act in the interest of the working class, and an ideology hostile toward markets and political dissent, with coordination of economic activity through centralised economic planning (a \"command economy\").\n* Social democratic concept, based on the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], which defines socialism as a set of values rather than a specific type of social and economic organisation. It includes unconditional support for parliamentary democracy, gradual and reformist attempts to establish socialism and support for socially progressive causes. Social democrats are not opposed to the market or private property; instead they try to ameliorate the effects of capitalism through a welfare state, which relies on the market as the fundamental coordinating entity in the economy and a degree of public ownership/public provision of public goods in an economy otherwise dominated by private enterprise.\n* East Asian model, or [[socialist market economy]], based on a largely free-market, capital accumulation for profit and substantial private ownership along with state-ownership of strategic industries monopolised by a single political party. J\u00e1nos Kornai ultimately leaves the classification of this model (as either socialist or capitalist) to the reader.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bm.ust.hk/~ced/iea/Hong_Kong_Yingyinek_kikuldott_05june2.doc |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183831/http://www.bm.ust.hk/~ced/iea/Hong_Kong_Yingyinek_kikuldott_05june2.doc |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSocialism can be divided into market socialism and planned socialism based on their dominant mechanism of resource allocation. Another distinction can be made between the type of property structures of different socialist systems (public, [[cooperative]] or [[Common ownership|common]]) and on the dominant form of economic management within the economy (hierarchical or [[Self-managed economy|self-managed]]).\n\n=== Economic democracy ===\n[[Economic democracy]] is a model of market socialism primarily developed by the American economist [[David Schweickart]]. In Schweickart's model, enterprises and natural resources are owned by society in the form of public banking, and management is elected by the workers within each firm. Profits would be distributed among the workers of the respective enterprise.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schweickart|first=David |title=After Capitalism|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KWy9JbWvjywC&pg=PA156&dq=%22Economic+Democracy+is+a+market+economy.+Hence+stimulating+consumer+demand+is+in+the+immediate+interest+of+every+enterprise%22&hl=en&ei=ADzZTePwLMiZOoSFweEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Economic%20Democracy%20is%20a%20market%20economy.%20Hence%20stimulating%20consumer%20demand%20is%20in%20the%20immediate%20interest%20of%20every%20enterprise%22&f=false|date=July 23, 2002|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|chapter=Chapter 5: Economic Democracy: Why We Need It; 5.7: Ecology, p. 156}}</ref>\n\n=== Lange\u2013Lerner model ===\nThe [[Lange model|Lange\u2013Lerner model]] involves public ownership of the means of production and the utilization of a trial-and-error approach to achieving equilibrium prices by a central planning board. The Central Planning Board would be responsible for setting prices through a trial-and-error approach to establish equilibrium prices, effectively acting as the abstract ''Walrasian auctioneer'' in Walrasian economics. Managers of the state-owned firms would be instructed to set prices to equal marginal cost (P=MC), so that economic equilibrium and [[Pareto efficiency]] would be achieved. The Lange model was expanded upon by the American economist [[Abba Lerner]] and became known as the Lange\u2013Lerner theorem, particularly the role of the social dividend. Forerunners of the Lange model include the neoclassical economists [[Enrico Barone]] and [[Fred M. Taylor]].\n\n=== Self-managed economy ===\nThe [[self-managed economy]] is a form of socialism where enterprises are owned and managed by their employees, effectively negating the employer-employee (or [[wage labor]]) dynamic of capitalism and emphasizing the opposition to [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], self-managing and cooperative aspect of socialism. Members of cooperative firms are relatively free to manage their own affairs and work schedules. This model was developed most extensively by the Yugoslav economists [[Branko Horvat]], [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and the American economist Benjamin Ward.\n\n=== Worker self-directed enterprise ===\n[[Workers' self-management|Worker self-directed enterprise]] is a recent proposal advocated by the American [[Marxian economist]] [[Richard D. Wolff]]. This model shares many similarities with the model of socialist self-management in that employees own and direct their enterprises, but places a greater role on democratically elected management within a market economy.\n\n=== Democratic planned socialism ===\nDemocratic planned socialism is a form of [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planned economy]].<ref name=\"Democratic Planned Socialism, 2002\">{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Al|title=Democratic Planned Socialism: Feasible Economic Procedures|journal=Science & Society|date=March 2002|volume=66|issue=1|pages=29\u201342|doi=10.1521/siso.66.1.29.21009|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/586a7aeeaa92eb204314dd0390e7644ab378a76b}}</ref>\n\n=== Feasible socialism ===\nFeasible socialism was the name [[Alec Nove]] gave his outline for socialism in his work ''The Economics of Feasible Socialism''. According to Nove, this model of socialism is \"feasible\" because it can be realized within the lifetime of anyone living today. It involves a combination of publicly owned and centrally directed enterprises for large-scale industries, autonomous publicly owned enterprises, consumer and worker-owned cooperatives for the majority of the economy, and private ownership for small businesses. It is a market-based mixed economy that includes a substantial role for macroeconomic interventionism and indicative economic planning.<ref>{{cite book|last= Nove|first= Alec|title= The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited|publisher= Routledge|year= 1991|isbn= 978-0043350492|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove}}</ref>\n\n=== Pragmatic market socialism ===\nThe American economist James Yunker detailed a model where social ownership of the means of production is achieved the same way private ownership is achieved in modern capitalism through the shareholder system that separates management functions from ownership. Yunker posits that social ownership can be achieved by having a public body, designated the Bureau of Public Ownership (BPO), owning the shares of publicly listed firms without affecting market-based allocation of capital inputs. Yunker termed this model pragmatic market socialism because it does not require massive changes to society and would leave the existing management system intact, and would be at least as efficient as modern-day capitalism while providing superior social outcomes as public ownership of large and established enterprises would enable profits to be distributed among the entire population in a social dividend rather than going largely to a class of inheriting [[Economic rent|rentiers]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Yunker|first= James|title= Socialism Revised and Modernized: The Case for Pragmatic Market Socialism|publisher= Praeger|date= April 1992|isbn= 978-0275941345|pages= [https://archive.org/details/socialismrevised00yunk/page/29 29\u201331]|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/socialismrevised00yunk/page/29}}</ref>\n\n=== Participatory economy ===\n[[Participatory economics]] utilizes participatory decision making as an economic mechanism to guide the production, consumption and allocation of resources in a given society.\n\n=== Computer-managed allocation ===\nProposals for utilizing computer-based coordination and information technology for the coordination and optimization of resource allocation (also known as [[cybernetics]]) within an economy have been outlined by various socialists, economists and computer scientists, including [[Oskar Lange]], the Soviet engineer [[Viktor Glushkov]], and more recently [[Paul Cockshott]] and Allin Cottrell.\n\n=== Peer-to-peer economy and open source ===\nThe \"networked information age\" has enabled the development and emergence of new forms of organizing the production of value in non-market arrangements that have been termed [[commons-based peer production]] along with the negation of ownership and the concept of property in the development of software in the form of [[open source]] and [[open design]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Schmitt and Anton|first= Richard and Anatole |title= Taking Socialism Seriously|publisher= Lexington Books|date=March 2012|isbn= 978-0739166352|page = 160|quote=Commons-based peer production bears a close family resemblance to the familiar vision of socialism sketched in the first paragraph of this chapter\u2026In commons-based peer production a critical mass of inputs, and all outputs, are distributed within information networks as free goods rather than as commodities to be sold for profit by capitalist firms.}}</ref>\n\n=== Negotiated coordination ===\nEconomist [[Pat Devine]] has created a model of coordination called \"negotiated coordination\", which is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved, with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gesd.free.fr/devine.pdf |title=Participatory Planning Through Negotiated Coordination |date= |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Elements of socialism in practice ==\nAlthough a number of economic systems have existed with various socialist attributes, or have been deemed socialist by their proponents, almost all of the economic systems listed below have largely retained elements of capitalism such as [[wage labor]], the [[accumulation of capital]], and [[commodity]] production. Nonetheless, various elements of a socialist economy have been implemented or experimented with in various economies throughout history.\n\nVarious forms of socialist organizational attributes have existed as minor modes of production within the context of a capitalist economy throughout history\u2014examples of this include [[Worker co-operative|cooperative enterprises]] in a capitalist economy, and the emerging free-software movement based on social [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer production]].\n\n=== Centrally planned economies ===\nA centrally planned economy combines public ownership of the means of production with [[Planned economy#Planned versus command economies|centralized state planning]]. This model is usually associated with the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type command economy]]. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency. In the early years of Soviet central planning, the planning process was based upon a selected number of physical flows with inputs mobilized to meet explicit production targets measured in natural or technical units. This [[Material balance planning|material balances]]&nbsp;method of achieving plan coherence was later complemented and replaced by value planning, with money provided to enterprises so that they could recruit labour and procure materials and intermediate production goods and services. The Soviet economy was brought to balance by the interlocking of three sets of calculation, namely the setting up of a model incorporating balances of production, manpower and finance. The exercise was undertaken annually and involved a process of iteration (the \"method of successive approximation\").<ref>[[Michael Kaser]], ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 150\u201351 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref> Although nominally a \"centrally planned\" economy, in reality formulation of the plan took place on a more local level of the production process as information was relayed from enterprises to planning ministries. Aside from the Soviet Union and [[Eastern Bloc]] economies, this economic model was also utilized by the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]], [[Republic of Cuba]] and [[North Korea]].\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\n<!-- Linked from Soviet economics. -->\n{{main|Economy of the Soviet Union}}\n{{see also|Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Gosplan|Ministry of Finance (Soviet Union)}}\nThe [[Soviet Union]] and some of its European satellites aimed for a fully centrally [[planned economy]]. They dispensed almost entirely with private ownership over the means of production. However, workers were still effectively paid a wage for their labour. Some believe that according to Marxist theory this should have been a step towards a genuine workers' state. However, some Marxists consider this a misunderstanding of Marx's views of [[historical materialism]] and his views of the process of socialization.\n\nThe characteristics of this model of economy were:\n* Production quotas for every productive unit. A farm, mine or factory was judged on the basis of whether its production met the quota. It would be provided with a quota of the inputs it needed to start production, and then its quota of output would be taken away and given to downstream production units or distributed to consumers.\n* Allocation through political control. In contrast with systems where prices ''determined'' allocation of resources, in the Soviet Union, allocation, particularly of means of production was determined by the bureaucracy. The prices that were constructed were done so ''after'' the formulation of the economy plan, and such prices did not factor into choices about what was produced and how it was produced in the first place.\n* Full employment. Every worker was ensured employment. However workers were generally not directed to jobs. The central planning administration adjusted relative wages rates to influence job choice in accordance with the outlines of the current plan.\n* Clearing goods by planning: if a surplus of a product was accumulated, then the central planning authority would either reduce the quota for its production or increase the quota for its use.\n* [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Five-year plans]] for the long-term development of key industries.\n\nThe planning system in the Soviet Union was introduced under Stalin between 1928 and 1934.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, p. 102 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref> Following the Second World War, in the seven countries with communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, central planning with five- (or six-) year plans on the Soviet model had been introduced by 1951. The common features were the nationalization of industry, transport and trade, compulsory procurement in farming (but not collectivization) and a monopoly on foreign trade.<ref>Kaser, M C in ''Economic Reforms in the Socialist World'', 1989, edited by Gomulka, Stanislav, Ha, Yong-Chool and Kim, Cae-One, New York: M E Sharpe, pp. 97\u201398.</ref> Prices were largely determined on the basis of the costs of inputs, a method derived from the labour theory of value. Prices did not therefore incentivize production enterprises whose inputs were instead purposely rationed by the central plan. This \"taut planning\" began around 1930 in the Soviet Union and was only attenuated after the economic reforms in 1966\u20131968 when enterprises were encouraged to make profits.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 172, 222 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the communist party, the stated purpose of planning was to enable the people through the party and state institutions to undertake activities that would have been frustrated by a market economy, including the rapid expansion of universal education and health care, urban development with mass good quality housing and industrial development of all regions of the country. Nevertheless, markets continued to exist in Soviet-type planned economies. Even after the collectivization of agriculture in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, members of the collective farm and anyone with a private garden plot were free to sell their own produce (farm workers were often paid in kind). Licensed markets operated in every town and city borough where non-state-owned enterprises (such as cooperatives and collective farms) were able to offer their products and services. From 1956 and 1959 onwards, all wartime controls over manpower were removed and people could apply and quit jobs freely in the Soviet Union. The use of market mechanisms went furthest in Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. From 1975, Soviet citizens had the right to engage in private handicraft and collective farmers could raise and sell livestock privately in 1981. It should also be noted that households were free to dispose of their income as they chose and incomes were lightly taxed.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Economics'', 1970, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, pp. 94\u201395, 107, 111\u201312, 127, 148, 165 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref>\n\n===== Dispute that the Soviet model is socialism =====\nVarious scholars and political economists have criticized the claim that the centrally planned economy and specifically the Soviet model of economic development constitutes a form of socialism. They argue that the Soviet economy was structured upon the [[accumulation of capital]] and the extraction of [[surplus value]] from the working class by the planning agency in order to reinvest this surplus into the economy and to distribute to managers and senior officials, indicating the Soviet Union and other Soviet-style economies were [[state capitalist]] economies.<ref>Chomsky, Noam (1986).

In macroeconomic terms, the plan allocated the whole national product to workers in the form of wages for the workers' own use, with a fraction withheld for investment and imports from abroad. The difference between the average value of wages and the value of national output per worker did not imply the existence of surplus value since it was part of a consciously formulated plan for the development of society.<ref>John Eaton, ''Political Economy: A Marxist Textbook'', 1949, London: Lawrence and Wishart, pp. 182\u201383.</ref> The presence of inequality in the socialist planned economies did not imply that an exploiting class existed. In the Soviet Union, communist party members were able to buy scarce goods in special shops and the leadership elite took advantage of state property to live in more spacious accommodation and sometimes luxury. Although they received privileges not commonly available and some additional income in kind, there was no difference in their official remuneration in comparison to their non-party peers.

This analysis is consistent with Lenin's [[April Theses]] in which he stated that the goal of the Bolshevik revolution was not the introduction of socialism which could only be established on a worldwide scale, but that it was intended to bring production and the state under the control of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies. Furthermore, these communist states often do not claim to have achieved [[socialism]] in their countries; on the contrary, they claim to be building and working toward the establishment of socialism in their countries. For example, the preamble to the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]'s constitution states that Vietnam only entered a transition stage between capitalism and socialism after the country was re-unified under the Communist party in 1976,<ref>[http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ VN Embassy&nbsp;\u2013 Constitution of 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709162321/http://www.vietnamembassy-usa.org/learn_about_vietnam/politics/constitution/ |date=2011-07-09 }} Full Text.

The [[1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union]], known as the Fundamental Law of Victorious Socialism, embodied the claim that the foundations for socialism had been laid.<ref>V Kashin and N Cherkasov, ''What is the Transition Period?'', 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 140\u201341.</ref> Stalin introduced the theory of [[socialism in one country]] which argued that socialism can be built in a single country, despite existing in a global capitalist economic system. Nevertheless, it was recognized that the stage during which developed socialism would be built would be a lengthy one and would not be achieved by the Soviet Union on its own. According to the official textbooks, the first stage of the transition period from capitalism to socialism had been completed by the 1970s in the European socialist countries (except Poland and Yugoslavia) and in Mongolia and Cuba. The next stage of developed socialism would not be reached until \"the economic integration of the socialist states becomes a major factor of their economic progress\" and social relations had been reconstructed on \"collectivist principles\".<ref>V Kashin and N Cherkasov, ''What is the Transition Period?'', 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 142\u201344; Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, ''What is Political Economy?'', 1986 Moscow: Progress Publishers, p. 325.</ref> Communist writers accepted that during these earlier stages in constructing socialism the exchange of commodities on the basis of the average socially necessary labour embodied within them occurred and involved the mediation of money. Socialist planned economies were systems of commodity production but this was directed in a conscious way towards meeting the needs of the people and not left to the \"anarchy of the market\".<ref>John Eaton, ''Political Economy: A Marxist Textbook'', 1949, London: Lawrence and Wishart, pp. 179\u201382; Stalin, J V, ''Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR'' (1952) in ''Selected Works Volume 1'', 2012, Kolkata: Prometheus, pp. 317\u201325.</ref> At the stage of developed socialism, \"the state of dictatorship of the proletariat changes into a state of all people reflecting the increasing homogeneity of society\" and the \"evening out of economic development levels\" within and between socialist countries.

Only then could the world socialist system progress towards the higher phase of communism.<ref>V Kashin and N Cherkasov, ''What is the Transition Period?'', 1987, Moscow: Progress Publishers, p. 144; Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, ''What is Political Economy?'', 1986 Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 323\u201326, 330.</ref>\n\n==== World socialist economic system ====\nBy the 1980s, the world economic socialist system embraced one-third of the world\u2019s population but generated no more than 15 percent of global economic output. At its height in the mid-1980s, the world socialist system could be said to comprise the following countries with a \"socialist orientation\", though not all were allies of the Soviet Union: Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Eastern Germany, Ethiopia, Hungary, Mozambique, Nicaragua, North Korea, Laos, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Vietnam, South Yemen, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.<ref>Marie Lavigne, ''International Political Economy and Socialism'', 1991, Cambridge University Press, pp. 54\u201355 {{ISBN|0-521-33427-6}}.</ref> The system co-existed alongside the world capitalist system but was founded upon the principles of cooperation and mutual assistance rather than upon competition and rivalry The countries involved aimed to even-out the level of economic development and to play an equal part in the international division of labour. An important role was played by the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) or [[Comecon]], an international body set up to promote economic development. It involved joint planning activity, the establishment of international economic, scientific and technical bodies and methods of cooperation between state agencies and enterprises, including joint ventures and projects.<ref>Sergei Ilyin and Alexander Motylev, ''What is Political Economy?'', 1986, Moscow: Progress Publishers, pp. 322\u201324.</ref> Allied to the CMEA were the International Development Bank, established in 1971; and the International Bank for Economic Cooperation, founded in 1963, which had their parallel in the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund in the non-socialist world.<ref>Kaser, M C, ''Comecon: Integration problems of the planned economies'', 1967, Oxford University Press, p. 170 {{ISBN|0-303-17565-6}}.</ref>\n\nThe main tasks of the CMEA were plan coordination, production specialization and regional trade. In 1961 Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, put forward proposals for establishing an integrated, centrally planned socialist commonwealth in which each geographic region would specialize production in line with its set of natural and human resources. The resulting document, the \"Basic Principles of the International Socialist Division of Labour\" was adopted at the end of 1961, despite objections from Romania on certain aspects. The \"Basic Principles\" were never implemented fully and were replaced in 1971 by the adoption of the \"Comprehensive Programme for Further Extension and Improvement of Cooperation and Development of Socialist Economic Integration\". As a result, many specialization agreements were made between CMEA member states for investment programmes and projects. The importing country pledged to rely on the exporting country for its consumption of the product in question. Production specialization occurred in engineering, automotive, chemicals, computers and automation, telecommunications and biotechnology. Scientific and technical cooperation between CMEA member states was facilitated by the establishment in 1969 of the International Centre for Scientific and Technical Information  in Moscow.<ref>Jenny Brine, ''Comecon: The rise and fall of an international socialist organization'', 1992, New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University/Transaction, p. xii {{ISBN|1-56000-080-5}}.</ref>\n\nTrade between CMEA member states was divided into \"hard goods\" and \"soft goods\". The former could be sold on world markets and the latter could not.

However, in practice this meant that investment was shifted towards new branches of industry, including the electronics, computing, automotive and nuclear power sectors, leaving the traditional heavy industries dependent upon older technologies. Despite the rhetoric about modernization, innovation remained weak as enterprise managers preferred routine production that was easier to plan and brought them predictable bonuses. Embargoes on high technology exports organized through the US-supported [[CoCom]] arrangement hampered technology transfer. Enterprise managers also ignored inducements to introduce labour-saving measures as they wished to retain a reserve of personnel to be available to meet their production target by working at top speed when supplies were delayed.<ref>[[Archie Brown]], and [[Michael Kaser]], ''Soviet Policy for the 1980s'', 1982, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, pp. 188, 194, 200, 208 {{ISBN|0-253-35412-9}}; Simon Clarke (editor), ''Structural Adjustment without Mass Unemployment?

Enterprises faced a resource constraint and hoarded labour and other inputs and avoided sub-contracting intermediate production activities, preferring to retain the work in-house. The enterprise, according to the theory promulgated by [[J\u00e1nos Kornai]], was constrained by its resources not by the demand for its goods and services; nor was it constrained by its finances since the government was not likely to shut it down if it failed to meet its financial targets. Enterprises in socialist planned economies operated within a \"soft\" budget constraint, unlike enterprises in capitalist market economies which are demand-constrained and operate within \"hard\" budget constraints, as they face bankruptcy if their costs exceed their sales. As all producers were working in a resource-constrained economy they were perpetually in short supply and the shortages could never be eliminated, leading to chronic disruption of production schedules. The effect of this was to preserve a high level of employment.<ref>J\u00e1nos Kornai, \u2018\u2019Economics of Shortage\u2019\u2019, Amsterdam: North Holland; Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 60, 130\u201335, 248 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref>\n\nAs the supply of consumer goods failed to match rising incomes (because workers still received their pay even if they were not fully productive), household savings accumulated, indicating, in the official terminology, \"postponed demand\". Western economists called this \"[[monetary overhang]]\" or \"repressed inflation\". Prices on the black market were several times higher than in the official price-controlled outlets, reflecting the scarcity and possible illegality of the sale of these items. Therefore, although consumer welfare was reduced by shortages, the prices households paid for their regular consumption were lower than would have been the case had prices been set at market-clearing levels.<ref>Brown, A, and Kaser, M C, ''The Soviet Union Since the Fall of Khrushchev'', 1978, London: Macmillan, pp. 212\u201314 {{ISBN|0-333-23337-9}}; Brown, A, and Kaser, M C, ''Soviet Policy for the 1980s'', 1982, Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, p. 193 {{ISBN|0-253-35412-9}}; Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 61, 130\u201335 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the 1980s it became clear that the CMEA area was \"in crisis\", although it remained viable economically and was not expected to collapse.<ref>Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 76 and 248 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref> The \"extensive\" growth model was retarding growth in the CMEA as a whole, with member countries dependent upon supplies of raw materials from the USSR and upon the Soviet market for sales of goods. The decline in growth rates reflected a combination of diminishing returns to capital accumulation and low innovation as well as micro-economic inefficiencies, which a high rate of saving and investment was unable to counter. The CMEA was supposed to ensure coordination of national plans but it failed even to develop a common methodology for planning which could be adopted by its member states. As each member state was reluctant to give up national self-sufficiency the CMEA\u2019s efforts to encourage specialization was thwarted. There were very few joint ventures and therefore little intra-enterprise technology transfer and trade, which in the capitalist world was often undertaken by trans-national corporations. The International Bank for Economic Cooperation had no means of converting a country\u2019s trade surplus into an option to buy goods and services from other CMEA members.<ref>Marie Lavigne, ''The Economies of Transition: From socialist economy to market economy'', 1995, London: Macmillan, pp. 52\u201354 and 75\u201376 {{ISBN|0-333-52731-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Transition to market economies ===\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, many of the remaining [[socialist state]]s presiding over centrally planned economies began introducing reforms that shifted their economies away from centralized planning. In Central and Eastern Europe and the USSR the transition from a planned economy to a market economy was accompanied by the transformation of the socialist [[mode of production]] to a capitalist mode of production. In Asia (China, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam) and in Cuba market mechanisms were introduced by the ruling communist parties and the planning system was reformed without systemic transformation.\n\nThe transformation from socialism to capitalism involved a political shift: from a people\u2019s democracy (see [[People's Republic]] and [[Communist state]]) with a constitutionally entrenched \"leading role\" for the communist and workers\u2019 parties in society to a liberal [[representative democracy]] with a separation of legislative, executive and judicial authorities and centres of private power that can act as a brake on the state\u2019s activity.<ref>Boris Putrin, ''Political Terms: A short guide'', 1982, Moscow: Novosti, p. 63; Samuel E Finer, ''Comparative Government'', 1974, Harmondsworth: Penguin, pp. 66\u201371 {{ISBN|0-140-21170-5}}.</ref>\n\nVietnam adopted an economic model it formally titled the ''socialist-oriented market economy''.

In several countries property was restored to its former owners or their legal successors. If the actual property could not be returned the former owners received compensation. This occurred in Eastern Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Estonia. In all the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the government decided against restoration or compensation on the grounds that too much time had elapsed and in many cases compensation had already been made through bilateral treaties between the USSR and foreign governments representing the former owners.

The [[Great Leap Forward]] saw a remarkably large-scale experiment with rapid collectivisation of agriculture, and other ambitious goals. Results were less than expected, (e.g., there were food shortages and mass starvation) and the program was abandoned after  three years.

They can be regarded as [[social democratic]] experiments, because they universally retained a wage-based economy and private ownership and control of the decisive means of production.\n\nNevertheless, these western European countries tried to restructure their economies away from a [[Laissez-faire|purely private]] capitalist model.

Advantages of nationalization include: the ability of the state to direct [[investment]] in key industries, the distribution of state [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from nationalized industries for the overall national good, the ability to direct producers to social rather than market goals, greater control of the industries by and for the workers, and the benefits and burdens of publicly funded research and development are extended to the wider populace.\n* [[Redistribution of wealth]], through both tax and spending policies that aim to reduce economic inequalities. Social democracies typically employ various forms of [[progressive taxation]] regarding wage and business income, wealth, inheritance, capital gains and property. On the spending side, a set of social policies typically provides free access to public services such as education, health care and child care, while subsidized access to housing, food, pharmaceutical goods, water supply, waste management and electricity is also common.\n* [[Social security]] schemes where workers contribute to a mandatory public insurance program. The insurance typically include monetary provisions for retirement pensions and survivor benefits, permanent and temporary disabilities, unemployment and [[parental leave]]. Unlike private insurance, governmental schemes are based on public statutes and not contracts, so that contributions and benefits may change in time and are based on solidarity among participants. Its funding is done on an ongoing basis, without direct relationship with future liabilities.\n* [[Minimum wages]], employment protection and [[trade union]] recognition rights for the benefit of workers. The objectives of these policies are to guarantee living wages and help produce [[full employment]]. There are a number of different models of trade union protection which evolved, but they all guarantee the right of workers to form unions, negotiate benefits and participate in strikes. Germany, for instance, appointed union representatives at high levels in all corporations and had much less industrial strife than the UK, whose laws encouraged [[Strike action|strikes]] rather than negotiation.\n* [[Indicative planning|National planning]] for industrial development.\n* [[Demand management]] in a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]] fashion to help ensure economic growth and employment.\n\n==== State capitalism ====\n{{main|State capitalism}}\nVarious social democratic mixed economies are state capitalist, consisting of large commercial [[state enterprise]]s that operate according to the laws of capitalism and pursue profits, that have evolved in countries which have been influenced by various [[Socialist party|elected socialist political parties]] and their economic reforms. While these policies and reforms did not change the fundamental aspect of capitalism and non-socialist elements within these countries supported or often implemented many of these reforms themselves, the result has been a set of economic institutions that were at least partly influenced by socialist ideology.\n\n===== India =====\n{{main|Economy of India}}\nAfter gaining independence from Britain, [[India]] adopted a broadly socialist-inspired approach to economic growth. Like other countries with a democratic transition to a [[mixed economy]], it did not abolish private property in capital. India proceeded by nationalizing various large privately run firms, creating state-owned enterprises and redistributing income through progressive taxation in a manner similar to social democratic Western European nations than to planned economies such as the Soviet Union or China. Today, India is often characterized as having a [[free-market economy]] that combines economic planning with the [[free-market]]. However, it did adopt a very firm focus on [[Indicative planning|national planning]] with a series of broad [[Five-Year Plans of India|five-year plans]].\n\n===== Norway =====\nModern Norwegian state capitalism has its origins in public ownership of the country's oil reserves and in the country's [[post-World War II]] [[social democratic]] reforms.

[[Taiwan's economy]] includes a number of state-owned enterprises, but the Taiwanese state's role in the economy shifted from that of an entrepreneur to a minority investor in companies alongside the democratization agenda of the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dittmer |first= Lowell |title= Taiwan and China: Fitful Embrace |publisher= University of California Press|year= 2017|isbn= 978-0520295988|page = 118|quote=A decade after Taiwan made its democratic transition, the KMT's Leninist control model has yet to fade from the decision-making process.

Private property in the means of production was abolished so that individuals and co-operative associations of producers owned productive property and introduced democratic measures where elected officials received no more in compensation than the average worker and could be recalled at any time.<ref>{{cite web|author=Karl Marx |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm |title=The Civil War in France |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> Anarchists also participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. [[George Woodcock]] manifests that \"a notable contribution to the activities of the Commune and particularly to the organization of public services was made by members of various anarchist factions, including the mutualists Courbet, Longuet, and Vermorel, the [[Collectivist anarchism|libertarian collectivists]] Varlin, Malon, and Lefrangais, and the [[bakunin]]ists Elie and [[Elis\u00e9e Reclus]] and [[Louise Michel]].<ref name=\"Anarchism 1962\">[[George Woodcock]].

New forms of socialist institutional arrangements began to take form at the end of the 20th century with the advancement and proliferation of the internet and other tools that allow for collaborative decision-making.\n\n[[Michel Bauwens]] identifies the emergence of the open software movement and [[Social peer-to-peer processes|peer-to-peer production]] as an emergent alternative [[mode of production]] to the capitalist economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources, and the (direct) production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital.<ref name=\"Ctheory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=499|title=The Political Economy of Peer Production|date=2005-01-12|author=|publisher=CTheory}}</ref>\n\n[[Commons-based peer production]] generally involves developers who produce goods and services with no aim to profit directly, but freely contribute to a project relying upon an open common pool of resources and software code.

Rather than implementing a centrally planned economy, Yugoslavia developed a market socialist system where enterprises and firms were [[Cooperative|socially owned]] rather than publicly owned by the state. In these organizations, the management was elected directly by the workers in each firm, and were later organized according to [[Edvard Kardelj]]'s theory of associated labor.\n\n==== Self-managed enterprises ====\n{{see also|Cooperative}}\nThe [[Mondragon Corporation]], a federation of cooperatives in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] region of Spain, organizes itself as an employee-owned, employee-managed enterprise. Similar styles of decentralized management, which embrace cooperation and collaboration in place of traditional hierarchical management structures, have been adopted by various private corporations such as [[Cisco Systems]], inc.<ref>{{cite web|last=McGirt |first=Ellen |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/131/revolution-in-san-jose.html |title=How Cisco's CEO John Chambers Is Turning the Tech Giant Socialist &#124; Fast Company &#124; Business + Innovation |publisher=Fast Company |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref> But unlike Mondragon, Cisco remains firmly under private ownership. More fundamentally, employee-owned, self-managed enterprises still operate within the broader context of capitalism and are subject to the accumulation of capital and profit-loss mechanism.\n\n=== Anarchist Spain ===\n{{main|Spanish Revolution of 1936}}\n{{see also|Anarcho-syndicalism}}\nIn Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939).<ref>{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|authorlink=Antony Beevor|year=2006|page=46|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936\u20131939|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson|location=London|isbn=978-0-297-84832-5}}</ref> In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[Collective farming|collectivised]] the land.<ref name='Bolloten 1984, p.54'>{{cite book | last = Bolloten | first = Burnett | authorlink = Burnett Bolloten | title = The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | date = 15 November 1984 | location = | page =1107 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-8078-1906-7 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| last = Bolloten | first = Burnett | authorlink = Burnett Bolloten | title = The Spanish Civil War: Revolution and Counterrevolution | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | date = 15 November 1984 | location = | page =1107 | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-8078-1906-7 }}</ref> But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the [[Soviet Union]]. The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' [[social revolution]] that began during the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist]] and more broadly [[libertarian socialist]] organizational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily [[Catalonia]], Aragon, [[Andalusia]], and parts of [[Levante, Spain|the Levante]]. Much of [[Spain's economy]] was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like [[Catalonia]], the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] influence, as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-allied party actively resisted attempts at [[collectivization]] enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, [[agriculture|agrarian]] areas became collectivised and run as [[Libertarian socialism|libertarian]] [[Commune (intentional community)|communes]].

Besides this, some socialist economic theories are criticized by other socialists. Libertarian socialist, mutualist and other market socialist economists criticize centralized economic planning and propose [[participatory economics]] and decentralized socialism.\n\nMarket economists generally criticize socialism for eliminating the free market and its [[price signal]]s which they consider necessary for rational economic calculation. They also consider that it causes a lack of incentive and believe that these problems lead to a slower rate of technological advance and a slower rate of growth of GDP.\n\nAustrian School economists such as [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[Ludwig von Mises]] have argued that the elimination of private ownership of the [[means of production]] would inevitably create worse economic conditions for the general populace than those that would be found in market economies. They argue that without the price signals of the market it is impossible to calculate rationally how to allocate resources. Mises called this the [[economic calculation problem]]. Polish economist [[Oskar Lange]] and [[Abba Lerner]] responded to Mises' argument by developing the [[Lange Model]] during the [[economic calculation debate]]. The Lange model argues that an economy in which all production is performed by the state, where there is a functioning price mechanism, has similar properties to a market economy under perfect competition in that it achieves [[Pareto efficiency]].\n\nThe neoclassical view is that there is a lack of incentive, not a lack of information in a planned economy. They argue that within a socialist planned economy there is a lack of incentive to act on information. Therefore, the crucial missing element is not so much information as the Austrian School argued as it is the motivation to act on information.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heilbroner|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Heilbroner|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Socialism.html|title=Socialism|series=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty|date=2008|edition=2nd|accessdate=18 June 2017}}<!-- Note: This is an original essay for the CEE, not available from other sources. --></ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{too many see alsos|date=July 2019}}\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Anarchist economics]]\n* [[Anarcho-communism]]\n* [[Basic income]]\n* [[Collectivist anarchism]]\n* [[Communism]]\n* [[Complexity economics]]\n* [[Collectivism]]\n* [[Economic calculation debate]]\n* [[Economic democracy]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Evolutionary economics]]\n* [[Fair trade]]\n* [[Feminist economics]]\n* [[Gandhian economics]]\n* [[History of economic thought]]\n* [[Indicative planning]]\n* [[Job guarantee]]\n* [[Labour economics]]\n* [[List of socialist economists]]\n* [[Market socialism]]\n* [[Marxian economics]]\n* [[Mutualism (economic theory)]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Cooperative|Cooperative stock market]]\n* [[Nationalization]]\n* [[Participatory economics]]\n* [[Planned economy]]\n* [[Post-capitalism]]\n* [[Production for use]]\n* [[Public banking]]\n* [[Ricardian socialism]]\n* [[Syndicalism]]\n* [[Social dividend]]\n* [[Socialist market economy]]\n* [[Socialism (Marxism)|Socialist mode of production]]\n* [[Socialization (economics)]]\n* [[Welfare economics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Michael Albert|Albert, Michael]]; Hahnel, Robin: ''[https://zcomm.org/wp-content/uploads/zbooks/www/books/polpar.htm The Political Economy of Participatory Economics]'', Princeton University Press, 1991.

Parliament, which consists of the [[House of Lords]] and the elected House of Commons, was [[State Opening of Parliament|convened]] on 25 May 2010 at the [[Palace of Westminster]] by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].

Peers elected former [[Crossbencher]] [[Frances D'Souza, Baroness D'Souza|Baroness D'Souza]] to replace her. From the start of this Parliament the Lords were \"led\" by [[Thomas Galbraith, 2nd Baron Strathclyde|Lord Strathclyde]] without an [[absolute majority]] on his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] benches.  In January 2013 he stood down and was succeeded by [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Lord Hill of Oareford]].\n\nNotable newcomers in this general election included [[Liz Kendall]], [[Guto Bebb]], [[Gloria De Piero]], [[Sajid Javid]], [[Michael Dugher]], [[Amber Rudd]], [[Lisa Nandy]], [[Damian Hinds]], [[Anna Soubry]], [[Heidi Alexander]], [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]], [[Alison McGovern]], [[Chris Williamson (politician)|Chris Williamson]], [[Owen Smith]], [[Nicky Morgan]], [[Tristram Hunt]], [[Dan Poulter]], [[Esther McVey]], [[Priti Patel]], [[Luciana Berger]], [[Karen Bradley]], [[Chuka Umunna]], [[Louise Mensch]], [[Dominic Raab]], [[Tracey Crouch]], [[Valerie Vaz]] and [[Caroline Lucas]].\n\nDuring the 2010\u201315 Parliament, [[John Bercow]] was the Speaker, [[David Cameron]] served as Prime Minister, and [[Harriet Harman]] and [[Ed Miliband]] served as Leader of the Opposition.\n\n==House of Commons composition (2010 and 2015)==\n[[File:House_of_Commons_2010.jpg|thumb|The Commons chamber immediately prior to the first Queen's Speech debate]]\nThese are graphical representations of the House of Commons showing a comparison of party strengths as it was directly after the 2010 general election and before the 2015 general election:\n\n[[File:House of Commons (Start of 55th Parliament).svg|frameless|560x560px]][[File:House of Commons (End of 55th Parliament).svg|frameless|560x560px]]\n\nThis table shows the number of MPs in each party:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;\" | '''Affiliation'''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | '''Members'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Current State of the Parties: Dissolution of Parliament|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/|publisher=www.Parliament.uk|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> \n|-\n!

This happens as a result of the election of Deputy Speakers, by-elections, defections, suspensions or removal of [[whip (politics)|whip]].\n\nTechnically, [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|MPs cannot resign]]. However, they can effectively do so by requesting to be appointed as the [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead]] or the [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham]], which vacates their seat.\n\nThe net outcome of all changes at the dissolution of Parliament resulted in four fewer Conservative MPs, two fewer Labour MPs, one fewer Liberal Democrat MP, four more independent MPs, the addition of one Respect MP and the addition of two UKIP MPs. This resulted in a reduction of the actual government majority from eighty-three to seventy-three. Both Respect and UKIP were previously unrepresented in the fifty-fifth Parliament. This was the first time that candidates standing for UKIP had been elected to the House of Commons.\n\n===Deputy Speakers===\nAlthough Deputy Speakers do not resign from their parties, they cease to vote (except to break ties) and they do not participate in party-political activity until the next election.\n*[[Lindsay Hoyle]] (Lab, [[Chorley (UK Parliament constituency)|Chorley]]) was elected [[Chairman of Ways and Means]].\n*[[Nigel Evans]] (Con, [[Ribble Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Ribble Valley]]) was elected First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and held the position until his resignation on 10 September 2013.<ref name=\"Evans\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24048954 | title=Nigel Evans to carry on as independent MP despite sex charges | work=[[BBC News]] | date=11 September 2013 | accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Dawn Primarolo]] (Lab, [[Bristol South (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South]]) was elected Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means.\n*[[Eleanor Laing]] (Con, [[Epping Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping Forest]]) was elected First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means on 16 October 2013.<ref name=\"Conservative MP Eleanor Laing elected deputy Speaker\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24553607 | title=Conservative MP Eleanor Laing elected deputy Speaker | work=[[BBC News]] | date=16 October 2013 | accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===By-elections===\n{{main|List of United Kingdom by-elections (1979\u2013present)#2010-2015 Parliament}}\nBy-elections are held for seats that become vacant.

Parliament, which consists of the [[House of Lords]] and the elected House of Commons, was [[State Opening of Parliament|convened]] on 25 May 2010 at the [[Palace of Westminster]] by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. It was [[Dissolution of Parliament#United Kingdom|dissolved]] at the beginning of 30 March 2015, being 25 working days ahead of the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] on 7 May 2015.\n\nThe election saw each of Parliament's 650 [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituencies]] return one MP to the House of Commons. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[David Cameron]], became the single largest party, though without an overall majority. This resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. A [[Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|coalition agreement]] was then formed following negotiations with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] and their leader [[Nick Clegg]]. [[John Bercow]] resumed his role as [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. In September 2010, [[Ed Miliband]] won a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership vote to succeed [[Gordon Brown]] as permanent [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]].\n\nIn the House of Lords, [[Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman|Baroness Hayman]] (ex-Labour) resumed her role as [[Lord Speaker]] until the end of her five-year term in 2011, after which she did not seek re-election in the house. Peers elected former [[Crossbencher]] [[Frances D'Souza, Baroness D'Souza|Baroness D'Souza]] to replace her. From the start of this Parliament the Lords were \"led\" by [[Thomas Galbraith, 2nd Baron Strathclyde|Lord Strathclyde]] without an [[absolute majority]] on his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] benches.  In January 2013 he stood down and was succeeded by [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Lord Hill of Oareford]].\n\nNotable newcomers in this general election included [[Liz Kendall]], [[Guto Bebb]], [[Gloria De Piero]], [[Sajid Javid]], [[Michael Dugher]], [[Amber Rudd]], [[Lisa Nandy]], [[Damian Hinds]], [[Anna Soubry]], [[Heidi Alexander]], [[Jacob Rees-Mogg]], [[Alison McGovern]], [[Chris Williamson (politician)|Chris Williamson]], [[Owen Smith]], [[Nicky Morgan]], [[Tristram Hunt]], [[Dan Poulter]], [[Esther McVey]], [[Priti Patel]], [[Luciana Berger]], [[Karen Bradley]], [[Chuka Umunna]], [[Louise Mensch]], [[Dominic Raab]], [[Tracey Crouch]], [[Valerie Vaz]] and [[Caroline Lucas]].\n\nDuring the 2010-15 Parliament, [[John Bercow]] was the Speaker, [[David Cameron]] served as Prime Minister, and [[Harriet Harman]] and [[Ed Miliband]] served as Leader of the Opposition.\n\n==House of Commons composition (2010 and 2015)==\n[[File:House_of_Commons_2010.jpg|thumb|The Commons chamber immediately prior to the first Queen's Speech debate]]\nThese are graphical representations of the House of Commons showing a comparison of party strengths as it was directly after the 2010 general election and before the 2015 general election:\n\n[[File:House of Commons (Start of 55th Parliament).svg|frameless|560x560px]][[File:House of Commons (End of 55th Parliament).svg|frameless|560x560px]]\n\nThis table shows the number of MPs in each party:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;vertical-align:middle;\" | '''Affiliation'''\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"vertical-align:top;\" | '''Members'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Current State of the Parties: Dissolution of Parliament|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/mps/current-state-of-the-parties/|publisher=www.Parliament.uk|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref> \n|-\n!

This happens as a result of the election of Deputy Speakers, by-elections, defections, suspensions or removal of [[whip (politics)|whip]].\n\nTechnically, [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|MPs cannot resign]]. However, they can effectively do so by requesting to be appointed as the [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead]] or the [[Crown Steward and Bailiff of the three Chiltern Hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham]], which vacates their seat.\n\nThe net outcome of all changes at the dissolution of Parliament resulted in four fewer Conservative MPs, two fewer Labour MPs, one fewer Liberal Democrat MP, four more independent MPs, the addition of one Respect MP and the addition of two UKIP MPs. This resulted in a reduction of the actual government majority from eighty-three to seventy-three. Both Respect and UKIP were previously unrepresented in the fifty-fifth Parliament. This was the first time that candidates standing for UKIP had been elected to the House of Commons.\n\n===Deputy Speakers===\nAlthough Deputy Speakers do not resign from their parties, they cease to vote (except to break ties) and they do not participate in party-political activity until the next election.\n*[[Lindsay Hoyle]] (Lab, [[Chorley (UK Parliament constituency)|Chorley]]) was elected [[Chairman of Ways and Means]].\n*[[Nigel Evans]] (Con, [[Ribble Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Ribble Valley]]) was elected First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means and held the position until his resignation on 10 September 2013.<ref name=\"Evans\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24048954 | title=Nigel Evans to carry on as independent MP despite sex charges | work=[[BBC News]] | date=11 September 2013 | accessdate=11 September 2013}}</ref>\n*[[Dawn Primarolo]] (Lab, [[Bristol South (UK Parliament constituency)|Bristol South]]) was elected Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means.\n*[[Eleanor Laing]] (Con, [[Epping Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping Forest]]) was elected First Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means on 16 October 2013.<ref name=\"Conservative MP Eleanor Laing elected deputy Speaker\">{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24553607 | title=Conservative MP Eleanor Laing elected deputy Speaker | work=[[BBC News]] | date=16 October 2013 | accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n===By-elections===\n{{main|List of United Kingdom by-elections (1979\u2013present)#2010-2015 Parliament}}\nBy-elections are held for seats that become vacant.
