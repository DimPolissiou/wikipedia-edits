Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education|Swann]]'' decision, which supported busing programs to integrate school districts to remedy ''[[de jure]]'' [[Racial segregation|segregation]], but opposed it to remedy ''[[de facto]]'' segregation, as in Delaware. He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment. Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]] (R-PA) and Majority Leader [[Mike Mansfield]] (D-MT) offered to leave the text of Griffin's amendment intact but add the qualifier that such legislation was not intended to weaken the judiciary's power to enforce the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendments]] of the U.S. Constitution.

Biden spoke to the auditorium and said his position on school busing was evolving, emphasizing that busing in Delaware was in his opinion beyond court restrictions. The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing. Biden and anti-busing senators wanted to limit the scope of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title VI\u2014nondiscrimination in federally assisted programs|Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] with respect to the federal government's power to enforce school integration policies.<ref name=\"Gadsen\" /> After 1975, Biden took a harsher line on further legislative action to limit busing.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> That year, Helms proposed an anti-integration amendment to an education bill that would stop the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]] (HEW) from collecting data about students' or teachers' races and thereby prevent it from defunding districts that refused to integrate. Biden supported this amendment, saying: \"I am sure it comes as a surprise to some of my colleagues{{nbsp}}... that a senator with a voting record such as mine stands up and supports\" it.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=220\u2013221}} He said busing was a \"bankrupt idea [that violated] the cardinal rule of common sense\", and that his opposition would make it easier for other liberals to follow suit.<ref name=\"cby-44\" /> But he had also supported integrationist Senator [[Edward Brooke]]'s (R-MA) initiatives on housing, job opportunities and voting rights.<ref name=\"Sokol\" /> Civil rights lawyer and NAACP Legal Defense Fund director [[Jack Greenberg]] criticized Biden's support for the bill, saying it \"heave[d] a brick through the window of school integration\", with Biden's hand on the brick.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ross |first1=Janell |title=Joe Biden didn't just compromise with segregationists.

The Reagan Foundation funds the permanent Reagan Museum and all of the special exhibits that come to the Presidential Library.

November 5, 1996, \"Doer's Profile - John D. Heubusch\"</ref> before graduating from Virginia Tech in 1980 with a B.A. in English and political science. He later earned an M.A. in National Security Studies from Georgetown University.  Heubusch began his career in 1980 as a research analyst for the [[Department of the Air Force]]'s Office of Public Affairs, writing speeches and preparing the early-morning newsclips for Pentagon brass and staff.<ref name=\"auto2\">''Congressional Staff Directory'', 1987 edition (CSD Ltd, Mt Vernon VA), Charles Brownson, ed., p. 813</ref>\n\nHe moved to Capitol Hill in 1981, landing a job as a legislative aide to Republican Congressman [[Denny Smith]] of Oregon. Eventually, Heubusch was named as Smith's chief of staff, while also serving as a House Budget Committee staffer, with a focus on defense.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Rep. Smith, a conservative former fighter pilot, was keen on rooting out Pentagon waste and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of defense equipment and systems. Concerned about the poor quality of weapons testing to ensure combat readiness, Smith was instrumental in creating the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) in 1983 as part of the Defense Authorization bill. (Heubusch helped craft Smith's amendment.)  The idea was to create an independent office within the Defense Department that would act as a testing watchdog; despite some good work, OT&E later became part of the cover-up of poorly designed weapons systems.<ref>Church, Foster, ''The Oregonian'', July 11, 1988, \"Smith in the Middle of Aegis Issue\"</ref>\n\nSmith was forced to step up his work on the 133-member Military Reform Caucus (with Heubusch as staff director). Their efforts led to:\n\n* The eventual abandonment of the Sergeant York (DIVAD) air-defense system. Smith's OT&E conducted tests on the self-propelled anti-aircraft gun in 1984 and 1985, after the Congressman had blasted the York and called for a performance review, and the results were abysmal.<ref name=time>Bruce van Voost and Amy Wilentz, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959780,00.html \"No More Time for Sergeant York\"], ''Time'', 9 September 1985</ref> The director of OT&E reported the DIVAD was \"not operationally effective,\" and shortly thereafter, Defense Secretary [[Caspar Weinberger]] cancelled the program after only 50 had been built.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050466,00.html \"Gunning for Sergeant York\"], ''Time'', August 1985</ref> Heubusch later called DIVAD \"one of the lemons of the 1980s.\"<ref>Vartabedian, P.H., ''Los Angeles Times'',  January 13, 1990, \"Image Problem May Make It Hard to Find a Buyer for Ford Aerospace Defense: The unit's odd assortment of products means it will likely be broken up and sold piecemeal\"</ref>\n* The re-armoring and refitting of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle by the Army.  This followed the revelation of data in 1985 that, according to Heubusch at the time, showed that weapon impacts ``caused problems with ammunition fires and explosions more serious than what the Army has let on.``<ref>''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'', November 21, 1985, \"Fighting Vehicle Pleases the Army\"</ref> In 1986, Heubusch and Smith also protested the Bradley's failure to ford streams without taking on massive amounts of water and sinking; \"The Bradley doesn't swim worth a damn and the Army knows it,\" Heubusch told reporters.<ref>Walker, Bill, ''Sacramento Bee'', December 21, 1986, \"Does Army Vehicle Sink Or Swim?\"</ref>\n* Investigation of the Aegis air-defense system for US Navy vessels. In 1984, Smith ridiculed Navy testing of the Aegis system, saying it was conducted in secrecy, that the testing was too easy and that it produced inaccurate results. In 1988, a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf using Aegis shot down a 177-foot-long Iranian airliner (because it couldn't distinguish it from a 62-foot-long fighter), and 290 passengers were killed. Heubusch revealed that a [[General Accounting Office]] report on Aegis testing, made public in July 1988, confirmed Smith's contention that the Navy \"essentially rigged the tests to prove it was easy for the ship to do what they said it would do.\"<ref>Duin, Steve, ''Oregonian'', July 14, 1988, \"Frightening Flotsam of the Aegis affair\"</ref><ref>Royce, Knut, ''Newsday'', July 17, 1988, \"Weapons Test Flawed Report -- Report Faults Trials on Aegis System that Shot Down Jet\"</ref>\n\nThe reliably liberal ''Washington Monthly'' magazine looked backed in 1993 at the individuals who had contributed most to cleaning up the Pentagon during the Reagan era. \"Many people, including a larger contingent of active-duty officers than might be guessed, played important roles in the military reform movement . . .\" 17 men and women are named, among them [[Gary Hart]] and journalist [[James Fallows]]\u2014and they include Smith and Heubusch.<ref>''Washington Monthly'', October 1993, \"The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Heubusch left Capitol Hill to work for [[Elizabeth Dole]], named as [[Secretary of Labor]] under new President [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref>Foster Church & Alan R.

Instead of the parochial practice (common then and now) of naming one of his own staffers to manage the sprawling 200-person operation, D'Amato and his chief strategist, [[Arthur Finkelstein]], sought to professionalize the committee's operations. After an intensive search process, they named Heubusch as executive director.<ref>King, John, Associated Press, December 11, 1994, \"POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: San Diego Almost A Done Deal\"</ref> Other key hires included [[Jo Anne B. Barnhart]] as Political Director, and [[Gordon Hensley]] as Communications Director.<ref>''Roll Call'', September 23, 1996, p. A-24, \"Politics' Fabulous Fifty\"</ref> (Barnhart was a long-time aide and campaigner for Sen. [[William V. Roth, Jr.|William Roth]], and later served as Commissioner of the [[Social Security Administration]].)\n\nThey had a tough act to follow \u2014 Sen. [[Phil Gramm]] of Texas had just piloted Republicans to a 7-seat gain and recaptured control of the Senate. The [[Bob Packwood]] sex-harassment scandal led to a costly special election, lost narrowly by GOP candidate [[Gordon H. Smith|Gordon Smith]].<ref>AP story in ''Baltimore Sun'', February 1, 1996, \u201cOre. Democrat Finally Wins Senate Seat; Wyden Ends Party Losses From 1962, Calls Victory A Backlash Against GOP \u201c</ref> The NRSC faced several challenges beyond their control, many emanating from the two dominant Republicans of 1995\u201396, House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Bob Dole]]. The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995 gave [[Bill Clinton]] an opportunity to marginalize his opponents, and slowed the momentum of the reform-minded Republican Congress. By late 1995, unrelenting Democratic and press attacks, and his own missteps, had turned Gingrich into a pariah through much of the country (2-to-1 unfav-fav ratio in surveys);<ref>Roman, Nancy E., ''Washington Times'', January 23, 1996, \"'96 elections: A referendum on GOP Congress\"</ref> meanwhile, Dole was running for President, and allowing ambition to overshadow his Senate work. In mid-1996, Dole resigned from the Senate to campaign full-time, but by then he was behind Clinton to stay, and eventually polled less than 41% nationwide.\n\nD'Amato remained personally devoted to Bob Dole. Heubusch and the NRSC team urged Republican Senate candidates to carve out their own individual profiles on issues. The NRSC paid particular attention to blunting the wave of millionaire political unknowns (e.g., [[Tom Bruggere]] in Oregon, [[Mark Warner]] in Virginia, Elliott Close in South Carolina) recruited that year by the Democrats.<ref>Nakashima, Ellen & Hsu, Spencer S., ''Washington Post'', October 7, 1996, \u201cMark Warner Sets Va. Media Spending Record; Senate Candidate Puts $5.2 Million Into TV\u201d</ref> It also shored up many endangered incumbents, including [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]] (New Hampshire), [[John Warner]] (Virginia), 75-year-old [[Jesse Helms]] and 94-year-old [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref>Dewar, Helen, ''Washington Post'', July 15, 1996, \"Democrats' Senate Prospects Grow Brighter\"</ref>\n\nHeubusch was also quick to exploit a June 1996 ruling by the US Supreme Court in a Colorado case, that allowed political parties to spend unlimited sums in campaigns, as long as the spending remained independent of candidates.<ref>Lambro, Donald, ''Washington Times'', July 8, 1996, \"Ruling unleashes cash for campaign \"</ref> Heubusch immediately set up an independent arm of the NRSC to coordinate such expenditures.<ref>Marcus, Ruth, Washington Post, October 26, 1996, \"Reinterpreting The Rules; 'Independent Expenditures' Alter Senate Races\"</ref> There was aggressive independent spending in 14 Senate races \"and we won nine of them,\" Heubusch later told the ''Washington Post''.<ref>''Washington Post'', February 12, 1997</ref>\n\nOn Election Night, as Clinton defeated Dole by nearly 9 points and Gingrich's House Republicans lost a net 8 seats, Republicans won open Democratic seats in Alabama, Arkansas and Nebraska, while a GOP incumbent lost South Dakota. In a poor year for most Republicans, the NRSC under Heubusch had gained a net 2 seats, for a postwar GOP record total of 55 (and narrowly missed another gain in the Cleland-Millner race in Georgia). Heubusch, Barnhart and Hensley were later singled out by ''Roll Call'' newspaper in 1996 as among national \"Politics' Fabulous Fifty.\"<ref>Cook, Charles E., ''Roll Call'', December 12, 1996, \"Political Surveyor\" column, p. 5</ref>\n\n== Gateway Computers and Ted Waitt, 1997-2008 ==\nIn 1997, Heubusch was hired by [[Gateway Computers]], the upstart South Dakota-based electronics manufacturer, as vice president for governmental affairs, creating and heading their DC office.<ref>Brasher, Philip, AP story in ''Toronto Globe & Mail'', April 3, 1997 \"Gateway woos Washington, PC supplier hires lobbyist, contributes to both parties\"</ref> He was a registered lobbyist from 1997 to 1999,<ref>Data from US House of Representatives, Office of Records & Registration</ref> and on Gateway's behalf was a leading proponent of a ban on taxes on internet purchases. When President [[Bill Clinton]] endorsed such a moratorium in February 1998, Heubusch said: \"We're looking at a wave of tremendous growth in the next 10 years no matter what legislation passes, because it's such a convenient way for someone to conduct business . . . If legislation like this doesn't pass, it will simply add to confusion for the consumer.\"<ref>''Sinocast'', Comtex News Network, February 27, 1998, \"What happens when Internet tax ban ends?\"</ref>\n\nGateway's founder and CEO Ted Waitt, known as a maverick in the tech industry, hired Heubusch for another reason. During the mid-1990s, computer software giant Microsoft had begun to challenge hardware manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and others for control of the \"desktop.\" Its core interest was in attempting to own the customer relationship by forcing hardware manufacturers such as Gateway to limit inclusion of nascent internet browsers to Microsoft only products, in particular Internet Explorer or \"IE,\" instead of Netscape's \"Navigator.\" Gateway was intent on providing customers with a choice of these new internet search tools and favored consumer personalization of the desktop. It saw Microsoft's demand as an antitrust violation given its monopolistic position in the marketplace. Microsoft provided the underlying operating system to run 95 percent of the world's personal computers at the time.\n\nHeubusch orchestrated an effort on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft's practices. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in particular were critical of the company's practices and forced the issue into the public eye. The most far reaching antitrust suit brought in the history of the department in relation to the U.S. computer industry resulted. The government's case was argued by famed attorney David Boies. In U.S. v Microsoft Corporation, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft's practices were in violation of antitrust laws. His judgement ordered the company to be broken into two separate business units, one to produce the operating system and one to produce software components. After years of various appeals, lobbying by Microsoft and the election of George W. Bush which led to new appointees at the Department of Justice, the company succeeded in denuding Judge Jackson's original order and the software giant, while chastened, was allowed to continue its monopolistic practices. <ref> \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.</ref>\n\nBy 2000, Heubusch had left Washington for Gateway's new headquarters in San Diego, and became Chief of Staff, answering directly to company founder [[Ted Waitt]].,<ref>Wesch, Hank, ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', August 11, 2001, \"From the Murph to the turf by the surf\"</ref> and later (in addition to Chief of Staff) vice president for strategy.

November 5, 1996, \"Doer's Profile - John D. Heubusch\"</ref> before graduating from Virginia Tech in 1980 with a B.A. in English and political science. He later earned an M.A. in National Security Studies from Georgetown University.  Heubusch began his career in 1980 as a research analyst for the [[Department of the Air Force]]'s Office of Public Affairs, writing speeches and preparing the early-morning newsclips for Pentagon brass and staff.<ref name=\"auto2\">''Congressional Staff Directory'', 1987 edition (CSD Ltd, Mt Vernon VA), Charles Brownson, ed., p. 813</ref>\n\nHe moved to Capitol Hill in 1981, landing a job as a legislative aide to Republican Congressman [[Denny Smith]] of Oregon. Eventually, Heubusch was named as Smith's chief of staff, while also serving as a House Budget Committee staffer, with a focus on defense.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Rep. Smith, a conservative former fighter pilot, was keen on rooting out Pentagon waste and ensuring the safety and effectiveness of defense equipment and systems. Concerned about the poor quality of weapons testing to ensure combat readiness, Smith was instrumental in creating the Office of Operational Test and Evaluation (OT&E) in 1983 as part of the Defense Authorization bill. (Heubusch helped craft Smith's amendment.)  The idea was to create an independent office within the Defense Department that would act as a testing watchdog; despite some good work, OT&E later became part of the cover-up of poorly designed weapons systems.<ref>Church, Foster, ''The Oregonian'', July 11, 1988, \"Smith in the Middle of Aegis Issue\"</ref>\n\nSmith was forced to step up his work on the 133-member Military Reform Caucus (with Heubusch as staff director). Their efforts led to:\n\n* The eventual abandonment of the Sergeant York (DIVAD) air-defense system. Smith's OT&E conducted tests on the self-propelled anti-aircraft gun in 1984 and 1985, after the Congressman had blasted the York and called for a performance review, and the results were abysmal.<ref name=time>Bruce van Voost and Amy Wilentz, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959780,00.html \"No More Time for Sergeant York\"], ''Time'', 9 September 1985</ref> The director of OT&E reported the DIVAD was \"not operationally effective,\" and shortly thereafter, Defense Secretary [[Caspar Weinberger]] cancelled the program after only 50 had been built.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050466,00.html \"Gunning for Sergeant York\"], ''Time'', August 1985</ref> Heubusch later called DIVAD \"one of the lemons of the 1980s.\"<ref>Vartabedian, P.H., ''Los Angeles Times'',  January 13, 1990, \"Image Problem May Make It Hard to Find a Buyer for Ford Aerospace Defense: The unit's odd assortment of products means it will likely be broken up and sold piecemeal\"</ref>\n* The re-armoring and refitting of the Bradley Fighting Vehicle by the Army.  This followed the revelation of data in 1985 that, according to Heubusch at the time, showed that weapon impacts ``caused problems with ammunition fires and explosions more serious than what the Army has let on.``<ref>''South Florida Sun-Sentinel'', November 21, 1985, \"Fighting Vehicle Pleases the Army\"</ref> In 1986, Heubusch and Smith also protested the Bradley's failure to ford streams without taking on massive amounts of water and sinking; \"The Bradley doesn't swim worth a damn and the Army knows it,\" Heubusch told reporters.<ref>Walker, Bill, ''Sacramento Bee'', December 21, 1986, \"Does Army Vehicle Sink Or Swim?\"</ref>\n* Investigation of the Aegis air-defense system for US Navy vessels. In 1984, Smith ridiculed Navy testing of the Aegis system, saying it was conducted in secrecy, that the testing was too easy and that it produced inaccurate results. In 1988, a Navy ship in the Persian Gulf using Aegis shot down a 177-foot-long Iranian airliner (because it couldn't distinguish it from a 62-foot-long fighter), and 290 passengers were killed. Heubusch revealed that a [[General Accounting Office]] report on Aegis testing, made public in July 1988, confirmed Smith's contention that the Navy \"essentially rigged the tests to prove it was easy for the ship to do what they said it would do.\"<ref>Duin, Steve, ''Oregonian'', July 14, 1988, \"Frightening Flotsam of the Aegis affair\"</ref><ref>Royce, Knut, ''Newsday'', July 17, 1988, \"Weapons Test Flawed Report -- Report Faults Trials on Aegis System that Shot Down Jet\"</ref>\n\nThe reliably liberal ''Washington Monthly'' magazine looked backed in 1993 at the individuals who had contributed most to cleaning up the Pentagon during the Reagan era. \"Many people, including a larger contingent of active-duty officers than might be guessed, played important roles in the military reform movement . . .\" 17 men and women are named, among them [[Gary Hart]] and journalist [[James Fallows]]\u2014and they include Smith and Heubusch.<ref>''Washington Monthly'', October 1993, \"The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1989, Heubusch left Capitol Hill to work for [[Elizabeth Dole]], named as [[Secretary of Labor]] under new President [[George H.W.

Instead of the parochial practice (common then and now) of naming one of his own staffers to manage the sprawling 200-person operation, D'Amato and his chief strategist, [[Arthur Finkelstein]], sought to professionalize the committee's operations. After an intensive search process, they named Heubusch as executive director.<ref>King, John, Associated Press, December 11, 1994, \"POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: San Diego Almost A Done Deal\"</ref> Other key hires included [[Jo Anne B.

The [[Bob Packwood]] sex-harassment scandal led to a costly special election, lost narrowly by GOP candidate [[Gordon H. Smith|Gordon Smith]].<ref>AP story in ''Baltimore Sun'', February 1, 1996, \u201cOre. Democrat Finally Wins Senate Seat; Wyden Ends Party Losses From 1962, Calls Victory A Backlash Against GOP \u201c</ref> The NRSC faced several challenges beyond their control, many emanating from the two dominant Republicans of 1995\u201396, House Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]] and Senate Majority Leader [[Bob Dole]]. The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995 gave [[Bill Clinton]] an opportunity to marginalize his opponents, and slowed the momentum of the reform-minded Republican Congress. By late 1995, unrelenting Democratic and press attacks, and his own missteps, had turned Gingrich into a pariah through much of the country (2-to-1 unfav-fav ratio in surveys);<ref>Roman, Nancy E., ''Washington Times'', January 23, 1996, \"'96 elections: A referendum on GOP Congress\"</ref> meanwhile, Dole was running for President, and allowing ambition to overshadow his Senate work. In mid-1996, Dole resigned from the Senate to campaign full-time, but by then he was behind Clinton to stay, and eventually polled less than 41% nationwide.\n\nD'Amato remained personally devoted to Bob Dole. Heubusch and the NRSC team urged Republican Senate candidates to carve out their own individual profiles on issues. The NRSC paid particular attention to blunting the wave of millionaire political unknowns (e.g., [[Tom Bruggere]] in Oregon, [[Mark Warner]] in Virginia, Elliott Close in South Carolina) recruited that year by the Democrats.<ref>Nakashima, Ellen & Hsu, Spencer S., ''Washington Post'', October 7, 1996, \u201cMark Warner Sets Va. Media Spending Record; Senate Candidate Puts $5.2 Million Into TV\u201d</ref> It also shored up many endangered incumbents, including [[Robert C. Smith|Bob Smith]] (New Hampshire), [[John Warner]] (Virginia), 75-year-old [[Jesse Helms]] and 94-year-old [[Strom Thurmond]].<ref>Dewar, Helen, ''Washington Post'', July 15, 1996, \"Democrats' Senate Prospects Grow Brighter\"</ref>\n\nHeubusch was also quick to exploit a June 1996 ruling by the US Supreme Court in a Colorado case, that allowed political parties to spend unlimited sums in campaigns, as long as the spending remained independent of candidates.<ref>Lambro, Donald, ''Washington Times'', July 8, 1996, \"Ruling unleashes cash for campaign \"</ref> Heubusch immediately set up an independent arm of the NRSC to coordinate such expenditures.<ref>Marcus, Ruth, Washington Post, October 26, 1996, \"Reinterpreting The Rules; 'Independent Expenditures' Alter Senate Races\"</ref> There was aggressive independent spending in 14 Senate races \"and we won nine of them,\" Heubusch later told the ''Washington Post''.<ref>''Washington Post'', February 12, 1997</ref>\n\nOn Election Night, as Clinton defeated Dole by nearly 9 points and Gingrich's House Republicans lost a net 8 seats, Republicans won open Democratic seats in Alabama, Arkansas and Nebraska, while a GOP incumbent lost South Dakota. In a poor year for most Republicans, the NRSC under Heubusch had gained a net 2 seats, for a postwar GOP record total of 55 (and narrowly missed another gain in the Cleland-Millner race in Georgia). Heubusch, Barnhart and Hensley were later singled out by ''Roll Call'' newspaper in 1996 as among national \"Politics' Fabulous Fifty.\"<ref>Cook, Charles E., ''Roll Call'', December 12, 1996, \"Political Surveyor\" column, p. 5</ref>\n\n== Gateway Computers and Ted Waitt, 1997-2008 ==\nIn 1997, Heubusch was hired by [[Gateway Computers]], the upstart South Dakota-based electronics manufacturer, as vice president for governmental affairs, creating and heading their DC office.<ref>Brasher, Philip, AP story in ''Toronto Globe & Mail'', April 3, 1997 \"Gateway woos Washington, PC supplier hires lobbyist, contributes to both parties\"</ref> He was a registered lobbyist from 1997 to 1999,<ref>Data from US House of Representatives, Office of Records & Registration</ref> and on Gateway's behalf was a leading proponent of a ban on taxes on internet purchases. When President [[Bill Clinton]] endorsed such a moratorium in February 1998, Heubusch said: \"We're looking at a wave of tremendous growth in the next 10 years no matter what legislation passes, because it's such a convenient way for someone to conduct business . . . If legislation like this doesn't pass, it will simply add to confusion for the consumer.\"<ref>''Sinocast'', Comtex News Network, February 27, 1998, \"What happens when Internet tax ban ends?\"</ref>\n\nGateway's founder and CEO Ted Waitt, known as a maverick in the tech industry, hired Heubusch for another reason. During the mid-1990s, computer software giant Microsoft had begun to challenge hardware manufacturers such as Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and others for control of the \"desktop.\" Its core interest was in attempting to own the customer relationship by forcing hardware manufacturers such as Gateway to limit inclusion of nascent internet browsers to Microsoft only products, in particular Internet Explorer or \"IE,\" instead of Netscape's \"Navigator.\" Gateway was intent on providing customers with a choice of these new internet search tools and favored consumer personalization of the desktop. It saw Microsoft's demand as an antitrust violation given its monopolistic position in the marketplace. Microsoft provided the underlying operating system to run 95 percent of the world's personal computers at the time.\n\nHeubusch orchestrated an effort on Capitol Hill and in the Justice Department to investigate Microsoft's practices. Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in particular were critical of the company's practices and forced the issue into the public eye. The most far reaching antitrust suit brought in the history of the department in relation to the U.S. computer industry resulted. The government's case was argued by famed attorney David Boies. In U.S. v Microsoft Corporation, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft's practices were in violation of antitrust laws. His judgement ordered the company to be broken into two separate business units, one to produce the operating system and one to produce software components. After years of various appeals, lobbying by Microsoft and the election of George W. Bush which led to new appointees at the Department of Justice, the company succeeded in denuding Judge Jackson's original order and the software giant, while chastened, was allowed to continue its monopolistic practices. <ref> \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.</ref>\n\nBy 2000, Heubusch had left Washington for Gateway's new headquarters in San Diego, and became Chief of Staff, answering directly to company founder [[Ted Waitt]].,<ref>Wesch, Hank, ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', August 11, 2001, \"From the Murph to the turf by the surf\"</ref> and later (in addition to Chief of Staff) vice president for strategy.

{"title_page": "Logarithmic scale", "text_new": "A '''logarithmic scale''' (or '''log scale''') is a way of displaying numerical data over a very wide range of values in a compact way\u2014typically the largest numbers in the data are hundreds or even thousands of times larger than the smallest numbers. Such a [[scale (measurement)|scale]] is [[nonlinear]]: the numbers 10 and 20, and 90 and 100, are not the same distance apart on a log scale. Rather, the numbers 10 and 100, and 100 and 1000 are equally spaced. Thus moving a set distance along the scale means the number has been ''multiplied'' by 10 (or some other fixed factor). Often [[exponential growth]] curves are displayed on a log scale, otherwise they would increase too quickly to fit within a small [[Plot (graphics)|graph]]. Another way to think about it is that the ''number of [[Numerical digit |digits]]'' of the data grows at a constant rate. The numbers 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 are equally spaced on a log scale, but the number of digits is going up by 1 each time: 2, 3, 4, and 5 digits. In this way, adding two digits ''multiplies'' the quantity measured on the log scale by a factor of 100.\n\n[[File:Logarithmic_scale.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|right|A logarithmic scale from 0.1 to 100]]\n\n[[File:Internet host count 1988-2012 log scale.png|thumb|upright=1.7|right|Graph on a logarithmic scale]]\n\n==Common uses==\n\n\n\nThe markings on [[slide rule]]s are arranged in a log scale for multiplying or dividing numbers by adding or subtracting lengths on the scales.\n\n[[File:slide rule example3.svg|thumb|590px|center|The two logarithmic scales of a slide rule]]\n\n\nThe following are examples of commonly used logarithmic scales, where a larger quantity results in a higher value:\n* [[Richter magnitude scale]] and [[moment magnitude scale]] (MMS) for strength of [[earthquakes]] and [[Motion (physics)|movement]] in the [[Earth]] [[File:COB data Tsunami deaths.PNG|right|thumb|400px|A logarithmic scale makes it easy to compare values that cover a large range, such as in this map.]]\n* [[Sound level (disambiguation)|Sound level]], with units [[decibel|bel and decibel]]\n* [[Neper]] for amplitude, field and power quantities\n* [[Frequency level]], with units [[Cent (music)|cent]], [[minor second]], [[major second]], and [[octave]] for the relative pitch of notes in [[music]]\n* [[Logit]] for [[odds]] in [[statistics]]\n* [[Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale]]\n* [[Logarithmic timeline]]\n* Counting [[f-stop]]s for ratios of [[photographic exposure]]\n* The [[9 (number)#Probability|rule of 'nines']] used for rating low [[probabilities]] \n* [[Entropy]] in [[thermodynamics]]\n* [[Information]] in [[information theory]]\n* Particle size distribution curves of soil\n\nThe following are examples of commonly used logarithmic scales, where a larger quantity results in a lower (or negative) value:\n* [[pH]] for acidity\n* [[Apparent magnitude|Stellar magnitude scale]] for brightness of [[star]]s\n* [[Krumbein scale]] for [[Particle size (grain size)|particle size]] in [[geology]]\n* [[Absorbance]] of light by transparent samples\n\nSome of our [[sense]]s operate in a logarithmic fashion ([[Weber\u2013Fechner law]]), which makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate.

Due to the identity\n\n: <math>\\log_b a = \\frac{\\log_c a}{\\log_c b},</math>\n\nthe logarithms of any given number ''a'' to two different bases (here ''b'' and ''c'') differ only by the constant factor log<sub>''c''</sub>&nbsp;''b''.  This constant factor can be considered to represent the conversion factor for converting a numerical representation of the pure (indefinite) logarithmic quantity Log(''a'') from one arbitrary unit of measurement (the [log&nbsp;''c''] unit) to another (the [log&nbsp;''b''] unit), since\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{Log}(a) = (\\log_b a)[\\log b] = (\\log_c a)[\\log c] .</math>\n\nFor example, [[Boltzmann]]'s standard definition of entropy ''S'' = ''k''&nbsp;ln&nbsp;''W'' (where ''W'' is the number of ways of arranging a system and ''k'' is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann's constant]]) can also be written more simply as just ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;Log(''W''), where \"Log\" here denotes the indefinite logarithm, and we let ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[log&nbsp;e]; that is, we identify the physical entropy unit ''k'' with the mathematical unit [log&nbsp;e].

Such a [[scale (measurement)|scale]] is [[nonlinear]]: the numbers 10 and 20, and 90 and 100, are not the same distance apart on a log scale. Rather, the numbers 10 and 100, and 100 and 1000 are equally spaced. Thus moving a set distance along the scale means the number has been ''multiplied'' by 10 (or some other fixed factor). Often [[exponential growth]] curves are displayed on a log scale, otherwise they would increase too quickly to fit within a small [[Plot (graphics)|graph]]. Another way to think about it is that the ''number of [[Numerical digit |digits]]'' of the data grows at a constant rate. The numbers 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 are equally spaced on a log scale, but the number of digits is going up by 1 each time: 2, 3, 4, and 5 digits.

He spent his last fifty years in Germany, dying after a long illness at the age of 76 {{harv|Nonnenmann|2008}}.\n\n==Biography==\nKagel was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], into an Ashkenazi Jewish family that had fled from Russia in the 1920s {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. He studied music, history of [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] in [[Buenos Aires]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. In 1957 he moved as a scholar to [[Cologne]], Germany, where he lived until his death.\n\n===As teacher===\n\nFrom 1960\u201366 and 1972\u201376 he taught at the [[Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse|International Summer School at Darmstadt]] {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He also taught from 1964\u201365 at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] as [[Slee Professor of music theory]]. At the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Berlin Film and Television Academy]] he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in [[Gothenburg]] and Cologne {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He was professor for new music theatre at the [[Cologne Conservatory]] from 1974\u201397.<!--Attinello 2001 would cover this as well, except he does not give the terminal date.--> Among his students were [[Maria de Alvear]], [[Carola Bauckholt]], [[Branimir Krsti\u0107]], [[David Sawer]], {{ill|Rickard Scheffer|sv}}, [[Juan Maria Solare]], [[Gerald Barry (composer)|Gerald Barry]], and [[Chao-Ming Tung]]. {{See LMST|Mauricio|Kagel}}\n\n===As composer===\n\nSome of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers {{harv|Kennedy and Bourne|2006}}, such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, to physically interact with other performers, and so on. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}.<!--Is this a quote or paraphrase?--> He was also active in the fields of film and photography, proving that the possibilities of music are inexhaustible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1991 Kagel was invited by [[Walter Fink]] as the second composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]]. In 2000 he received the [[Ernst von Siemens Music Prize]].\n\n==Works==\n''Staatstheater'' (1970) remains, probably, Kagel\u2019s best-known work. It is the piece that most clearly shows his absurdist tendency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} He described it as a \u201c[[ballet]] for non-dancers,\u201d{{Cite quote|date=September 2008}} although it is in many ways more like an [[opera]]; the devices it uses as [[musical instrument]]s include [[chamber pot]]s and [[enema]] equipment. As the work progresses, the piece itself, and opera and ballet in general, becomes its own subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nSimilar is the [[radio]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''Ein Aufnahmezustand'' (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In ''Con voce'' (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. ''Match'' (1964), is a \u201ctennis game\u201d for cellists with a percussionist as umpire {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}} (for [[Siegfried Palm]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}<!--Formerly offered citation, [http://www.bertdekkers.nl/klassiek/kagel_list.html Kagel: Match], lists a recording made by Palm, but does not confirm the work was written for him.-->), also the subject of one of Kagel's films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre {{harv|Griffiths|1981|loc=812}}.\n\nBut Kagel wrote a large number of more conventional \u201cpure\u201d pieces too, including [[orchestra]]l music, [[chamber music]]. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt ({{harvnb|Warnaby|1986|loc=38}}; {{harvnb|Decarsin|1985|loc=260}}).\n\nKagel also made [[film]]s, with one of the best known being ''[[Ludwig van (film)|Ludwig van]]'' (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s music made during the bicentenary of that composer's birth {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}. In it, a reproduction of Beethoven's studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the [[Beethoven House]] in [[Bonn]]. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven's pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a [[piano]] playing the music as it appears in each shot.

He spent his last fifty years in Germany, dying after a long illness at the age of 76 {{harv|Nonnenmann|2008}}.\n\n==Biography==\nKagel was born in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], into an Ashkenazi Jewish family that had fled from Russia in the 1920s {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}. He studied music, history of [[literature]], and [[philosophy]] in [[Buenos Aires]] {{harv|Grimshaw|2009}}. In 1957 he moved as a scholar to [[Cologne]], Germany, where he lived until his death.\n\n===As teacher===\n\nFrom 1960\u201366 and 1972\u201376 he taught at the [[Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse|International Summer School at Darmstadt]] {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He also taught from 1964\u201365 at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] as [[Slee Professor of music theory]]. At the [[Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin|Berlin Film and Television Academy]] he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in [[Gothenburg]] and Cologne {{harv|Attinello|2001}}. He was professor for new music theatre at the [[Cologne Conservatory]] from 1974\u201397.<!--Attinello 2001 would cover this as well, except he does not give the terminal date.--> Among his students were [[Maria de Alvear]], [[Carola Bauckholt]], [[Branimir Krsti\u0107]], [[David Sawer]], {{ill|Rickard Scheffer|sv}}, [[Juan Maria Solare]], [[Gerald Barry (composer)|Gerald Barry]], and [[Chao-Ming Tung]]. {{See LMST|Mauricio|Kagel}}\n\n===As composer===\n\nSome of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers {{harv|Kennedy and Bourne|2006}}, such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, to physically interact with other performers, and so on. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}.<!--Is this a quote or paraphrase?--> He was also active in the fields of film and photography, proving that the possibilities of music are inexhaustible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} In 1991 Kagel was invited by [[Walter Fink]] as the second composer featured in the annual [[Rheingau Musik Festival#Portraits of living composers|Komponistenportr\u00e4t]] of the [[Rheingau Musik Festival]]. In 2000 he received the [[Ernst von Siemens Music Prize]].\n\n==Works==\n''Staatstheater'' (1970) remains, probably, Kagel\u2019s best-known work. It is the piece that most clearly shows his absurdist tendency.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} He described it as a \u201c[[ballet]] for non-dancers,\u201d{{Cite quote|date=September 2008}} although it is in many ways more like an [[opera]]; the devices it uses as [[musical instrument]]s include [[chamber pot]]s and [[enema]] equipment. As the work progresses, the piece itself, and opera and ballet in general, becomes its own subject matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nSimilar is the [[radio]] [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''Ein Aufnahmezustand'' (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In ''Con voce'' (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. ''Match'' (1964), is a \u201ctennis game\u201d for cellists with a percussionist as umpire {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}} (for [[Siegfried Palm]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}<!--Formerly offered citation, [http://www.bertdekkers.nl/klassiek/kagel_list.html Kagel: Match], lists a recording made by Palm, but does not confirm the work was written for him.-->), also the subject of one of Kagel's films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre {{harv|Griffiths|1981|loc=812}}.\n\nBut Kagel wrote a large number of more conventional \u201cpure\u201d pieces too, including [[orchestra]]l music, [[chamber music]]. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt ({{harvnb|Warnaby|1981|loc=38}}; {{harvnb|Decarsin|1985|loc=260}}).\n\nKagel also made [[film]]s, with one of the best known being ''[[Ludwig van (film)|Ludwig van]]'' (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s music made during the bicentenary of that composer's birth {{harv|Griffiths|1978|loc=188}}. In it, a reproduction of Beethoven's studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the [[Beethoven House]] in [[Bonn]]. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven's pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a [[piano]] playing the music as it appears in each shot. Because the music has been wrapped around curves and edges, it is somewhat distorted, but Beethovenian motifs can still be heard. In other parts, the film contains parodies of radio or TV broadcasts connected with the \"Beethoven Year 1770\". Kagel later turned the film into a piece of sheet music itself which could be performed in a concert without the film\u2014the score consists of close-ups of various areas of the studio, which are to be interpreted by the performing [[pianist]].\n\n===For orchestra===\n\n* ''Dos piezas'' for orchestra (1952)\n* ''Heterophonie'' for orchestra (1959\u201361)\n* ''Zehn M\u00e4rsche, um den Sieg zu verfehlen'' (Ten marches in order to miss victory), for brass orchestra (1979)\n* ''Les id\u00e9es fixes'', rondo for orchestra (1988/89)\n* ''Opus 1.991'' for orchestra (1990)\n* ''Konzertst\u00fcck'' ([[Concert piece]]), for timpani and orchestra (1990\u201392)\n* ''\u00c9tudes'' for orchestra (I 1992, II 1995/96, III 1996)\n* ''Fremde T\u00f6ne & Widerhall'' (Strange sounds and echo), for orchestra (2005)\n\n===Chamber music===\n\n* [[String Sextet (Kagel)|String Sextet]] (1953\u201357)\n* ''Transici\u00f3n II'' for piano, percussion, and two tapes (1958\u201359)\n* ''Sonant'' for guitar, harp, contrabass, and skin instruments (1960)\n* ''Match'' for three players (two celli and percussionist-umpire) (1964)\n* ''Musik f\u00fcr Renaissance-Instrumente'', for two up to twenty-two instruments (1965\u201366)\n* String Quartets Nos. 1 and 2 (1965\u201367)\n* ''Der Schall'' for five players performing on 54 plucked-string, percussion, and wind instruments (1968)\n* ''Acustica'' for experimental sound-producers and loud-speakers (1968\u201370)\n* ''Morceau de concours'' for 1 or 2 trumpets (1968\u201372)\n* ''Dressur'', trio for wood percussion (1977)\n* ''Rrrrrrr...'', six duos for two percussionists (1982)\n* ''Pan'' a tutti i Papagheni, for piccolo and string quartet (1985)\n* Piano Trio No. 1 (1985)\n* String Quartet No. 3 (1986)\n* ''Aus dem Nachlass'', pieces for viola, cello, and contrabass (1986)\n* ''Phantasiest\u00fcck'' for flute and piano (1989)\n* String Quartet No. 4 (1993)\n* ''Schattenkl\u00e4nge'', three pieces for bass clarinet (1995)\n* ''Art bruit'' for a percussionist and an assistant (1994/95)\n* Piano Trio No. 2 (2001)\n\n===Vocal works===\n\n* ''F\u00fcrst Igor \u2013 Strawinsky'', a requiem for [[Igor Strawinsky]] for bass and instruments (1982)\n* ''[[Sankt-Bach-Passion]]'' for soloists, choirs and orchestra (premiered in 1985)\n* ''Mitternachtsst\u00fck'' for voices and instruments on four fragments from the diary of [[Robert Schumann]] (1980\u201381/86)\n* ''Schwarzes Madrigal'' (Black madrigal), for choir, trumpet, tuba and 2 percussionists (1998/99)\n* ''In der Matratzengruft'' for tenor and ensemble (2008)\n\n===Stage works===\n\n* ''Staatstheater'' (1967/70)\n* ''Mare nostrum'', Scenic Play for countertenor, baritone, flute, oboe, guitar, harp, cello and percussion (1975)\n* ''Kantrimiusik'', pastorale for voices and instruments (1975)\n* ''Music-Epic about the Devil \u201cLa trahison orale\u201d'' (1983)\n\n===Film===\n\n* ''Ludwig van'' (1969)\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|n.d.}}|reference=Anon. n.d. \"[http://www.mauricio-kagel.com/gb/biografy.html# Mauricio Kagel, 1931\u20132008]\".

The high-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these assays but their availability will depend on the rate of production for each system.

{"title_page": "Sleep and memory", "text_new": "[[File:Sleeping while studying.JPG|thumb|alt=Sleeping while studying.JPG|Young woman asleep over study materials]]\nThe relationship between '''sleep and memory''' has been postulated and studied since, at least, the early 19th century. [[Memory]], the cognitive process of storing and retrieving past experiences, learning and recognition are recalled,<ref name=\"walker\"/> is a product of brain plasticity, the structural changes within [[Synapse|synapses]] that create associations between stimuli. Stimuli are encoded within milliseconds; however, the long-term maintenance of memories can take additional minutes, days, or even years to fully consolidate and become a stable memory that is accessible(more resistant to change or interference). Therefore, the formation of a specific memory occurs rapidly, but the evolution of a memory is often an ongoing process.\n\nMemory processes have been shown to be stabilized and enhanced (sped up and/or integrated) and memories better [[memory consolidation|consolidated]] by nocturnal [[sleep]] and even daytime [[nap]]s. Certain [[sleep stages]] have been demonstrated as improving an individual's memory, though this is task-specific. Generally, [[declarative memory|declarative memories]] are believed to be enhanced by [[slow-wave sleep]], while [[non-declarative memory|non-declarative memories]] are enhanced by [[REM sleep|rapid eye movement (REM) sleep]], although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results. The effect of sleep on memory, especially as it pertains to the [[human brain]], is an active field of research in [[neurology]], [[psychology]], and related disciplines.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1801, David Hartley first suggested that dreaming altered the associative planetary links within the brain during rapid eye movement (REM) periods of the sleep cycle. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable by the end of the 19th century. In \u2018Peter and Wendy\u2019,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter and Wendy|last=Barrie|first=James|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> [[J.M. Barrie]] wrote  ''\u2018It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. \u2026When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\u2019'' The stories of Peter Pan take place in a fictional world and contain many allusions to aspects of [[cognitive psychology]], some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter Pan and the Mind of J.

It was not until 1953, however, when sleep was delineated into rapid eye movement sleep and [[non-rapid eye movement sleep]], that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted.<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.04.007 |title=Sleep-dependent motor memory plasticity in the human brain |year=2005 |last1=Walker |first1=M.P. |last2=Stickgold |first2=R. |last3=Alsop |first3=D. |last4=Gaab |first4=N. |last5=Schlaug |first5=G. |journal=Neuroscience |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=911\u20137 |pmid=15964485}}</ref> As behavioral characteristics of the effects of sleep and memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis of sleep and memory.<ref name=\"sleepmemory\" />\n\n== Sleep cycles ==\n[[File:Simplified Sleep Phases.jpg|thumb|Sleep cycles, with REM indicated in red]]\nSleep progresses in a cyclical fashion through five stages. Four of these stages are collectively referred to as [https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=8686 ''non-rapid eye movement'' (NREM)] sleep whereas the last cycle is a rapid eye movement period. A cycle takes approximately 90\u2013110 minutes to complete. Wakefulness is found through [[EEG]] measures to be characterized by ''[[beta wave]]s'', the highest in frequency and lowest in amplitude, and tend to move inconsistently due to the vast amount of stimuli a person encounters while awake. \n*Pre-sleep is the period of decreased perceptual awareness where brain activity is characterized by ''[[alpha waves]]'' which are more rhythmic, higher in amplitude and lower in frequency compared to beta waves.\n*Stage one is characterized by light sleep and lasts roughly 10 minutes. Brain waves gradually transition to ''[[theta waves]]''.\n*Stage two also contains theta waves; however, random short bursts of increased frequency called ''[[sleep spindles]]'' are a defining characteristic of this stage.\n*Stage three and four are very similar and together are considered to be \"deep sleep\". In  these stages brain activity transitions to ''[[delta waves]]'' which are the lowest in frequency and highest in amplitude. These two stages combined are also called ''slow wave sleep'' (SWS).\n*Stage five, REM sleep, is one of the most interesting stages as brain wave patterns are similar to those seen in relaxed wakefulness. This is referred to as \"active sleep\" and is the period when most dreaming occurs. REM sleep is also thought to play a role in the cognitive development of infants and children as they spend much more of their sleep in REM periods opposed to adults.\nDuring the first half of the night, the largest portion of sleep is spent as SWS, but as the night progresses SWS stages decrease in length while REM stages increase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sleepdisorders.about.com/od/doihaveasleepdisorder/a/Sleep_Stage_Basics.htm |title=Understanding the Basics of Sleep Stages |first=Brandon |last=Peters |publisher=[[About.com]] |date=January 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Memory terms ==\n=== Stabilization vs. enhancement ===\nStabilization of a memory is the anchoring of a memory in place, in which a weak connection is established.  Stabilization of [[procedural memory|procedural memories]] can even occur during waking hours, suggesting that specific non-declarative tasks are enhanced in the absence of sleep.<ref name=\"sleepmemory\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070307 |title=Sleep, Memory, and Plasticity |year=2006 |last1=Walker |first1=Matthew P. |last2=Stickgold |first2=Robert |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=57 |pages=139\u201366 |pmid=16318592 |issue=1|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/037b4b2a47d2f35fad62fc4d7ca3e8998f4e2c39 }}</ref>\nWhen memories are said to be enhanced, however, the connection is strengthened by rehearsal as well as connecting it to other related memories thereby making the retrieval more efficient.  Whereas stabilization of non-declarative memories can be seen to occur during a wakeful state, ''enhancement'' of these sensory and [[motor learning|motor memories]] has most been found to occur during nocturnal sleep.<ref name=\"sleepmemory\"/>\n\n=== Use-dependent processes vs. experience-dependent processes ===\nBrain activity that occurs during sleep is assessed in two ways: Use-dependency, and Experience-dependency.<ref name=\"therole\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1062856 |title=The Role of Sleep in Learning and Memory |year=2001 |last1=Maquet |first1=P. |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5544 |pages=1048\u201352 |pmid=11691982|bibcode = 2001Sci...294.1048M }}</ref> \nUse-dependent brain activity is a result of the neuronal usage that occurred during the previous waking hours.  Essentially it is neuronal regeneration, activity that occurs whether you have learnt anything new or not.<ref name=\"therole\"/>\n\nExperience-dependent brain activity is a result of a new situation, environment, or learned task or fact that has taken place in the pre-sleep period.   This is the type of brain activity that denotes memory consolidation/enhancement.<ref name=\"therole\"/>\n\nIt is often hard to distinguish between the two in an experimental setting because the setting alone is a new environment. This new environment would be seen in the sleeping brain activity along with the newly learned task.  To avoid this, most experimenters insist participants spend one day in the experimental condition before testing begins so the setting is not novel once the experiment begins.  This ensures the collected data for experience-dependent brain activity is purely from the novel task.\n\n===Consolidation===\n{{See also|memory consolidation}}\nConsolidation of a memory is a process that takes an initially unstable representation and encodes it in a more sturdy, effective and efficient manner. In this new state, the memory is less susceptible to interference.<ref name=\"walker\"/> There are essentially three phases of [[memory consolidation]] and all are thought to be facilitated by sleep or not sleep:\n# ''Stabilization'' is the encoding of a memory which takes only  6 milliseconds.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n# ''Enhancement'' is the continual process of consolidation which can occur over minutes, 7 hours, days but not longer.<ref name=\"walker\"/>  Post-sleep behavioural activities can be seen to show significant improvements in the absence of practice.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n# ''Integration'' can also take hours or years and is the process of connecting recently encoded memories into existing memory networks.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n\n===Reconsolidation===\nReconsolidation of a memory involves the retrieval of an already consolidated memory (explicit or implicit), into short-term or working memory.   Here it is brought into a labile state where subsequent information can 'interfere' with what is currently in memory, therefore altering the memory.  This is known as retroactive interference, and is an extremely significant issue for court and eyewitness testimonies.<ref name=\"consolidation2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2007.03.011 |title=Sleep-dependent memory consolidation and reconsolidation |year=2007 |last1=Stickgold |first1=Robert |last2=Walker |first2=Matthew P. |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=331\u201343 |pmid=17470412 |pmc=2680680}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-training vs post-training sleep deprivation===\nResearchers approach the study of sleep and memory from different angles. Some studies measure the effects of [[sleep deprivation]] ''after'' a novel task is taught (the subject learns the task and is sleep deprived afterwards). This is referred to as ''post-training sleep deprivation''. Conversely, other experiments have been conducted that measure the effects of sleep deprivation ''before'' a task has been taught (the subject is sleep-deprived and then learns a task). This is referred to as ''pre-training sleep deprivation''.\n\n===Offline memory processing===\nThis is the processing of memories out of conscious awareness.  After you are finished reading something, for example this very article about sleep and memory, your brain continues to process the information even as you accomplish other tasks like playing a game of soccer.  This \"offline\" processing likewise occurs in your sleep.<ref name=\"consolidation2\"/>\n\n== Methods of measuring memory ==\n===Behavioral measures===\n* A '''self-ordered pointing task''' is a task of memory where a participant is presented with a number of images (or words) which are arranged on a display. Several trials are presented, each with a different arrangement and containing some of the previous words or images. The task for the participant is to point to a word or image they had not previously pointed to in other trials.<ref name=\"pointing\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/35001068 |year=2000 |last1=Gillin |first1=J.

Participants are asked to virtually tour the same thing at a later time while brain imaging is used to measure activity.<ref name=\"spatial memories\" />\n* A '''paired word associative task''' consists of two phases. During the first phase (acquisition), the responses of the paired-associate task are learned and become recallable. In the second phase (associative phase), the subject learns to pair each response to a separate [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. For example, a visual cue would provide information as to what words must be recalled after the stimulus and words are removed.<ref name=\"krista\">{{cite journal |bibcode=2004PNAS..101.2140G |jstor=3371408 |title=Low acetylcholine during slow-wave sleep is critical for declarative memory consolidation |last1=Gais |first1=Steffen |last2=Born |first2=Jan |volume=101 |year=2004 |pages=2140\u20132144 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |doi=10.1073/pnas.0305404101 |pmid=14766981 |issue=7|pmc=357065 }}</ref>\n* In a '''mirror tracing task''' participants are asked to trace several figures as fast and as accurately as possible which they can only see in a mirror.

The subjects are asked to react as fast and accurately as possible to the appearance of a stimulus below one of the markers. Subjects can be trained on the task with either explicit instructions (e.g. there are colour sequences presented which must be learned) or implicit ones (e.g. the experimentor does not mention colour sequences, thus leaving the subjects to believe that they are taking place in a speed test).  When this task is used in sleep studies, after a time delay, subjects are tested for retention.<ref name=\"awareness\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.01.027 |title=Awareness Modifies the Skill-Learning Benefits of Sleep |year=2004 |last1=Robertson |first1=Edwin M. |last2=Pascual-Leone |first2=Alvaro |last3=Press |first3=Daniel Z. |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=208\u201312 |pmid=14761652}}</ref>\n* In the '''reach-to-grasp task''' rodents learned a skilled forelimb task.

Structural imaging deals predominately with the structure of the brain ([[computed tomography]]) while [[functional imaging]] deals more heavily with metabolic processes in regards to anatomical functioning ([[positron emission tomography]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]).  In recent years, the relationship between sleep and memory processes had been aided by the development of such neuroimaging techniques.<ref name=\"Experiencedependent\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/77744 |year=2000 |last1=Maquet |first1=Pierre |last2=Laureys |first2=Steven |last3=Peigneux |first3=Philippe |last4=Fuchs |first4=Sonia |last5=Petiau |first5=Christophe |last6=Phillips |first6=Christophe |last7=Aerts |first7=Joel |last8=Del Fiore |first8=Guy |last9=Degueldre |first9=Christian |last10=Meulemans |first10=Thierry |last11=Luxen |first11=Andr\u00e9 |last12=Franck |first12=Georges |last13=Van Der Linden |first13=Martial |last14=Smith |first14=Carlyle |last15=Cleeremans |first15=Axel |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=831\u20136 |pmid=10903578 |title=Experience-dependent changes in cerebral activation during human REM sleep|display-authors=8 }}</ref>\n\n[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) is used in viewing a functional processes of the brain (or other body parts). A [[Positron]]-emitting [[radionuclide]] is injected into the blood stream and emits [[gamma rays]] which are detected by an imaging scanner. Computer analysis then allows for a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the brain region or body part of interest.\n\n[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is a type of brain imaging that measures the change of oxygen in the blood due to the activity of neurons. The resulting data can be visualized as a picture of the brain with colored representations of activation.\n\n=== Molecular measures ===\nAlthough this may be seen as similar to neuroimaging techniques, molecular measures help to enhance areas of activation that would otherwise be indecipherable to neuroimaging. One such technique that aids in both the temporal and visual resolution of fMRI is the [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) response. Changes in the BOLD response can be seen when there is differing levels of activation in suspected areas of functioning. Energy is supplied to the brain in the form [[glucose]] and [[oxygen]] (which is transferred by [[hemoglobin]]). The blood supply is consistently regulated so that areas of activation receive higher amounts of energy compared to areas that are less activated.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Siesj\u00f6\n  | first = Bo K.\n  | title = Brain Energy Metabolism \n  | publisher = Wiley\n  | year = 1978\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-471-99515-9\n  | page = 612 }}</ref> In [[positron emission tomography]], the use of [[radionuclides]] ([[isotopes]] with short [[half lives]]) facilitates visual resolution.

For this method, participants often must come into a lab where researchers can use PSG to measure things such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep fragmentation.  PSG can monitor various body functions including brain activity (electroencephalography), eye movement (electrooculography), muscle movement (electromyography), and heart rhythm (electrocardiography).\n\n[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) is a procedure that records electrical activity along the scalp.  This procedure cannot record activity from individual neurons, but instead measures the overall average electrical activity in the brain.\n\n[[Electrooculography]] (EOG) measures the difference in electrical potential between the front and the back of the eye.  This does not measure a response to individual visual stimuli, but instead measures general eye movement.\n\n[[Electromyography]] (EMG) is used to records the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. A device called an [[electromyograph]] measures the electrical potential of muscle cells to monitor muscle movement.\n\n[[Electrocardiography]] (ECG or EKG) measures the electrical depolarization of the heart muscles using various electrodes placed near the chest and limbs.  This measure of depolarization can be used to monitor heart rhythm.\n\n=== Behavioural measures ===\n[[Actigraphy]] is a common and minimally invasive way to measure sleep architecture. Actigraphy has only one method of recording, movement.  This movement can be analyzed using different actigraphic programs.  As such, an actigraph can often be worn similarly to a watch, or around the waist as a belt. Because it is minimally invase and relatively inexpensive, this method allows for recordings outside of a lab setting and for many days at a time.  But, actigraphy often over estimates sleep time (de Souza 2003 and Kanady 2011).\n\n==Competing theories==\nMost studies point to the specific deficits in declarative memories that form pre or post REM sleep deprivation.  Conversely, deficits in non-declarative memory occur pre or post NREM sleep deprivation.  This is the stage specific enhancement theory.<ref name=\"therole\"/>  There is also a proposed dual-step memory hypothesis suggesting that optimal learning occurs when the memory trace is initially processed in SWS and then REM sleep.   Support for this is shown in many experiments where memory improvement is greater with either SWS or REM sleep compared to sleep deprivation, but memory is even more accurate when the sleep period contains both SWS and REM sleep.<ref name=\"therole\"/>\n\n== Declarative memory ==\n[[Declarative memory]] is the memory for conscious events.  There are two types of declarative memory: episodic and semantic.  Episodic memory is for remembering experiences or personal facts whereas semantic memory is remembering specific facts. Declarative memory is typically considered to be an [[explicit memory]] because the individual must consciously try to remember it. \n\n===Temporal memory===\nTemporal memory consists of [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10948/ three main categories], although they are still debated on by psychologists and neurobiologists; the categories are immediate memory, short-term and long-term memory. Immediate memory is when a memory is recalled based on recently presented information. Short-term memory is what is used when retaining information that had been presented within seconds or minutes prior. A type of short-term memory is known as working memory, which is the ability to retain information that is necessary to carry out sequential actions. Lastly, long-term memory is the retention of information for longer periods of time, such as days, weeks or even a lifetime.\n\nIn a study participants were placed in 4 groups; two control groups either given [[caffeine]] or a [[placebo]] and two groups that were [[sleep deprived]] for 36 hours either given caffeine or a placebo. The task used to measure temporal memory consisted of discriminating between recent and less recent face presentations. A set of twelve unfamiliar faces were presented sequentially every 10 seconds. A self-ordered pointing task was used afterwards for 5 minutes to prevent rehearsal and to keep tired participants occupied. This required them to mark any new items seen (either nouns or abstract shapes) presented on 12 sheets. A second set was presented, followed by another self-ordered pointing task, and then a random sequence of 48 faces either containing previously presented faces or new ones were shown to the participant. They were asked if they recognized the faces and whether they were from the first or second set. Results indicate that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but does produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set). Caffeine was found to have a greater effect on the sleep deprived group as compared to the placebo group deprived of sleep but still performed worse than both control groups. Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Brain imaging studies of those sleep deprived found that the greatest reduction in [[metabolic rate]] is in the [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/713755870 |pmid=10718074 |title=Sleep Loss and Temporal Memory |year=2000 |last1=Harrison |first1=Yvonne |last2=Horne |first2=James A. |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A |volume=53 |pages=271\u2013279 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Verbal learning===\nA blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] was used in a study by Drummond et al. to measure the brain's response to verbal learning following sleep deprivation. An fMRI recorded brain activity during a verbal learning task of participants either having a normal night of sleep or those deprived of 34.7 (\u00b1 1.2) hours of sleep. The task alternated between a baseline condition of determining whether nouns were upper or lower case and an experimental condition of memorizing a list of nouns. The results of the study indicate that performance is significantly worse on free recall of the list of nouns when sleep deprived (an average of 2.8 \u00b1 2 words) compared to having a normal night of sleep (4.7 \u00b1 4 words). In terms of brain regions activated, the left [[prefrontal cortex]], [[premotor cortex]], and [[temporal lobe]]s were found to be activated during the task in the rested state and discrete regions of the prefrontal cortex were even more activated during the task in the sleep deprived state. As well, the bilateral [[parietal lobes|parietal lobe]], left [[middle frontal gyrus]], and right interior frontal gyrus were found to be activated for those sleep deprived. The implication of these findings are that the brain can initially compensate for the effects of sleep deprivation while maintaining partially intact performance, which declines with an increasing time-on-task. This initial compensation may be found in the bilateral regions of both frontal and parietal lobes and the activation of the prefrontal cortex is significantly correlated with sleepiness.<ref name=\"pointing\" />\n\n===Cognitive performance===\nCerebral activation during performance on three cognitive tasks (verbal learning, arithmetic, and divided attention) were compared after both normal sleep and 35 hours of total sleep deprivation (TSD) in a study by Drummond and Brown. Use of fMRI measured these differences in the brain. In the verbal learning task, [[fMRI]] indicated the regions involved in both verbal learning and memorization. The results found that both TSD and a normal night of sleep showed a significant response in the prefrontal cortex and following TSD displayed a response of additional areas which included other prefrontal areas, bilateral [[inferior parietal lobule]] and [[superior parietal lobule|superior]] [[parietal lobes]]. Increases in sleepiness also correlated with activation of two [[ventral]] prefrontal regions and a [[correlation]] between a greater activation in bilateral [[parietal lobes]] (which include language areas) and lower levels of impairment on free recall were also found following TSD. In the arithmetic task normal sleep showed the expected activation in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal [[working memory]] regions but following TSD only showed activation in the left superior parietal lobe and the left [[premotor cortex]] in response, with no new areas to compensate (as was found in verbal learning). Increased sleepiness was also correlated with activation in a ventral prefrontal region, but only one region. The divided attention task combined both verbal learning and the arithmetic task. fMRI indicated that cerebral response after TSD is similar to that of the verbal learning task (specifically the right prefrontal cortex, bilateral parietal lobes, and [[cingulate gyrus]] showing the strongest response). The implication of this finding is that additional brain regions activated after both verbal learning and divided attention tasks following TSD represent a cerebral compensatory response to lacking sleep. For example, there is a decline in response of the left temporal lobes during both tasks which is involved in different learning tasks during a rested state but involvement of the left inferior parietal lobe in short-term verbal memory storage following TSD suggests that this region might compensate. No new areas for the arithmetic task may suggest that it relies heavily on working memory so compensation is not possible, in comparison to tasks such as verbal learning which rely less on working memory.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00325-6 |title=The Effects of Total Sleep Deprivation on Cerebral Responses to Cognitive Performance |year=2001 |last1=Drummond |first1=S |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=S68\u201373 |pmid=11682277 |last2=Brown |first2=GG}}</ref>\n\n===Slow wave sleep (SWS)===\n[[Slow wave sleep]] (SWS) has been often associated with successful performance in declarative memory recall tasks. For example, declarative and procedural memory recall tasks applied over early and late nocturnal sleep, as well as wakefulness controlled conditions, have been shown that declarative memory improves more during early sleep (dominated by SWS) while procedural memory during late sleep (dominated by REM sleep).<ref name=\":024\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rasch | first1 = B. | last2 = B\u00fcchel | first2 = C. | last3 = Gais | first3 = S. | last4 = Born | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = Odor cues during slow-wave sleep prompt declarative memory consolidation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5817| pages = 1426\u20139 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138581 | pmid = 17347444 }}</ref><ref name=\":134\">{{cite journal | last1 = Born | first1 = J. | last2 = Wilhelm | first2 = I. | year = 2012 | title = System consolidation of memory during sleep | journal = Psychological Research | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 192\u2013203 | doi = 10.1007/s00426-011-0335-6 | pmid = 21541757 | pmc = 3278619 }}</ref> Based on targeted memory reactivation (TMR) that use associated memory cues for triggering memory traces during sleep, recent studies have been reassuring the importance of nocturnal SWS for the formation of persistent memories in neocortical networks, as well as highlighting the possibility of increasing people's memory performance at declarative recalls.<ref name=\":024\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ngo | first1 = H. | last2 = Martinetz | first2 = T. | last3 = Born | first3 = J. | last4 = M\u00f6lle | first4 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Auditory Closed-Loop Stimulation of the Sleep Slow Oscillation Enhances Memory | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 78 | issue = 3| pages = 545\u2013553 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.03.006 | pmid = 23583623 }}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schreiner | first1 = T. | last2 = Rasch | first2 = B. | year = 2015 | title = Boosting Vocabulary Learning by Verbal Cueing During Sleep | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 25 | issue = 11| pages = 4169\u20134179 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhu139 | pmid = 24962994 }}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schreiner | first1 =  | last2 = Rasch | first2 =  | year = 2017 | title = The beneficial role of memory reactivation for language learning during sleep: A review | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 167 | issue = | pages = 94\u2013105 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2016.02.005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Klinzing | first1 = J. | last2 = Kugler | first2 = S. | last3 = Soekadar | first3 = S. | last4 = Rasch | first4 = B. | last5 = Born | first5 = J. | last6 = Diekelmann | first6 = S. | year = 2018 | title = Odor cueing during slow-wave sleep benefits memory independently of low cholinergic tone | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 235 | issue = 1| pages = 291\u2013299 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-017-4768-5 | pmid = 29119218 | pmc = 5748395 }}</ref> Increased slow activity and sleep time spent in SWS have been also related to better performance in [[implicit learning]].<ref name=\"local sleep\">{{cite journal|last1=Huber|first1=Reto|last2=Felice Ghilardi|first2=M.|last3=Massimini|first3=Marcello|last4=Tononi|first4=Giulio|year=2004|title=Local sleep and learning|journal=Nature|volume=430|issue=6995|pages=78\u201381|bibcode=2004Natur.430...78H|doi=10.1038/nature02663|pmid=15184907}}</ref>\n\n====Macroscopic brain systems====\n\nThe most prominent population pattern in the hippocampus during nREM is called sharp wave ripples (SPW-R). SPW-Rs are the most synchronous neuronal patterns in the mammalian brain. As many as 15-30 percent of neuron in 50-200 ms fire synchronously in the CA3-CA2-CA1, subicular complex and entorhinal cortex during SWP-R (as opposed to ~1 percent during active waking and REM). Neurons within SPW-R are sequentially organized and many of the fast sequences are related to the order of neuronal firing during the pre-sleep experience of the animal. For example, when the rat explores a maze, place cell sequences in the different arms of the maze are replayed either in a forward (as during the experience itself) or reverse order but compressed in time several fold. SPW-R are temporally linked to both sleep spindles and slow oscillations of the neocortex. Interfering with SPW-Rs or its coupling with neocortical slow oscillations results in memory impairment, which can be as severe as surgically damaging the hippocampus and/or associated structures. SPW-R is therefore the most prominent physiological biomarker of episodic (i.e., hippocampus-dependent) memory consolidation (Buzsaki 2015).\n\n=====Neural forebrain reverberation correlation=====\nResearchers used rats in order to investigate the effects of novel tactile objects on the long-term evolution of the major rodent forebrain loops essential in species-specific behaviours, including such structures as the [[hippocampus]], [[putamen]], [[neocortex]]  and the [[thalamus]].<ref name= \"neuronal reverberation\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020024 |title=Long-Lasting Novelty-Induced Neuronal Reverberation during Slow-Wave Sleep in Multiple Forebrain Areas |year=2004 |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Sidarta |last2=Gervasoni |first2=Damien |last3=Soares |first3=Ernesto S. |last4=Zhou |first4=Yi |last5=Lin |first5=Shih-Chieh |last6=Pantoja |first6=Janaina |last7=Lavine |first7=Michael |last8=Nicolelis |first8=Miguel A.

At some point four novel tactile objects were placed in the four corners of the rat's cage.  They were all very different from one another and they were there for a total of one hour.  The brain activity during this hour was used as a baseline or template to compare.  Data analysis implied that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during waking hours or REM sleep. As well, these post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (one hour), indicating [[long term potentiation]].<ref name=\"neuronal reverberation\"/>  Further analysis on a neuron to neuron base showed no subset of neurons (brain structure) to be responsible for the reverberations or anti-reverberations (patterns of activity significantly more dissimilar than novel stimulation templates).  Another difference noticed was the highest correlation peaks in SWS corresponded with the lowest rate of neuron firing in the forebrain, opposite that of REM sleep and waking where rate of firing is the highest.  It is hypothesized that this is due to interference from other incoming stimuli during waking periods.  In SWS there is no incoming stimuli so the novel experience can be replayed, without interruption.<ref name=\"neuronal reverberation\" />\n\n=====Neural hippocampal reverberation correlations=====\nA study by Peigneux ''et al.'', (2004) noted that the firing sequences in the hippocampal ensembles during spatial learning are also active during sleep, which shows that post training sleep has a role in processing spatial memories. This study was done to prove that the same hippocampal areas are activated in humans during route learning in a virtual town, and are reactivated during subsequent [[slow wave sleep]] (SWS).<ref name= \"spatial memories\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.007 |title=Are Spatial Memories Strengthened in the Human Hippocampus during Slow Wave Sleep? |year=2004 |last1=Peigneux |first1=Philippe |last2=Laureys |first2=Steven |last3=Fuchs |first3=Sonia |last4=Collette |first4=Fabienne |last5=Perrin |first5=Fabien |last6=Reggers |first6=Jean |last7=Phillips |first7=Christophe |last8=Degueldre |first8=Christian |last9=Del Fiore |first9=Guy |last10=Aerts |first10=Jo\u00ebl |last11=Luxen |first11=A |last12=Maquet |first12=P |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=535\u201345 |pmid=15504332|display-authors=8 }}</ref> In order to monitor this activation, experimenters used [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]] and [[fMRI]] to use cerebral blood flow as a marker of synaptic activity. The finding noted that the amount of hippocampal activation during slow-wave sleep positively correlated to the improvement on the virtual tour task the following day, which indicates that hippocampal activity during sleep correlates with the improvement in memory performance. These findings prove that learning-dependent modulation in hippocampal activity while sleeping shows processing of the previously learned episodic and spatial memory traces. This modulation of the hippocampus leads to plastic changes in the brain and ultimately an improvement in performance. The results of this study showed that spatial memory traces are processed in humans while they are in [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]]. It showed a reaction of the hippocampal formation during SWS, after a declarative spatial memory task. Experimenters also found, that in humans, there is experience dependent modulations of activity during NREM sleep in the hippocampal regions, but not during REM sleep after learning. The evidence from this study was substantial to its hypothesis that the information learned while awake, is altered, and strengthened while humans are sleeping.<ref name=\"spatial memories\" />\n\nBased on the active system consolidation hypothesis, repeated reactivations of newly encoded information in hippocampus during slow oscillations in NREM sleep mediate the stabilization and gradually integration of declarative memory with pre-existing knowledge networks on the cortical level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Diekelmann | first1 = Susanne | last2 = Born | first2 = Jan | year = 2010 | title = The memory function of sleep | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 114\u2013126 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2762 | pmid = 20046194 }}</ref> It assumes the hippocampus might hold information only temporarily and in fast-learning rate, whereas the neocortex is related to long-term storage and slow-learning rate.<ref name=\":024\" /><ref name=\":134\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rasch | first1 = B. | last2 = Born | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = About sleep's role in memory | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 681\u2013766 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00032.2012 | pmid = 23589831 | pmc = 3768102 }}</ref> This dialogue between hippocampus and neocortex occurs in parallel with hippocampal [[Sharp waves and ripples|sharp-wave ripples]] and [[Sleep spindle|thalamo-cortical spindles]], synchrony that drives the formation of spindle-ripple event which seems to be a prerequisite for the formation of long-term memories.<ref name=\":134\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Decreases in acetylcholine====\nIn this study, two groups of participants took part in a two night counterbalanced   study.  Two tasks were learned by all participants between 10:00-10:30pm.  The declarative task was a paired-associate word list of 40 German semantically related word pairs.  The non-declarative task was a mirror-tracing task.  At 11:00pm all participants were put on a two-hour infusion of either [[physostigmine]] or a [[placebo]].  Physostigmine is an [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]; it is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of the inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]], thereby allowing it to remain active longer in the [[chemical synapse|synapses]].  The sleep group was put to bed while the other group stayed awake.  Testing of both tasks took place at 2:45am, 30 minutes after the sleep group had been woken up; a sleep which had been rich in [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS).  Results showed that the increased ACh negatively affected [[recall (memory)|recall memory]] (declarative task), in the sleep condition compared to participants given the placebo.<ref name=\"krista\" /> Specifically, recall after sleep for the placebo group showed an increase of 5.2 \u00b1 0.8 words compared to an increase of only 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 words when participants were given the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.  Conversely, neither speed nor accuracy declined in the non-declarative mirror task when participants were given physostigmine, and neither task performance was affected in the wake groups when physotigmine was administered.  This suggests that the purpose of ACh suppression during SWS allows for hippocampus \u2013dependent  declarative memory consolidation; high levels of ACh during SWS blocks memory replay on a hippocampal level.<ref name=\"krista\"/>\n*Note:  There was no correlation between the amount of SWS and level of recall.  Memory consolidation can be disrupted, however, if large parts on SWS are missing.\n\n====Increases in sleep spindles====\n[[File:Stage2sleep.svg|thumb|right|A typical EEG during stage 2 sleep]]\n[[Sleep spindles]] are short and intense bursts of neurons firing in sync, occurring in the thalamo-cortical networks. These peak late in the night and are defining characteristics of [[Sleep#Stages of sleep|stage two sleep]]. Sleep spindles are thought to aid in information consolidating during sleep and have been shown to increase after training on a motor task.<ref name=\"practice with\"/>\n\nA study, using 49 rats indicated the increase of sleep spindles during [[slow-wave sleep]] following learning. It gave evidence to the increase of spindle frequency during non-REM sleep following paired associate of motor-skill learning tasks. Using an [[electroencephalography|EEG]], sleep spindles were detected and showed to be present only during slow-wave sleep. Beginning with a preliminary study, rats underwent six hours of monitored sleep, after a period of learning. Results showed that during the first hour following learning, there was the most evident effect on learning-modulated sleep spindle density. However, this increase in spindle density was not dependent on the training condition. In other words, there was an increase in spindles regardless of how the rats were trained. EEG patterns showed a significant difference in the density of sleep spindles compared to the density of a control group of rats, who did not undergo any training before their sleep spindles were measured. This effect of increased spindle density only lasted for the first hour into sleep following training, and then disappeared within the second hour into sleep.\n\n=== Reward learning and memory ===\nIn a study by Fischer and Born, 2009,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0017256 |pmid=19857029 |title=Anticipated reward enhances offline learning during sleep |year=2009 |last1=Fischer |first1=Stefan |last2=Born |first2=Jan |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=1586\u20131593}}</ref> previous knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be significant predictors of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks that would have to be replicated at a later time. The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A [[control group]] was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.\n\n== Non-declarative memory ==\n[[Non-declarative memory]] is memory gained from previous experiences that is unconsciously applied to everyday scenarios. Non-declarative memory is essential for the performance of learned skills and habits, for example, running or cooking a favourite meal. There are three types of non-declarative memories: [[implicit memory]] (unconscious memory, [[priming (psychology)|priming]]), instrumental memory ([[classical conditioning]]), and [[procedural memory]] (automatic skill memory).\n\n===Sleep deprivation===\n====ERK phosphorylation====\nExtracellular signal-related kinases, also known as classical [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAP kinase]], are a group of protein kinases located in neurons.  These proteins are activated or deactivated by [[phosphorylation]] (adding of a phosphate group using ATP), in response to neurotransmitters and growth factors.<ref name=\"brain research\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2004.05.032 |title=Sleep deprivation impairs spatial memory and decreases extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in the hippocampus |year=2004 |last1=Guan |first1=Zhiwei |last2=Peng |first2=Xuwen |last3=Fang |first3=Jidong |journal=Brain Research |volume=1018 |pages=38\u201347 |pmid=15262203 |issue=1}}</ref>  This can result in subsequent protein to protein interactions and signal transductions (neurotransmitters or hormones transmit to cells), which ultimately controls all cellular processes including gene transcription and cell cycles (important in learning and memory).  A study tested four groups of rats in the Morris Water Maze, two groups in the spatial task (hidden platform) and two groups in the non-spatial task (visible platform.)  The effects of six hours of total [[sleep deprivation]] (TSD) were assessed for the experimental group (one spatial group, one non-spatial group) in both tasks. Six hours after the TSD period (or sleep period for controls), the groups of rats were trained on either task then tested 24 hours later.  In addition, the levels of  total ERK phosphorylation (ERK 1 and ERK 2), protein phosphate 1 (PP1), and MAPK phosphatase 2 (latter two both involved in dephosphorylation) were assessed by decapitating four other groups of mice, (two sleep deprived and two non-sleep deprived), and removing their hippocampuses after the six hours of TSD, or two hours after TSD (eight hours total).  Results showed that TSD did not impair learning of the spatial task, but it did impair memory.  With regards to the non-spatial task, learning again was no different in the TSD; however, memory in the TSD group was actually slightly better, although not quite significantly.  Analysis of the hippocampus showed that TSD significantly decreased the levels of total ERK phosphorylation by about 30%. TSD did not affect proteins in the cortex which indicates that the decreases in ERK levels were due to impaired signal transduction in the hippocampus.  In addition, neither PP1 or MAPK phosphatase 2 levels were increased suggesting that the decreases in ERK were not due to dephosphorylation but instead a result of TSD.  Therefore, it is proposed that TSD has aversive effects on the cellular processes (ERK: gene transcription etc.), underlying sleep-dependent memory plasticity.<ref name=\"brain research\" />\n\n=== REM sleep ===\n[[REM sleep]] is known for its vivid creations and similarity to the bioelectric outputs of a waking person. This stage of sleep is characterized by muscle atonia, fast but low voltage [[EEG]] and, as the name suggests, rapid eye movement. It is difficult to attribute memory gains to a single stage of sleep when it may be the entire [[sleep cycle]] that is responsible for [[memory consolidation]]. Recent research conducted by Datta et al.<ref name=Datta2000>{{cite journal |first1=Subimal |last1=Datta |title=Avoidance Task Training Potentiates Phasic Pontine-Wave Density in the Rat: A Mechanism for Sleep-Dependent Plasticity |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=11069969 |pmc=6773158 |year=2000 |volume=20 |issue=22 |pages=8607\u201313|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-22-08607.2000 }}</ref> used an avoidance task followed by a post-training REM sleep period to examine changes in [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P waves]] affecting reprocessing of recently acquired stimuli. It was found that not only were the P waves increased during post-training sleep but also the density of the waves. These findings may imply that P waves during REM sleep may help to activate critical forebrain and cortical structures dealing with memory consolidation. In a Hennevin et al. study, 1989,<ref name=\"Hennevin1\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0163-1047(89)90948-5 |title=Improvement of learning by mesencephalic reticular stimulation during postlearning paradoxical sleep |year=1989 |last1=Hennevin |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Hars |first2=Bernard |last3=Bloch |first3=Vincent |journal=Behavioral and Neural Biology |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=291\u2013306 |pmid=2730495}}</ref> the mesencephalic [[reticular formation]] (MRF) was given light [[electrical stimulation]], during REM sleep, which is known to have an advantageous effect for learning when applied after training. The rats in the experiment were trained to run a maze in search of a food reward. One group of rats was given non-awakening MRF electrical stimulations after each of their maze trials compared to a [[control group]] which did not receive any electrical stimulation. It was noticed that the stimulated rats performed significantly better in respect to error reduction. These findings imply that dynamic memory processes occur both during training as well as during post-training sleep. Another study by Hennevin et al. (1998)<ref name=\"Hennevin2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.112.4.839|title= Neuronal plasticity induced by fear conditioning is expressed during paradoxical sleep: Evidence from simultaneous recordings in the lateral amygdala and the medial geniculate in rats |year=1998 |last1=Hennevin |first1=Elizabeth |last2= Maho|first2= Catherine|last3= Hars|first3= Bernard|journal= Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=112 |issue=4|pages=839\u2013862|pmid=}}</ref> conditioned rats to fear a noise that is associated with a subsequent foot shock. The interesting part of the experiment is that fear responding to the noise (measured in the [[amygdala]]) was observed when the noise was presented during REM sleep. This was compared to a group of pseudo-conditioned rats who did not display the same amygdalar activation during post-training sleep. This would suggest that neural responding to previously salient stimuli is maintained even during REM sleep. There is no shortage of research conducted on the effects that REM sleep has on the working brain but consistency in the findings is what plagues recent research. There is no guarantee as to what functions REM sleep may perform for our bodies and brains but modern research is always expanding and assimilating new ideas to further our understanding of such processes.\n\n====PGO waves====\nIn animals, the appearance of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves ([[PGO waves]]) is related to that of the bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements.<ref name=\"Dang\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13638490500138702 |pmid=16449068 |title=A role for sleep in brain plasticity |year=2006 |last1=Dang-Vu |first1=T.

Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006,<ref name=\"Dang\"/> reported that the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and [[occipital cortex]] display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and [[memory consolidation]].  An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions.<ref name=Datta2000/><ref name=\"Datta et al 2004\">{{cite journal |first1=Subimal |last1=Datta |first2=Vijayakumar |last2=Mavanji |first3=Jagadish |last3=Ulloor |first4=Elissa H. |last4=Patterson |title=Activation of Phasic Pontine-Wave Generator Prevents Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Deprivation-Induced Learning Impairment in the Rat: A Mechanism for Sleep-Dependent Plasticity |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=14960614 |pmc=6730333 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4111-03.2004 |year=2004 |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=1416\u201327}}</ref> In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]] generator (located in the [[pontine tegmentum]]) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a [[carbachol]] injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point to the fact that the activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.\n\n====Implicit face memory====\nFaces are an important part of one's social life.  To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the [[fusiform gyrus]] (occipito-temporal brain area) and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of [[implicit memory]].<ref name=\"signsof\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-0511(02)00125-4 |title=Signs of REM sleep dependent enhancement of implicit face memory: A repetition priming study |year=2003 |last1=Wagner |first1=Ullrich |last2=Hallschmid |first2=Manfred |last3=Verleger |first3=Rolf |last4=Born |first4=Jan |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=197\u2013210 |pmid=12633978|citeseerx=10.1.1.607.6441 }}</ref> REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit [[visuospatial]] memory processes, rather than [[slow-wave sleep]] which is crucial for explicit [[memory consolidation]]. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance.<ref name=\"signsof\"/>  A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces.<ref name=\"signsof\"/>\n\n====Macroscopic brain systems====\nPrevious research has shown REM sleep to reactivate cortical neural assemblies post-training on a [[serial reaction time]] task (SRT), in other words REM sleep replays the processing that occurred while one learnt an implicit task in the previous waking hours.<ref name=\"Learned Material\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(88)90787-2 |title=Nerve growth factor promotes survival of cultured magnocellular cholinergic neurons from nucleus basalis of Meynert in postnatal rats |year=1988 |last1=Hatanaka |first1=Hiroshi |last2=Nihonmatsu |first2=Itsuko |last3=Tsukui |first3=Hiroko |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=90 |pages=63\u20138 |pmid=2842704 |issue=1\u20132}}</ref> However, control subjects did not complete a SRT task, thus researchers could not assume the reactivation of certain networks to be a result of the implicitly learned sequence/grammar as it could simply be due to elementary visuomotor processing which was obtained in both groups.  To answer this question the experiment was redone and another group was added who also took part in the SRT task.  They experienced no sequence to the SRT task (random group),  whereas the experimental group did experience a sequence (probabilistic group), although without conscious awareness.  Results of  PET scans indicate that bilateral cuneus were significantly more activated during SRT practice as well as post-training REM sleep in the Probabilistic group than the Random group.<ref name=\"Learned Material\" />  In addition, this activation was significantly increased during REM sleep versus the SRT task.  This suggests that specific brain regions are specifically engaged in the post-processing of sequential information.  This is further supported by the fact that regional CBF (rCBF) during post-training REM sleep are modulated by the level of high-order, but not low-order learning obtained prior to sleep.  Therefore, brain regions that take part in a learning process are modulated by both the sequential structure of the learned material (increased activation in cuneus), and the amount of high-order learning (rCBF).<ref name=\"Learned Material\" />\n\n====REM sleep deprivation and neurotrophic factors====\nThe effects of REM sleep deprivation (RSD) on neurotrophic  factors, specifically [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF), were assessed in 2000 by Sie et el.  [[Neurotrophin]]s are proteins found in the brain and periphery that aid in the survival, functioning and generation of [[neurons]]; this is an important element in the [[synaptic plasticity]] process, the underlying neurochemical foundation in forming memories.<ref name=\"Differential Effects\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(00)02708-6 |title=Differential effect of short-term REM sleep deprivation on NGF and BDNF protein levels in the rat brain |year=2000 |last1=Sei |first1=Hiroyoshi |last2=Saitoh |first2=Daisuke |last3=Yamamoto |first3=Kei |last4=Morita |first4=Kyoji |last5=Morita |first5=Yusuke |journal=Brain Research |volume=877 |issue=2 |pages=387\u201390 |pmid=10986357}}</ref> Sei et al., inserted [[electrode]]s into the skulls of seven pairs of rats to measure [[electroencephalography|Electroencephalogram]] (EEG), and inserted wire into the neck muscles of the rats to measure [[Electromyogram]] (EMG), a technique used to measure the amount of muscle activity.   Half the rats experienced a six-hour REM sleep deprivation period, while the other half experienced a six-hour sleep period, containing all sleep cycles.  Results showed that in the rats in the REM sleep deprivation group showed decreased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the [[cerebellum]] (coordination, motor learning) and [[brainstem]] (sensory and motor ascending pathway), conversely the [[hippocampus]] (long-term memory, spatial navigation), showed decreases in nerve growth factor levels.  BDNF protein has been shown to be necessary for [[procedural memory|procedural learning]] (form of non-declarative memory).  Since procedural learning has also exhibited consolidation and enhancement under REM sleep, it is proposed that the impairment of procedural learning tasks is due to the lack of BDNF proteins in the cerebellum and brainstem during RSD.<ref name=\"Differential Effects\" />  In regards to NGF, the [[basal forebrain]] (production and distribution of AcH in the brain), more specifically the medial septal area, sends [[cholinergic]] (excitatory in hippocampus) and GABAinergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters through fibres to the hippocampus target cells.  These target cells then secrete NGF which plays a key role in the physiological state of the hippocampus and its functions.  It has been noted that REM sleep increases the secretion of NGF, therefore it has been proposed that during RSD cholinergic activity decreases leading to a decrease in NGF and impairment in procedural learning.<ref name=\"Differential Effects\" />\n[[File:Vertebrate-brain-regions.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=A mid-sagittal view of the brain. The hippocampus is represented by the light blue arc.|Vertebrate brain regions]]\n\n=== Macroscopic brain system reorganization ===\nWalker and Stickgold hypothesized that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level.<ref name=\"walker\"/> Their experiment consisted of two groups; the night-sleep group was taught a motor sequence block tapping task at night, put to sleep and then retested 12 hours later. The day-wake group was taught the same task in the morning and tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI was used to measure brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep group compared to the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum ([[olfactory tubercle]], [[nucleus accumbens]]), as well as regions of the [[cerebellum]] (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed \"decreased\" signal activation bilaterally in the [[parietal lobe|parietal cortices]] (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex.<ref name=\"walker\"/> Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate brain plasticity. The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would have to sleep in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n\n=== Working memory ===\nConsidered to be a mental workspace enabling temporary storage and retrieval of information, [[working memory]] is crucial to problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity is a measure of the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Aritake et al.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2039-08.2008 |title=Sleep Accelerates the Improvement in Working Memory Performance |year=2008 |last1=Kuriyama |first1=K. |last2=Mishima |first2=K. |last3=Suzuki |first3=H. |last4=Aritake |first4=S. |last5=Uchiyama |first5=M. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=40 |pages=10145\u201350 |pmid=18829972|pmc=6671268 }}</ref> conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5\u20136 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved [[fluid intelligence]].\n\n==== Sleep deprivation ====\n[[Sleep deprivation]], whether it is total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation, can impair [[working memory]] in measures of memory, speed of [[cognition|cognitive processing]], attention and task switching. Casement et al. found that when subjects were asked to recognize digits displayed on a screen by typing them on a keypad, the working memory speed of subjects whose sleep was restricted to four hours a night (approximately 50% of their normal sleep amount) were 58% slower than control groups who were allowed their full eight hours of sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2005.11.002 |title=The contribution of sleep to improvements in working memory scanning speed: A study of prolonged sleep restriction |year=2006 |last1=Casement |first1=Melynda D. |last2=Broussard |first2=Josiane L. |last3=Mullington |first3=Janet M. |last4=Press |first4=Daniel Z. |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=208\u201312 |pmid=16384630 |pmc=4120641}}</ref>\n\n==Synaptic plasticity==\nThe brain is an ever-changing, plastic, model of information sharing and processing. In order for the brain to incorporate new experiences into a refined [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] it has to undergo specific modifications to consolidate and assimilate all new information.<ref name=\"Dang\"/> [[Synaptic plasticity]] can be described as the changing in strength between two related neurons. Neuroplasticity is most clearly seen in the instances of REM sleep deprivation during brain maturation. Regional brain measurements in neo-natal REM sleep deprived rats displayed a significant size reduction in areas such as the [[cerebral cortex]] and the [[brain stem]]. The rats were deprived during critical periods after birth and thus anatomical size reduction is observed.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0165-3806(83)90184-0 |title=Effects of experimental suppression of active (REM) sleep during early development upon adult brain and behavior in the rat |year=1983 |last1=Mirmiran |first1=M. |last2=Scholtens |first2=J. |last3=Van De Poll |first3=N.E. |last4=Uylings |first4=H.B.M. |last5=Van Der Gugten |first5=J. |last6=Boer |first6=G.J. |journal=Developmental Brain Research |volume=7 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=277\u201386 |pmid=6850353}}</ref> Using a pursuit task (used to test visuomotor capabilities) in combination with an [[fMRI]], Maquet et al., 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Pierre |last1=Maquet |first2=Sophie |last2=Schwartz |first3=Richard |last3=Passingham |first4=Christopher |last4=Frith |title=Sleep-Related Consolidation of a Visuomotor Skill: Brain Mechanisms as Assessed by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=12598632 |pmc=6742239 |year=2003 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=1432\u201340|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-04-01432.2003 }}</ref> found that increases in activation were seen in the supplementary eye field and right [[dentate nucleus]] of subjects who were allowed to sleep as compared to sleep deprived individuals. The right [[superior temporal sulcus]] was also noticed to have higher activation levels. When functional connectivity was analyzed it was found that the dentate nucleus was more closely involved with the functions of the superior temporal sulcus. The results suggest that performance on the pursuit task relies on the subject's ability to comprehend appropriate movement patterns in order for recreation of the optimal movements. Sleep deprivation was found to interrupt the slow processes that lead to learning of this procedural skill and alter connectivity changes that would have normally been seen after a night of rest. [[Neuroplasticity]] has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades and results have shown that significant changes that occur in our cortical processing areas have the power to modulate neuronal firing to both new and previously experienced stimuli.\n\n===Neurotransmitter regulation===\nThe changes in quantity of a certain neurotransmitter as well as how the post-synaptic terminal responds to this change are underlying mechanisms of brain plasticity.<ref name=\"Dang\"/> During sleep there are remarkable changes in modulatory neurotransmitters throughout the brain.[[Acetylcholine]] is an [[excitatory neurotransmitter]] that is seen to increase to near waking levels during REM sleep while compared to lower levels during slow-wave sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1309574 |pmc = 6575696|title=Cellular mechanisms underlying cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation of neuronal firing mode in the cat and guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus |date=1992-01-01 |first1=DA |last1=McCormick |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=278\u201389|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.12-01-00278.1992 }}</ref> Evidence has shown that functioning of the hippocampus dependent memory system ([[episodic memory]] and [[autobiographical memory]]) is directly affected by cholinergic changes throughout the wake-sleep cycle. High levels of ACh would promote information attained during wakefulness to be stored in the hippocampus. This is accomplished by suppressing previous excitatory connections while facilitating encoding without interference from previously stored information. During [[NREM]] sleep, and especially [[slow-wave sleep]], low levels of Ach would cause the release of this suppression and allow for spontaneous recovery of hippocampal neurons resulting in the facilitation of [[memory consolidation]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01365-0 |title=Neuromodulation: Acetylcholine and memory consolidation |year=1999 |last1=Hasselmo |first1=Michael E. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=351\u2013359 |pmid=10461198}}</ref>\n\n=== Gene expression ===\nRecently, approximately one hundred genes whose brain expression is increased during periods of sleep have been found.<ref name=\"cirelli\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00814-6 |title=Extensive and Divergent Effects of Sleep and Wakefulness on Brain Gene Expression |year=2004 |last1=Cirelli |first1=Chiara |last2=Gutierrez |first2=Christina M. |last3=Tononi |first3=Giulio |journal=Neuron |volume=41 |pages=35\u201343 |pmid=14715133 |issue=1}}</ref> A similar number of genes were found to promote gene expression during wakefulness. These sets of genes are related to different functional groups which may promote different cellular processes.

There was a sleep related increase in processes that involve the synthesis and maintenance of the synapse. Such processes include [[membrane trafficking]], [[synaptic vesicle]] recycling, myelin structural protein formation, and [[cholesterol]] and [[protein synthesis]]. In a different study it was found that there was a sleep related increase in [[calmodulin]]-dependent [[protein kinase]] IV that has been specifically involved in synaptic depression and in the consolidation of [[long-term memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80808-9 |title=A Late Phase of Cerebellar Long-Term Depression Requires Activation of CaMKIV and CREB |year=1999 |last1=Ahn |first1=Sohyun |last2=Ginty |first2=David D. |last3=Linden |first3=David J. |journal=Neuron |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=559\u201368 |pmid=10433267}}</ref> These findings encourage an association between sleep and different aspects of neural plasticity.<ref name=\"cirelli\"/>\n\n== Alternative sleep schedules ==\n===Motor skills learning===\nThe impact of daytime [[nap]]s was looked at by Walker and Stickgold (2005).<ref name=\"It's practice\"/>  The experimental group was given a 60-90 minute afternoon nap (one full cycle), after a [[motor skill]]s task learned that morning, while the control group received no nap.

However, it seemed to all even out after that same nights sleep; the no-nap group improved 24% and the nap group improved only 7% more for a total of 23%, virtually identical.

The individuals that were allowed a 30-60 minute nap seemed to gain stabilization of the skill as no deterioration occurred.  If allowed a 60-90 minute nap ([[REM sleep]] and [[slow-wave sleep]]), individuals displayed enhancement.

Therefore, the formation of a specific memory occurs rapidly, but the evolution of a memory is often an ongoing process.\n\nMemory processes have been shown to be stabilized and enhanced (sped up and/or integrated) and memories better [[memory consolidation|consolidated]] by nocturnal [[sleep]] and even daytime [[nap]]s. Certain [[sleep stages]] have been demonstrated as improving an individual's memory, though this is task-specific. Generally, [[declarative memory|declarative memories]] are believed to be enhanced by [[slow-wave sleep]], while [[non-declarative memory|non-declarative memories]] are enhanced by [[REM sleep|rapid eye movement (REM) sleep]], although there are some inconsistencies among experimental results. The effect of sleep on memory, especially as it pertains to the [[human brain]], is an active field of research in [[neurology]], [[psychology]], and related disciplines.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1801, David Hartley first postulated that dreaming altered the associative planetary links within the brain during dreaming periods of dreams. The idea that sleep had a mentally restorative effect, sorting out and consolidating memories and ideas, was intellectually acceptable by the end of the 19th century. In \u2018Peter and Wendy\u2019,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter and Wendy|last=Barrie|first=James|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|year=1911|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> [[J.M. Barrie]] wrote  ''\u2018It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day. \u2026When you wake in the morning, the naughtinesses and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind; and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.\u2019'' The stories of Peter Pan take place in a mental world and contain many allusions to aspects of [[cognitive psychology]], some of which predate their formal scientific investigation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Peter Pan and the Mind of J.

It was not until 1953, however, when sleep was delineated into rapid eye movement sleep and [[non-rapid eye movement sleep]], that studies focusing on the effect of specific sleep stages on memory were conducted.<ref name=\"walker\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.04.007 |title=Sleep-dependent motor memory plasticity in the human brain |year=2005 |last1=Walker |first1=M.P. |last2=Stickgold |first2=R. |last3=Alsop |first3=D. |last4=Gaab |first4=N. |last5=Schlaug |first5=G. |journal=Neuroscience |volume=133 |issue=4 |pages=911\u20137 |pmid=15964485}}</ref> As behavioral characteristics of the effects of sleep and memory are becoming increasingly understood and supported, researchers are turning to the weakly understood neural basis of sleep and memory.<ref name=\"sleepmemory\" />\n\n== Sleep cycles ==\n[[File:Simplified Sleep Phases.jpg|thumb|Sleep cycles, with REM indicated in red]]\nSleep progresses in a cyclical fashion through five stages. Four of these stages are collectively referred to as ''non-rapid eye movement'' (NREM) sleep whereas the last cycle is a rapid eye movement period. A cycle takes approximately 90\u2013110 minutes to complete. Wakefulness is found through [[EEG]] measures to be characterized by ''[[beta wave]]s'' which are the highest in frequency and lowest in amplitude and tend to move inconsistently due to the vast amount of stimuli a person encounters while awake. \n*Pre-sleep is the period of decreased perceptual awareness where brain activity is characterized by ''[[alpha waves]]'' which are more rhythmic, higher in amplitude and lower in frequency compared to beta waves.\n*Stage one is characterized by light sleep and lasts roughly 10 minutes. Brain waves gradually transition to ''[[theta waves]]''.\n*Stage two also contains theta waves; however, random short bursts of increased frequency called ''[[sleep spindles]]'' are a defining characteristic of this stage.\n*Stage three and four are very similar and together are considered to be \"deep sleep\". In  these stages brain activity transitions to ''[[delta waves]]'' which are the lowest in frequency and highest in amplitude. These two stages combined are also called ''slow wave sleep'' (SWS).\n*Stage five, REM sleep, is one of the most interesting stages as brain wave patterns are similar to those seen in relaxed wakefulness. This is referred to as \"active sleep\" and is the period when most dreaming occurs. REM sleep is also thought to play a role in the cognitive development of infants and children as they spend much more of their sleep in REM periods opposed to adults.\nDuring the first half of the night, the largest portion of sleep is spent as SWS, but as the night progresses SWS stages decrease in length while REM stages increase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sleepdisorders.about.com/od/doihaveasleepdisorder/a/Sleep_Stage_Basics.htm |title=Understanding the Basics of Sleep Stages |first=Brandon |last=Peters |publisher=[[About.com]] |date=January 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Memory terms ==\n=== Stabilization vs. enhancement ===\nStabilization of a memory is the anchoring of a memory in place, in which a weak connection is established.  Stabilization of [[procedural memory|procedural memories]] can even occur during waking hours, suggesting that specific non-declarative tasks are enhanced in the absence of sleep.<ref name=\"sleepmemory\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070307 |title=Sleep, Memory, and Plasticity |year=2006 |last1=Walker |first1=Matthew P. |last2=Stickgold |first2=Robert |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=57 |pages=139\u201366 |pmid=16318592 |issue=1|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/037b4b2a47d2f35fad62fc4d7ca3e8998f4e2c39 }}</ref>\nWhen memories are said to be enhanced, however, the connection is strengthened by rehearsal as well as connecting it to other related memories thereby making the retrieval more efficient.  Whereas stabilization of non-declarative memories can be seen to occur during a wakeful state, ''enhancement'' of these sensory and [[motor learning|motor memories]] has most been found to occur during nocturnal sleep.<ref name=\"sleepmemory\"/>\n\n=== Use-dependent processes vs. experience-dependent processes ===\nBrain activity that occurs during sleep is assessed in two ways: Use-dependency, and Experience-dependency.<ref name=\"therole\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1062856 |title=The Role of Sleep in Learning and Memory |year=2001 |last1=Maquet |first1=P. |journal=Science |volume=294 |issue=5544 |pages=1048\u201352 |pmid=11691982|bibcode = 2001Sci...294.1048M }}</ref> \nUse-dependent brain activity is a result of the neuronal usage that occurred during the previous waking hours.  Essentially it is neuronal regeneration, activity that occurs whether you have learnt anything new or not.<ref name=\"therole\"/>\n\nExperience-dependent brain activity is a result of a new situation, environment, or learned task or fact that has taken place in the pre-sleep period.   This is the type of brain activity that denotes memory consolidation/enhancement.<ref name=\"therole\"/>\n\nIt is often hard to distinguish between the two in an experimental setting because the setting alone is a new environment. This new environment would be seen in the sleeping brain activity along with the newly learned task.  To avoid this, most experimenters insist participants spend one day in the experimental condition before testing begins so the setting is not novel once the experiment begins.  This ensures the collected data for experience-dependent brain activity is purely from the novel task.\n\n===Consolidation===\n{{See also|memory consolidation}}\nConsolidation of a memory is a process that takes an initially unstable representation and encodes it in a more sturdy, effective and efficient manner. In this new state, the memory is less susceptible to interference.<ref name=\"walker\"/> There are essentially three phases of [[memory consolidation]] and all are thought to be facilitated by sleep or not sleep:\n# ''Stabilization'' is the encoding of a memory which takes only  6 milliseconds.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n# ''Enhancement'' is the continual process of consolidation which can occur over minutes, 7 hours, days but not longer.<ref name=\"walker\"/>  Post-sleep behavioural activities can be seen to show significant improvements in the absence of practice.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n# ''Integration'' can also take hours or years and is the process of connecting recently encoded memories into existing memory networks.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n\n===Reconsolidation===\nReconsolidation of a memory involves the retrieval of an already consolidated memory (explicit or implicit), into short-term or working memory.   Here it is brought into a labile state where subsequent information can 'interfere' with what is currently in memory, therefore altering the memory.  This is known as retroactive interference, and is an extremely significant issue for court and eyewitness testimonies.<ref name=\"consolidation2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2007.03.011 |title=Sleep-dependent memory consolidation and reconsolidation |year=2007 |last1=Stickgold |first1=Robert |last2=Walker |first2=Matthew P. |journal=Sleep Medicine |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=331\u201343 |pmid=17470412 |pmc=2680680}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-training vs post-training sleep deprivation===\nResearchers approach the study of sleep and memory from different angles. Some studies measure the effects of [[sleep deprivation]] ''after'' a novel task is taught (the subject learns the task and is sleep deprived afterwards). This is referred to as ''post-training sleep deprivation''. Conversely, other experiments have been conducted that measure the effects of sleep deprivation ''before'' a task has been taught (the subject is sleep-deprived and then learns a task). This is referred to as ''pre-training sleep deprivation''.\n\n===Offline memory processing===\nThis is the processing of memories out of conscious awareness.  After you are finished reading something, for example this very article about sleep and memory, your brain continues to process the information even as you accomplish other tasks like playing a game of soccer.  This \"offline\" processing likewise occurs in your sleep.<ref name=\"consolidation2\"/>\n\n== Methods of measuring memory ==\n===Behavioral measures===\n* A '''self-ordered pointing task''' is a task of memory where a participant is presented with a number of images (or words) which are arranged on a display. Several trials are presented, each with a different arrangement and containing some of the previous words or images.

During the first phase (acquisition), the responses of the paired-associate task are learned and become recallable. In the second phase (associative phase), the subject learns to pair each response to a separate [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]].

The subjects are asked to react as fast and accurately as possible to the appearance of a stimulus below one of the markers. Subjects can be trained on the task with either explicit instructions (e.g. there are colour sequences presented which must be learned) or implicit ones (e.g. the experimentor does not mention colour sequences, thus leaving the subjects to believe that they are taking place in a speed test).

Structural imaging deals predominately with the structure of the brain ([[computed tomography]]) while [[functional imaging]] deals more heavily with metabolic processes in regards to anatomical functioning ([[positron emission tomography]], [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]]).  In recent years, the relationship between sleep and memory processes had been aided by the development of such neuroimaging techniques.<ref name=\"Experiencedependent\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/77744 |year=2000 |last1=Maquet |first1=Pierre |last2=Laureys |first2=Steven |last3=Peigneux |first3=Philippe |last4=Fuchs |first4=Sonia |last5=Petiau |first5=Christophe |last6=Phillips |first6=Christophe |last7=Aerts |first7=Joel |last8=Del Fiore |first8=Guy |last9=Degueldre |first9=Christian |last10=Meulemans |first10=Thierry |last11=Luxen |first11=Andr\u00e9 |last12=Franck |first12=Georges |last13=Van Der Linden |first13=Martial |last14=Smith |first14=Carlyle |last15=Cleeremans |first15=Axel |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=3 |issue=8 |pages=831\u20136 |pmid=10903578 |title=Experience-dependent changes in cerebral activation during human REM sleep|display-authors=8 }}</ref>\n\n[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) is used in viewing a functional processes of the brain (or other body parts). A [[Positron]]-emitting [[radionuclide]] is injected into the blood stream and emits [[gamma rays]] which are detected by an imaging scanner. Computer analysis then allows for a 3-dimensional reconstruction of the brain region or body part of interest.\n\n[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is a type of brain imaging that measures the change of oxygen in the blood due to the activity of neurons. The resulting data can be visualized as a picture of the brain with colored representations of activation.\n\n=== Molecular measures ===\nAlthough this may be seen as similar to neuroimaging techniques, molecular measures help to enhance areas of activation that would otherwise be indecipherable to neuroimaging. One such technique that aids in both the temporal and visual resolution of fMRI is the [[blood-oxygen-level dependent]] (BOLD) response. Changes in the BOLD response can be seen when there is differing levels of activation in suspected areas of functioning. Energy is supplied to the brain in the form [[glucose]] and [[oxygen]] (which is transferred by [[hemoglobin]]). The blood supply is consistently regulated so that areas of activation receive higher amounts of energy compared to areas that are less activated.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Siesj\u00f6\n  | first = Bo K.\n  | title = Brain Energy Metabolism \n  | publisher = Wiley\n  | year = 1978\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-471-99515-9\n  | page = 612 }}</ref> In [[positron emission tomography]], the use of [[radionuclides]] ([[isotopes]] with short [[half lives]]) facilitates visual resolution.

For this method, participants often must come into a lab where researchers can use PSG to measure things such as total sleep time, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, and sleep fragmentation.  PSG can monitor various body functions including brain activity (electroencephalography), eye movement (electrooculography), muscle movement (electromyography), and heart rhythm (electrocardiography).\n\n[[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) is a procedure that records electrical activity along the scalp.  This procedure cannot record activity from individual neurons, but instead measures the overall average electrical activity in the brain.\n\n[[Electrooculography]] (EOG) measures the difference in electrical potential between the front and the back of the eye.  This does not measure a response to individual visual stimuli, but instead measures general eye movement.\n\n[[Electromyography]] (EMG) is used to records the electrical activity of skeletal muscles. A device called an [[electromyograph]] measures the electrical potential of muscle cells to monitor muscle movement.\n\n[[Electrocardiography]] (ECG or EKG) measures the electrical depolarization of the heart muscles using various electrodes placed near the chest and limbs.  This measure of depolarization can be used to monitor heart rhythm.\n\n=== Behavioural measures ===\n[[Actigraphy]] is a common and minimally invasive way to measure sleep architecture. Actigraphy has only one method of recording, movement.  This movement can be analyzed using different actigraphic programs.  As such, an actigraph can often be worn similarly to a watch, or around the waist as a belt. Because it is minimally invase and relatively inexpensive, this method allows for recordings outside of a lab setting and for many days at a time.  But, actigraphy often over estimates sleep time (de Souza 2003 and Kanady 2011).\n\n==Competing theories==\nMost studies point to the specific deficits in declarative memories that form pre or post REM sleep deprivation.  Conversely, deficits in non-declarative memory occur pre or post NREM sleep deprivation.  This is the stage specific enhancement theory.<ref name=\"therole\"/>  There is also a proposed dual-step memory hypothesis suggesting that optimal learning occurs when the memory trace is initially processed in SWS and then REM sleep.   Support for this is shown in many experiments where memory improvement is greater with either SWS or REM sleep compared to sleep deprivation, but memory is even more accurate when the sleep period contains both SWS and REM sleep.<ref name=\"therole\"/>\n\n== Declarative memory ==\n[[Declarative memory]] is the memory for conscious events.  There are two types of declarative memory: episodic and semantic.  Episodic memory is for remembering experiences whereas semantic memory is remembering specific facts.\n\n===Temporal memory===\nTemporal memory consists of remembering ''when'' a specific memory has occurred. In a study participants were placed in 4 groups; two control groups either given [[caffeine]] or a [[placebo]] and two groups that were [[sleep deprived]] for 36 hours either given caffeine or a placebo. The task used to measure temporal memory consisted of discriminating between recent and less recent face presentations. A set of twelve unfamiliar faces were presented sequentially every 10 seconds. A self-ordered pointing task was used afterwards for 5 minutes to prevent rehearsal and to keep tired participants occupied. This required them to mark any new items seen (either nouns or abstract shapes) presented on 12 sheets. A second set was presented, followed by another self-ordered pointing task, and then a random sequence of 48 faces either containing previously presented faces or new ones were shown to the participant. They were asked if they recognized the faces and whether they were from the first or second set. Results indicate that sleep deprivation does not significantly affect recognition of faces, but does produce a significant impairment of temporal memory (discriminating which face belonged to which set). Caffeine was found to have a greater effect on the sleep deprived group as compared to the placebo group deprived of sleep but still performed worse than both control groups. Sleep deprivation was also found to increase beliefs of being correct, especially if they were wrong. Brain imaging studies of those sleep deprived found that the greatest reduction in [[metabolic rate]] is in the [[prefrontal cortex]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/713755870 |pmid=10718074 |title=Sleep Loss and Temporal Memory |year=2000 |last1=Harrison |first1=Yvonne |last2=Horne |first2=James A. |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A |volume=53 |pages=271\u2013279 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n===Verbal learning===\nA blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] was used in a study by Drummond et al. to measure the brain's response to verbal learning following sleep deprivation. An fMRI recorded brain activity during a verbal learning task of participants either having a normal night of sleep or those deprived of 34.7 (\u00b1 1.2) hours of sleep. The task alternated between a baseline condition of determining whether nouns were upper or lower case and an experimental condition of memorizing a list of nouns. The results of the study indicate that performance is significantly worse on free recall of the list of nouns when sleep deprived (an average of 2.8 \u00b1 2 words) compared to having a normal night of sleep (4.7 \u00b1 4 words). In terms of brain regions activated, the left [[prefrontal cortex]], [[premotor cortex]], and [[temporal lobe]]s were found to be activated during the task in the rested state and discrete regions of the prefrontal cortex were even more activated during the task in the sleep deprived state. As well, the bilateral [[parietal lobes|parietal lobe]], left [[middle frontal gyrus]], and right interior frontal gyrus were found to be activated for those sleep deprived. The implication of these findings are that the brain can initially compensate for the effects of sleep deprivation while maintaining partially intact performance, which declines with an increasing time-on-task. This initial compensation may be found in the bilateral regions of both frontal and parietal lobes and the activation of the prefrontal cortex is significantly correlated with sleepiness.<ref name=\"pointing\" />\n\n===Cognitive performance===\nCerebral activation during performance on three cognitive tasks (verbal learning, arithmetic, and divided attention) were compared after both normal sleep and 35 hours of total sleep deprivation (TSD) in a study by Drummond and Brown. Use of fMRI measured these differences in the brain. In the verbal learning task, [[fMRI]] indicated the regions involved in both verbal learning and memorization. The results found that both TSD and a normal night of sleep showed a significant response in the prefrontal cortex and following TSD displayed a response of additional areas which included other prefrontal areas, bilateral [[inferior parietal lobule]] and [[superior parietal lobule|superior]] [[parietal lobes]]. Increases in sleepiness also correlated with activation of two [[ventral]] prefrontal regions and a [[correlation]] between a greater activation in bilateral [[parietal lobes]] (which include language areas) and lower levels of impairment on free recall were also found following TSD. In the arithmetic task normal sleep showed the expected activation in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal [[working memory]] regions but following TSD only showed activation in the left superior parietal lobe and the left [[premotor cortex]] in response, with no new areas to compensate (as was found in verbal learning). Increased sleepiness was also correlated with activation in a ventral prefrontal region, but only one region. The divided attention task combined both verbal learning and the arithmetic task. fMRI indicated that cerebral response after TSD is similar to that of the verbal learning task (specifically the right prefrontal cortex, bilateral parietal lobes, and [[cingulate gyrus]] showing the strongest response). The implication of this finding is that additional brain regions activated after both verbal learning and divided attention tasks following TSD represent a cerebral compensatory response to lacking sleep. For example, there is a decline in response of the left temporal lobes during both tasks which is involved in different learning tasks during a rested state but involvement of the left inferior parietal lobe in short-term verbal memory storage following TSD suggests that this region might compensate. No new areas for the arithmetic task may suggest that it relies heavily on working memory so compensation is not possible, in comparison to tasks such as verbal learning which rely less on working memory.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0893-133X(01)00325-6 |title=The Effects of Total Sleep Deprivation on Cerebral Responses to Cognitive Performance |year=2001 |last1=Drummond |first1=S |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=S68\u201373 |pmid=11682277 |last2=Brown |first2=GG}}</ref>\n\n===Slow wave sleep (SWS)===\n[[Slow wave sleep]] (SWS) has been often associated with successful performance in declarative memory recall tasks. For example, declarative and procedural memory recall tasks applied over early and late nocturnal sleep, as well as wakefulness controlled conditions, have been shown that declarative memory improves more during early sleep (dominated by SWS) while procedural memory during late sleep (dominated by REM sleep).<ref name=\":024\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rasch | first1 = B. | last2 = B\u00fcchel | first2 = C. | last3 = Gais | first3 = S. | last4 = Born | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = Odor cues during slow-wave sleep prompt declarative memory consolidation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 315 | issue = 5817| pages = 1426\u20139 | doi = 10.1126/science.1138581 | pmid = 17347444 }}</ref><ref name=\":134\">{{cite journal | last1 = Born | first1 = J. | last2 = Wilhelm | first2 = I. | year = 2012 | title = System consolidation of memory during sleep | journal = Psychological Research | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 192\u2013203 | doi = 10.1007/s00426-011-0335-6 | pmid = 21541757 | pmc = 3278619 }}</ref> Based on targeted memory reactivation (TMR) that use associated memory cues for triggering memory traces during sleep, recent studies have been reassuring the importance of nocturnal SWS for the formation of persistent memories in neocortical networks, as well as highlighting the possibility of increasing people's memory performance at declarative recalls.<ref name=\":024\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ngo | first1 = H. | last2 = Martinetz | first2 = T. | last3 = Born | first3 = J. | last4 = M\u00f6lle | first4 = M. | year = 2013 | title = Auditory Closed-Loop Stimulation of the Sleep Slow Oscillation Enhances Memory | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 78 | issue = 3| pages = 545\u2013553 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2013.03.006 | pmid = 23583623 }}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schreiner | first1 = T. | last2 = Rasch | first2 = B. | year = 2015 | title = Boosting Vocabulary Learning by Verbal Cueing During Sleep | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 25 | issue = 11| pages = 4169\u20134179 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/bhu139 | pmid = 24962994 }}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal | last1 = Schreiner | first1 =  | last2 = Rasch | first2 =  | year = 2017 | title = The beneficial role of memory reactivation for language learning during sleep: A review | url = | journal = Brain and Language | volume = 167 | issue = | pages = 94\u2013105 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandl.2016.02.005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Klinzing | first1 = J. | last2 = Kugler | first2 = S. | last3 = Soekadar | first3 = S. | last4 = Rasch | first4 = B. | last5 = Born | first5 = J. | last6 = Diekelmann | first6 = S. | year = 2018 | title = Odor cueing during slow-wave sleep benefits memory independently of low cholinergic tone | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 235 | issue = 1| pages = 291\u2013299 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-017-4768-5 | pmid = 29119218 | pmc = 5748395 }}</ref> Increased slow activity and sleep time spent in SWS have been also related to better performance in [[implicit learning]].<ref name=\"local sleep\">{{cite journal|last1=Huber|first1=Reto|last2=Felice Ghilardi|first2=M.|last3=Massimini|first3=Marcello|last4=Tononi|first4=Giulio|year=2004|title=Local sleep and learning|journal=Nature|volume=430|issue=6995|pages=78\u201381|bibcode=2004Natur.430...78H|doi=10.1038/nature02663|pmid=15184907}}</ref>\n\n====Macroscopic brain systems====\n\nThe most prominent population pattern in the hippocampus during nREM is called sharp wave ripples (SPW-R). SPW-Rs are the most synchronous neuronal patterns in the mammalian brain. As many as 15-30 percent of neuron in 50-200 ms fire synchronously in the CA3-CA2-CA1, subicular complex and entorhinal cortex during SWP-R (as opposed to ~1 percent during active waking and REM). Neurons within SPW-R are sequentially organized and many of the fast sequences are related to the order of neuronal firing during the pre-sleep experience of the animal. For example, when the rat explores a maze, place cell sequences in the different arms of the maze are replayed either in a forward (as during the experience itself) or reverse order but compressed in time several fold. SPW-R are temporally linked to both sleep spindles and slow oscillations of the neocortex. Interfering with SPW-Rs or its coupling with neocortical slow oscillations results in memory impairment, which can be as severe as surgically damaging the hippocampus and/or associated structures. SPW-R is therefore the most prominent physiological biomarker of episodic (i.e., hippocampus-dependent) memory consolidation (Buzsaki 2015).\n\n=====Neural forebrain reverberation correlation=====\nResearchers used rats in order to investigate the effects of novel tactile objects on the long-term evolution of the major rodent forebrain loops essential in species-specific behaviours, including such structures as the [[hippocampus]], [[putamen]], [[neocortex]]  and the [[thalamus]].<ref name= \"neuronal reverberation\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020024 |title=Long-Lasting Novelty-Induced Neuronal Reverberation during Slow-Wave Sleep in Multiple Forebrain Areas |year=2004 |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Sidarta |last2=Gervasoni |first2=Damien |last3=Soares |first3=Ernesto S. |last4=Zhou |first4=Yi |last5=Lin |first5=Shih-Chieh |last6=Pantoja |first6=Janaina |last7=Lavine |first7=Michael |last8=Nicolelis |first8=Miguel A.

At some point four novel tactile objects were placed in the four corners of the rat's cage.  They were all very different from one another and they were there for a total of one hour.  The brain activity during this hour was used as a baseline or template to compare.  Data analysis implied that the neural assemblies during SWS correlated significantly more with templates than during waking hours or REM sleep. As well, these post-learning, post-SWS reverberations lasted 48 hours, much longer than the duration of novel object learning (one hour), indicating [[long term potentiation]].<ref name=\"neuronal reverberation\"/>  Further analysis on a neuron to neuron base showed no subset of neurons (brain structure) to be responsible for the reverberations or anti-reverberations (patterns of activity significantly more dissimilar than novel stimulation templates).  Another difference noticed was the highest correlation peaks in SWS corresponded with the lowest rate of neuron firing in the forebrain, opposite that of REM sleep and waking where rate of firing is the highest.  It is hypothesized that this is due to interference from other incoming stimuli during waking periods.  In SWS there is no incoming stimuli so the novel experience can be replayed, without interruption.<ref name=\"neuronal reverberation\" />\n\n=====Neural hippocampal reverberation correlations=====\nA study by Peigneux ''et al.'', (2004) noted that the firing sequences in the hippocampal ensembles during spatial learning are also active during sleep, which shows that post training sleep has a role in processing spatial memories. This study was done to prove that the same hippocampal areas are activated in humans during route learning in a virtual town, and are reactivated during subsequent [[slow wave sleep]] (SWS).<ref name= \"spatial memories\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.007 |title=Are Spatial Memories Strengthened in the Human Hippocampus during Slow Wave Sleep? |year=2004 |last1=Peigneux |first1=Philippe |last2=Laureys |first2=Steven |last3=Fuchs |first3=Sonia |last4=Collette |first4=Fabienne |last5=Perrin |first5=Fabien |last6=Reggers |first6=Jean |last7=Phillips |first7=Christophe |last8=Degueldre |first8=Christian |last9=Del Fiore |first9=Guy |last10=Aerts |first10=Jo\u00ebl |last11=Luxen |first11=A |last12=Maquet |first12=P |journal=Neuron |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=535\u201345 |pmid=15504332|display-authors=8 }}</ref> In order to monitor this activation, experimenters used [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]] and [[fMRI]] to use cerebral blood flow as a marker of synaptic activity. The finding noted that the amount of hippocampal activation during slow-wave sleep positively correlated to the improvement on the virtual tour task the following day, which indicates that hippocampal activity during sleep correlates with the improvement in memory performance. These findings prove that learning-dependent modulation in hippocampal activity while sleeping shows processing of the previously learned episodic and spatial memory traces. This modulation of the hippocampus leads to plastic changes in the brain and ultimately an improvement in performance. The results of this study showed that spatial memory traces are processed in humans while they are in [[non-rapid eye movement sleep|NREM sleep]]. It showed a reaction of the hippocampal formation during SWS, after a declarative spatial memory task. Experimenters also found, that in humans, there is experience dependent modulations of activity during NREM sleep in the hippocampal regions, but not during REM sleep after learning. The evidence from this study was substantial to its hypothesis that the information learned while awake, is altered, and strengthened while humans are sleeping.<ref name=\"spatial memories\" />\n\nBased on the active system consolidation hypothesis, repeated reactivations of newly encoded information in hippocampus during slow oscillations in NREM sleep mediate the stabilization and gradually integration of declarative memory with pre-existing knowledge networks on the cortical level.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Diekelmann | first1 = Susanne | last2 = Born | first2 = Jan | year = 2010 | title = The memory function of sleep | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 114\u2013126 | doi = 10.1038/nrn2762 | pmid = 20046194 }}</ref> It assumes the hippocampus might hold information only temporarily and in fast-learning rate, whereas the neocortex is related to long-term storage and slow-learning rate.<ref name=\":024\" /><ref name=\":134\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rasch | first1 = B. | last2 = Born | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = About sleep's role in memory | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 2| pages = 681\u2013766 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00032.2012 | pmid = 23589831 | pmc = 3768102 }}</ref> This dialogue between hippocampus and neocortex occurs in parallel with hippocampal [[Sharp waves and ripples|sharp-wave ripples]] and [[Sleep spindle|thalamo-cortical spindles]], synchrony that drives the formation of spindle-ripple event which seems to be a prerequisite for the formation of long-term memories.<ref name=\":134\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Decreases in acetylcholine====\nIn this study, two groups of participants took part in a two night counterbalanced   study.  Two tasks were learned by all participants between 10:00-10:30pm.  The declarative task was a paired-associate word list of 40 German semantically related word pairs.  The non-declarative task was a mirror-tracing task.  At 11:00pm all participants were put on a two-hour infusion of either [[physostigmine]] or a [[placebo]].  Physostigmine is an [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]; it is a drug that inhibits the breakdown of the inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] [[Acetylcholine]], thereby allowing it to remain active longer in the [[chemical synapse|synapses]].  The sleep group was put to bed while the other group stayed awake.  Testing of both tasks took place at 2:45am, 30 minutes after the sleep group had been woken up; a sleep which had been rich in [[slow-wave sleep]] (SWS).  Results showed that the increased ACh negatively affected [[recall (memory)|recall memory]] (declarative task), in the sleep condition compared to participants given the placebo.<ref name=\"krista\" /> Specifically, recall after sleep for the placebo group showed an increase of 5.2 \u00b1 0.8 words compared to an increase of only 2.1 \u00b1 0.6 words when participants were given the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.  Conversely, neither speed nor accuracy declined in the non-declarative mirror task when participants were given physostigmine, and neither task performance was affected in the wake groups when physotigmine was administered.  This suggests that the purpose of ACh suppression during SWS allows for hippocampus \u2013dependent  declarative memory consolidation; high levels of ACh during SWS blocks memory replay on a hippocampal level.<ref name=\"krista\"/>\n*Note:  There was no correlation between the amount of SWS and level of recall.  Memory consolidation can be disrupted, however, if large parts on SWS are missing.\n\n====Increases in sleep spindles====\n[[File:Stage2sleep.svg|thumb|right|A typical EEG during stage 2 sleep]]\n[[Sleep spindles]] are short and intense bursts of neurons firing in sync, occurring in the thalamo-cortical networks. These peak late in the night and are defining characteristics of [[Sleep#Stages of sleep|stage two sleep]]. Sleep spindles are thought to aid in information consolidating during sleep and have been shown to increase after training on a motor task.<ref name=\"practice with\"/>\n\nA study, using 49 rats indicated the increase of sleep spindles during [[slow-wave sleep]] following learning. It gave evidence to the increase of spindle frequency during non-REM sleep following paired associate of motor-skill learning tasks. Using an [[electroencephalography|EEG]], sleep spindles were detected and showed to be present only during slow-wave sleep. Beginning with a preliminary study, rats underwent six hours of monitored sleep, after a period of learning. Results showed that during the first hour following learning, there was the most evident effect on learning-modulated sleep spindle density. However, this increase in spindle density was not dependent on the training condition. In other words, there was an increase in spindles regardless of how the rats were trained. EEG patterns showed a significant difference in the density of sleep spindles compared to the density of a control group of rats, who did not undergo any training before their sleep spindles were measured. This effect of increased spindle density only lasted for the first hour into sleep following training, and then disappeared within the second hour into sleep.\n\n=== Reward learning and memory ===\nIn a study by Fischer and Born, 2009,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0017256 |pmid=19857029 |title=Anticipated reward enhances offline learning during sleep |year=2009 |last1=Fischer |first1=Stefan |last2=Born |first2=Jan |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=1586\u20131593}}</ref> previous knowledge of monetary reward and post-training sleep are proven to be significant predictors of overall finger sequence tapping performance. Subjects were presented with two different finger sequence tasks that would have to be replicated at a later time. The subjects were told that there would be a reward offered for improvement upon a specific finger tapping sequence task. A [[control group]] was not given any knowledge of a reward. The subjects were separated further by allowing a sleep period between initial training and final testing for one group while another group faced a wake retention interval. It was concluded that the group that received both information about reward as well as being able to sleep displayed the highest increase in performance on both finger tapping sequences. Knowledge of reward without sleep and sleep without knowledge of reward were both significant contributors to improved performance. In all cases sleep was determined to have an advantageous effect on overall performance when compared to groups that underwent a twelve-hour wake retention period.\n\n== Non-declarative memory ==\n[[Non-declarative memory]] is memory gained from previous experiences that is unconsciously applied to everyday scenarios. Non-declarative memory is essential for the performance of learned skills and habits, for example, running or cooking a favourite meal. There are three types of non-declarative memories: [[implicit memory]] (unconscious memory, [[priming (psychology)|priming]]), instrumental memory ([[classical conditioning]]), and [[procedural memory]] (automatic skill memory).\n\n===Sleep deprivation===\n====ERK phosphorylation====\nExtracellular signal-related kinases, also known as classical [[Mitogen-activated protein kinase|MAP kinase]], are a group of protein kinases located in neurons.  These proteins are activated or deactivated by [[phosphorylation]] (adding of a phosphate group using ATP), in response to neurotransmitters and growth factors.<ref name=\"brain research\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2004.05.032 |title=Sleep deprivation impairs spatial memory and decreases extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in the hippocampus |year=2004 |last1=Guan |first1=Zhiwei |last2=Peng |first2=Xuwen |last3=Fang |first3=Jidong |journal=Brain Research |volume=1018 |pages=38\u201347 |pmid=15262203 |issue=1}}</ref>  This can result in subsequent protein to protein interactions and signal transductions (neurotransmitters or hormones transmit to cells), which ultimately controls all cellular processes including gene transcription and cell cycles (important in learning and memory).  A study tested four groups of rats in the Morris Water Maze, two groups in the spatial task (hidden platform) and two groups in the non-spatial task (visible platform.)  The effects of six hours of total [[sleep deprivation]] (TSD) were assessed for the experimental group (one spatial group, one non-spatial group) in both tasks. Six hours after the TSD period (or sleep period for controls), the groups of rats were trained on either task then tested 24 hours later.  In addition, the levels of  total ERK phosphorylation (ERK 1 and ERK 2), protein phosphate 1 (PP1), and MAPK phosphatase 2 (latter two both involved in dephosphorylation) were assessed by decapitating four other groups of mice, (two sleep deprived and two non-sleep deprived), and removing their hippocampuses after the six hours of TSD, or two hours after TSD (eight hours total).  Results showed that TSD did not impair learning of the spatial task, but it did impair memory.  With regards to the non-spatial task, learning again was no different in the TSD; however, memory in the TSD group was actually slightly better, although not quite significantly.  Analysis of the hippocampus showed that TSD significantly decreased the levels of total ERK phosphorylation by about 30%. TSD did not affect proteins in the cortex which indicates that the decreases in ERK levels were due to impaired signal transduction in the hippocampus.  In addition, neither PP1 or MAPK phosphatase 2 levels were increased suggesting that the decreases in ERK were not due to dephosphorylation but instead a result of TSD.  Therefore, it is proposed that TSD has aversive effects on the cellular processes (ERK: gene transcription etc.), underlying sleep-dependent memory plasticity.<ref name=\"brain research\" />\n\n=== REM sleep ===\n[[REM sleep]] is known for its vivid creations and similarity to the bioelectric outputs of a waking person. This stage of sleep is characterized by muscle atonia, fast but low voltage [[EEG]] and, as the name suggests, rapid eye movement. It is difficult to attribute memory gains to a single stage of sleep when it may be the entire [[sleep cycle]] that is responsible for [[memory consolidation]]. Recent research conducted by Datta et al.<ref name=Datta2000>{{cite journal |first1=Subimal |last1=Datta |title=Avoidance Task Training Potentiates Phasic Pontine-Wave Density in the Rat: A Mechanism for Sleep-Dependent Plasticity |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=11069969 |pmc=6773158 |year=2000 |volume=20 |issue=22 |pages=8607\u201313|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.20-22-08607.2000 }}</ref> used an avoidance task followed by a post-training REM sleep period to examine changes in [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P waves]] affecting reprocessing of recently acquired stimuli. It was found that not only were the P waves increased during post-training sleep but also the density of the waves. These findings may imply that P waves during REM sleep may help to activate critical forebrain and cortical structures dealing with memory consolidation. In a Hennevin et al. study, 1989,<ref name=\"Hennevin1\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0163-1047(89)90948-5 |title=Improvement of learning by mesencephalic reticular stimulation during postlearning paradoxical sleep |year=1989 |last1=Hennevin |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Hars |first2=Bernard |last3=Bloch |first3=Vincent |journal=Behavioral and Neural Biology |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=291\u2013306 |pmid=2730495}}</ref> the mesencephalic [[reticular formation]] (MRF) was given light [[electrical stimulation]], during REM sleep, which is known to have an advantageous effect for learning when applied after training. The rats in the experiment were trained to run a maze in search of a food reward. One group of rats was given non-awakening MRF electrical stimulations after each of their maze trials compared to a [[control group]] which did not receive any electrical stimulation. It was noticed that the stimulated rats performed significantly better in respect to error reduction. These findings imply that dynamic memory processes occur both during training as well as during post-training sleep. Another study by Hennevin et al. (1998)<ref name=\"Hennevin2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0735-7044.112.4.839|title= Neuronal plasticity induced by fear conditioning is expressed during paradoxical sleep: Evidence from simultaneous recordings in the lateral amygdala and the medial geniculate in rats |year=1998 |last1=Hennevin |first1=Elizabeth |last2= Maho|first2= Catherine|last3= Hars|first3= Bernard|journal= Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=112 |issue=4|pages=839\u2013862|pmid=}}</ref> conditioned rats to fear a noise that is associated with a subsequent foot shock. The interesting part of the experiment is that fear responding to the noise (measured in the [[amygdala]]) was observed when the noise was presented during REM sleep. This was compared to a group of pseudo-conditioned rats who did not display the same amygdalar activation during post-training sleep. This would suggest that neural responding to previously salient stimuli is maintained even during REM sleep. There is no shortage of research conducted on the effects that REM sleep has on the working brain but consistency in the findings is what plagues recent research. There is no guarantee as to what functions REM sleep may perform for our bodies and brains but modern research is always expanding and assimilating new ideas to further our understanding of such processes.\n\n====PGO waves====\nIn animals, the appearance of ponto-geniculo-occipital waves ([[PGO waves]]) is related to that of the bioelectric outputs of rapid eye movements.<ref name=\"Dang\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13638490500138702 |pmid=16449068 |title=A role for sleep in brain plasticity |year=2006 |last1=Dang-Vu |first1=T.

Although these phasic waves are observed in many portions of the animal brain, they are most noticeable in the pons, lateral geniculate bodies, and the occipital cortex. Peigneux et al., 2006,<ref name=\"Dang\"/> reported that the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] and [[occipital cortex]] display higher levels of activity during REM sleep than during wakefulness. This would add to the theory that activation in these areas is similar to PGO wave activation in animals. Pontine waves are commonly seen in animals as a mechanism to help facilitate learning and [[memory consolidation]].  An improvement on task performance was seen to be a result of increased P waves between REM sleep sessions.<ref name=Datta2000/><ref name=\"Datta et al 2004\">{{cite journal |first1=Subimal |last1=Datta |first2=Vijayakumar |last2=Mavanji |first3=Jagadish |last3=Ulloor |first4=Elissa H. |last4=Patterson |title=Activation of Phasic Pontine-Wave Generator Prevents Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Deprivation-Induced Learning Impairment in the Rat: A Mechanism for Sleep-Dependent Plasticity |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=14960614 |pmc=6730333 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4111-03.2004 |year=2004 |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=1416\u201327}}</ref> In a study using post learning REM sleep deprivation the effects of stimulating the [[P wave (electrocardiography)|P wave]] generator (located in the [[pontine tegmentum]]) of a rat were observed. Two groups of rats underwent an avoidance learning task and then allowed a sleep period while another group of rats were deprived sleep. When comparing the two groups the sleep deprived rats showed a significant deficit in learning from having not undergone REM sleep. In another rat group, the P wave generator was stimulated using a [[carbachol]] injection and the rats then underwent a sleep deprivation stage. When these rats were again tested on their learning it was shown that activation of the P wave generator during sleep deprivation resulted in normal learning being achieved. This would point to the fact that the activation of P waves, even without REM sleep, was enough to enhance the memory processes that would not normally have happened.\n\n====Implicit face memory====\nFaces are an important part of one's social life.  To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the [[fusiform gyrus]] (occipito-temporal brain area) and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of [[implicit memory]].<ref name=\"signsof\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0301-0511(02)00125-4 |title=Signs of REM sleep dependent enhancement of implicit face memory: A repetition priming study |year=2003 |last1=Wagner |first1=Ullrich |last2=Hallschmid |first2=Manfred |last3=Verleger |first3=Rolf |last4=Born |first4=Jan |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=197\u2013210 |pmid=12633978|citeseerx=10.1.1.607.6441 }}</ref> REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit [[visuospatial]] memory processes, rather than [[slow-wave sleep]] which is crucial for explicit [[memory consolidation]]. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance.<ref name=\"signsof\"/>  A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces.<ref name=\"signsof\"/>\n\n====Macroscopic brain systems====\nPrevious research has shown REM sleep to reactivate cortical neural assemblies post-training on a [[serial reaction time]] task (SRT), in other words REM sleep replays the processing that occurred while one learnt an implicit task in the previous waking hours.<ref name=\"Learned Material\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0304-3940(88)90787-2 |title=Nerve growth factor promotes survival of cultured magnocellular cholinergic neurons from nucleus basalis of Meynert in postnatal rats |year=1988 |last1=Hatanaka |first1=Hiroshi |last2=Nihonmatsu |first2=Itsuko |last3=Tsukui |first3=Hiroko |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=90 |pages=63\u20138 |pmid=2842704 |issue=1\u20132}}</ref> However, control subjects did not complete a SRT task, thus researchers could not assume the reactivation of certain networks to be a result of the implicitly learned sequence/grammar as it could simply be due to elementary visuomotor processing which was obtained in both groups.  To answer this question the experiment was redone and another group was added who also took part in the SRT task.  They experienced no sequence to the SRT task (random group),  whereas the experimental group did experience a sequence (probabilistic group), although without conscious awareness.  Results of  PET scans indicate that bilateral cuneus were significantly more activated during SRT practice as well as post-training REM sleep in the Probabilistic group than the Random group.<ref name=\"Learned Material\" />  In addition, this activation was significantly increased during REM sleep versus the SRT task.  This suggests that specific brain regions are specifically engaged in the post-processing of sequential information.  This is further supported by the fact that regional CBF (rCBF) during post-training REM sleep are modulated by the level of high-order, but not low-order learning obtained prior to sleep.  Therefore, brain regions that take part in a learning process are modulated by both the sequential structure of the learned material (increased activation in cuneus), and the amount of high-order learning (rCBF).<ref name=\"Learned Material\" />\n\n====REM sleep deprivation and neurotrophic factors====\nThe effects of REM sleep deprivation (RSD) on neurotrophic  factors, specifically [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) and [[brain-derived neurotrophic factor]] (BDNF), were assessed in 2000 by Sie et el.  [[Neurotrophin]]s are proteins found in the brain and periphery that aid in the survival, functioning and generation of [[neurons]]; this is an important element in the [[synaptic plasticity]] process, the underlying neurochemical foundation in forming memories.<ref name=\"Differential Effects\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-8993(00)02708-6 |title=Differential effect of short-term REM sleep deprivation on NGF and BDNF protein levels in the rat brain |year=2000 |last1=Sei |first1=Hiroyoshi |last2=Saitoh |first2=Daisuke |last3=Yamamoto |first3=Kei |last4=Morita |first4=Kyoji |last5=Morita |first5=Yusuke |journal=Brain Research |volume=877 |issue=2 |pages=387\u201390 |pmid=10986357}}</ref> Sei et al., inserted [[electrode]]s into the skulls of seven pairs of rats to measure [[electroencephalography|Electroencephalogram]] (EEG), and inserted wire into the neck muscles of the rats to measure [[Electromyogram]] (EMG), a technique used to measure the amount of muscle activity.   Half the rats experienced a six-hour REM sleep deprivation period, while the other half experienced a six-hour sleep period, containing all sleep cycles.  Results showed that in the rats in the REM sleep deprivation group showed decreased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the [[cerebellum]] (coordination, motor learning) and [[brainstem]] (sensory and motor ascending pathway), conversely the [[hippocampus]] (long-term memory, spatial navigation), showed decreases in nerve growth factor levels.  BDNF protein has been shown to be necessary for [[procedural memory|procedural learning]] (form of non-declarative memory).  Since procedural learning has also exhibited consolidation and enhancement under REM sleep, it is proposed that the impairment of procedural learning tasks is due to the lack of BDNF proteins in the cerebellum and brainstem during RSD.<ref name=\"Differential Effects\" />  In regards to NGF, the [[basal forebrain]] (production and distribution of AcH in the brain), more specifically the medial septal area, sends [[cholinergic]] (excitatory in hippocampus) and GABAinergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters through fibres to the hippocampus target cells.  These target cells then secrete NGF which plays a key role in the physiological state of the hippocampus and its functions.  It has been noted that REM sleep increases the secretion of NGF, therefore it has been proposed that during RSD cholinergic activity decreases leading to a decrease in NGF and impairment in procedural learning.<ref name=\"Differential Effects\" />\n[[File:Vertebrate-brain-regions.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=A mid-sagittal view of the brain. The hippocampus is represented by the light blue arc.|Vertebrate brain regions]]\n\n=== Macroscopic brain system reorganization ===\nWalker and Stickgold hypothesized that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level.<ref name=\"walker\"/> Their experiment consisted of two groups; the night-sleep group was taught a motor sequence block tapping task at night, put to sleep and then retested 12 hours later. The day-wake group was taught the same task in the morning and tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI was used to measure brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep group compared to the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum ([[olfactory tubercle]], [[nucleus accumbens]]), as well as regions of the [[cerebellum]] (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed \"decreased\" signal activation bilaterally in the [[parietal lobe|parietal cortices]] (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex.<ref name=\"walker\"/> Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate brain plasticity. The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would have to sleep in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity.<ref name=\"walker\"/>\n\n=== Working memory ===\nConsidered to be a mental workspace enabling temporary storage and retrieval of information, [[working memory]] is crucial to problem-solving and analysis of different situations. Working memory capacity is a measure of the number of mental processing functions one is able to perform consecutively. Increases in one's working memory capacity can be accomplished with a strategy known as [[chunking (psychology)|chunking]]. Aritake et al.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2039-08.2008 |title=Sleep Accelerates the Improvement in Working Memory Performance |year=2008 |last1=Kuriyama |first1=K. |last2=Mishima |first2=K. |last3=Suzuki |first3=H. |last4=Aritake |first4=S. |last5=Uchiyama |first5=M. |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=40 |pages=10145\u201350 |pmid=18829972|pmc=6671268 }}</ref> conducted a finger sequence tapping experiment in which the subjects were shown coloured dots in sequence on a monitor corresponding to buttons on their keyboard. When a colour was shown the subject had to react by pressing the right colour on the keyboard. The subjects were separated into three groups. Group one continually trained with no periods of sleep. Group two was trained and retested over ten hours of wakefulness followed by eight hours of sleep and final testing. The third group was trained at ten pm, followed by an eight-hour sleep. This group was then tested the following morning and again later in the same day. Results displayed that wakefulness was an insignificant predictor of performance improvement, unless followed by a period of sleep. Groups that were allowed a post training sleep period, regardless of its time in reference to training, was beneficial to the improvement on the finger tapping sequences. The initial working memory capacity of the groups averaged three to four units. In groups two and three the working memory capacity was increased to an average of 5\u20136 units. It was proposed that sleep-dependent improvements may contribute to overall improvement in working memory capacity leading to improved [[fluid intelligence]].\n\n==== Sleep deprivation ====\n[[Sleep deprivation]], whether it is total sleep deprivation or partial sleep deprivation, can impair [[working memory]] in measures of memory, speed of [[cognition|cognitive processing]], attention and task switching. Casement et al. found that when subjects were asked to recognize digits displayed on a screen by typing them on a keypad, the working memory speed of subjects whose sleep was restricted to four hours a night (approximately 50% of their normal sleep amount) were 58% slower than control groups who were allowed their full eight hours of sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2005.11.002 |title=The contribution of sleep to improvements in working memory scanning speed: A study of prolonged sleep restriction |year=2006 |last1=Casement |first1=Melynda D. |last2=Broussard |first2=Josiane L. |last3=Mullington |first3=Janet M. |last4=Press |first4=Daniel Z. |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=72 |issue=2 |pages=208\u201312 |pmid=16384630 |pmc=4120641}}</ref>\n\n==Synaptic plasticity==\nThe brain is an ever-changing, plastic, model of information sharing and processing. In order for the brain to incorporate new experiences into a refined [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] it has to undergo specific modifications to consolidate and assimilate all new information.<ref name=\"Dang\"/> [[Synaptic plasticity]] can be described as the changing in strength between two related neurons. Neuroplasticity is most clearly seen in the instances of REM sleep deprivation during brain maturation. Regional brain measurements in neo-natal REM sleep deprived rats displayed a significant size reduction in areas such as the [[cerebral cortex]] and the [[brain stem]]. The rats were deprived during critical periods after birth and thus anatomical size reduction is observed.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0165-3806(83)90184-0 |title=Effects of experimental suppression of active (REM) sleep during early development upon adult brain and behavior in the rat |year=1983 |last1=Mirmiran |first1=M. |last2=Scholtens |first2=J. |last3=Van De Poll |first3=N.E. |last4=Uylings |first4=H.B.M. |last5=Van Der Gugten |first5=J. |last6=Boer |first6=G.J. |journal=Developmental Brain Research |volume=7 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=277\u201386 |pmid=6850353}}</ref> Using a pursuit task (used to test visuomotor capabilities) in combination with an [[fMRI]], Maquet et al., 2003,<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Pierre |last1=Maquet |first2=Sophie |last2=Schwartz |first3=Richard |last3=Passingham |first4=Christopher |last4=Frith |title=Sleep-Related Consolidation of a Visuomotor Skill: Brain Mechanisms as Assessed by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=12598632 |pmc=6742239 |year=2003 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=1432\u201340|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.23-04-01432.2003 }}</ref> found that increases in activation were seen in the supplementary eye field and right [[dentate nucleus]] of subjects who were allowed to sleep as compared to sleep deprived individuals. The right [[superior temporal sulcus]] was also noticed to have higher activation levels. When functional connectivity was analyzed it was found that the dentate nucleus was more closely involved with the functions of the superior temporal sulcus. The results suggest that performance on the pursuit task relies on the subject's ability to comprehend appropriate movement patterns in order for recreation of the optimal movements. Sleep deprivation was found to interrupt the slow processes that lead to learning of this procedural skill and alter connectivity changes that would have normally been seen after a night of rest. [[Neuroplasticity]] has been thoroughly researched over the past few decades and results have shown that significant changes that occur in our cortical processing areas have the power to modulate neuronal firing to both new and previously experienced stimuli.\n\n===Neurotransmitter regulation===\nThe changes in quantity of a certain neurotransmitter as well as how the post-synaptic terminal responds to this change are underlying mechanisms of brain plasticity.<ref name=\"Dang\"/> During sleep there are remarkable changes in modulatory neurotransmitters throughout the brain.[[Acetylcholine]] is an [[excitatory neurotransmitter]] that is seen to increase to near waking levels during REM sleep while compared to lower levels during slow-wave sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=1309574 |pmc = 6575696|title=Cellular mechanisms underlying cholinergic and noradrenergic modulation of neuronal firing mode in the cat and guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus |date=1992-01-01 |first1=DA |last1=McCormick |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=278\u201389|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.12-01-00278.1992 }}</ref> Evidence has shown that functioning of the hippocampus dependent memory system ([[episodic memory]] and [[autobiographical memory]]) is directly affected by cholinergic changes throughout the wake-sleep cycle. High levels of ACh would promote information attained during wakefulness to be stored in the hippocampus. This is accomplished by suppressing previous excitatory connections while facilitating encoding without interference from previously stored information. During [[NREM]] sleep, and especially [[slow-wave sleep]], low levels of Ach would cause the release of this suppression and allow for spontaneous recovery of hippocampal neurons resulting in the facilitation of [[memory consolidation]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(99)01365-0 |title=Neuromodulation: Acetylcholine and memory consolidation |year=1999 |last1=Hasselmo |first1=Michael E. |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=351\u2013359 |pmid=10461198}}</ref>\n\n=== Gene expression ===\nRecently, approximately one hundred genes whose brain expression is increased during periods of sleep have been found.<ref name=\"cirelli\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00814-6 |title=Extensive and Divergent Effects of Sleep and Wakefulness on Brain Gene Expression |year=2004 |last1=Cirelli |first1=Chiara |last2=Gutierrez |first2=Christina M. |last3=Tononi |first3=Giulio |journal=Neuron |volume=41 |pages=35\u201343 |pmid=14715133 |issue=1}}</ref> A similar number of genes were found to promote gene expression during wakefulness. These sets of genes are related to different functional groups which may promote different cellular processes.

There was a sleep related increase in processes that involve the synthesis and maintenance of the synapse. Such processes include [[membrane trafficking]], [[synaptic vesicle]] recycling, myelin structural protein formation, and [[cholesterol]] and [[protein synthesis]]. In a different study it was found that there was a sleep related increase in [[calmodulin]]-dependent [[protein kinase]] IV that has been specifically involved in synaptic depression and in the consolidation of [[long-term memory]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80808-9 |title=A Late Phase of Cerebellar Long-Term Depression Requires Activation of CaMKIV and CREB |year=1999 |last1=Ahn |first1=Sohyun |last2=Ginty |first2=David D. |last3=Linden |first3=David J. |journal=Neuron |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=559\u201368 |pmid=10433267}}</ref> These findings encourage an association between sleep and different aspects of neural plasticity.<ref name=\"cirelli\"/>\n\n== Alternative sleep schedules ==\n===Motor skills learning===\nThe impact of daytime [[nap]]s was looked at by Walker and Stickgold (2005).<ref name=\"It's practice\"/>  The experimental group was given a 60-90 minute afternoon nap (one full cycle), after a [[motor skill]]s task learned that morning, while the control group received no nap.

However, it seemed to all even out after that same nights sleep; the no-nap group improved 24% and the nap group improved only 7% more for a total of 23%, virtually identical.

The individuals that were allowed a 30-60 minute nap seemed to gain stabilization of the skill as no deterioration occurred.  If allowed a 60-90 minute nap ([[REM sleep]] and [[slow-wave sleep]]), individuals displayed enhancement.

Over the years he has lived and worked in Europe, the Americas (the United States and Latin America), and Asia (Japan, China, and Taiwan).  His professional trajectory has combined serving as a policy practitioner at the national, regional, and global levels, and as a scholar and professor in academia.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in Les Herbiers, Vend\u00e9e, Jean-Marc Coicaud studied philosophy, literature, law/political science and linguistics. He attended [[University of Nantes]] and then moved to Paris where he studied at [https://www.univ-paris1.fr/ Universit\u00e9 Paris 1 Panth\u00e9on-Sorbonne], [http://www.sciencespo.fr/en Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris] (Sciences Po), and Universit\u00e9 Paris VII. Later on he studied in the United States at Harvard University. He earned a doctorate in Political Science/Law at the Sorbonne and a Doctorat d'Etat in Legal and Political Theory from Sciences Po.\n\nFollowing his first doctorate, Coicaud worked for the Scientific and Cultural Services of the French Consulate in Houston, Texas. He then returned to France and worked as a legislative assistant for a Parliament Member of the European Parliament. At the same time he taught constitutional law to first-year students at the Sorbonne.  With the support of an [http://worldwide.harvard.edu/links/arthur-sachs-scholarship-fund-france Arthur Sachs Fellowship] and a Ministry of Foreign Affairs Fellowship, he spent six years at Harvard University working on his doctorat d'Etat. At Harvard, Coicaud was affiliated with the Center for European Studies, the Center for International Affairs, the Department of Philosophy, and the Law School. This led to his second doctorat d'Etat, granted by Sciences Po, on the issue of political legitimacy and responsibility, eventually published in a variety of languages.\n\nFollowing the end of his studies Coicaud received a position with the Executive Office of the United Nations Secretary-General, Dr. [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali|Boutros-Ghali]], as a member of his speech-writing team, at the United Nations Headquarters, in New York.

In 1737, he spoke in favour of an increase in the [[Prince of Wales]]\u2019s allowance.<ref name=HOP/>\n\nUpon his death at [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] in 1737 Lawson gave the vicar of Isel church the tithes of [[Blindcrake]], Sunderland, Isel Old-Park and Isel Gate in lieu of the tithes of Isel demesne.<ref>Lysons and Lysons (1816), p. 121</ref>\n\nHe had married Elizabeth Lucy Mordaunt, daughter of the Hon. [[Harry Mordaunt]] MP and niece of the [[Earl of Peterborough]], with whom he had two sons and two daughters. He was succeeded in turn by his elder son, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 4th Baronet (1731\u201339) and his younger son Sir Mordaunt Lawson, 5th Baronet (1735\u201343) both of whom died in childhood, thus ending the supremacy of the [[Isel, Cumbria|Isel]] Lawsons.\n\nThe eldest daughter Elizabeth, who died in 1759, also deserves an historical footnote. She became a [[Maid of Honour]] to the [[Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha|Princess of Wales]] and although courted by General [[James Wolfe]], hero of [[Quebec]], she refused his hand of marriage.<ref name=\"Furguson p.466-7 1871\"/> As told by Joseph Pennell, writing in ''Highways and Byways in the Lake District''.
