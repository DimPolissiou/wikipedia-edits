By contrast, bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Alexander|journal=|volume=|pages=43\u201344|doi=10.1007/1-4020-4494-1_31|title=Environmental Geology|series=Encyclopedia of Earth Science|year=1999|isbn=978-0-412-74050-3|chapter=Bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, biomagnification}}</ref>\n\n== Examples ==\n\nAn example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase \"[[mad as a hatter]]\" (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which forms organic species such as [[methylmercury]], which is lipid-soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [[mercury poisoning]]. Other lipid-[[soluble]] (fat-soluble) poisons include [[tetraethyllead]] compounds (the [[lead]] in leaded [[petrol]]), and [[DDT]]. These compounds are stored in the body's [[fat]], and when the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.\n\n[[Strontium-90]], part of the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[atomic bomb]]s, is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in [[osteogenesis]], where its radiation can cause damage for a long time.\n\nNaturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate. The marine [[algal bloom]]s known as \"[[red tide]]s\" can result in local filter-feeding organisms such as [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s becoming toxic; coral reef fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as [[ciguatera]] when they accumulate a toxin called [[ciguatoxin]] from reef algae.     \n\nSome animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense; by consuming toxic plants or animal prey, a species may accumulate the toxin, which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator. One example is the [[Manduca sexta|tobacco hornworm]], which concentrates [[nicotine]] to a toxic level in its body as it consumes [[tobacco]] plants.\nPoisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on.\nOther compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms.
