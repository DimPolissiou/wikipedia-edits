In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

Lalo attaches the bell to Hector's wheelchair, enabling him to communicate more effectively with his right index finger, the only body part Hector can move after he emerges from his coma.

Mike stops at a money wire store and reviews security footage showing Werner looking at travel brochures, as Lalo watches from outside. Mike guesses Werner is going to a nearby spa to meet his wife and asks Gus to allow him to persuade Werner to return rather than killing him. After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters the store and attempts to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred Whalen, refuses to tell him. Lalo kills Fred and reviews the footage himself, burns the store as he leaves, then begins calling travel resorts to track down Werner. Pretending to work for Gus, Lalo obtains some details about the construction of the meth lab before Mike arrives at Werner's location and ends the call. Realizing that Lalo is partially aware of Werner's activities, Gus tells Mike Werner will have to be killed and offers to send men to do it.

When buyers complain, Lalo discovers the meth and demands a meeting with Gus. Gus claims Werner was constructing a chilling system under Mike's supervision at the Los Pollos Hermanos farm, stole cocaine, fled, and was killed, after which Gus attempted to cover up the loss by replacing the missing cocaine with local, inferior meth. The cover story explains events of which Lalo was aware, and he accepts Gus's explanation and apology, but remains suspicious. Juan privately warns Lalo that [[Don Eladio Vuente]] and the cartel trust Gus, or at least consider him a valuable earner, so Lalo should consider the matter closed. Lalo later receives confirmation from Hector that Gus enjoys cartel protection as long as he remains a top earner. Because of Lalo's suspicions, Gus shuts down work on his underground meth lab and Mike sends Werner's men home, paid in full for the half-completed job and warned to remain silent.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Magic Man |episode-link=Magic Man (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=February 23, 2020 |season=5 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nGus demands that Nacho find a way to gain Lalo's trust and start passing inside information about the Salamancas.

Jimmy tells [[Kim Wexler]] he does not plan to fight for Lalo's release. From jail, Lalo tells Nacho to continue harassing Gus by burning down one of his restaurants, which Nacho reports to Mike. Gus and the heads of other Madrigal subsidiaries provide reports to CEO Peter Schuler and [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]]. Gus later meets privately with Peter and Lydia to update them on the status of the meth lab, and warns them that Lalo remains a threat. Afterwards, Gus and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as Gus's Salamanca organization mole by vandalizing the interior of Gus's flagship restaurant, then setting an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike provides Jimmy details of his investigative work on Lalo, which he performed under an assumed name.

Jimmy agrees to go, but asks for $100,000 as his fee, and Lalo agrees. An informant who observed The Cousins pick up the cash makes a telephone call to report it. After Jimmy receives the cash and begins his return trip, he is cut off by gunmen who take the money and prepare to kill him. Mike was tracking Jimmy and kills all but one of the gunmen, after which Jimmy and Mike walk cross-country with the cash to avoid the surviving gunman. When Jimmy fails to return home, Kim pretends to be Lalo's lawyer and visits him in jail to ask for his location so she can start to search.

Mike and Jimmy agree on a cover story for Jimmy to tell Lalo. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and he is released. Jimmy tells Lalo he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked cross-country in order to avoid risking the money. Lalo says he intends to return to Mexico to avoid the scrutiny of suspicious police and prosecutors. Lalo says goodbye to Hector and has Nacho drive him to the same pickup site where Jimmy received the bail money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he decides to search for Jimmy's car. After finding it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on him from a nearby rooftop, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his experience in the desert, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car.

After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters the store and attempts to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred Whalen, refuses to tell him. Lalo kills Fred and reviews the footage himself, burns the store as he leaves, then begins calling travel resorts to track down Werner. Pretending to work for Gus, Lalo obtains some details about the construction of the meth lab before Mike arrives at Werner's location and ends the call.

The cover story explains events of which Lalo was aware, and he accepts Gus's explanation and apology, but remains suspicious. Juan privately warns Lalo that [[Don Eladio Vuente]] and the cartel trust Gus, or at least consider him a valuable earner, so Lalo should consider the matter closed. Lalo later receives confirmation from Hector that Gus enjoys cartel protection as long as he remains a top earner. Because of Lalo's suspicions, Gus shuts down work on his underground meth lab and Mike sends Werner's men home, paid in full for the half-completed job and warned to remain silent.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Magic Man |episode-link=Magic Man (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=February 23, 2020 |season=5 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nGus demands that Nacho find a way to gain Lalo's trust and start passing inside information about the Salamancas.

Gus later meets privately with Peter and Lydia to update them on the status of the meth lab, and warns them that Lalo remains a threat. Afterwards, Gus and Nacho preserve Nacho's role as Gus's Salamanca organization mole by vandalizing the interior of Gus's flagship restaurant, then setting an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike provides Saul details of his investigative work on Lalo, which he performed under an assumed name.

After Saul receives the cash and begins his return trip, he is cut off by gunmen who take the money and prepare to kill him. Mike was tracking Saul and kills all but one of the gunmen, after which Saul and Mike walk cross-country with the cash to avoid the surviving gunman.

He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at the [[University of Cambridge]], and became president of the [[Footlights]], touring internationally with its revue in 1964.

He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and was a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for almost 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England.

First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand-up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]].

After ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the television [[animated]] comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/bananaman/cast_crew/|title=Bananaman cast and crew credits|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|website=British Comedy Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tim_Brooke-Taylor|title=Tim Brooke-Taylor \u2013 UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]].

First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand-up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be the Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971 he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the television [[animated]] comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/bananaman/cast_crew/|title=Bananaman cast and crew credits|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|website=British Comedy Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tim_Brooke-Taylor|title=Tim Brooke-Taylor \u2013 UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\".<ref name=BBCDeath/> Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ldEQYB39GSsC|title=The Fully Authorised History of I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue: The Clue Bible from Footlights to Mornington Crescent|first=Jem|last=Roberts|date=2 September 2010|publisher=Random House|via=Google Books}}</ref> On 18 February 1981, Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nIn 1998 Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode of the political satire game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143043/fullcredits|title=If I Ruled the World (TV Series 1998\u2013 ) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]]. [[Paul McGann]] played the [[Eighth Doctor]], and Brooke-Taylor played the part of Mims, a [[Zygon]] taking the shape of a human.\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they had two sons, Ben and Edward.<ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}</ref><ref>''Who's Who on Television'' \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}</ref> He lived in [[Berkshire]].<ref>Old Wykehamist Record.</ref>  He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.<ref name=LG59808>{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 Today \u2013 Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|2020 coronavirus pandemic]], Brooke-Taylor died of complications from [[coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on 12 April 2020, aged 79.<ref name=BBCDeath>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dies with coronavirus, aged 79 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52262490 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews ===\nBrooke-Taylor was elected Lord [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|Rector]] by the students of the [[University of St Andrews]] and held office between 1979 and 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourunion.net/voice/rectorelection/previousrectors/|title=Previous Rectors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yourunion.net|publisher=University of St Andrews Students' Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>  In this role he represented the students, chaired the University Court and presided over the [[General Council of the University of St Andrews|General Council]] in the absence of the [[Chancellor of the University of St Andrews|Chancellor]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourunion.net/voice/rectorelection/history/|title=History of the Rector|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yourunion.net|publisher=University of St Andrews Students' Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/key-officials/rector/|title=Rector|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\u00a0 At his installation he arrived by helicopter, rode a motorbike and was hauled in an open carriage as part of The Drag.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://standrewsrarebooks.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/cricketer-comedians-and-campaigners-rectors-1967-93/|title=Cricketer, Comedians, and Campaigners: Rectors, 1967-1993|last=St Andrews Special Collections|date=2018-04-13|website=Echoes from the Vault|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> His installation speech included a mother-in-law joke in Latin and a suggestion his successor should be a woman;

The test is intended to evaluate the mental calibre of a candidate. In broad terms, this is really an assessment of not only a candidate's intellectual qualities, but also social traits and interest in current affairs. Some of the qualities to be judged are mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgement, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, and intellectual and moral integrity.\n\nThe technique of the interview is not that of a strict cross-examination, but of a natural, though directed and purposeful conversation that is intended to reveal the mental qualities of the candidate.\n\nThe interview is not intended to test either of the specialized or general knowledge of the candidate, which has been already tested through written papers. Candidates are expected to have taken an intelligent interest not only in their special subjects of academic study, but also in the events which are happening around them both within and outside their own state or country as well as in modern currents of thought and in new discoveries which should rouse the curiosity of all well-educated youth. The interview standards are very high and require thorough preparation as well as commitment.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.upsc.gov.in Union Public Service Commission official website]\n*[https://upsc.gov.in/examinations/Civil%20Services%20%28Preliminary%29%20Examination%2C%202019 Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination 2019 official website]\n*[https://upsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/Final_Notice_CSPE_2019_N.pdf Civil Services Examination 2019 official notification]\n\n{{Standardized tests in India}}\n\n[[Category:Standardised tests in India]]\n[[Category:Union Public Service Commission]]\n[[Category:Civil service tests in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{Use Indian English|date = February 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox examination\n| name                = Civil Services Examination\n| image_name          =  \n| image_alt           =\n| caption             =\n| acronym             ={{plainlist|\n*UPSC CSE\n*UPSC CSPE (Preliminary)\n*UPSC CSME (Mains)\n}}\n| type                = Paper-based standardized test\n| test_admin          = [[Union Public Service Commission]]\n| skills_tested       = Writing, [[English language|English]], [[General knowledge]], others\n| purpose             = Selection of candidates to the various posts of [[Civil Services of India]]\n| year_started        = {{Start date|1922}}<ref>https://www.upsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/History%20of%20the%20Commission%20final%20%281%29_0.pdf</ref>\n| year_terminated     = <!-- {{End date|YYYY}} -->\n| duration            = 2 hours/paper (Prelims) <br> 3 hours/paper (Mains) \n| score_range         = 0 - 200 (Prelims) <br> 0 - 1750 (Mains) <br> 0 - 275 (Interview) <br> Total = 2025 (Mains + Interview)\n| score_validity      =\n| offered             = Once a year\n| attempt_restriction = 6 (General), 9 (OBC & PwBD- General), no limits for SC & ST candidates\n| regions             = India\n| language            = Question paper is only given in [[Hindi]] or English.

Also simply referred to as the '''UPSC examination''',<ref name=note/> it is conducted in three phases - a preliminary examination consisting of two objective-type papers (General Studies Paper I and General Studies Paper II also popularly known as Civil Service Aptitude Test or CSAT), and a main examination consisting of nine papers of conventional (essay) type, in which two papers are qualifying and only marks of seven are counted followed by a personality test (interview).<ref name=note/>\n\n==Process==\nThe Civil Services Examination is based on the British era [[Imperial Civil Service]] tests, as well as the civil service tests conducted by old Indian empires such as the [[Mauryan Empire]] and [[Mughal Empire]]. It is considered to be the most difficult competitive examination in India. A single attempt takes two complete years of preparation - one year before the prelims and one year from prelims to interview. In total, one sits in actual exam for 32 hours from prelims till interview.

The test is intended to evaluate the mental calibre of a candidate. In broad terms, this is really an assessment of not only a candidate's intellectual qualities, but also social traits and interest in current affairs. Some of the qualities to be judged are mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation, clear and logical exposition, balance of judgement, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership, and intellectual and moral integrity.\n\nThe technique of the interview is not that of a strict cross-examination, but of a natural, though directed and purposeful conversation that is intended to reveal the mental qualities of the candidate.\n\nThe interview is not intended to test either of the specialized or general knowledge of the candidate, which has been already tested through written papers. Candidates are expected to have taken an intelligent interest not only in their special subjects of academic study, but also in the events which are happening around them both within and outside their own state or country as well as in modern currents of thought and in new discoveries which should rouse the curiosity of all well-educated youth. The interview standards are very high and require thorough preparation as well as commitment.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.upsc.gov.in Union Public Service Commission official website]\n*[https://upsc.gov.in/examinations/Civil%20Services%20%28Preliminary%29%20Examination%2C%202019 Civil Services (Preliminary) Examination 2019 official website]\n*[https://upsc.gov.in/sites/default/files/Final_Notice_CSPE_2019_N.pdf Civil Services Examination 2019 official notification]\n\n{{Standardized tests in India}}\n\n[[Category:Standardised tests in India]]\n[[Category:Union Public Service Commission]]\n[[Category:Civil service tests in India]]\n", "name_user": "103.105.96.109", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eOptional subjects)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Services_Examination_(India)"}

Any of several schools could potentially fill the non-football slot, with Pete Thamel of [[Yahoo Sports]] considering [[VCU Rams|VCU]] to be \"the most logical target there.\" Thamel dismissed the prospect of the American adding a new all-sports member, saying \"there's no obvious candidate who could add value in both basketball and football.\"<ref name=\"Borzello, Schlabach\"/><ref name=\"Thamel 2019-06-22\"/>\n\nOn June 24, 2019, it was reported that the Big East had formally approved an invitation for UConn to join the conference.<ref>{{cite web |title=Big East presidents approve UConn's invitation to join conference; football program's future remains uncertain |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/big-east-presidents-approve-uconns-invitation-to-join-conference-football-programs-future-remains-uncertain/ |website=CBSSports.com |accessdate=25 June 2019 |language=en}}</ref> On June 26, 2019, the UConn Board of Trustees accepted the invitation and they are expected to join the league for the 2020-2021 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collegebasketball.nbcsports.com/2019/06/26/its-official-uconn-is-back-in-the-big-east/|title=It's official: UConn is back in the Big East|last=Dauster|first=Rob|date=2019-06-26|website=CollegeBasketballTalk|language=en|access-date=2019-06-26}}</ref> On July 26, media reports indicated that UConn and The American had reached a buyout agreement that confirmed UConn's Big East arrival date as July 1, 2020, paying the American a $17 million exit fee.<ref name=\"UConn buyout\">{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/27263372/uconn-leaving-aac-20-owe-17m-exit-fee |title=UConn leaving AAC in '20, will owe $17M exit fee |first=Jeff |last=Borzello |website=ESPN.com |date=July 26, 2019 |accessdate=July 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt was widely reported that UConn was \"rejoining\" the Big East, given that the Huskies would be reunited with many of the schools against which it played for three decades in the original Big East.

Starting with the 2016 season, a conference can conduct an \"exempt\" championship game with fewer than 12 members, as long as it either plays in two divisions or conducts a full round-robin schedule.</ref> When Navy joined in 2015 and divisions were created, Navy was placed in the West division along with Houston, Memphis, SMU, Tulane, and Tulsa. Teams play eight conference games a season. Since 2015, each team has played the other five teams in its own division, as well as three teams from the other division, operating in a four-year cycle ensuring that each school will play every conference opponent at home and on the road at least once in the four-year cycle.<ref>{{cite news|title=American Announces Football Schedule Format for 2015\u201318|url=http://theamerican.org/news/2014/12/18/FB_1218143422.aspx|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=December 18, 2014|date=December 18, 2012}}</ref> The East and West division winners, determined by final conference record, meet in the [[American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game]], which is played at the home site of one of the division winners. \n\nWith the departure of UConn after the 2019 season, divisions were affected by the reduction to an uneven number of teams. The American has no immediate plan to add another team to rebalance division, so divisions have been eliminated from the conference for the time being. The championship game will now be played by the two teams that achieved the best record in regular season conference play.\n\nLike the conference itself, football experienced much transition through its history \u2013 in fact it was the main force behind such departures and expansion. In 2003, the BCS announced that it would adjust the automatic bids granted to its six founding conferences based on results from 2004 to 2007. With the addition of [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville]], and [[South Florida Bulls|South Florida]] in 2005, the conference retained its BCS automatic-qualifying status. In 2007, South Florida rose to No. 2 in the BCS rankings, but finished No. 21 in the final poll. Cincinnati finished the 2009 regular season undefeated at 12\u20130, and ranked No. 3 in the final BCS standings, barely missing the opportunity to play for the BCS National Championship. The conference was 9\u20137 (.563) in [[BCS Bowl#Bowl games|BCS bowl games]], the third highest winning percentage amongst the AQ conferences. After the 2017 Season, the University of Central Florida Knights, a member of the American, went undefeated but was not invited to the College Football Playoff. They earned the Group of Five's New Years Six bowl bid and defeated Auburn in the Peach Bowl. They would claim a national championship, which was recognized by the Colley Matrix, one of the NCAA recognized selectors of the national champion in football.\n\n===All-time school and conference records===\nAs of the conclusion of the [[2019 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2019 season]].\nConference wins and losses are since the formation of The American.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:1em auto; width:90%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n! colspan=\"4\"|Overall\n! colspan=\"3\"|Conference\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Bowl <br> Appearances\n! rowspan=\"2\"|The American <br> Championships\n! rowspan=\"2\"|National <br> Championships\n|-\n!

Teams play eight conference games a season. Since 2015, each team has played the other five teams in its own division, as well as three teams from the other division, operating in a four-year cycle ensuring that each school will play every conference opponent at home and on the road at least once in the four-year cycle.<ref>{{cite news|title=American Announces Football Schedule Format for 2015\u201318|url=http://theamerican.org/news/2014/12/18/FB_1218143422.aspx|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=December 18, 2014|date=December 18, 2012}}</ref> The East and West division winners, determined by final conference record, meet in the [[American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game]], which is played at the home site of one of the division winners. \n\nWith the departure of UConn after the 2019 season, divisions were affected by the reduction to an uneven number of teams. The American has no immediate plan to add another team to rebalance division, so divisions have been eliminated from the conference for the time being. The championship game will now be played by the two teams that achieved the best record in regular season conference play.\n\nLike the conference itself, football experienced much transition through its history \u2013 in fact it was the main force behind such departures and expansion. In 2003, the BCS announced that it would adjust the automatic bids granted to its six founding conferences based on results from 2004 to 2007. With the addition of [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville]], and [[South Florida Bulls|South Florida]] in 2005, the conference retained its BCS automatic-qualifying status. In 2007, South Florida rose to No. 2 in the BCS rankings, but finished No. 21 in the final poll. Cincinnati finished the 2009 regular season undefeated at 12\u20130, and ranked No. 3 in the final BCS standings, barely missing the opportunity to play for the BCS National Championship. The conference was 9\u20137 (.563) in [[BCS Bowl#Bowl games|BCS bowl games]], the third highest winning percentage amongst the AQ conferences. After the 2017 Season, the University of Central Florida Knights, a member of the American, went undefeated but was not invited to the College Football Playoff. They earned the Group of Five's New Years Six bowl bid and defeated Auburn in the Peach Bowl.

It opened on 1 March 1858, but after a year became part of the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] system when the ELR was taken over by that company.  The station consisted of two platforms with the main building on the northbound side.  A wooden signal box was provided to control the adjacent [[level crossing]], passing loop and nearby goods yard.  The line towards Ormskirk was subsequently doubled in 1875, the year after the station was renamed.\n\nThroughout its life the route operated as a self-contained branch, though connections were available for {{rws|Preston}}, [[Liverpool Exchange railway station|Liverpool]] & Blackpool at Ormskirk and for {{rws|St Helens Central}}, {{rws|Wigan Wallgate}} and [[Manchester Victoria railway station|Manchester Victoria]] at Rainford.  The service was also generous, with the L&Y running a steam [[railmotor]] service of 19 trains per day in each direction from 1906.  A similar pattern continued after the route became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] in January 1923, but increasing road competition after World War II and the subsequent [[nationalisation]] of the railways in 1948 saw traffic levels decline.\n\nThe station was closed to passenger traffic by the [[British Transport Commission]] on 5 November 1956,<ref>{{Butt-Stations |page=213 }}</ref> with the line south to Rainford closing completely on 16 November 1961 and the rest on 4 November 1963, when goods traffic at the station ceased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/s/skelmersdale/index.shtml|title=Disused Stations \u2013 Skelmersdale|work=Disused Stations|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>  The track was lifted in 1968 and station was demolished soon afterwards; the B5312 road (known as ''Railway Road'') now passes through the site.\n\nIronically this was done just as the town was undergoing a significant increase in population levels and associated housing development, having been designated as one of the second wave of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] in 1961 (it was chosen, along with [[Runcorn]] as an overspill town for Liverpool).\n\n==Reopening proposals==\n\nSkelmersdale has been described as the largest town in North-West England that doesn't have a railway station,<ref>{{cite web|title=A station back in Skelmersdale|url=http://www.railfuture.org.uk/A+Station+Back+in+Skelmersdale|website=railfuture|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> although Leigh in Greater Manchester, which also has no station is larger.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.wigan.gov.uk/Docs/PDF/Council/Council-statistics-and-demographics/Census2011PopulationandHouseholdEstimatesforWards.pdf|format=PDF|title=Census 2011: Population and Household Estimates for Wards|publisher=[[Wigan Council]]|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> There have been many discussions about reopening a railway station in Skelmersdale.

It opened on 1 March 1858, but after a year became part of the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] system when the ELR was taken over by that company.  The station consisted of two platforms with the main building on the northbound side.  A wooden signal box was provided to control the adjacent [[level crossing]], passing loop and nearby goods yard.  The line towards Ormskirk was subsequently doubled in 1875, the year after the station was renamed.\n\nThroughout its life the route operated as a self-contained branch, though connections were available for {{rws|Preston}}, [[Liverpool Exchange railway station|Liverpool]] & Blackpool at Ormskirk and for {{rws|St Helens Central}}, {{rws|Wigan Wallgate}} and [[Manchester Victoria railway station|Manchester Victoria]] at Rainford.  The service was also generous, with the L&Y running a steam [[railmotor]] service of 19 trains per day in each direction from 1906.  A similar pattern continued after the route became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] in January 1923, but increasing road competition after World War II and the subsequent [[nationalisation]] of the railways in 1948 saw traffic levels decline.\n\nThe station was closed to passenger traffic by the [[British Transport Commission]] on 5 November 1956,<ref>{{Butt-Stations |page=213 }}</ref> with the line south to Rainford closing completely on 16 November 1961 and the rest on 4 November 1963, when goods traffic at the station ceased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.disused-stations.org.uk/s/skelmersdale/index.shtml|title=Disused Stations \u2013 Skelmersdale|work=Disused Stations|accessdate=23 October 2013}}</ref>  The track was lifted in 1968 and station was demolished soon afterwards; the B5312 road (known as ''Railway Road'') now passes through the site.\n\nIronically this was done just as the town was undergoing a significant increase in population levels and associated housing development, having been designated as one of the second wave of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] in 1961 (it was chosen, along with [[Runcorn]] as an overspill town for Liverpool).\n\n==Reopening proposals==\n\nSkelmersdale has been described as the largest town in North-West England that doesn't have a railway station,<ref>{{cite web|title=A station back in Skelmersdale|url=http://www.railfuture.org.uk/A+Station+Back+in+Skelmersdale|website=railfuture|accessdate=31 October 2016}}</ref> although Leigh in Greater Manchester, which also has no station is larger.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.wigan.gov.uk/Docs/PDF/Council/Council-statistics-and-demographics/Census2011PopulationandHouseholdEstimatesforWards.pdf|format=PDF|title=Census 2011: Population and Household Estimates for Wards|publisher=[[Wigan Council]]|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> There have been many discussions about reopening a railway station in Skelmersdale.

Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis.

Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.
