The video also thanks his fans for sticking with him through his YouTube career, referencing past notable videos.<ref name=\"CongratsDexerto\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/watch-pewdiepie-roast-t-series-epic-new-congratulations-diss-track-504410 |title=Watch PewDiePie roast T-Series with epic new 'Congratulations' diss track |last=Glaze |first=Virginia |date=31 March 2019 |website=dexerto.com}}</ref><ref name=\"polygon\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/31/18275692/pewdiepie-tseries-feud-concession-diss-track |title=PewDiePie admits defeat to T-Series |last=Radulovic |first=Petrana |date=31 March 2019 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref><ref name=\"theverge\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/31/18289617/pewdiepie-tseries-congratulations-subscribe-youtube-diss-track-100-million |title=PewDiePie concedes to T-Series in battle for YouTube\u2019s biggest channel |last=Alexander |first=Julia |date=31 March 2019 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47042761 |title=PewDiePie concedes defeat to YouTube rival T-Series |date=1 April 2019 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the song was uploaded to YouTube, PewDiePie regained his lead against T-Series.<ref name=Tobin2019>{{cite web|last=Tobin|first=Ben|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|title=PewDiePie back on top as largest YouTube channel over Indian music label T-Series|work=[[USA Today]]|date=2 April 2019|accessdate=3 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404024138/https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/04/02/pewdiepie-back-top-biggest-youtube-channel-over-t-series/3339914002/|archive-date=4 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Eight days after the release of \"Congratulations,\" both music videos were banned in India when the [[Delhi High Court]] granted an injunction in favor of T-Series.<ref name=\"DissTracksBanned1\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.medianama.com/2019/04/223-delhi-high-court-orders-youtube-to-remove-pewdiepie-diss-tracks-on-t-series/ |title=Delhi High Court orders YouTube to remove PewDiePie \"diss tracks\" on T-Series |last=Babele |first=Aryan |date=12 April 2019 |website=Medianama |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DissTracksBanned2\">{{Cite web |url=https://roguerocket.com/2019/04/15/pewdiepies-t-series-diss-tracks-banned-in-india/ |title=PewDiePie\u2019s T-Series Diss Tracks Banned in India |last=Stenn |first=Lili |date=15 April 2019 |website=Rogue Rocket |access-date=13 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"DissTracksBanned3\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/04/11/india-v-pewdiepie/ |title=India Clamps Down on PewDiePie Racism \u2014 High Court Orders YouTube to Remove Two Offensive Videos |last=Sanchz |first=Daniel |date=11 April 2019 |website=Digital Music News |access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 October 2019, following PewDiePie's surpassing 100 million subscribers and a few months of Minecraft gameplay videos, PewDiePie released \"Mine All Day (Minecraft music video)\".

It is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] and is intended to enhance an [[Fireteam#Marine Corps|automatic rifleman's]] maneuverability. The U.S. Marine Corps initially planned to purchase 6,500 M27s to replace a portion of the [[M249 light machine gun]]s employed by automatic riflemen within [[List of United States Marine Corps battalions#Infantry|Infantry]] and [[United States Marine Corps Light Armored Reconnaissance|Light Armored Reconnaissance]] Battalions. Approximately 8,000\u201310,000 M249s will remain in service with the Marine Corps to be used at the discretion of company commanders.  In December 2017, the Marine Corps announced that it would equip every Marine in an infantry squad with the M27.<ref name=\"kitup5jan18\">[https://www.military.com/kitup/2018/01/05/m27s-and-head-toe-gear-overhaul-way-marine-grunts.html M27s and 'Head-to-Toe' Gear Overhaul on the Way for Marine Grunts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180107233105/https://www.military.com/kitup/2018/01/05/m27s-and-head-toe-gear-overhaul-way-marine-grunts.html |date=2018-01-07 }} - Military.com/Kitup, 5 January 2018</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:M249 FN MINIMI DM-SD-05-05342.jpg|thumb|left|A U.S. Marine firing an M249 from an [[M122 tripod|M122A1 tripod]] at a training range in November 2003]]\n\nIn 1985, the U.S. Marine Corps adopted the [[M249 Squad Automatic Weapon]] (SAW), one year after the U.S. Army. Procurement of this {{convert|22|lb|kg|abbr=on}} loaded weight [[Light machine gun]] was a service-level decision because the weapon was adopted by the Army with a contract method the Marines could use. While the belt-fed M249 was portable and had a high volume of fire, its relatively heavy weight meant gunners could have trouble keeping up with riflemen.<ref name=\"sadj\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1445 From BAR to IAR \u2013 How the Marines Finally Got Their Infantry Automatic Rifle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031102022/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1445 |date=2013-10-31 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 20 November 2012</ref>\n\nThe M249 light machine gun provides infantry [[squad]]s with the high [[rate of fire]] of a [[machine gun]] combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle. It can be fed from both [[Belt (firearm)|linked ammunition]] and [[STANAG magazine]]s, like those used in the [[M16 rifle|M16]] and [[M4 carbine|M4]]. M249s have seen action in every major conflict involving the United States since the [[United States invasion of Panama|U.S. invasion of Panama]] in 1989.\n\n==Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR)==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1999, a Universal Need Statement was issued for an Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR). Around 2000, the 1st Marine Division\u2019s [[2nd Battalion, 7th Marines]] Regiment conducted initial, limited IAR trials which confirmed the desirability of a light automatic rifle. The key difference between a lighter infantry rifle and a more heavily built ''automatic rifle'' is the ability of the latter to maintain sustained continuous fire without stoppages, overheating the barrel or receiver and losing accuracy. Experiences in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] resulted in formal requests for recommendations. The Universal Need Statement spent six years going through the procurement process before an official program was begun and a list of required capabilities was created in early 2005.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nThe Infantry Automatic Rifle program began on 14 July 2005, when the Marine Corps sent Requests For Information to arms manufacturers. Characteristics desired in the weapon included: portability and maneuverability; similarity in appearance to other rifles in the squad, reducing the likelihood that the gunner will receive special attention from the enemy; facilitation of the gunner's participation in counter-insurgency operations and capability of maintaining a high volume of fire. An initial requirement for a magazine with a minimum capacity of 100 rounds was dropped in favor of the 30-round [[STANAG magazine]] because, at the start of testing, available 100-round magazines were unreliable.

Fielding of the approximately 6,500 M27 units was expected to be completed in the summer of 2013, at a cost of $13 million. Each M27 gunner was to be equipped with around twenty-two 30-round magazines of the type currently in use with the [[M16 rifle|M16]] and [[M4 carbine]] approximating the combat load of an M249 SAW gunner; although the M27 gunner would not be expected to carry all 22 magazines. The individual combat load would be determined at the unit level and was expected to vary by unit, based on results of evaluations conducted by the four infantry battalions and one light armored reconnaissance battalion that participated in the Limited User Evaluation. Though program officials were aware that switching from the belt-fed M249 would result in a loss of [[suppressive fire]] capability, Charles Clark III, of the Marine Corps' Combat Development and Integration Office, cited the substantially increased accuracy of the M27 as a significant factor in the decision to replace the M249.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/corps-to-replace-saw-with-automatic-rifle.html|title=Corps to Replace SAW With Automatic Rifle|year=2011|publisher=[[Military.com]]|accessdate=16 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718012729/http://www.military.com/news/article/corps-to-replace-saw-with-automatic-rifle.html|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Replacement of M16/M4===\nIn early 2017, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[Robert Neller]] said he wanted to equip every \"[[MOS 0311|0311]]\" rifleman with an M27 IAR. Because of that, the Marine Corps issued a request in early 2017 for 11,000 M27 IARs from H&K. While talking about the Corps' request, Chris Woodburn, deputy of the Maneuver Branch, Fires and Maneuver Integration at [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command]], said \"The new order will replace all [[M4 carbine|M4s]] in every infantry squad with an M27, except for the squad leader.\" He also stated that the change includes infantry training battalions. The timeline for funding was planned for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, with the Corps acquiring some of the rifles in fiscal year 2018. As of August 2017, officials have stated that \"riflemen are the top priority,\" but that the M27 \"will be in the hands of combat engineers and light armored reconnaissance battalion scouts next.\" The Corps later issued a pre-solicitation notice for the M27. \"The new pre-solicitation notice of 50,184 [M27s],\" said Woodburn, \"is [meant] to up the production capacity that H&K must be able to meet as the sole-source provider [of the M27], should the Marines decide to order more in the future.\" At SHOT Show 2018, the Marine Corps announced that the deal with H&K to produce 11,000 M27s for the Marine Corps had been finalized and that the M27 IAR would be adopted as the standard issue service rifle of the Marine Corps infantry, replacing the M4A1.<ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/newsletters/daily-news-roundup/2017/08/15/marines-want-50000-more-infantry-automatic-rifles-to-replace-m4/ Marines want 11,000 Infantry Automatic Rifles to replace M4 in every infantry squad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040146/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/newsletters/daily-news-roundup/2017/08/15/marines-want-50000-more-infantry-automatic-rifles-to-replace-m4/ |date=2018-03-31 }} - Marinesmagazine.mil, 15 August, 2017</ref>\n\n===Suppressive fire debate===\n[[File:USMC-120405-M-AB169-004.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine practices firing an M27 IAR on fully automatic fire in April 2012.]]\n\nWhile [[Marine Corps Systems Command]] was optimistic about operational testing, former Marine Commandant General [[James T. Conway]] remained skeptical because of the reduction in firepower at the [[fireteam]]-level that would result if the M27 was adopted.<ref name=\"CMCskeptic\">{{cite news|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_iar_041910w/|title=Corps may field infantry auto-rifle this fall|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|date=April 19, 2010|publisher=Marine Corps Times|accessdate=19 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060325/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_iar_041910w/|archivedate=8 March 2012}}</ref> He felt that, while more accurate, it was unlikely that the M27 could provide fire-superiority over the belt-fed M249 SAW. A magazine-fed rifle, requiring frequent reloading, would not be able to sustain the same rate of fire. In a firefight, squad members carrying extra magazines for the M27 might not always be in position to supply them to the gunner. Further, the SAW was already a battle-proven weapon. It was also significant that the Army had chosen not to pursue the IAR concept.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nThe notion that the M27 represents a reduction in suppressive fire has spawned considerable debate between proponents of the M249 SAW within the infantry and those who advocate that a lighter, more maneuverable, and accurate weapon is sufficient to support offensive operations at the squad level. It is debatable, in fact, that program officials actually concede a loss of suppressive fire capabilities, as the only statements of concern over this concept were made by General Conway.\n\nWith a SAW, the doctrine of fire suppression is the sound of continuous fire with rounds landing close to the enemy. While the M249's volume of fire may be greater, it is less accurate. Experienced troops who have dealt with incoming fire are less likely to take cover from incoming rounds if they are not close enough. With an IAR, the doctrine is that lower volume of fire is needed with better accuracy. Fewer rounds need to be used and automatic riflemen can remain in combat longer and in more situations.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nAnother benefit of the M27 over the M249 is that in many respects it resembles an M4 rifle as used by the rest of the squad. This makes it harder to identify by enemy troops, and if replacing all M4s and M249s, would enable the use of the exact same magazines quickly and easily.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\n==Combat reviews==\nThe IAR was initially fielded in December 2010.<ref name=\"marinecorpstimes18feb16\"/> [[1st Battalion 3rd Marines]] were deployed to Afghanistan in April 2011 with 84 IARs. Former SAW gunners initially did not like the M27, but appreciated it as time went on. It weighed 9&nbsp;lb (4&nbsp;kg) loaded, compared to 22&nbsp;lb (10&nbsp;kg) for an M249, which was a significant difference when on five-hour missions. Gunners said it was \"two weapons in one,\" being able to fire single shots accurately out to 800 meters and have fully automatic fire. It also blended in with standard M16-style service rifles, making it difficult for enemy forces to identify the machine gunner. The battalion leadership also saw the M27 as better at preventing collateral damage, as it is more controllable on fully automatic than the M249. Concern of volume of fire loss was made up for through training courses developed in December 2010. With the M249 SAW, the idea of suppression was volume of fire and the sound of the machine gun. With the M27 IAR, the idea of suppression shifts to engaging with precision fire, as it has rifle accuracy at long range and fully automatic fire at short range. Shooters transitioned from long-range precision fire at 700 meters to short-to-medium suppressive fire at 200 meters, both while in the prone position. Some gunners in combat have been used as designated marksmen. An M27 gunner with one aimed shot has the effect of three or four automatic shots from the SAW, and still has the option of a heavier volume with an accurate [[shot grouping|grouping]].<ref name=\"skeptic\">[http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20110719/NEWS/107190309/IAR-wins-over-skeptical-Marine-infantrymen IAR wins over skeptical Marine infantrymen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021084012/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20110719/NEWS/107190309/IAR-wins-over-skeptical-Marine-infantrymen |date=2013-10-21 }} - MarineCorpstimes.com, 19 July 2011</ref>\n\nMarines issued with the M27 enjoy its familiarity with the M4-style weapons in service.

IAR gunners consider the rifle-grade accuracy to be a huge improvement over the SAW, despite the loss of sustained firing.  With a shrinking budget, the Marine Corps is looking at ways to implement the IAR as a multipurpose weapon.

The improved STANAG magazine with the tan-colored anti-tilt follower is favored over the previous version with the green follower because it can be inserted more easily and the anti-tilt follower can handle high rates of fully automatic fire with less chance of malfunction. There have been issues with some STANAG magazines sticking in the magwell, especially when painted and or damaged. While a rifleman normally carries seven 30-round magazines, an IAR gunner has to carry up to sixteen, and may carry as many as twenty one, due to its role and fully automatic rate of fire. The magazine well has a flared opening that aids in magazine insertion, but a [[Magpul Industries#Firearms accessories|PMAG 30 GEN M2]] magazine cannot be inserted due to the frontal plastic bevel on the PMAG.<ref name=\"review\"/> Because the M27 cannot be fed from the widely used M2 PMAG magazines that M4s or M16 rifles in the squad could take, the Marines banned the polymer PMAG for issue on November 26, 2012 to prevent interchangeability issues.<ref>[http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2012/11/marine-corps-bans-polymer-rifle-magazines-112612/ Marine Corps bans popular rifle magazines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130142554/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2012/11/marine-corps-bans-polymer-rifle-magazines-112612/ |date=2012-11-30 }} - Marinecorpstimes.com, November 26, 2012</ref> In response, Magpul began the process of arranging verification and official testing for their improved PMAG 30 GEN M3 magazine, which is compatible with both the M27 and M16-series rifles.<ref>[http://militarytimes.com/blogs/gearscout/2012/11/30/magpul-speaks-out-on-the-marine-corps-polymer-magazine-ban/ Magpul speaks out on the Marine Corps polymer magazine ban] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204152253/http://militarytimes.com/blogs/gearscout/2012/11/30/magpul-speaks-out-on-the-marine-corps-polymer-magazine-ban/ |date=2012-12-04 }} - Militarytimes Gearscout.com, November 30, 2012</ref> After Marine Corps testing of the [[5.56x45mm NATO#M855A1|M855A1 Enhanced Performance Round]] with the M27 showed reliability problems from feeding issues from standard magazines,<ref>[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/12/20/army-round-triggers-problems-marine-m27-auto-rifle.html Army Round Triggers Problems in Marine M27 Auto Rifle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226152150/http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/12/20/army-round-triggers-problems-marine-m27-auto-rifle.html |date=2016-12-26 }} - Military.com, 20 December 2016</ref> the PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window, which had better reliability with the EPR, was approved for use by Marines in December 2016 so that M27 gunners who receive M855A1 rounds do not face such issues.<ref>[http://kitup.military.com/2016/12/pmag-marines-m27-m855a1-round.html Marines to Get PMAG to Fix M27 Woes with M855A1 Round] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226152013/http://kitup.military.com/2016/12/pmag-marines-m27-m855a1-round.html |date=2016-12-26 }} - Kitup.Military.com, 20 December 2016</ref> Due to its role, high capacity magazines of between 50 and 100 rounds are being explored.<ref name=\"Corps switch\"/>\n\n===Accessories===\nThe M27 is essentially an HK416 with accessories required by the Marine Corps.<ref>[http://militarytimes.com/blogs/gearscout/2011/10/24/whats-the-diff-between-the-m27-iar-and-the-hk416/ Breakdown: M27 IAR vs. HK416] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906040919/http://militarytimes.com/blogs/gearscout/2011/10/24/whats-the-diff-between-the-m27-iar-and-the-hk416/ |date=2012-09-06 }} - Militarytimes.com/Gearscout, October 24, 2011</ref> The standard optic is the [[Trijicon]] [[Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight|ACOG]] Squad Day Optic (SDO), officially designated the Sight Unit, SU-258/PVQ Squad Day Optic.

Procurement of this {{convert|22|lb|kg|abbr=on}} loaded weight [[Light machine gun]] was a service-level decision because the weapon was adopted by the Army with a contract method the Marines could use. While the belt-fed M249 was portable and had a high volume of fire, its relatively heavy weight meant gunners could have trouble keeping up with riflemen.<ref name=\"sadj\">[http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1445 From BAR to IAR \u2013 How the Marines Finally Got Their Infantry Automatic Rifle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031102022/http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=1445 |date=2013-10-31 }} - SAdefensejournal.com, 20 November 2012</ref>\n\nThe M249 light machine gun provides infantry [[squad]]s with the high [[rate of fire]] of a [[machine gun]] combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle. It can be fed from both [[Belt (firearm)|linked ammunition]] and [[STANAG magazine]]s, like those used in the [[M16 rifle|M16]] and [[M4 carbine|M4]]. M249s have seen action in every major conflict involving the United States since the [[United States invasion of Panama|U.S. invasion of Panama]] in 1989.\n\n==Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR)==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1999, a Universal Need Statement was issued for an Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR). Around 2000, the 1st Marine Division\u2019s [[2nd Battalion, 7th Marines]] Regiment conducted initial, limited IAR trials which confirmed the desirability of a light automatic rifle. The key difference between a lighter infantry rifle and a more heavily built ''automatic rifle'' is the ability of the latter to maintain sustained continuous fire without stoppages, overheating the barrel or receiver and losing accuracy. Experiences in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] resulted in formal requests for recommendations. The Universal Need Statement spent six years going through the procurement process before an official program was begun and a list of required capabilities was created in early 2005.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nThe Infantry Automatic Rifle program began on 14 July 2005, when the Marine Corps sent Requests For Information to arms manufacturers. Characteristics desired in the weapon included: portability and maneuverability; similarity in appearance to other rifles in the squad, reducing the likelihood that the gunner will receive special attention from the enemy; facilitation of the gunner's participation in counter-insurgency operations and capability of maintaining a high volume of fire. An initial requirement for a magazine with a minimum capacity of 100 rounds was dropped in favor of the 30-round [[STANAG magazine]] because, at the start of testing, available 100-round magazines were unreliable. Caliber was specified as 5.56\u00d745mm with non-linked ammunition, so as to achieve commonality with existing service rifles.<ref name=\"sadj\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=a8698386e4300ceee7bc1067a71dab5c&tab=core&_cview=0|title=10\u2014Non-developmental, 5.56mm, Infantry Automatic Rifle (IAR)|date=July 14, 2005|publisher=Fed[[Business opportunity|BizOpp]]|accessdate=20 August 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122145748/https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&mode=form&id=a8698386e4300ceee7bc1067a71dab5c&tab=core&_cview=0|archive-date=22 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Testing===\nIn 2006, contracts were issued to several manufacturers for sample weapons.

Fielding of the approximately 6,500 M27 units was expected to be completed in the summer of 2013, at a cost of $13 million. Each M27 gunner was to be equipped with around twenty-two 30-round magazines of the type currently in use with the [[M16 rifle|M16]] and [[M4 carbine]] approximating the combat load of an M249 SAW gunner; although the M27 gunner would not be expected to carry all 22 magazines. The individual combat load would be determined at the unit level and was expected to vary by unit, based on results of evaluations conducted by the four infantry battalions and one light armored reconnaissance battalion that participated in the Limited User Evaluation. Though program officials were aware that switching from the belt-fed M249 would result in a loss of [[suppressive fire]] capability, Charles Clark III, of the Marine Corps' Combat Development and Integration Office, cited the substantially increased accuracy of the M27 as a significant factor in the decision to replace the M249.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/news/article/corps-to-replace-saw-with-automatic-rifle.html|title=Corps to Replace SAW With Automatic Rifle|year=2011|publisher=[[Military.com]]|accessdate=16 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718012729/http://www.military.com/news/article/corps-to-replace-saw-with-automatic-rifle.html|archive-date=18 July 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Replacement of M16/M4===\nIn early 2017, [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[Robert Neller]] said he wanted to equip every \"[[MOS 0311|0311]]\" rifleman with an M27 IAR. Because of that, the Marine Corps issued a request in early 2017 for 11,000 M27 IARs from H&K. While talking about the Corps' request, Chris Woodburn, deputy of the Maneuver Branch, Fires and Maneuver Integration at [[Marine Corps Combat Development Command]], said \"The new order will replace all [[M4 carbine|M4s]] in every infantry squad with an M27, except for the squad leader.\" He also stated that the change includes infantry training battalions. The timeline for funding was planned for fiscal years 2019 and 2020, with the Corps acquiring some of the rifles in fiscal year 2018. As of August 2017, officials have stated that \"riflemen are the top priority,\" but that the M27 \"will be in the hands of combat engineers and light armored reconnaissance battalion scouts next.\" The Corps later issued a pre-solicitation notice for the M27. \"The new pre-solicitation notice of 50,184 [M27s],\" said Woodburn, \"is [meant] to up the production capacity that H&K must be able to meet as the sole-source provider [of the M27], should the Marines decide to order more in the future.\" At SHOT Show 2018, the Marine Corps announced that the deal with H&K to produce 11,000 M27s for the Marine Corps had been finalized and that the M27 IAR would be adopted as the standard issue service rifle of the Marine Corps infantry, replacing the M4A1.<ref>[https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/newsletters/daily-news-roundup/2017/08/15/marines-want-50000-more-infantry-automatic-rifles-to-replace-m4/ Marines want 11,000 Infantry Automatic Rifles to replace M4 in every infantry squad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331040146/https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/newsletters/daily-news-roundup/2017/08/15/marines-want-50000-more-infantry-automatic-rifles-to-replace-m4/ |date=2018-03-31 }} - Marinesmagazine.mil, 15 August, 2017</ref>\n\n===Suppressive fire debate===\n[[File:USMC-120405-M-AB169-004.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine practices firing an M27 IAR on fully automatic fire in April 2012.]]\n\nWhile [[Marine Corps Systems Command]] was optimistic about operational testing, former Marine Commandant General [[James T. Conway]] remained skeptical because of the reduction in firepower at the [[fireteam]]-level that would result if the M27 was adopted.<ref name=\"CMCskeptic\">{{cite news|url=http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_iar_041910w/|title=Corps may field infantry auto-rifle this fall|last=Lamothe|first=Dan|date=April 19, 2010|publisher=Marine Corps Times|accessdate=19 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308060325/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2010/04/marine_iar_041910w/|archivedate=8 March 2012}}</ref> He felt that, while more accurate, it was unlikely that the M27 could provide fire-superiority over the belt-fed M249 SAW. A magazine-fed rifle, requiring frequent reloading, would not be able to sustain the same rate of fire. In a firefight, squad members carrying extra magazines for the M27 might not always be in position to supply them to the gunner. Further, the SAW was already a battle-proven weapon. It was also significant that the Army had chosen not to pursue the IAR concept.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nThe notion that the M27 represents a reduction in suppressive fire has spawned considerable debate between proponents of the M249 SAW within the infantry and those who advocate that a lighter, more maneuverable, and accurate weapon is sufficient to support offensive operations at the squad level. It is debatable, in fact, that program officials actually concede a loss of suppressive fire capabilities, as the only statements of concern over this concept were made by General Conway.\n\nWith a SAW, the doctrine of fire suppression is the sound of continuous fire with rounds landing close to the enemy. While the M249's volume of fire may be greater, it is less accurate. Experienced troops who have dealt with incoming fire are less likely to take cover from incoming rounds if they are not close enough. With an IAR, the doctrine is that lower volume of fire is needed with better accuracy. Fewer rounds need to be used and automatic riflemen can remain in combat longer and in more situations.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\nAnother benefit of the M27 over the M249 is that in many respects it resembles an M4 rifle as used by the rest of the squad. This makes it harder to identify by enemy troops, and if replacing all M4s and M249s, would enable the use of the exact same magazines quickly and easily.<ref name=\"sadj\"/>\n\n==Combat reviews==\nThe IAR was initially fielded in December 2010.<ref name=\"marinecorpstimes18feb16\"/> [[1st Battalion 3rd Marines]] were deployed to Afghanistan in April 2011 with 84 IARs. Former SAW gunners initially did not like the M27, but appreciated it as time went on. It weighed 9&nbsp;lb (4&nbsp;kg) loaded, compared to 22&nbsp;lb (10&nbsp;kg) for an M249, which was a significant difference when on five hour missions. Gunners said it was \"two weapons in one,\" being able to fire single shots accurately out to 800 meters and have fully automatic fire. It also blended in with standard M16-style service rifles, making it difficult for enemy forces to identify the machine gunner. The battalion leadership also saw the M27 as better at preventing collateral damage, as it is more controllable on fully automatic than the M249. Concern of volume of fire loss was made up for through training courses developed in December 2010. With the M249 SAW, the idea of suppression was volume of fire and the sound of the machine gun. With the M27 IAR, the idea of suppression shifts to engaging with precision fire, as it has rifle accuracy at long range and fully automatic fire at short range. Shooters transitioned from long-range precision fire at 700 meters to short-to-medium suppressive fire at 200 meters, both while in the prone position. Some gunners in combat have been used as designated marksmen. An M27 gunner with one aimed shot has the effect of three or four automatic shots from the SAW, and still has the option of a heavier volume with an accurate [[shot grouping|grouping]].<ref name=\"skeptic\">[http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20110719/NEWS/107190309/IAR-wins-over-skeptical-Marine-infantrymen IAR wins over skeptical Marine infantrymen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021084012/http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/article/20110719/NEWS/107190309/IAR-wins-over-skeptical-Marine-infantrymen |date=2013-10-21 }} - MarineCorpstimes.com, 19 July 2011</ref>\n\nMarines issued with the M27 enjoy its familiarity with the M4-style weapons in service.

IAR gunners consider the rifle-grade accuracy to be a huge improvement over the SAW, despite the loss of sustained firing.  With a shrinking budget, the Marine Corps is looking at ways to implement the IAR as a multipurpose weapon.

The FIA is also the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for [[Formula One]] and other international [[auto racing|motorsports]].\n \nA [[barrister]] and former amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of [[March Engineering]], a racing car constructor and Formula One racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters for the company between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the [[Formula One Constructors' Association]] (FOCA), the body that represents Formula One constructors. Together with [[Bernie Ecclestone]] he represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings with race organisers. In 1978, Mosley became the official legal adviser to FOCA. In this role he and Marco Piccinini negotiated the first version of the [[Concorde Agreement]], which settled [[FISA\u2013FOCA war|a long-standing dispute]] between FOCA and the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of Formula One. Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA, FISA's parent body, in 1993.\n\nMosley identified his major achievement as FIA President as the promotion of the [[Euro NCAP|European New Car Assessment Programme]] (Euro NCAP or Encap). He has also promoted increased safety and the use of green technologies in motor racing. In 2008, stories about his sex life appeared in the British press, along with unfounded allegations regarding Nazi connotations. Mosley successfully sued the newspaper that published the allegations and maintained his position as FIA president. He stood down at the end of his term in 2009 and was replaced by his preferred successor, [[Jean Todt]].\n \nMosley is the youngest son of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]], former leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]],  and [[Diana Mitford]]. He was educated in France, Germany, and Britain before going on to attend university at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he graduated with a degree in physics. He then changed to law and was [[called to the bar]] in 1964. In his teens and early twenties, Mosley was involved with his father's post-war political party, the [[Union Movement]] (UM). He has said that the association of his surname with fascism stopped him from developing his interest in politics further, although he briefly worked for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the early 1980s.\n\nMosley is the subject of Michael Shevloff's 2020 biographical documentary ''Mosley''<ref>{{cite news |title=New Mosley film includes segments he \"would've cut\" |publisher=Motorsport Network |accessdate=24 January 2020 |url=https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mosley-documentary-release-date-revealing/4676225/?nrt=54 |archivedate=21 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Family and early life==\nMax Mosley was born on 13 April 1940<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/max-mosley-mosley-the-grand-machinator-of-formula-one-96759.html|title=Max Mosley: Mosley the grand machinator of Formula One|last=Viner|first=Brian|date=19 July 2003|website=The Independent|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> in London, in the early years of the [[Second World War]].

The name March is an acronym based on the initials of the founders; the 'M' stands for Mosley.<ref name=face2face/> Like the other founders, Mosley put in \u00a32,500 of capital. His father told him that the company \"would certainly go bankrupt, but it would be good training for something serious later on.\"<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 18.</ref>\n \nMosley played a key role in publicising the new outfit. Although March had few resources and limited experience, the firm announced ambitious plans to enter Formula One, the pinnacle of single-seater racing, in 1970. The team had initially intended to enter a single car, but by the beginning of the season (partly due to deals made by Mosley), the number of March cars entered for their first Formula One race had risen to five. Two of these were run by March's own in-house [[wiktionary:factory team|works team]] and the rest by customer teams.<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 22\u201327.</ref> Mosley also negotiated [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] from tyre maker [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] and [[oil additive]] manufacturer [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]].<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 23, 30.</ref>\n \nThe new operation was initially successful. In Formula One, March cars won three of their first four races. One of these was a world championship race, the [[1970 Spanish Grand Prix]], won by reigning world champion [[Jackie Stewart]] in a customer car run by [[Tyrrell Racing]]. As a result, March finished third in the 1970 [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]]. The factory also sold 40 cars to customers in various lower formulae. Despite these successes, the organisation got into financial difficulty almost immediately. The Formula One operation was costing more than the customer car business was making. The March works team's contract with its lead driver, [[Chris Amon]], was expensive, and Mosley, in his own words, \"tried at every opportunity to get rid of him\".<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 34.</ref> He reasoned that Stewart's highly competitive customer car was enough to show March in a good light. Amon stayed to the end of the year, but Mosley succeeded in \"restructuring\" his contract, saving the company some much-needed money.<ref>Henry (1989), p. 40.</ref> At the end of the season, Mosley successfully demanded full control of the finances, including the factory run by Coaker, who left shortly afterwards. Mosley and Herd borrowed \u00a320,000 from relatives and friends to support the company into its second year. According to Lovell the money came from Mosley's half-brother, [[Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne|Jonathan Guinness]].<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 119.</ref>\n \nTyrrell started making its own cars towards the end of 1970, and March's 1971 program in Formula One was much reduced, with no recognised front-running driver. The Firestone and STP sponsorship was insufficient and Mosley failed to attract a large backer for 1971. Motorsport author Mike Lawrence has suggested that the shortfall forced him into short-term deals, which maintained cashflow, but were not in the best long-term interests of the company.<ref name=\"Lawrence 1989 p.46\">Lawrence (1989), p. 46.</ref> Mosley negotiated a deal for the team to use [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines in a third car, bringing much needed funding. The engines proved uncompetitive, and his hopes of an ongoing partnership with the Italian automobile manufacturer were not met.<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 54\u201359.</ref> Nonetheless, March again finished third in the constructors championship, and works driver [[Ronnie Peterson]], in a [[Cosworth DFV]]-powered car, was second in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]]. March's financial woes continued: the company had lost \u00a371,000 at the end of 1971. Mosley and Rees disagreed over how to rectify the situation and Rees left March early in 1972.<ref>Henry (1989), p. 64.</ref>\n[[File:March 2-4-0 Louwman Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Mosley pushed for the unusual six-wheeled [[March 2-4-0]] designed by Robin Herd to be built because of its significant aerodynamic and other advantages. The car never raced, however sales of models of the car are said to make it the most profitable car the company ever made.<ref name=6wheel />]]\n \nMarch was more successful in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright.<ref name=\"Lawrence 1989 p.46\"/> Losing money on a deal to supply [[Jochen Neerpasch]], then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]] and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season.<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 70.</ref> March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships.<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 238\u2013251.</ref> However, BMW also put pressure on Herd to concentrate on the Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a [[race engineer]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n \nAlthough March considered quitting Formula One on several occasions, money was always found to support at least one car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled [[Tyrrell P34|P34]]. The resulting [[March 2-4-0]] never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a [[Scalextric]] [[slotcar racing|slotcar]] model was profitable.<ref name=6wheel>Lawrence (1989), pp. 113\u2013115.</ref> Mosley spent much of his time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] and [[Penske Racing|Penske]]. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in Formula One ended the same year.{{efn|March works teams returned to Formula One in 1981\u20131982 and 1987\u20131992 (as [[Leyton House Racing]] in 1990 and 1991).}}<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 122.</ref>\n\n\n==Formula One Constructors' Association==\n{{Main|Formula One Constructors' Association}}\n \nFrom 1969, Mosley was invited to represent March at the Grand Prix Constructors' Association (GPCA), which negotiated joint deals on behalf of its member teams.

In his biography of Ecclestone, Terry Lovell suggests that he appointed Mosley to this role not only because of his legal ability, but also because he \"saw in Mosley the necessary diplomatic and political skills that made him perfectly suited to the establishment of the FIA\".<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 107.</ref> The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), founded in 1904 was FISA's parent body, representing road car users worldwide.

His nomination was blocked by French, Italian and German manufacturers.<ref>Lovell (2004), pp. 105\u2013107.</ref>\n \nIn the early 1980s, Mosley represented FOCA in the \"[[FISA\u2013FOCA war]]\", a conflict between FOCA, representing the mainly UK-based independent teams, and FISA, which was supported by the \"[[grandee]]\" constructors owned by road car manufacturers (primarily [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Renault]]). In 1980, FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non-championship [[1981 South African Grand Prix]]. The staging of this event, with worldwide television coverage, helped persuade [[Jean-Marie Balestre]], the FISA president, that FISA would have to negotiate a settlement with FOCA. As Mosley has since commented: \"We were absolutely [[wiktionary:skint|skint]]. If Balestre could have held the manufacturer's support for a little bit longer, the constructors would have been on their knees. The outcome would then have been very different.\"<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 142.</ref> Mosley helped draw up the [[Concorde Agreement]], a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of commercial and television rights. The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007, and a new one was being discussed, as of 2008. In 1982, the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed, Mosley left his role at FOCA, and Formula One, to work for the Conservative Party.<ref name=Lovell82-86>Lovell (2004), pp. 230\u2013231.</ref>\n\n==FISA presidency==\n{{Main|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile}}\nMosley returned to motorsport in 1986, with the support of Ecclestone and Balestre, to become president of the FISA Manufacturers' Commission, the successor body to the BPICA with a seat on the FISA World Council.

Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new [[digital television]] technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said \"My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long.\"<ref name=Lovell254>Lovell (2004), pp. 254\u2013256.</ref> The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15&nbsp;years,<ref name=Lovell254 /> An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission.<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 269.</ref> Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams.

The resulting warning letters from van Miert to the FIA and Ecclestone were leaked and ended the attempt to float F1; the FIA won a case against the Commission for the leak in 1998.<ref>Lovell (2004), pp. 289\u2013292.</ref>\n \nAt the same time, a local court in Germany ruled that the television rights to the FIA [[European Truck Racing]] Cup (passed to Ecclestone by the FIA the previous year, along with all other FIA authorised championships) should be returned to the series organiser, following a complaint from German television company AE TV-Cooperations. The TV Company argued that Ecclestone and Mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the Treaty of Rome; following the court's decision Mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further notice. On appeal, the court ruled that the series organiser should be able to sell the television rights to whoever they felt was the best option for coverage and the FIA reinstated the European Truck Racing Cup.\nBetween 1997 and 2000 Mosley repeatedly warned that if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement to the media and held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission's case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competitive and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.<ref name=\"eur-lex.europa.eu\">{{cite web|title=Notice published pursuant to Article 19(3) of Council Regulation No 17 concerning Cases COMP/35.163 Notification of FIA Regulations, COMP/36.638 Notification by FIA/FOA of agreements relating to the FIA Formula One World Championship, COMP/36.776 GTR/FIA & others|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2001:169:0005:0011:EN:PDF|publisher=Official Journal of the European Communities|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=1 May 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107071920/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2001:169:0005:0011:EN:PDF |archivedate=6 January 2016}}</ref>\n \nMosley came up with an innovative way to dispose of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300&nbsp;million (\u00a3150&nbsp;million).<ref name=\"eur-lex.europa.eu\" />\nThe FIA planned to \"put almost all of it into a charitable foundation which will then have the resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety\",<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/26496/mosley-explains-tv-rights-sale/|title=Mosley explains TV rights sale|date=28 May 2001|publisher=GPUpdate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714232840/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/26496/mosley-explains-tv-rights-sale/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> and thus the FIA Foundation was created in 2001.

Before the settlement with the EU Commission was reached, Mosley feared that the FIA was losing control over the sport following a heated argument with Ecclestone in Paris. Ecclestone argued that he had built Formula One into the entity that it was and the FIA only had rights to designate the event as official. Ecclestone threatened to \"do a [[scorched earth]]\" if another party were to gain control of the commercial side of Formula One.

The FIA is also the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for [[Formula One]] and other international [[auto racing|motorsports]].\n \nA [[barrister]] and former amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of [[March Engineering]], a racing car constructor and Formula One racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters for the company between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the [[Formula One Constructors' Association]] (FOCA), the body that represents Formula One constructors. Together with [[Bernie Ecclestone]] he represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings with race organisers. In 1978, Mosley became the official legal adviser to FOCA. In this role he and Marco Piccinini negotiated the first version of the [[Concorde Agreement]], which settled [[FISA\u2013FOCA war|a long-standing dispute]] between FOCA and the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of Formula One. Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA, FISA's parent body, in 1993.\n\nMosley identified his major achievement as FIA President as the promotion of the [[Euro NCAP|European New Car Assessment Programme]] (Euro NCAP or Encap). He has also promoted increased safety and the use of green technologies in motor racing. In 2008, stories about his sex life appeared in the British press, along with unfounded allegations regarding Nazi connotations. Mosley successfully sued the newspaper that published the allegations and maintained his position as FIA president. He stood down at the end of his term in 2009 and was replaced by his preferred successor, [[Jean Todt]].\n \nMosley is the youngest son of [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]], former leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]],  and [[Diana Mitford]]. He was educated in France, Germany, and Britain before going on to attend university at [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he graduated with a degree in physics. He then changed to law and was [[called to the bar]] in 1964. In his teens and early twenties, Mosley was involved with his father's post-war political party, the [[Union Movement]] (UM). He has said that the association of his surname with fascism stopped him from developing his interest in politics further, although he briefly worked for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the early 1980s.\n\nMosley is the subject of Michael Shevloff's 2020 biographical documentary ''Mosley''<ref>{{cite news |title=New Mosley film includes segments he \"would've cut\" |publisher=Motorsport Network |accessdate=24 January 2020 |url=https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/mosley-documentary-release-date-revealing/4676225/?nrt=54 |archivedate=21 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Family and early life==\nMax Mosley was born on 13 April 1940<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/max-mosley-mosley-the-grand-machinator-of-formula-one-96759.html|title=Max Mosley: Mosley the grand machinator of Formula One|last=Viner|first=Brian|date=19 July 2003|website=The Independent|language=en|url-status=live|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> in London, in the early years of the [[Second World War]].

Mosley was attracted by the sport, and once qualified as a barrister, began teaching law in the evenings to earn enough money to start racing cars himself.<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 13.</ref> The sport's indifference to his background appealed to Mosley:\n \n{{quote|There was always a certain amount of trouble [being the son of Sir Oswald] until I came into motor racing.

In 1968, he formed the London Racing Team in partnership with driver Chris Lambert to compete in European [[Formula Two]], which at that time was the level of racing just below Formula One. Their cars were prepared by [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]], later a Formula One team owner. It was a dangerous time to race.

The name March is an acronym based on the initials of the founders; the 'M' stands for Mosley.<ref name=face2face/> Like the other founders, Mosley put in \u00a32,500 of capital. His father told him that the company \"would certainly go bankrupt, but it would be good training for something serious later on.\"<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 18.</ref>\n \nMosley played a key role in publicising the new outfit. Although March had few resources and limited experience, the firm announced ambitious plans to enter Formula One, the pinnacle of single-seater racing, in 1970. The team had initially intended to enter a single car, but by the beginning of the season (partly due to deals made by Mosley), the number of March cars entered for their first Formula One race had risen to five. Two of these were run by March's own in-house [[wiktionary:factory team|works team]] and the rest by customer teams.<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 22\u201327.</ref> Mosley also negotiated [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]] from tyre maker [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] and [[oil additive]] manufacturer [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]].<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 23, 30.</ref>\n \nThe new operation was initially successful. In Formula One, March cars won three of their first four races. One of these was a world championship race, the [[1970 Spanish Grand Prix]], won by reigning world champion [[Jackie Stewart]] in a customer car run by [[Tyrrell Racing]]. As a result, March finished third in the 1970 [[List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions|Constructors' Championship]]. The factory also sold 40 cars to customers in various lower formulae. Despite these successes, the organisation got into financial difficulty almost immediately. The Formula One operation was costing more than the customer car business was making. The March works team's contract with its lead driver, [[Chris Amon]], was expensive, and Mosley, in his own words, \"tried at every opportunity to get rid of him\".<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 34.</ref> He reasoned that Stewart's highly competitive customer car was enough to show March in a good light. Amon stayed to the end of the year, but Mosley succeeded in \"restructuring\" his contract, saving the company some much-needed money.<ref>Henry (1989), p. 40.</ref> At the end of the season, Mosley successfully demanded full control of the finances, including the factory run by Coaker, who left shortly afterwards. Mosley and Herd borrowed \u00a320,000 from relatives and friends to support the company into its second year. According to Lovell the money came from Mosley's half-brother, [[Jonathan Guinness, 3rd Baron Moyne|Jonathan Guinness]].<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 119.</ref>\n \nTyrrell started making its own cars towards the end of 1970, and March's 1971 program in Formula One was much reduced, with no recognised front-running driver. The Firestone and STP sponsorship was insufficient and Mosley failed to attract a large backer for 1971. Motorsport author Mike Lawrence has suggested that the shortfall forced him into short-term deals, which maintained cashflow, but were not in the best long-term interests of the company.<ref name=\"Lawrence 1989 p.46\">Lawrence (1989), p. 46.</ref> Mosley negotiated a deal for the team to use [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] engines in a third car, bringing much needed funding. The engines proved uncompetitive, and his hopes of an ongoing partnership with the Italian automobile manufacturer were not met.<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 54\u201359.</ref> Nonetheless, March again finished third in the constructors championship, and works driver [[Ronnie Peterson]], in a [[Cosworth DFV]]-powered car, was second in the [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|Drivers' Championship]]. March's financial woes continued: the company had lost \u00a371,000 at the end of 1971. Mosley and Rees disagreed over how to rectify the situation and Rees left March early in 1972.<ref>Henry (1989), p. 64.</ref>\n[[File:March 2-4-0 Louwman Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Mosley pushed for the unusual six-wheeled [[March 2-4-0]] designed by Robin Herd to be built because of its significant aerodynamic and other advantages. The car never raced, however sales of models of the car are said to make it the most profitable car the company ever made.<ref name=6wheel />]]\n \nMarch was more successful in selling large numbers of customer cars in the lower formulae. Mosley organised extensive test sessions for the 1971 cars for journalists and drivers, and arranged a successful scheme for drivers to rent cars and engines for the season, rather than buying them outright.<ref name=\"Lawrence 1989 p.46\"/> Losing money on a deal to supply [[Jochen Neerpasch]], then motorsport manager at Ford, with a Formula Two car paid off when Neerpasch moved to [[BMW in motorsport|BMW]] and offered March an exclusive deal to use BMW's Formula Two engine for the 1973 season.<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 70.</ref> March cars powered by BMW engines won five of the next 11 European Formula Two championships.<ref>Lawrence (1989), pp. 238\u2013251.</ref> However, BMW also put pressure on Herd to concentrate on the Formula Two programme. As a result, he spent less time with the Formula One team, where Mosley started to act as a [[race engineer]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n \nAlthough March considered quitting Formula One on several occasions, money was always found to support at least one car. Motorsport historian Mike Lawrence credits Mosley with pressing for a six-wheeled March to be built as a draw for sponsors, having seen the popularity with fans of Tyrrell's six-wheeled [[Tyrrell P34|P34]]. The resulting [[March 2-4-0]] never competed in Formula One, but generated the required publicity and a [[Scalextric]] [[slotcar racing|slotcar]] model was profitable.<ref name=6wheel>Lawrence (1989), pp. 113\u2013115.</ref> Mosley spent much of his time negotiating deals for drivers with sponsorship and was also successful in selling Marches to other Formula One teams, such as [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] and [[Penske Racing|Penske]]. The cars were rarely frontrunners, although the works team won a single race in both 1975 and 1976. By the end of 1977, Mosley was fed up with the struggle to compete in Formula One with no resources and left to work for FOCA full-time, selling his shares in the company to Herd but remaining as a director. March's involvement in Formula One ended the same year.{{efn|March works teams returned to Formula One in 1981\u20131982 and 1987\u20131992 (as [[Leyton House Racing]] in 1990 and 1991).}}<ref>Lawrence (1989), p. 122.</ref>\n\n\n==Formula One Constructors' Association==\n{{Main|Formula One Constructors' Association}}\n \nFrom 1969, Mosley was invited to represent March at the Grand Prix Constructors' Association (GPCA), which negotiated joint deals on behalf of its member teams. Although the new March organisation was not popular with the established teams, Mosley has said that \"when they went along to meetings to discuss things such as prize money, they felt they ought to take me along because I was a lawyer\".<ref name=FOCA1>Lawrence (1989), p. 33.</ref> He was unimpressed with the standard of negotiations: \"our side all went in a group because no-one trusted anyone else and all were afraid that someone would break ranks and make a private deal.\"<ref name=FOCA1/> In 1971, British businessman [[Bernie Ecclestone]] bought the [[Brabham]] team, and Mosley recalls that: {{quote|Within about 20&nbsp;minutes of [Ecclestone] turning up at the [GPCA] meeting, it was apparent that here was someone who knew how many beans made five and after about half an hour he moved round the table to sit next to me, and from then on he and I started operating as a team. Within a very short time, the two of us were doing everything for the GPCA, instead of everyone moving around in a block, and from that developed FOCA.<ref name=FOCA1/>}}\n \nThe [[Formula One Constructors' Association]] (FOCA) was created in 1974 by Ecclestone, [[Colin Chapman]], [[Teddy Mayer]], Mosley, [[Ken Tyrrell]] and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]]. FOCA would represent the commercial interests of the teams at meetings with the Commission Sportive Internationale (CSI) a commission of  the FIA and motorsport's world governing body. The CSI later became the  [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA), motorsport's world governing body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-eccber.html|title=People: Bernie Ecclestone|accessdate=30 January 2008|publisher=GrandPrix.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128192017/http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/cref-eccber.html|archive-date=28 January 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> After leaving March at the end of {{f1|1977}}, Mosley officially became legal advisor to FOCA, which was led by Ecclestone. In his biography of Ecclestone, Terry Lovell suggests that he appointed Mosley to this role not only because of his legal ability, but also because he \"saw in Mosley the necessary diplomatic and political skills that made him perfectly suited to the establishment of the FIA\".<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 107.</ref> The [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), founded in 1904 was FISA's parent body, representing road car users worldwide. In the same year, Mosley was nominated for a role at the FIA's Bureau Permanent International de Constructeurs d'Automobile (BPICA). His nomination was blocked by French, Italian and German manufacturers.<ref>Lovell (2004), pp. 105\u2013107.</ref>\n \nIn the early 1980s, Mosley represented FOCA in the \"[[FISA\u2013FOCA war]]\", a conflict between FOCA, representing the mainly UK-based independent teams, and FISA, which was supported by the \"[[grandee]]\" constructors owned by road car manufacturers (primarily [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Ferrari]] and [[Renault]]). In 1980, FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non-championship [[1981 South African Grand Prix]]. The staging of this event, with worldwide television coverage, helped persuade [[Jean-Marie Balestre]], the FISA president, that FISA would have to negotiate a settlement with FOCA. As Mosley has since commented: \"We were absolutely [[wiktionary:skint|skint]]. If Balestre could have held the manufacturer's support for a little bit longer, the constructors would have been on their knees. The outcome would then have been very different.\"<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 142.</ref> Mosley helped draw up the [[Concorde Agreement]], a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of commercial and television rights. The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007, and a new one was being discussed, as of 2008. In 1982, the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed, Mosley left his role at FOCA, and Formula One, to work for the Conservative Party.<ref name=Lovell82-86>Lovell (2004), pp. 230\u2013231.</ref>\n\n==FISA presidency==\n{{Main|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile}}\nMosley returned to motorsport in 1986, with the support of Ecclestone and Balestre, to become president of the FISA Manufacturers' Commission, the successor body to the BPICA with a seat on the FISA World Council. That same year, he established [[Simtek|Simtek Research]], a racing technical consultancy firm, with [[Nick Wirth]], a former March employee. He sold his share of Simtek in 1991, when elected president of the FISA.<ref>Lovell (2004), pp. 230\u2013231, 245\u2013246.</ref> According to Lovell, in 1987 Mosley suggested to Balestre that he could deal with his problems with Ecclestone by \"mak[ing] him a member of the establishment\". Later that year Ecclestone was appointed a vice-president of the FIA with responsibility for promotional affairs, with authority over Formula One and the other motor sports authorised by the FIA.<ref>Lovell (2004), pp. 226\u2013227.</ref>\n \nIn 1991, Mosley challenged Balestre for the presidency of FISA.

Ecclestone had been building up Formula One as a television package since the early 1990s, investing heavily in new [[digital television]] technology. For the duration of the deal, the FIA would receive an index-linked annual fixed royalty, estimated by Lovell at around 15%. Mosley said \"My belief is that I got a better deal than anyone else could have because it was more difficult for Ecclestone to take a hard line with me as we had worked together for so long.\"<ref name=Lovell254>Lovell (2004), pp. 254\u2013256.</ref> The following year the FIA also passed the rights to all its other directly sanctioned championships and events to Ecclestone, also for 15&nbsp;years,<ref name=Lovell254 /> An attempt to add a 10-year extension to the F1 contract in return for a share in Ecclestone's proposed flotation of Formula One was later vetoed by the European Commission.<ref>Lovell (2004), p. 269.</ref> Mosley's agreement with Ecclestone on TV rights for F1 angered three of the team principals in particular: Ron Dennis (McLaren), Frank Williams (Williams) and Ken Tyrrell (Tyrrell), who felt that neither Ecclestone nor the FIA had the right to make such an agreement without the teams.

The resulting warning letters from van Miert to the FIA and Ecclestone were leaked and ended the attempt to float F1; the FIA won a case against the Commission for the leak in 1998.<ref>Lovell (2004), pp. 289\u2013292.</ref>\n \nAt the same time, a local court in Germany ruled that the television rights to the FIA [[European Truck Racing]] Cup (passed to Ecclestone by the FIA the previous year, along with all other FIA authorised championships) should be returned to the series organiser, following a complaint from German television company AE TV-Cooperations. The TV Company argued that Ecclestone and Mosley were in breach of commercial clauses in the Treaty of Rome; following the court's decision Mosley appealed the judgement and cancelled the series until further notice. On appeal, the court ruled that the series organiser should be able to sell the television rights to whoever they felt was the best option for coverage and the FIA reinstated the European Truck Racing Cup.\nBetween 1997 and 2000 Mosley repeatedly warned that if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a Statement of Objections, listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement to the media and held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission's case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competitive and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.<ref name=\"eur-lex.europa.eu\">{{cite web|title=Notice published pursuant to Article 19(3) of Council Regulation No 17 concerning Cases COMP/35.163 Notification of FIA Regulations, COMP/36.638 Notification by FIA/FOA of agreements relating to the FIA Formula One World Championship, COMP/36.776 GTR/FIA & others|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2001:169:0005:0011:EN:PDF|publisher=Official Journal of the European Communities|date=13 June 2001|accessdate=1 May 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107071920/http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2001:169:0005:0011:EN:PDF |archivedate=6 January 2016}}</ref>\n \nMosley came up with an innovative way to dispose of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300&nbsp;million (\u00a3150&nbsp;million).<ref name=\"eur-lex.europa.eu\" />\nThe FIA planned to \"put almost all of it into a charitable foundation which will then have the resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety\",<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/26496/mosley-explains-tv-rights-sale/|title=Mosley explains TV rights sale|date=28 May 2001|publisher=GPUpdate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714232840/http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/26496/mosley-explains-tv-rights-sale/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|access-date=1 May 2019}}</ref> and thus the FIA Foundation was created in 2001.

Before the settlement with the EU Commission was reached, Mosley feared that the FIA was losing control over the sport following a heated argument with Ecclestone in Paris. Ecclestone argued that he had built Formula One into the entity that it was and the FIA only had rights to designate the event as official. Ecclestone threatened to \"do a [[scorched earth]]\" if another party were to gain control of the commercial side of Formula One. Mosley came up with the solution in order for the FIA to retain its sporting management role and Ecclestone to retain his commercial role.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tom |last=Bower |title=No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone |pages=245\u2013247}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve 1996.jpg|thumb|left|From the late 1960s to the early 2000s, F1 teams were heavily dependent on funding from cigarette companies like [[Rothmans International plc|Rothmans]].

The cemetery was created in 1867 and dedicated in 1871, and overlooks [[Lake Champlain]].  It is near the current campus of [[Burlington High School (Vermont)|Burlington High School]].\n\n==Details==\nLakeview Cemetery is a non-denominational cemetery owned by the city of Burlington.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The cemetery's [[Howard Mortuary Chapel|Louisa Howard Chapel]] is available for rent, and is frequently used for marriage ceremonies, funerals, memorial services, music recitals, and other functions.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The city government's management of the cemetery is aided by the Friends of Lakeview Cemetery, a group formed in the early 1990s to plan improvements to the cemetery buildings and grounds and raise money to carry them out.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==History==\nLakeview Cemetery was established in 1867 when the city of Burlington purchased 23 acres of land from H. B. Sawyer for $3,500 (about $65,000 in 2019).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  In 1868, the city purchased an additional seven from J. A. Arthur for $2,000 (about $38,000 in 2019).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nThe cemetery was planned in the [[rural cemetery]] style that became popular in the mid 1800s.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Located at what was then the outskirts of the city and situated near the end of the city's [[tram|trolley car line]], Lakeview included many of the attributes of a park.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Its narrow, meandering roads, benches, and [[Ornamental plant|specimen trees]] helped make it an outdoor destination for city dwellers, who visited for picnics and other activities.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nIn the 1880s, philanthropist Louisa Howard financed the construction of a small church on the cemetery grounds.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  When the stone [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic Revival]] building was dedicated in 1882, it was named in her honor.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The [[Howard Mortuary Chapel|Louisa Howard Chapel]] fell into disuse during the 1940s, but in the 1990s a group of interested individuals formed Friends of Lakeview Cemetery, which raised funds to refurbish it.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  By 2004, the group had raised $100,000, and the chapel underwent a restoration that was completed in 2006.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Other improvements and restorations undertaken by Friends of Lakeview Cemetery include construction of a new gazebo in 2010 to replace an original that had fallen into disrepair.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The new cedar wood gazebo was crafted by hand in the 19th Century [[Adirondack Architecture]] style so that it resembled the original.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nLakeview's grounds included three fountains that were donated in the 1870s by John P. Howard (Louisa Howard's brother).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}} In 2014, Friends of Lakeview Cemetery completed restoration of the fountains, using the remnants of the originals and a photo from a vintage postcard for reference.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==Interments==\nBurials at Lakeview Cemetery include veterans of every major conflict since the [[American Civil War]], including several members of the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]], a Union Army regiment of [[African American]] soldiers and white officers.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Several soldiers who served at nearby [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in the late 1800s and early 1900s are buried at Lakeview, including members of the famed [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]] (Buffalo Soldiers).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==Notable burials==\nMany notable political and military leaders and other prominent individuals are interred at Lakeview Cemetery, to include:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Harold J.

The cemetery was created in 1867 and dedicated in 1871, and overlooks [[Lake Champlain]].  It is near the current campus of [[Burlington High School (Vermont)|Burlington High School]].\n\n==Details==\nLakeview Cemetery is a non-denominational cemetery owned by the city of Burlington.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The cemetery's [[Howard Mortuary Chapel|Louisa Howard Chapel]] is available for rent, and is frequently used for marriage ceremonies, funerals, memorial services, music recitals, and other functions.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The city government's management of the cemetery is aided by the Friends of Lakeview Cemetery, a group formed in the early 1990s to plan improvements to the cemetery buildings and grounds and raise money to carry them out.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==History==\nLakeview Cemetery was established in 1867 when the city of Burlington purchased 23 acres of land from H. B. Sawyer for $3,500 (about $65,000 in 2019).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  In 1868, the city purchased an additional seven from J. A. Arthur for $2,000 (about $38,000 in 2019).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nThe cemetery was planned in the [[rural cemetery]] style that became popular in the mid 1800s.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Located at what was then the outskirts of the city and situated near the end of the city's [[tram|trolley car line]], Lakeview included many of the attributes of a park.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Its narrow, meandering roads, benches, and [[Ornamental plant|specimen trees]] helped make it an outdoor destination for city dwellers, who visited for picnics and other activities.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nIn the 1880s, philanthropist Louisa Howard financed the construction of a small church on the cemetery grounds.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  When the stone [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Gothic Revival]] building was dedicated in 1882, it was named in her honor.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The [[Howard Mortuary Chapel|Louisa Howard Chapel]] fell into disuse during the 1940s, but in the 1990s a group of interested individuals formed Friends of Lakeview Cemetery, which raised funds to refurbish it.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  By 2004, the group had raised $100,000, and the chapel underwent a restoration that was completed in 2006.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Other improvements and restorations undertaken by Friends of Lakeview Cemetery include construction of a new gazebo in 2010 to replace an original that had fallen into disrepair.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  The new cedar wood gazebo was crafted by hand in the 19th Century [[Adirondack Architecture]] style so that it resembled the original.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\nLakeview's grounds included three fountains that were donated in the 1870s by John P. Howard (Louisa Howard's brother).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}} In 2014, Friends of Lakeview Cemetery completed restoration of the fountains, using the remnants of the originals and a photo from a vintage postcard for reference.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==Interments==\nBurials at Lakeview Cemetery include veterans of every major conflict since the [[American Civil War]], including several members of the [[54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment]], a Union Army regiment of [[African American]] soldiers and white officers.{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}  Several soldiers who served at nearby [[Fort Ethan Allen]] in the late 1800s and early 1900s are buried at Lakeview, including members of the famed [[10th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|10th Cavalry Regiment]] (Buffalo Soldiers).{{sfn|\"More than a burial ground\"}}\n\n==Notable burials==\nMany notable political and military leaders and other prominent individuals are interred at Lakeview Cemetery, to include:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Harold J.

In the 1970s and 80s he was a founding member of the influential [[neo-expressionist]] art movement [[Neue Wilde]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] alongside [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Markus L\u00fcpertz]], and his brother [[Albert Oehlen]]. \n\n==Biography==\nOehlen studied at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] ([[Alfonso H\u00fcppi]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} His is formative participant of the German art movement [[Neue Wilde]], which was especially active in Germany during the 1980s, and used a [[Punk subculture|punk]] style that stood in opposition to [[minimalism]]. The aim was to attack the high-browed nature of minimalism with a style of painting that is based on instinct and gesturally emphasizes the wild, spontaneous, obsessive and sensual. \n\nOehlen has continuously developed his work and, in parallel with painting, also works on sculptures and musical projects. His new works are increasingly inspired by the perceptual experiments of [[Op Art]], with printed image interferences that occur in grid-like patterns above and below the layers of the picture. Along with forms that are oriented toward computer aesthetics, this brings an aspect of serialism to the images. It can be understood as a humorous and ironic commentary on the expressive nature of painting and \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 on the Neuen Wilden movement itself. Markus Oehlen's complex, layered pictures are composed of a plethora of found images, shapes and distorted painterly elements which, taken out of their previous context, take on a new function and meaning. By rearranging the individual compositional elements of the canvasses in the context of art, Oehlen creates surreal still lifes that were not originally so intended, playing with the notion of randomness and suggesting strange narratives. The pictures on large canvasses convince through their radical approach to painting.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 1977 he meet [[Martin Kippenberger]]. He took part at the group exhibition [[Von hier aus \u2013 Zwei Monate neue deutsche Kunst in D\u00fcsseldorf]] in 1984.

In the 1970s and 80s he was a founding member of the influential [[neo-expressionist]] art movement [[Neue Wilde]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] alongside [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Markus L\u00fcpertz]], and his brother [[Albert Oehlen]]. \n\n==Biography==\nOehlen studied at the [[Kunstakademie D\u00fcsseldorf]] ([[Alfonso H\u00fcppi]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} His is formative participant of the German art movement [[Neue Wilde]], which was especially active in Germany during the 1980s, and used a [[Punk subculture|punk]] style that stood in opposition to [[minimalism]]. The aim was to attack the high-browed nature of minimalism with a style of painting that is based on instinct and gesturally emphasizes the wild, spontaneous, obsessive and sensual. \n\nOehlen has continuously developed his work and, in parallel with painting, also works on sculptures and musical projects. His new works are increasingly inspired by the perceptual experiments of [[Op Art]], with printed image interferences that occur in grid-like patterns above and below the layers of the picture. Along with forms that are oriented toward computer aesthetics, this brings an aspect of serialism to the images. It can be understood as a humorous and ironic commentary on the expressive nature of painting and \u2013 in retrospect \u2013 on the Neuen Wilden movement itself. Markus Oehlen's complex, layered pictures are composed of a plethora of found images, shapes and distorted painterly elements which, taken out of their previous context, take on a new function and meaning. By rearranging the individual compositional elements of the canvasses in the context of art, Oehlen creates surreal still lifes that were not originally so intended, playing with the notion of randomness and suggesting strange narratives. The pictures on large canvasses convince through their radical approach to painting.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 1977 he meet [[Martin Kippenberger]]. He took part at the group exhibition [[Von hier aus \u2013 Zwei Monate neue deutsche Kunst in D\u00fcsseldorf]] in 1984. He exhibited 1993 at [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York: \u201eProjects 39\u201c \u2013 with Georg Herold.\n\nOehlen was founding member of the bands [[Mittagspause]], [[Fehlfarben]], [[Flying Klassenfeind]], [[Vielleichtors]], and [[Van Oehlen]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He played with [[Red Krayola]].

The Team consists of a Head Boy, a Head Girl, three Deputy School Captains and six School Captains, who serve from Christmas of Year 12 until the following Christmas of Year 13, or in effect, a calendar year. There are also approximately 50 prefects led by the Head Prefect, who is one of the eleven members of the School Captains Team, along with several senior prefects.

This was extended, replacing the conservatories, then expanded further with the construction of the atrium block, which currently houses the English faculty, opened in February 1997.\n\nDuring the academic year 2001/2002 the school was extended out and up from the old Manor to facilitate English, Drama, Psychology and Music, as old mobile classrooms were removed from the site for refurbishment and a lease renewal.\n\nIn 2002 construction on a new Maths block (\"M\") began. The work was completed in August to be unveiled in the new academic year 2002/2003. This building houses one large first floor room used as an exam room and Sixth Form study area.\n\nIn December 2006 new accommodation for art students was finally ready and opened by local artist [[Billy Childish]]. Consisting of a Skylab-style structure, it was built on stilts above the existing design technology (\"D\") block, and includes a disabled lift, the first in the school.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Art block of Chatham Grammar Boys.jpg|The new art block, and below, the [[Design Technology|DT]] block\nFile:M block of Chatham Grammar Boys.jpg|M block (Maths block)\n</gallery>\n\n==Former pupils==\n* [[Stel Pavlou]], author, screenwriter\n* [[Lee Ryan]], singer-songwriter and member of [[Blue (English band)|Blue]]<ref>{{citenews|title=Chatham's Lee Ryan bidding for Eurovision glory|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/news/chathams-lee-ryan-bidding-for-e-a74922/|publisher=[[KentOnline]]|date=12 May 2011|first=Danny|last=Boyle}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Smalling]], footballer<ref>{{citenews|title=Chris Smalling: 'Next thing I knew I was meeting Sir Alex.

Another one of the School Captains is the House Captain and is responsible for overseeing house events within the School{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Houses ===\nThere are four school houses, all named after ships constructed at the historic [[Chatham Dockyard]] located nearby. \n*{{colour box|blue}} ''[[HMS Guardian (1932)|Guardian]]'' \n*{{colour box|yellow}} ''[[HMS Shannon (1906)|Shannon]]'' \n*{{colour box|red}} ''[[HMS Conquest (1915)|Conquest]]'' \n*{{colour box|purple}} ''[[HMS Barfleur (1768)|Barfleur]]'' \nThe houses compete against each other at events like the school's annual summer Sports Day, the autumn Cross Country, sports events such as [[rugby union|rugby]] and [[field hockey|hockey]], and also at tasks like collecting the most 'rewards', to obtain the House Shield trophy.\n{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Buildings==\nThe school comprises several buildings, most notably the former Holcombe Manor. This was extended, replacing the conservatories, then expanded further with the construction of the atrium block, which currently houses the English faculty, opened in February 1997.\n\nDuring the academic year 2001/2002 the school was extended out and up from the old Manor to facilitate English, Drama, Psychology and Music, as old mobile classrooms were removed from the site for refurbishment and a lease renewal.\n\nIn 2002 construction on a new Maths block (\"M\") began. The work was completed in August to be unveiled in the new academic year 2002/2003. This building houses one large first floor room used as an exam room and Sixth Form study area.\n\nIn December 2006 new accommodation for art students was finally ready and opened by local artist [[Billy Childish]]. Consisting of a Skylab-style structure, it was built on stilts above the existing design technology (\"D\") block, and includes a disabled lift, the first in the school.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Art block of Chatham Grammar Boys.jpg|The new art block, and below, the [[Design Technology|DT]] block\nFile:M block of Chatham Grammar Boys.jpg|M block (Maths block)\n</gallery>\n\n==Former pupils==\n* [[Stel Pavlou]], author, screenwriter\n* [[Lee Ryan]], singer-songwriter and member of [[Blue (English band)|Blue]]<ref>{{citenews|title=Chatham's Lee Ryan bidding for Eurovision glory|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/medway/news/chathams-lee-ryan-bidding-for-e-a74922/|publisher=[[KentOnline]]|date=12 May 2011|first=Danny|last=Boyle}}</ref>\n* [[Chris Smalling]], footballer<ref>{{citenews|title=Chris Smalling: 'Next thing I knew I was meeting Sir Alex.

[[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.\n\nThe [[National Bank of Canada]]'s Tim Simard, argued that WCS is the benchmark for those buying shares in Canadian oil sands companies, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., or Cenovus Energy Inc., Northern Blizzard Resources Inc., Pengrowth Energy Corp., or Twin Butte Energy Ltd or others where a \"big part of their exposure will be to heavy crude\u201d.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nThe price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil (petroleum) per barrel{{sfn|Index Mundi|nd}} suffers a differential{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI){{sfn|Department of Energy|2012}} as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) as published by [[Bloomberg Media]], which itself has a discount versus London-traded Brent oil.{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} This is based on data on prices and differentials from [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ).\n\n\"West Texas Intermediate Crude oil (WTI) is a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] for the North American market, and [[Edmonton Par]] and Western Canadian Select (WCS) are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and WTI are high-quality low sulphur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40\u00b0. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5\u00b0.\"{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}\n\n[[West Texas Intermediate]] WTI is a sweet, [[light crude oil]], with an [[API gravity]] of around 39.6 and [[specific gravity]] of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a [[sweet crude oil]] (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\n\"WCS prices at a discount to WTI because it is a lower quality crude (3.51Wt. percent sulfur and 20.5 API gravity){{sfn|Moore|2011}} and because of a transportation differential. The price of WCS is currently set at the U.S. Gulf Coast. It costs approximately $10/bbl for a barrel of crude to be transported from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, accounting for at least $10/bbl of the WTI-WCS discount. Pipeline constraints can also cause the transportation differential to rise significantly.\n\nBy March 2015, with the price of Ice Brent at US$60.55, and WTI at US$51.48, up US$1.10 from the previous day, WCS also rose US$1.20 to US$37.23 with a WTI-WCS price differential of US$14.25.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015}}{{rp|B10-11}} By 2 June 2015 with Brent at US$64.88/bbl, WTI at US$60.19/bbl and WCS at US$52.39/bbl.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Financial Post]]'', most Canadian investors continued to quote the price of WTI not WCS even though many Canadian oilsands producers sell at WCS prices, because WCS \"has always lacked the transparency and liquidity necessary to make it a household name with investors in the country\".{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} In 2014 Auspice created the Canadian Crude Excess Return Index to gauge WCS futures. Tim Simard, head of commodities at the ''[[National Bank of Canada]]'', claims \"WCS has \"some interesting different fundamental attributes than the conventional WTI barrel.\" WCS has \"better transparency and broader participation\" than Maya. However, he explained that in 2015 \"one of the only ways to take a position in oil is to use an ETF that is tied to WTI.\"{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} Simard claims that when the global price of oil is lower, for example, \"the first barrels to be turned off in a low-price environment are heavy barrels\" making WCS \"closer to the floor\" than WTI.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nIn order to address the transparency and liquidity issues facing WCS, Auspice created the [[Canadian Crude Index]] (CCI), which serves as a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for [[Petroleum production in Canada|oil produced in Canada]].<ref name=\"CCIbenchmark\">{{cite web |url=http://boereport.com/2016/01/04/auspice-capital-advisors-launches-first-live-index-tied-to-canadian-crude-oil/  |date=2016-01-04 |title=Auspice Capital Advisors Launches First Live Index Tied to Canadian Crude Oil}}</ref> The CCI allows investors to track the price, risk and [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the Canadian commodity.<ref name=\"CCIbenchmark\" /> The CCI can be used to identify opportunities to speculate outright on the price of Canadian crude oil or in conjunction with [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) to put on a spread trade which could represent the differential between the two.<ref name=\"factsheet\">{{cite web |url=http://content.auspicecapital.com/AuspiceCCIFactSheet2015.pdf |date=2015 |title=Fact sheet |work=Auspice Capital Advisors |access-date=29 December 2018 |location=Calgary, Alberta}}</ref> The CCI provides a fixed price reference for Canadian Crude Oil by targeting  an exposure that represents a three-month rolling position in crude oil.<ref name=\"threemonthrolling\">{{cite web |url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53a1ca9ce4b030ded763dbc2/t/55260223e4b0805894981ebb/1428554275298/Canadian+Crude+Excess+Return+Index+Methodology+3.0.1.pdf |title=Canadian Crude Excess Return Index (CCIER) Methodology |date=April 2015 |pages=7 |work=Auspice Capital Advisors |access-date=29 December 2018 |location=Calgary, Alberta }}</ref> To create a price representative of Canadian crude the index uses two futures contracts: A fixed price contract, which represents the price of crude oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], and a basis differential contract, which represents the difference in price between Cushing and [[Hardisty]], Alberta.<ref name=\"threemonthrolling\" /> Both contracts are priced in U.S. dollars per barrel.

In his presentation to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2013 John Foran demonstrated that Maya had traded at only a slight premium to WCS in 2010. Since then WCS price differentials widened \"with rising oil sands and tight oil production and insufficient pipeline capacity to access global markets\".{{Sfn|Foran|2013}} Mexico enjoys a location discount with its proximity to the heavy oil-capable refineries in the Gulf Coast. As well, Mexico began to strategically and successfully seek out joint venture refinery partnerships in the 1990s to create a market for its heavy crude oil in the U.S. Gulf. In 1993, ([[Pemex|Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos]], the state-owned Mexican oil company) and Shell Oil Company agreed on a joint US$1 billion refinery upgrading construction project which led to the construction of a new coker, hydrotreating unit, sulfur recovery unit and other facilities in Deer Park, Texas on the Houston Ship Channel in order to process large volumes of PEMEX heavy Maya crude while fulfilling the U.S. Clean Air Act requirements.{{sfn|PR|1993}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Year || <!-- 2007 --> 2007 || <!-- 2008 --> 2008 || <!-- 2009 --> 2009 || <!-- 2010 --> 2010 || <!-- 2011 --> 2011 || <!-- 2012 --> 2012 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 2013-02 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 2013-04-24 || <!-- August 2013 --> 2013-08 || <!-- December 2013 --> 2013-12 || <!-- January 2014 -->2014-01 || <!-- April 2014 -->2014-04||<!-- December 2014 -->2014-12 ||<!-- June 2015-06 -->2015-06\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->Brent US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 --> 73 || <!-- 2008 --> 98 || <!-- 2009 --> 62 || <!-- 2010 -->  80 || <!-- 2011 --> 112 || <!-- 2012 --> 112 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 118 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 103.41 || <!-- August 2013 --> 110 || <!-- December 2013 --> || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$64.88/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->WTI US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 --> 72 || <!-- 2008 --> 100 <small>peak:147</small>{{sfn|Scotiabank|2014}} || <!-- 2009 --> 62 || <!-- 2010 -->  80 || <!-- 2011 --> 95 || <!-- 2012 --> 95 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 95 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 93.29{{sfn|PSAC|2013a}} || <!-- August 2013 --> 97.90 || <!-- December 2013 --> || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 --> 102.07 {{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}||US$54.13/bbl){{Sfn|Financial Post|2014a}}{{rp|B7}}<!--US$68.93{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014}}-->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$60.19/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->WCS US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 -->  || <!-- 2008 --> 80 || <!-- 2009 --> 52 || <!-- 2010 -->  65 || <!-- 2011 --> 78 || <!-- 2012 --> 72 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 69 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 77.62{{sfn|PSAC|2013a}} || <!-- August 2013 --> 82.36 || <!-- December 2013 -->67{{Sfn|Philips|2013}} || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 --> $79.56 {{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}||US$38.13/bbl{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014a}}<!--US$51.93{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014}}-->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$52.39/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| Syncrude Sweet || 62 || 102 || 62 || 78 || 104 || 93 || 97 || 98.51 || <!-- December 2013--> || <!-- January 2014--> ||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|-\n| Edmonton Par || 72 || 96 || 58 || 75 || 96 || 86 || 87 || 89.53 || <!-- December 2013--> || <!-- January 2014-->||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|-\n| Maya US$/bbl || <!-- 2007--> || <!-- 2008--> || <!-- 2009--> || <!-- 2010--> || <!-- 2011--> || <!-- 2012--> || 101 || <!-- April 2013--> || <!-- December 2013 --> 2013-12 || 87 {{Sfn|Philips|2013}} || <!-- January 2014--> ||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|}\n\n(Prices except Maya for years 2007-February 2013){{sfn|TD|2013}}(Prices for Maya){{sfn|Van Loon|2013}} (Prices for 24 April 2013).{{sfn|PSCA|2013}}\n\nBy July 2013, Western Canadian Select (WCS) \"heavy oil prices climbed from US$75 to more than US$90 per barrel \u2014 the highest level since mid-2008, when WTI oil prices were at a record (US$147.90) \u2014 just prior to the 2008-09 'Great Recession'.\"{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} WCS \"heavy oil prices were \"expected to remain at the US$90, which is closer to the world price for heavy crude and WCS 'true, inherent value'\".{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} The higher price of WCS oil off WTI was explained by \"new rail shipments alleviating some export pipeline constraints \u2014 and the return of WTI oil prices to international levels\".{{sfn|Mohr|2013}}\n\nBy January 2014 there was a proliferation of trains and pipelines carrying WCS along with an increased demand on the part of U.S. refineries.

[[Cushing, Oklahoma]], a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America.\n\nThe [[National Bank of Canada]]'s Tim Simard, argued that WCS is the benchmark for those buying shares in Canadian oil sands companies, such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., or Cenovus Energy Inc., Northern Blizzard Resources Inc., Pengrowth Energy Corp., or Twin Butte Energy Ltd or others where a \"big part of their exposure will be to heavy crude\u201d.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nThe price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil (petroleum) per barrel{{sfn|Index Mundi|nd}} suffers a differential{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} against [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI){{sfn|Department of Energy|2012}} as traded on the [[New York Mercantile Exchange]] (NYMEX) as published by [[Bloomberg Media]], which itself has a discount versus London-traded Brent oil.{{sfn|Globe and Mail|2012}} This is based on data on prices and differentials from [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]] (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ).\n\n\"West Texas Intermediate Crude oil (WTI) is a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark crude oil]] for the North American market, and [[Edmonton Par]] and Western Canadian Select (WCS) are benchmarks crude oils for the Canadian market. Both Edmonton Par and WTI are high-quality low sulphur crude oils with API gravity levels of around 40\u00b0. In contrast, WCS is a heavy crude oil with an API gravity level of 20.5\u00b0.\"{{sfn|NRC|2013}}{{rp|9}}\n\n[[West Texas Intermediate]] WTI is a sweet, [[light crude oil]], with an [[API gravity]] of around 39.6 and [[specific gravity]] of about 0.827, which is lighter than Brent crude. It contains about 0.24% sulfur thus is rated as a [[sweet crude oil]] (having less than 0.5% sulfur), sweeter than Brent which has 0.37% sulfur. WTI is refined mostly in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions in the U.S., since it is high quality fuel and is produced within the country.\n\n\"WCS prices at a discount to WTI because it is a lower quality crude (3.51Wt. percent sulfur and 20.5 API gravity){{sfn|Moore|2011}} and because of a transportation differential. The price of WCS is currently set at the U.S. Gulf Coast. It costs approximately $10/bbl for a barrel of crude to be transported from Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, accounting for at least $10/bbl of the WTI-WCS discount. Pipeline constraints can also cause the transportation differential to rise significantly.\n\nBy March 2015, with the price of Ice Brent at US$60.55, and WTI at US$51.48, up US$1.10 from the previous day, WCS also rose US$1.20 to US$37.23 with a WTI-WCS price differential of US$14.25.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015}}{{rp|B10-11}} By 2 June 2015 with Brent at US$64.88/bbl, WTI at US$60.19/bbl and WCS at US$52.39/bbl.{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Financial Post]]'', most Canadian investors continued to quote the price of WTI not WCS even though many Canadian oilsands producers sell at WCS prices, because WCS \"has always lacked the transparency and liquidity necessary to make it a household name with investors in the country\".{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} In 2014 Auspice created the Canadian Crude Excess Return Index to gauge WCS futures. Tim Simard, head of commodities at the ''[[National Bank of Canada]]'', claims \"WCS has \"some interesting different fundamental attributes than the conventional WTI barrel.\" WCS has \"better transparency and broader participation\" than Maya. However, he explained that in 2015 \"one of the only ways to take a position in oil is to use an ETF that is tied to WTI.\"{{Sfn|Pett|2015}} Simard claims that when the global price of oil is lower, for example, \"the first barrels to be turned off in a low-price environment are heavy barrels\" making WCS \"closer to the floor\" than WTI.{{Sfn|Pett|2015}}\n\nIn order to address the transparency and liquidity issues facing WCS, Auspice created the [[Canadian Crude Index]] (CCI), which serves as a [[Benchmark (crude oil)|benchmark]] for [[Petroleum production in Canada|oil produced in Canada]].<ref name=\"CCIbenchmark\">{{cite web |url=http://boereport.com/2016/01/04/auspice-capital-advisors-launches-first-live-index-tied-to-canadian-crude-oil/  |date=2016-01-04 |title=Auspice Capital Advisors Launches First Live Index Tied to Canadian Crude Oil}}</ref> The CCI allows investors to track the price, risk and [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the Canadian commodity.<ref name=\"CCIbenchmark\" /> The CCI can be used to identify opportunities to speculate outright on the price of Canadian crude oil or in conjunction with [[West Texas Intermediate]] (WTI) to put on a spread trade which could represent the differential between the two.<ref name=\"factsheet\">{{cite web |url=http://content.auspicecapital.com/AuspiceCCIFactSheet2015.pdf |date=2015 |title=Fact sheet |work=Auspice Capital Advisors |access-date=29 December 2018 |location=Calgary, Alberta}}</ref> The CCI provides a fixed price reference for Canadian Crude Oil by targeting  an exposure that represents a three-month rolling position in crude oil.<ref name=\"threemonthrolling\">{{cite web |url=http://static1.squarespace.com/static/53a1ca9ce4b030ded763dbc2/t/55260223e4b0805894981ebb/1428554275298/Canadian+Crude+Excess+Return+Index+Methodology+3.0.1.pdf |title=Canadian Crude Excess Return Index (CCIER) Methodology |date=April 2015 |pages=7 |work=Auspice Capital Advisors |access-date=29 December 2018 |location=Calgary, Alberta }}</ref> To create a price representative of Canadian crude the index uses two futures contracts: A fixed price contract, which represents the price of crude oil at [[Cushing, Oklahoma]], and a basis differential contract, which represents the difference in price between Cushing and [[Hardisty]], Alberta.<ref name=\"threemonthrolling\" /> Both contracts are priced in U.S. dollars per barrel.

In his presentation to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) in 2013 John Foran demonstrated that Maya had traded at only a slight premium to WCS in 2010. Since then WCS price differentials widened \"with rising oil sands and tight oil production and insufficient pipeline capacity to access global markets\".{{Sfn|Foran|2013}} Mexico enjoys a location discount with its proximity to the heavy oil-capable refineries in the Gulf Coast. As well, Mexico began to strategically and successfully seek out joint venture refinery partnerships in the 1990s to create a market for its heavy crude oil in the U.S. Gulf. In 1993, ([[Pemex|Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos]], the state-owned Mexican oil company) and Shell Oil Company agreed on a joint US$1 billion refinery upgrading construction project which led to the construction of a new coker, hydrotreating unit, sulfur recovery unit and other facilities in Deer Park, Texas on the Houston Ship Channel in order to process large volumes of PEMEX heavy Maya crude while fulfilling the U.S. Clean Air Act requirements.{{sfn|PR|1993}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Year || <!-- 2007 --> 2007 || <!-- 2008 --> 2008 || <!-- 2009 --> 2009 || <!-- 2010 --> 2010 || <!-- 2011 --> 2011 || <!-- 2012 --> 2012 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 2013-02 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 2013-04-24 || <!-- August 2013 --> 2013-08 || <!-- December 2013 --> 2013-12 || <!-- January 2014 -->2014-01 || <!-- April 2014 -->2014-04||<!-- December 2014 -->2014-12 ||<!-- June 2015-06 -->2015-06\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->Brent US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 --> 73 || <!-- 2008 --> 98 || <!-- 2009 --> 62 || <!-- 2010 -->  80 || <!-- 2011 --> 112 || <!-- 2012 --> 112 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 118 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 103.41 || <!-- August 2013 --> 110 || <!-- December 2013 --> || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$64.88/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->WTI US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 --> 72 || <!-- 2008 --> 100 <small>peak:147</small>{{sfn|Scotiabank|2014}} || <!-- 2009 --> 62 || <!-- 2010 -->  80 || <!-- 2011 --> 95 || <!-- 2012 --> 95 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 95 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 93.29{{sfn|PSAC|2013a}} || <!-- August 2013 --> 97.90 || <!-- December 2013 --> || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 --> 102.07 {{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}||US$54.13/bbl){{Sfn|Financial Post|2014a}}{{rp|B7}}<!--US$68.93{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014}}-->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$60.19/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| <!-- Year -->WCS US$/bbl|| <!-- 2007 -->  || <!-- 2008 --> 80 || <!-- 2009 --> 52 || <!-- 2010 -->  65 || <!-- 2011 --> 78 || <!-- 2012 --> 72 || <!-- Feb 2013 --> 69 || <!-- April 24 2013 --> 77.62{{sfn|PSAC|2013a}} || <!-- August 2013 --> 82.36 || <!-- December 2013 -->67{{Sfn|Philips|2013}} || <!-- January 2014 --> || <!-- April 2014 --> $79.56 {{Sfn|Government of Alberta|2014}}||US$38.13/bbl{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014a}}<!--US$51.93{{Sfn|Financial Post|2014}}-->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->US$52.39/bbl{{Sfn|Calgary Herald|2015a}}\n|-\n| Syncrude Sweet || 62 || 102 || 62 || 78 || 104 || 93 || 97 || 98.51 || <!-- December 2013--> || <!-- January 2014--> ||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|-\n| Edmonton Par || 72 || 96 || 58 || 75 || 96 || 86 || 87 || 89.53 || <!-- December 2013--> || <!-- January 2014-->||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|-\n| Maya US$/bbl || <!-- 2007--> || <!-- 2008--> || <!-- 2009--> || <!-- 2010--> || <!-- 2011--> || <!-- 2012--> || 101 || <!-- April 2013--> || <!-- December 2013 --> 2013-12 || 87 {{Sfn|Philips|2013}} || <!-- January 2014--> ||<!-- April 2014 -->||<!-- December 2014 -->||<!-- June 2015-06 -->\n|}\n\n(Prices except Maya for years 2007-February 2013){{sfn|TD|2013}}(Prices for Maya){{sfn|Van Loon|2013}} (Prices for 24 April 2013).{{sfn|PSCA|2013}}\n\nBy July 2013, Western Canadian Select (WCS) \"heavy oil prices climbed from US$75 to more than US$90 per barrel \u2014 the highest level since mid-2008, when WTI oil prices were at a record (US$147.90) \u2014 just prior to the 2008-09 'Great Recession'.\"{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} WCS \"heavy oil prices were \"expected to remain at the US$90, which is closer to the world price for heavy crude and WCS 'true, inherent value'\".{{sfn|Mohr|2013}} The higher price of WCS oil off WTI was explained by \"new rail shipments alleviating some export pipeline constraints \u2014 and the return of WTI oil prices to international levels\".{{sfn|Mohr|2013}}\n\nBy January 2014 there was a proliferation of trains and pipelines carrying WCS along with an increased demand on the part of U.S. refineries.

Played by [[Katee Sackhoff]], she is a revised version of [[Lieutenant Starbuck]] from the 1978 ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series. She is one of the show's main characters.\n\n==Overview==\nDescribed by a critic as \"one of television's most complex, ever-evolving characters\", the role of Starbuck changed over the run of the series.<ref name=\"Canwest01\">{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/opinion/Katee+Sackhoff+returns+Earth/1269262/story.html |title=Katee Sackhoff returns to Earth |last=Angus |first=Kat |date=2009-02-09 |work=Canwest News Service |publisher=Vancouver Sun |pages=E5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419132143/http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/Katee%2BSackhoff%2Breturns%2BEarth/1269262/story.html |archivedate=2009-04-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to Sackhoff, Starbuck originally \"didn't value her own life,\" inspiring her readiness to die for her shipmates. By the end of the series, however, she is prepared to sacrifice herself for others because of her respect for all life.<ref name=\"Canwest01\"/> The character's physical appearance is based on Sackhoff's perception of Starbuck as an extremely fit, hard-drinking individual. \"I didn't want Starbuck to be completely ripped,\" said Sackhoff. \"This is a girl who drinks most of her calories.\"<ref name=\"Canwest01\"/>\n\nKara Thrace bears some parallels to the original 1978 Starbuck character: both are portrayed as hot-headed and cocky fighter pilots, considered the best in the fleet, but with a tendency to challenge authorities and get into trouble. Both are avid gamblers and enjoy drinking, smoking cigars, and sex. Both have crashed and been marooned on a deserted planet, using a downed Cylon ship to make an escape.<ref>See [[You Can't Go Home Again (Battlestar Galactica)]]</ref> Both are best friends with [[Lee Adama|Apollo]]. Kara had a relationship with Apollo's late brother Zak (mirroring the original Starbuck's on-and-off relationship with Apollo's sister Athena), affecting her relationship to Apollo and Zak's father, [[William Adama]].\n\nThe two characters differ both in their gender \u2013 complicating Kara Thrace's relationships with other characters, notably Apollo \u2013 as well as their outward appearance: whereas the original Starbuck, played by [[Dirk Benedict]], was a slick, well-groomed ladies' man, Kara appears more rugged and grimy. ''USA Today'' described her as \"the broken warrior, a young, idealistic soldier who has been fighting for all the right reasons, but has lost something along the way.\"<ref name=\"usatoday090312\"/>\n\n==Character history==\n{{in-universe|section|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe series bible developed for the TV series by Ron D. Moore states that Kara Thrace was born on Picon, but because her mother was in the Colonial Marines, she grew up as a [[military brat]] bouncing between different military bases on different planets during her entire childhood.  The result is that she has no particular attachment to Picon, and lived on Caprica for some years  before the TV series begins.  As this information is from the series bible but never stated on-screen, it is unknown if Kara is canonically considered a Caprican or a Picon.  However, her situation appears somewhat similar to Gaius Baltar, who grew up on Aerilon but moved to Caprica when he left home for university, then stayed the rest of his life there and abandoned all connections to his past.  As Ron Moore has said, the Twelve Colonies only united under one government fairly recently, during the first Cylon war fifty years ago, thus many people still think in terms of affiliation to each of the \"Twelve Tribes\" - but technically under the new federal government they switched to a residency system.  Thus, as Moore explained, Baltar was able to become the Caprican delegate to the Quorum of Twelve as a naturalized citizen of Caprica, and considered himself to be a Caprican in nationality, but was not ethnically a \"Caprican\".  Similarly, Kara may be ethnically a Picon, but loosely considers herself to be a naturalized Caprican.<ref>[http://leethomson.myzen.co.uk/Battlestar_Galactica/Battlestar_Galactica_Series_Bible.pdf BSG Series Bible]</ref>\n\nKara Thrace had intended to be a professional pyramid ball player until her knee gave out. She eventually joined the military, where she found more acceptance than she had felt at home as an [[child abuse|abused child]].<ref>Family problems had previously been alluded to but physical abuse is confirmed in \"[[The Farm (Battlestar Galactica)|The Farm]]\" when the Cylon [[Cylon (2003)#Simon (Cylon Model Number Unknown)|Simon]] points out that  every one of her fingers on both hands had been broken in the same place. Simon suggests she might not want to have children because of that, due to fears of passing the abuse on to them. There is a strong reaction from Kara but no further clarification on the topic within that episode. Later, in \"[[Maelstrom (Battlestar Galactica)|Maelstrom]]\", it is revealed her mother once punished her by placing her hand in a doorframe and slamming the door shut.</ref> Although Kara's mother, Socrata Thrace, had served as a Corporal in the first Cylon war, Kara was the first person in the family to become a commissioned officer. Socrata was not content with her daughter's military record, however, claiming she was not disciplined enough and was wasting her natural talent for flying. Kara's father, Dreilide Thrace, was a pianist. He left the family when Kara was a child, as Socrata had forced him to make a choice between his beloved piano playing, and picking up a steadier job to support the family.\n\nAs a flight instructor at the Colonial flight school, Kara met and became romantically involved with one of her students, [[Zak Adama]]. Although Zak told her he did not want any special treatment from her, Kara passed him even though he failed basic flight, as she could not bring herself to crush his dreams.\n\nHer leniency cost Zak his life when he died on his first Viper mission. After his death, Starbuck met his father, [[William Adama]]. He realized Starbuck and Zak had been engaged and brought her under his command as a Lieutenant. Zak's death, however, created a wedge between Adama and his other son, [[Lee Adama|Lee \"Apollo\" Adama]], who blamed his father for Zak's death, for creating an expectation that made Zak feel he needed to pursue becoming a Viper pilot in order to earn his father's affection. After the funeral, Lee broke off all contact with his father and Starbuck.\n\nStarbuck has a natural talent for flying and is considered Galactica's best pilot,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Making Starbuck Monstrous: The Poetics of Othering in Battlestar Galactica|first=Van|last=Leavenworth|doi=10.1111/jpcu.12156|volume=47|issue=4|year=2014|pages=688\u2013708|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|publisher=Popular Culture Association|issn=1540-5931}}</ref> although she also is known for being an avid card player and drinker as well as for an eruptive temper. Bill Adama loves Kara despite her flaws and considers her something of a surrogate daughter. However, Starbuck and [[Saul Tigh|Colonel Tigh]] share a mutual sense of loathing, despite - or perhaps because of - their similarities. At the time of the attack on the Colonies, she was second in command of Galactica's fighter wing.\n\n=== After the attack ===\nIn a card game prior to ''Galactica''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s decommissioning ceremony, Starbuck responds to Colonel Tigh's mocking of her call sign and her stint in the brig as a cadet by alluding to Tigh's troubled relationship with his wife. Infuriated, he flips the table over, and she punches him in the face. He sends her to the brig, promising her that her career is over. However, Adama tells Tigh he is probably overreacting: while he agrees to leave Kara in the brig until after the ceremony, Adama says there is no need to ruin her career over the incident. Following the [[Cylon (2003)|Cylons]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> attack on the Twelve Colonies, Starbuck is released to join the battle.\n\nStarbuck keeps her secret about Zak buried inside until after the Cylon attack on the [[Twelve Colonies]]. Soon after, when Starbuck fears she and the rest of humanity might be wiped out by the Cylons, she confesses her mistake to Lee. He is devastated. [[Act of Contrition (Battlestar Galactica)|Later]], he confronts her about it when she is chosen to train new Viper pilots aboard ''Galactica'' after several pilots are killed in a freak accident. The quality of recruits she is sent is subpar but still she begins their training, ordering them to call her \"God\". Starbuck, blinded by guilt, washes all the pilots out for relatively minor flaws. She then admits her secret to Adama who is furious and heartbroken; he orders her to reinstate the trainees.\n\nOn the next training mission, Starbuck and the trainees are ambushed by a small group of [[Cylon Raider]]s. Starbuck engages the Raiders on her own to cover the trainees' escape. With her Viper heavily damaged, she plummets toward the surface of a nearby desert moon, and is forced to eject and take her chances on the surface.\n\nStarbuck is declared \"missing in action\", and Adama orders a search and rescue operation which strains the ''Galactica''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew and combat resources. [[You Can't Go Home Again (Battlestar Galactica)|On the surface]], Starbuck struggles with a broken knee and near asphyxiation as her oxygen runs out. Luckily, she discovers the Cylon Raider she downed. Using her exceptional skill in flying, she figures out the Cylon technology and is able to pilot it back to the fleet.\n\nDepressed by her injuries, she initially needs incentive to work on rehabilitation and is soon rubbing people the wrong way again. Even after she is able to move around without a cane, the injury sidelines her from flight for many episodes; when given tactical charge of a mission in one episode, she cannot fly the critical role because her knee still can't handle the G-force.\n\nDuring her recovery, a [[Leoben Conoy|Number Two]] named Leoben is discovered aboard the ''Gemenon Traveller'' and is arrested. Adama assigns Starbuck to interrogate Leoben, believing she will be resistant to his mind games. Starbuck brutally interrogates Leoben, and he claims to have hidden a nuclear bomb on a timer somewhere in the fleet, threatening its detonation. Despite her often crude exterior, Starbuck is revealed to have a deep-seated faith in the gods, and engages in a debate about the existence of the Colonial gods vs. the Cylon god with Leoben, and whether the humanoid Cylons are actually \"human\". Leoben demonstrates that he is capable of breaking free and killing Starbuck at any time, but chooses not to, believing it is not God's will. During this period, Starbuck develops a respect for Leoben, and he falls in love with her. She is genuinely saddened when President [[Laura Roslin]] orders him executed by airlock, after he admits there is no bomb. She experiences a brief moment of emotional connection with Leoben when they touch palms through the glass of the airlock before he is executed. Afterwards, she privately prays to the Lords of Kobol, acknowledging that Leoben might not have had a soul, but if he did, asking that they take care of it.\n\nStarbuck's religious beliefs later come into play when President Roslin asks her to carry out a dangerous mission: return to Caprica and retrieve the [[Arrow of Apollo]], a religious artifact supposedly pointing the way to [[Earth]]. Starbuck is at first reluctant, believing that Adama already knows the way to Earth, and is leading them there. Roslin is forced to reveal that Adama lied about knowing Earth's whereabouts to give the fleet hope. This deeply shakes Starbuck's trust in Adama, and she eventually is convinced to help Roslin. She takes the Cylon Raider she had captured, leading Adama to declare Roslin had suborned mutiny; he sends a detachment of Marines to terminate her presidency.\n\nDuring her time on Caprica, Starbuck encounters a [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] (who beats her soundly), but manages to kill the Cylon out of sheer luck. She then meets up with [[Karl Agathon|Karl \"Helo\" Agathon]] (a close friend she believed dead after he stayed on Caprica) and the [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon Valerii]] copy pregnant with his child. Immediately realizing that Sharon is a Cylon, she attempts to kill her, while Helo stops her. This causes Sharon to flee in the stolen Raider, abandoning Starbuck and Helo. While attempting to find an alternative route off Caprica, they meet a resistance group that had been waging guerrilla war against the Cylons, led by fellow pyramid player [[Samuel Anders]]. Kara and Anders develop a bond over their shared past as pyramid players, and develop a romantic relationship. At one point Starbuck is injured in battle, captured, and wakes up in a Cylon \"farm\" as part of their experiments to create human/Cylon hybrids, but is originally led to believe she is in a hospital run by the resistance. A Cylon named [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]], posing as a doctor, experiments on her, claiming to be treating her for internal injuries, and keeps her in a drugged state. Without her knowledge, apparently one of her ovaries is surgically removed before she escapes; a fact discovered only much later. Starbuck escapes with the help of the resistance, killing Simon. Sharon returns with a Cylon Heavy Raider, and Starbuck plans to return to the fleet with her and Helo. However, she personally promises Anders that she will return with reinforcements to rescue the Resistance, giving Anders her dog tags as part of her promise.\n\nShe, Helo, and Sharon arrive on the planet [[Kobol]], joining Roslin in her search for the Tomb of Athena. Sharon is able to guide them to the tomb, and Adama joins them. They are able to place the Arrow of Apollo in the tomb, and gain a rudimentary map to Earth.\n\nSoon after returning to Galactica, the ''Battlestar Pegasus'', commanded by Rear Admiral Helena Cain, is discovered. Cain promotes Starbuck to Captain and assigns her as the [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] of the ''Pegasus''.\n\nAfter the fleet leadership denies her request to return to rescue the Caprican resistance fighters, Starbuck is depressed and guilt-stricken: she has broken her word, failed her duty, and assumes the man she is \"hung up on\" is either dead, or will be soon. As Pegasus CAG, she also feels responsible for the pilots who have died on her watch, or died because she has not yet killed the Cylon's \"top gun\", \"Scar\". She recklessly maneuvers to take out Scar, but at the last moment pulls away, setting up the kill for [[Louanne Katraine|Louanne \"Kat\" Katraine]] and giving up her own status as \"Top Gun\". Although this marks the beginning of a new resolve and the end of her self-destructive depressive behaviours, tensions between her and Apollo flare up again after she shoots him in a [[friendly fire]] incident during a hostage stand-off.\n\nAfter [[Lee Adama]]'s promotion to Commander and appointment as commander of the Battlestar ''Pegasus'', Starbuck transfers back to the ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' and assumes the role of its [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]].\n\n=== New Caprica ===\nThe complication of Starbuck and Lee's relationship was furthered when a drunken night on the newly found planet, [[New Caprica]], ended with Starbuck and Lee having a one-night stand where they both expressed their love for one another. When Lee woke up alone the next morning, he soon discovered Kara had proposed to and married Anders. Lee soon marries newly commissioned Lieutenant [[Anastasia Dualla]] while Starbuck moves planetside with Anders.\n\nAfter an all-night celebration of the first founder's day for New Caprica, tired and hungover, Starbuck and Tigh put their differences behind them. They even greet each other fondly following Tigh's demobilization and arrival at the colony. Her relationship with Lee, however, worsened to the point that they were not on speaking terms and he had little interest in helping her, even when Anders contracted a serious bout of pneumonia.\n\nAfter the Cylon invasion of New Caprica, she is imprisoned inside a mental facility, designed to look like her own former Caprican apartment. While there, a [[Leoben Conoy|Leoben]] model tries to convince her they are destined to be lovers. For four months Starbuck denies his advances, killing him several times despite knowing he would be back. Then she is presented with a young girl named Kacey that Leoben claims is their daughter, created with the ovary removed when she was in the egg farm. Initially she refuses to believe it and wants nothing to do with the girl, but when Kacey is badly injured in a fall down a staircase, she calls on Leoben for help and seems to grow more attached to both of them.  During the uprising on New Caprica, however, Starbuck once again kills Leoben and escapes with Kacey.\n\nIn the episode [[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)#Part II|\"Exodus\" Part II]], it is revealed Kacey is not Starbuck's child; the Cylons had abducted her. Kacey and her real mother are reunited on the ''Galactica'''s flight deck after the flight from New Caprica. Starbuck is left there alone on the flight deck, stunned and in disbelief.\n\n===Back with the fleet===\nAfter her situation on New Caprica and the truth about Kacey, she is left simmering with rage, which causes her to be reckless and destructive, almost killing herself in a Viper training exercise. After being removed from flight status by then-Major Lee Adama, she takes up residence in the pilot's mess along with Colonel Tigh, drinking and lowering the morale of ''Galactica'''s pilots by attempting to draw divisions between New Capricans and those who stayed with the fleet. Admiral Adama gives her an ultimatum; either straighten up and act like an officer, or 'get the hell off his ship' and find another ship to live on. Starbuck changes her attitude after Adama literally knocks her to the ground after she thumbs her nose at him.\n\nStarbuck's relationship with Lee Adama takes another dramatic turn after she angrily challenges him to a brutal and emotional boxing match aboard ''Galactica''. Their intense feelings for each other soon lead to an affair drawing resentment from their respective spouses. However, when Lee asks Starbuck to divorce Sam, she refuses due to her strong religious beliefs on the sacrament of marriage. Lee argues she is breaking her vows just by being with him, but Starbuck states she's merely [[bending the rules]]. Lee then decides he can no longer cheat while still married to Dualla. Later, Lee and Anders begin to voice their dislike for each other just as Starbuck's Raptor is shot down by the Cylons and she is reported missing. Anders vows to find her, but their position is outnumbered; Lee orders Anders at gunpoint to stay put and help defend their outnumbered position. Anders remains defiant.\n\nStarbuck suffers severe hand burns in the crash and is rescued by Dualla. After they escape the doomed algae planet, Starbuck makes one final effort to have a relationship with Lee, this time offering to leave Anders if he will leave Dualla. Lee chooses to try to make his own marriage work instead.\n\nKara's experiences with Leoben, as well as her troubled childhood, eventually come back to haunt her. She has nightmares involving both Leoben and the mandala supposedly connected to her \"destiny\". She asks an oracle about her dreams and is told Leoben understands her better than she understands herself, and he will show her \"destiny.\"\n\nDuring a patrol over a gas giant where the fleet is refueling, she sees a Cylon Raider and pursues it into a storm system which resembles her mandala. She is forced to abandon pursuit when her Viper is at risk of implosion from the pressure. Although she felt several impacts during her pursuit, then-[[Galen Tyrol|Chief Galen Tyrol]] finds no damage to her Viper and gun camera footage showed no evidence of any Raider, leading many to believe Kara had been hallucinating.\n\nAdama is concerned Kara might have burned out, but he leaves the decision to ground her up to Apollo as CAG. Apollo decides to give her another chance, and offers to fly as her wingman on her next patrol. During the patrol, Starbuck sees another Raider and again pursues. Her Viper is hit by debris and she is knocked out. She experiences a conversation with an [[Avatar]] with the appearance of Leoben set in her apartment on Caprica. The avatar forces Kara to confront her past, the abuse she received from her mother and the guilt she feels for leaving her mother to die alone. The avatar comments Kara has been running from her past just as she has been running away from death for her entire life, and implies eventually she will have to confront her fears and her \"destiny\". Moments before regaining consciousness in her Viper, Kara realizes the person she is speaking to is not the Cylon Leoben Conoy, and states, \"You're not Leoben.\" The avatar grins and replies, \"Never said I was.\" She awakens in her Viper cockpit as Apollo is calling for her to break off and ascend, or the atmospheric pressure will kill her. Starbuck keeps flying into the storm, and tells Lee to leave her. She is encompassed by a white light and certain calmness. Apollo witnesses her Viper imploding, with no sign that she survived.\n\nIn the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, \"[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part II]]\", Starbuck reappears in the same Viper that she was flying at the time she disappeared and is discovered by Apollo, appearing to be alive and well,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20043843,00.html |title=Cylon, Farewell, It's Time to Say Goodbye |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= 2007-06-27|accessdate= March 16, 2011 |first=Adam B. |last=Vary}}</ref> but the reason for her sudden resurrection has yet to be revealed. She tells Apollo not to \"freak out\" it is really her and she has been to Earth, and will show them the way.\n\nKara returns in Season 4 believing she had only been absent for six hours, but Anders informs her she was really gone for two months. The crew is wary of her return except for Lee, who greets her with an enthusiastic and long hug, and is so grateful for her return he is willing to overlook the possibility she is a Cylon, and he may be willing to accept her even as a Cylon. This becomes evident in Lee's questioning of his father whether if it had been his son, Lee's brother, who returned, would it have made a difference whether he was Cylon or human. She experiences frustration upon her return to ''Galactica'', as no one believes it is really her, and because of President Roslin's refusal to be guided by what she believes is a Cylon trick. The crew continues on the course Roslin had previously decided upon and move further away from the area Kara believes is Earth's true location. She attempts to encourage Adama to follow her suggestions, but when he refuses, she fears his being romantically linked to Roslin has unjustly influenced him. Feeling hopeless and fearing as they make more jumps farther away she will lose the \"feeling\" of Earth's location, she becomes desperate and holds President Roslin at gunpoint.\n\nDuring her standoff with the President, she tries to reason and appeal to the President's emotions. She hands the gun to Roslin and insists she shoot her if she really believes she is a Cylon, to which Roslin responds to by saying \"They made you perfect, didn't they?\" Roslin fires the gun, but misses Starbuck and hits a framed portrait of herself and Adama.\n\nStarbuck is thrown into the brig and has a hostile confrontation with Adama, who angrily says, \"You are so stupid you couldn't wait. You just lost your best ally. Now who is going to save you?\" She responds, \"Well, it certainly isn't you,\" and says she will fight to show them Earth's location until her death. She also accuses him of playing \"wet nurse\" to the president, to which he responds by throwing her to the floor and leaving her crying.\n\nLater, after Adama attempts to have a conversation with Roslin, which turns into a psychological sparring argument, he rethinks his decision and allows Kara to secretly look for Earth on a barge called ''Demetrius''.\n\n=== Aboard ''Demetrius'' - Looking for Earth ===\nAfter taking command of ''Demetrius'' to find a way to Earth, Starbuck finds herself at odds with the crew when her orders cause them to doubt her command ability. With only two days remaining until the ship must return to the Fleet, her command is further compromised by her refusal to explain her actions and her decision to bring the Cylon Leoben aboard after having found him in a damaged Cylon Heavy Raider. Eventually, she finds herself torn between following Leoben's advice to forge an alliance with the fragmented Cylons, or distrusting him because of what that risk entails. The tension with the crew leads to a mutiny, after which Kara acknowledges her errors and instead takes a small crew with her in a Raptor to visit the base ship. There, she meets with the base star's hybrid and is told, \"You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/battlestar-galactica-sackhoff-41775.aspx |title=Katee Sackhoff on the Battlestar Finale: \"I Want Closure\" |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate= March 16, 2011}}</ref> This echoes the warning given by the first hybrid to Kendra Shaw at the conclusion of ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Razor|Razor]]''.\n\n=== Earth ===\nIn \"[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]\", Starbuck and Leoben look for the Colonial beacon which led them to Earth. They find wreckage of a Viper with Starbuck's tail number and what appears to be her charred corpse.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Battlestar-Galactica-Cylon-1001754.aspx |title=And the Last Cylon Is... |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate= March 16, 2011}}</ref> Both Kara and Leoben are shocked by this discovery and do not understand what it means. After removing the [[dog tags]] and wedding ring, Kara asks \"If that's me lying there, then what am I?\". He responds by backing away, as if recoiling from the realization that she is indeed the \"Harbinger of Death.\" She returns to the wrecked Viper and, after carefully wrapping the remains in a parachute shawl, she incinerates the body on a funeral [[pyre]].\n\nStarbuck's description as \"the harbinger of death\" and Leoben's caution to her not to venture into the woods, \"you might not like what you find,\" were elements of the episode's homage to the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. [[List of characters in the Planet of the Apes films#Dr. Zaius|Dr. Zaius]] gave [[List of characters in the Planet of the Apes films#Taylor|Colonel Taylor]] the same warning, and instructed [[List of characters in the Planet of the Apes films#Cornelius|Dr. Cornelius]] to read from the sacred scrolls that man was the harbinger of death. Like Taylor, Starbuck was a human astronaut and military officer exploring a post-apocalyptic Earth.\n\n=== Mutiny ===\nIn \"[[The Oath (Battlestar Galactica)|The Oath]]\", Captain Thrace discovers civilians and a few mutinous Marines and crewmen arming themselves for battle. She rushes back to her quarters to prepare for battle, grabbing her sidearms and ammunition. Kara then finds Lieutenant Margaret \"Racetrack\" Edmondson, Charlie Conner, and a few others preparing to execute Lee Adama. She kills a Marine holding Adama and wounds Lieutenant Hamish \"Skulls\" McCall. Along with Lee Adama, Kara runs into several other loyal Colonials including President Roslin, Admiral Adama, and Colonel Tigh. While searching for Adama, Kara and Lee free loyalists found in the brig which includes Anders, who is then shot by a mutinous marine upon leaving. Kara, refusing to leave his side, pressures Lee and those who escaped to leave her in order for them to search for Adama.\n\n=== The song ===\nIn the episode \"[[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]\", Starbuck encounters a pianist in [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#J|Joe's Bar]] who is trying to compose a new song. At first she becomes annoyed by his repetitious playing, stating he reminds her of her father when he did nothing but play the piano and she mentions how her father left her and her mother to pursue it as a career. Over the course of the episode, Starbuck befriends the pianist and ends up working with him to try to finish his song.\n\nToward the end, the piano player writes down the notes Starbuck hums out on a sheet of paper. The pattern reminds Starbuck of a drawing of colored dots the Cylon-Human child, [[Hera Agathon]] had given to her earlier. She lines the child's drawing up with the notes the composer had drawn and they match exactly.\n\nWhen Starbuck and the pianist play the notes, the song is instantly recognized by [[Saul Tigh]] and Tory Foster \u2013 who are sitting at a nearby table with [[Ellen Tigh]] \u2013 as the song (\"[[Music of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)#All Along the Watchtower|All Along the Watchtower]]\") they heard in their heads when they learned they were the final Cylons. Ellen, of course, remembers it from Earth. A bewildered Saul asks Starbuck where she heard the song. Starbuck responds she played it as a kid and begins to mention her father, but stops short when she realizes the piano player, her father, was either a figment of her imagination or a vision.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak, Part I]]\" Starbuck tries to get answers from Anders about the song, even turning notes into numbers to see if there is a mathematical solution.\n\nIn \"[[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak, Part II and III]]\", after getting the coordinates from Anders for the Cylon Colony, Starbuck joins in on the rescue mission for Hera. After saving Hera, and as the Colony is being destroyed, Starbuck is ordered by Admiral Adama to jump the ''Galactica'' away to safety. Although she has no coordinates, Adama tells her to make a blind jump to anywhere. Recalling the musical notes and the numbers she extrapolated from it, she inputs them into the computer; the resulting jump puts ''Galactica'' near a habitable planet the fleet decides to settle on. It is revealed this new planet is our world, some 150,000 years ago; Admiral Adama names it \"Earth\", believing it better matched the dream the fleet had been seeking than did the original Earth (which had been found destroyed by nuclear war).\n\nOnce settled on the world, Kara says a final goodbye to Admiral Adama and tells Lee she's leaving - her 'job is done', having indeed led the human race to their end (the end of their journey) - and will not be coming back.  Kara then disappears into thin air and is not seen again. Seeing her gone, Lee tells her ghost she \"won't be forgotten\", echoing a moment from the \"Daybreak\" episodes. What really happened to Kara is left ambiguous. According to Katee Sackhoff, \"So when she at the end was saying goodbye to [Anders], I think that she was saying goodbye to their bodily forms,\" she said. \"I think she knew, especially if he says, 'I'll see you on the other side,' I think she's with him. I think they're both dead, but I think she's with him. That was a decision that we made, because I selfishly wanted her at peace, and the only way to do that was to have her with someone at the end, or to be with the person she wanted to be with. I don't know. That's kind of where I think she is. She's with Anders playing pyramid in the sky somewhere.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Castro |first1=Adam-Troy |title=Katee Sackhoff spills on 24\u2014and talks Starbuck's fate |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/katee-sackhoff-spills-on-24-and-talks-starbucks-fate |website=SYFY WIRE |accessdate=February 27, 2020 |date=December 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Casting==\nThere was considerable outrage from fans of the original series when producers announced their intention to re-cast Starbuck and Boomer as women, with the decision to change Starbuck's gender especially controversial due to the character's popularity.<ref name=\"brunt1\">{{cite news|author=Mark, Cristoph |url=http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/arts/20090227TDY16002.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090302092505/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/features/arts/20090227TDY16002.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-03-02 |title=Women at dark heart of Battlestar Galactica |date=2009-02-27 |work=[[Yomiuri Shimbun|Daily Yomiuri]] }}</ref><ref name=\"brunt2\">{{cite news | author = Salem, Rob | url = https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/349137 | title = Battlestar's final season | date = 2008-05-22 | work = [[Toronto Star]] | accessdate = 2009-03-16}}</ref> [[Ronald D.

She is one of the show's main characters.\n\n==Overview==\nDescribed by a critic as \"one of television's most complex, ever-evolving characters\", the role of Starbuck changed over the run of the series.<ref name=\"Canwest01\">{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/opinion/Katee+Sackhoff+returns+Earth/1269262/story.html |title=Katee Sackhoff returns to Earth |last=Angus |first=Kat |date=2009-02-09 |work=Canwest News Service |publisher=Vancouver Sun |pages=E5 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419132143/http://www.vancouversun.com/opinion/Katee%2BSackhoff%2Breturns%2BEarth/1269262/story.html |archivedate=2009-04-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> According to Sackhoff, Starbuck originally \"didn't value her own life,\" inspiring her readiness to die for her shipmates. By the end of the series, however, she is prepared to sacrifice herself for others because of her respect for all life.<ref name=\"Canwest01\"/> The character's physical appearance is based on Sackhoff's perception of Starbuck as an extremely fit, hard-drinking individual. \"I didn't want Starbuck to be completely ripped,\" said Sackhoff. \"This is a girl who drinks most of her calories.\"<ref name=\"Canwest01\"/>\n\nKara Thrace bears some parallels to the original 1978 Starbuck character: both are portrayed as hot-headed and cocky fighter pilots, considered the best in the fleet, but with a tendency to challenge authorities and get into trouble. Both are avid gamblers and enjoy drinking, smoking cigars, and sex. Both have crashed and been marooned on a deserted planet, using a downed Cylon ship to make an escape.<ref>See [[You Can't Go Home Again (Battlestar Galactica)]]</ref> Both are best friends with [[Lee Adama|Apollo]]. Kara had a relationship with Apollo's late brother Zak (mirroring the original Starbuck's on-and-off relationship with Apollo's sister Athena), affecting her relationship to Apollo and Zak's father, [[William Adama]].\n\nThe two characters differ both in their gender \u2013 complicating Kara Thrace's relationships with other characters, notably Apollo \u2013 as well as their outward appearance: whereas the original Starbuck, played by [[Dirk Benedict]], was a slick, well-groomed ladies' man, Kara appears more rugged and grimy. ''USA Today'' described her as \"the broken warrior, a young, idealistic soldier who has been fighting for all the right reasons, but has lost something along the way.\"<ref name=\"usatoday090312\"/>\n\n==Character history==\n{{in-universe|section|date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe series bible developed for the TV series by Ron D. Moore states that Kara Thrace was born on Picon, but because her mother was in the Colonial Marines, she grew up as a [[military brat]] bouncing between different military bases on different planets during her entire childhood.  The result is that she has no particular attachment to Picon, and lived on Caprica for some years  before the TV series begins.  As this information is from the series bible but never stated on-screen, it is unknown if Kara is canonically considered a Caprican or a Picon.  However, her situation appears somewhat similar to Gaius Baltar, who grew up on Aerilon but moved to Caprica when he left home for university, then stayed the rest of his life there and abandoned all connections to his past.  As Ron Moore has said, the Twelve Colonies only united under one government fairly recently, during the first Cylon war fifty years ago, thus many people still think in terms of affiliation to each of the \"Twelve Tribes\" - but technically under the new federal government they switched to a residency system.  Thus, as Moore explained, Baltar was able to become the Caprican delegate to the Quorum of Twelve as a naturalized citizen of Caprica, and considered himself to be a Caprican in nationality, but was not ethnically a \"Caprican\".  Similarly, Kara may be ethnically a Picon, but loosely considers herself to be a naturalized Caprican.<ref>[http://leethomson.myzen.co.uk/Battlestar_Galactica/Battlestar_Galactica_Series_Bible.pdf BSG Series Bible]</ref>\n\nKara Thrace had intended to be a professional pyramid ball player until her knee gave out. She eventually joined the military, where she found more acceptance than she had felt at home as an [[child abuse|abused child]].<ref>Family problems had previously been alluded to but physical abuse is confirmed in \"[[The Farm (Battlestar Galactica)|The Farm]]\" when the Cylon [[Cylon (2003)#Simon (Cylon Model Number Unknown)|Simon]] points out that  every one of her fingers on both hands had been broken in the same place. Simon suggests she might not want to have children because of that, due to fears of passing the abuse on to them. There is a strong reaction from Kara but no further clarification on the topic within that episode. Later, in \"[[Maelstrom (Battlestar Galactica)|Maelstrom]]\", it is revealed her mother once punished her by placing her hand in a doorframe and slamming the door shut.</ref> Although Kara's mother, Socrata Thrace, had served as a Corporal in the first Cylon war, Kara was the first person in the family to become a commissioned officer. Socrata was not content with her daughter's military record, however, claiming she was not disciplined enough and was wasting her natural talent for flying. Kara's father, Dreilide Thrace, was a pianist. He left the family when Kara was a child, as Socrata had forced him to make a choice between his beloved piano playing, and picking up a steadier job to support the family.\n\nAs a flight instructor at the Colonial flight school, Kara met and became romantically involved with one of her students, [[Zak Adama]]. Although Zak told her he did not want any special treatment from her, Kara passed him even though he failed basic flight, as she could not bring herself to crush his dreams.\n\nHer leniency cost Zak his life when he died on his first Viper mission. After his death, Starbuck met his father, [[William Adama]]. He realized Starbuck and Zak had been engaged and brought her under his command as a Lieutenant. Zak's death, however, created a wedge between Adama and his other son, [[Lee Adama|Lee \"Apollo\" Adama]], who blamed his father for Zak's death, for creating an expectation that made Zak feel he needed to pursue becoming a Viper pilot in order to earn his father's affection. After the funeral, Lee broke off all contact with his father and Starbuck.\n\nStarbuck has a natural talent for flying and is considered Galactica's best pilot,<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Making Starbuck Monstrous: The Poetics of Othering in Battlestar Galactica|first=Van|last=Leavenworth|doi=10.1111/jpcu.12156|volume=47|issue=4|year=2014|pages=688\u2013708|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|publisher=Popular Culture Association|issn=1540-5931}}</ref> although she also is known for being an avid card player and drinker as well as for an eruptive temper. Bill Adama loves Kara despite her flaws and considers her something of a surrogate daughter. However, Starbuck and [[Saul Tigh|Colonel Tigh]] share a mutual sense of loathing, despite - or perhaps because of - their similarities. At the time of the attack on the Colonies, she was second in command of Galactica's fighter wing.\n\n=== After the attack ===\nIn a card game prior to ''Galactica''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s decommissioning ceremony, Starbuck responds to Colonel Tigh's mocking of her call sign and her stint in the brig as a cadet by alluding to Tigh's troubled relationship with his wife. Infuriated, he flips the table over, and she punches him in the face. He sends her to the brig, promising her that her career is over. However, Adama tells Tigh he is probably overreacting: while he agrees to leave Kara in the brig until after the ceremony, Adama says there is no need to ruin her career over the incident. Following the [[Cylon (2003)|Cylons]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> attack on the Twelve Colonies, Starbuck is released to join the battle.\n\nStarbuck keeps her secret about Zak buried inside until after the Cylon attack on the [[Twelve Colonies]]. Soon after, when Starbuck fears she and the rest of humanity might be wiped out by the Cylons, she confesses her mistake to Lee. He is devastated. [[Act of Contrition (Battlestar Galactica)|Later]], he confronts her about it when she is chosen to train new Viper pilots aboard ''Galactica'' after several pilots are killed in a freak accident. The quality of recruits she is sent is subpar but still she begins their training, ordering them to call her \"God\". Starbuck, blinded by guilt, washes all the pilots out for relatively minor flaws. She then admits her secret to Adama who is furious and heartbroken; he orders her to reinstate the trainees.\n\nOn the next training mission, Starbuck and the trainees are ambushed by a small group of [[Cylon Raider]]s. Starbuck engages the Raiders on her own to cover the trainees' escape. With her Viper heavily damaged, she plummets toward the surface of a nearby desert moon, and is forced to eject and take her chances on the surface.\n\nStarbuck is declared \"missing in action\", and Adama orders a search and rescue operation which strains the ''Galactica''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew and combat resources. [[You Can't Go Home Again (Battlestar Galactica)|On the surface]], Starbuck struggles with a broken knee and near asphyxiation as her oxygen runs out. Luckily, she discovers the Cylon Raider she downed. Using her exceptional skill in flying, she figures out the Cylon technology and is able to pilot it back to the fleet.\n\nDepressed by her injuries, she initially needs incentive to work on rehabilitation and is soon rubbing people the wrong way again. Even after she is able to move around without a cane, the injury sidelines her from flight for many episodes; when given tactical charge of a mission in one episode, she cannot fly the critical role because her knee still can't handle the G-force.\n\nDuring her recovery, a [[Leoben Conoy|Number Two]] named Leoben is discovered aboard the ''Gemenon Traveller'' and is arrested. Adama assigns Starbuck to interrogate Leoben, believing she will be resistant to his mind games. Starbuck brutally interrogates Leoben, and he claims to have hidden a nuclear bomb on a timer somewhere in the fleet, threatening its detonation. Despite her often crude exterior, Starbuck is revealed to have a deep-seated faith in the gods, and engages in a debate about the existence of the Colonial gods vs. the Cylon god with Leoben, and whether the humanoid Cylons are actually \"human\". Leoben demonstrates that he is capable of breaking free and killing Starbuck at any time, but chooses not to, believing it is not God's will. During this period, Starbuck develops a respect for Leoben, and he falls in love with her. She is genuinely saddened when President [[Laura Roslin]] orders him executed by airlock, after he admits there is no bomb. She experiences a brief moment of emotional connection with Leoben when they touch palms through the glass of the airlock before he is executed. Afterwards, she privately prays to the Lords of Kobol, acknowledging that Leoben might not have had a soul, but if he did, asking that they take care of it.\n\nStarbuck's religious beliefs later come into play when President Roslin asks her to carry out a dangerous mission: return to Caprica and retrieve the [[Arrow of Apollo]], a religious artifact supposedly pointing the way to [[Earth]]. Starbuck is at first reluctant, believing that Adama already knows the way to Earth, and is leading them there. Roslin is forced to reveal that Adama lied about knowing Earth's whereabouts to give the fleet hope. This deeply shakes Starbuck's trust in Adama, and she eventually is convinced to help Roslin. She takes the Cylon Raider she had captured, leading Adama to declare Roslin had suborned mutiny; he sends a detachment of Marines to terminate her presidency.\n\nDuring her time on Caprica, Starbuck encounters a [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] (who beats her soundly), but manages to kill the Cylon out of sheer luck. She then meets up with [[Karl Agathon|Karl \"Helo\" Agathon]] (a close friend she believed dead after he stayed on Caprica) and the [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon Valerii]] copy pregnant with his child. Immediately realizing that Sharon is a Cylon, she attempts to kill her, while Helo stops her. This causes Sharon to flee in the stolen Raider, abandoning Starbuck and Helo. While attempting to find an alternative route off Caprica, they meet a resistance group that had been waging guerrilla war against the Cylons, led by fellow pyramid player [[Samuel Anders]]. Kara and Anders develop a bond over their shared past as pyramid players, and develop a romantic relationship. At one point Starbuck is injured in battle, captured, and wakes up in a Cylon \"farm\" as part of their experiments to create human/Cylon hybrids, but is originally led to believe she is in a hospital run by the resistance. A Cylon named [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]], posing as a doctor, experiments on her, claiming to be treating her for internal injuries, and keeps her in a drugged state. Without her knowledge, apparently one of her ovaries is surgically removed before she escapes; a fact discovered only much later. Starbuck escapes with the help of the resistance, killing Simon. Sharon returns with a Cylon Heavy Raider, and Starbuck plans to return to the fleet with her and Helo. However, she personally promises Anders that she will return with reinforcements to rescue the Resistance, giving Anders her dog tags as part of her promise.\n\nShe, Helo, and Sharon arrive on the planet [[Kobol]], joining Roslin in her search for the Tomb of Athena. Sharon is able to guide them to the tomb, and Adama joins them. They are able to place the Arrow of Apollo in the tomb, and gain a rudimentary map to Earth.\n\nSoon after returning to Galactica, the ''Battlestar Pegasus'', commanded by Rear Admiral Helena Cain, is discovered. Cain promotes Starbuck to Captain and assigns her as the [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]] of the ''Pegasus''.\n\nAfter the fleet leadership denies her request to return to rescue the Caprican resistance fighters, Starbuck is depressed and guilt-stricken: she has broken her word, failed her duty, and assumes the man she is \"hung up on\" is either dead, or will be soon. As Pegasus CAG, she also feels responsible for the pilots who have died on her watch, or died because she has not yet killed the Cylon's \"top gun\", \"Scar\". She recklessly maneuvers to take out Scar, but at the last moment pulls away, setting up the kill for [[Louanne Katraine|Louanne \"Kat\" Katraine]] and giving up her own status as \"Top Gun\". Although this marks the beginning of a new resolve and the end of her self-destructive depressive behaviours, tensions between her and Apollo flare up again after she shoots him in a [[friendly fire]] incident during a hostage stand-off.\n\nAfter [[Lee Adama]]'s promotion to Commander and appointment as commander of the Battlestar ''Pegasus'', Starbuck transfers back to the ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' and assumes the role of its [[Commander, Air Group|CAG]].\n\n=== New Caprica ===\nThe complication of Starbuck and Lee's relationship was furthered when a drunken night on the newly found planet, [[New Caprica]], ended with Starbuck and Lee having a one-night stand where they both expressed their love for one another. When Lee woke up alone the next morning, he soon discovered Kara had proposed to and married Anders. Lee soon marries newly commissioned Lieutenant [[Anastasia Dualla]] while Starbuck moves planetside with Anders.\n\nAfter an all-night celebration of the first founder's day for New Caprica, tired and hungover, Starbuck and Tigh put their differences behind them. They even greet each other fondly following Tigh's demobilization and arrival at the colony. Her relationship with Lee, however, worsened to the point that they were not on speaking terms and he had little interest in helping her, even when Anders contracted a serious bout of pneumonia.\n\nAfter the Cylon invasion of New Caprica, she is imprisoned inside a mental facility, designed to look like her own former Caprican apartment. While there, a [[Leoben Conoy|Leoben]] model tries to convince her they are destined to be lovers. For four months Starbuck denies his advances, killing him several times despite knowing he would be back. Then she is presented with a young girl named Kacey that Leoben claims is their daughter, created with the ovary removed when she was in the egg farm. Initially she refuses to believe it and wants nothing to do with the girl, but when Kacey is badly injured in a fall down a staircase, she calls on Leoben for help and seems to grow more attached to both of them.  During the uprising on New Caprica, however, Starbuck once again kills Leoben and escapes with Kacey.\n\nIn the episode [[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)#Part II|\"Exodus\" Part II]], it is revealed Kacey is not Starbuck's child; the Cylons had abducted her. Kacey and her real mother are reunited on the ''Galactica'''s flight deck after the flight from New Caprica. Starbuck is left there alone on the flight deck, stunned and in disbelief.\n\n===Back with the fleet===\nAfter her situation on New Caprica and the truth about Kacey, she is left simmering with rage, which causes her to be reckless and destructive, almost killing herself in a Viper training exercise. After being removed from flight status by then-Major Lee Adama, she takes up residence in the pilot's mess along with Colonel Tigh, drinking and lowering the morale of ''Galactica'''s pilots by attempting to draw divisions between New Capricans and those who stayed with the fleet. Admiral Adama gives her an ultimatum; either straighten up and act like an officer, or 'get the hell off his ship' and find another ship to live on. Starbuck changes her attitude after Adama literally knocks her to the ground after she thumbs her nose at him.\n\nStarbuck's relationship with Lee Adama takes another dramatic turn after she angrily challenges him to a brutal and emotional boxing match aboard ''Galactica''. Their intense feelings for each other soon lead to an affair drawing resentment from their respective spouses. However, when Lee asks Starbuck to divorce Sam, she refuses due to her strong religious beliefs on the sacrament of marriage. Lee argues she is breaking her vows just by being with him, but Starbuck states she's merely [[bending the rules]]. Lee then decides he can no longer cheat while still married to Dualla. Later, Lee and Anders begin to voice their dislike for each other just as Starbuck's Raptor is shot down by the Cylons and she is reported missing. Anders vows to find her, but their position is outnumbered; Lee orders Anders at gunpoint to stay put and help defend their outnumbered position. Anders remains defiant.\n\nStarbuck suffers severe hand burns in the crash and is rescued by Dualla. After they escape the doomed algae planet, Starbuck makes one final effort to have a relationship with Lee, this time offering to leave Anders if he will leave Dualla. Lee chooses to try to make his own marriage work instead.\n\nKara's experiences with Leoben, as well as her troubled childhood, eventually come back to haunt her. She has nightmares involving both Leoben and the mandala supposedly connected to her \"destiny\". She asks an oracle about her dreams and is told Leoben understands her better than she understands herself, and he will show her \"destiny.\"\n\nDuring a patrol over a gas giant where the fleet is refueling, she sees a Cylon Raider and pursues it into a storm system which resembles her mandala. She is forced to abandon pursuit when her Viper is at risk of implosion from the pressure. Although she felt several impacts during her pursuit, then-[[Galen Tyrol|Chief Galen Tyrol]] finds no damage to her Viper and gun camera footage showed no evidence of any Raider, leading many to believe Kara had been hallucinating.\n\nAdama is concerned Kara might have burned out, but he leaves the decision to ground her up to Apollo as CAG. Apollo decides to give her another chance, and offers to fly as her wingman on her next patrol. During the patrol, Starbuck sees another Raider and again pursues. Her Viper is hit by debris and she is knocked out. She experiences a conversation with an [[Avatar]] with the appearance of Leoben set in her apartment on Caprica. The avatar forces Kara to confront her past, the abuse she received from her mother and the guilt she feels for leaving her mother to die alone. The avatar comments Kara has been running from her past just as she has been running away from death for her entire life, and implies eventually she will have to confront her fears and her \"destiny\". Moments before regaining consciousness in her Viper, Kara realizes the person she is speaking to is not the Cylon Leoben Conoy, and states, \"You're not Leoben.\" The avatar grins and replies, \"Never said I was.\" She awakens in her Viper cockpit as Apollo is calling for her to break off and ascend, or the atmospheric pressure will kill her. Starbuck keeps flying into the storm, and tells Lee to leave her. She is encompassed by a white light and certain calmness. Apollo witnesses her Viper imploding, with no sign that she survived.\n\nIn the cliffhanger Season 3 finale, \"[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads, Part II]]\", Starbuck reappears in the same Viper that she was flying at the time she disappeared and is discovered by Apollo, appearing to be alive and well,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20043843,00.html |title=Cylon, Farewell, It's Time to Say Goodbye |magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= 2007-06-27|accessdate= March 16, 2011 |first=Adam B. |last=Vary}}</ref> but the reason for her sudden resurrection has yet to be revealed. She tells Apollo not to \"freak out\" it is really her and she has been to Earth, and will show them the way.\n\nKara returns in Season 4 believing she had only been absent for six hours, but Anders informs her she was really gone for two months. The crew is wary of her return except for Lee, who greets her with an enthusiastic and long hug, and is so grateful for her return he is willing to overlook the possibility she is a Cylon, and he may be willing to accept her even as a Cylon. This becomes evident in Lee's questioning of his father whether if it had been his son, Lee's brother, who returned, would it have made a difference whether he was Cylon or human. She experiences frustration upon her return to Galactica, as no one believes it is really her, and because of President Roslin's refusal to be guided by what she believes is a Cylon trick. The crew continues on the course Roslin had previously decided upon and move further away from the area Kara believes is Earth's true location. She attempts to encourage Adama to follow her suggestions, but when he refuses, she fears his being romantically linked to Roslin has unjustly influenced him. Feeling hopeless and fearing as they make more jumps farther away she will lose the \"feeling\" of Earth's location, she becomes desperate and holds President Roslin at gunpoint.\n\nDuring her standoff with the President, she tries to reason and appeal to the President's emotions. She hands the gun to Roslin and insists she shoot her if she really believes she is a Cylon, to which Roslin responds to by saying \"They made you perfect, didn't they?\" Roslin fires the gun, but misses Starbuck and hits a framed portrait of herself and Adama.\n\nStarbuck is thrown into the brig and has a hostile confrontation with Adama, who angrily says, \"You are so stupid you couldn't wait. You just lost your best ally. Now who is going to save you?\" She responds, \"Well, it certainly isn't you,\" and says she will fight to show them Earth's location until her death. She also accuses him of playing \"wet nurse\" to the president, to which he responds by throwing her to the floor and leaving her crying.\n\nLater, after Adama attempts to have a conversation with Roslin, which turns into a psychological sparring argument, he rethinks his decision and allows Kara to secretly look for Earth on a barge called ''Demetrius''.\n\n=== Aboard ''Demetrius'' - Looking for Earth ===\nAfter taking command of ''Demetrius'' to find a way to Earth, Starbuck finds herself at odds with the crew when her orders cause them to doubt her command ability. With only two days remaining until the ship must return to the Fleet, her command is further compromised by her refusal to explain her actions and her decision to bring the Cylon Leoben aboard after having found him in a damaged Cylon Heavy Raider. Eventually, she finds herself torn between following Leoben's advice to forge an alliance with the fragmented Cylons, or distrusting him because of what that risk entails. The tension with the crew leads to a mutiny, after which Kara acknowledges her errors and instead takes a small crew with her in a Raptor to visit the base ship. There, she meets with the base star's hybrid and is told, \"You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. You will lead them all to their end.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/battlestar-galactica-sackhoff-41775.aspx |title=Katee Sackhoff on the Battlestar Finale: \"I Want Closure\" |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate= March 16, 2011}}</ref> This echoes the warning given by the first hybrid to Kendra Shaw at the conclusion of ''[[Battlestar Galactica: Razor|Razor]]''.\n\n=== Earth ===\nIn \"[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]\", Starbuck and Leoben look for the Colonial beacon which led them to Earth. They find wreckage of a Viper with Starbuck's tail number and what appears to be her charred corpse.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Battlestar-Galactica-Cylon-1001754.aspx |title=And the Last Cylon Is... |magazine=[[TV Guide]] |accessdate= March 16, 2011}}</ref> Both Kara and Leoben are shocked by this discovery and do not understand what it means. After removing the [[dog tags]] and wedding ring, Kara asks \"If that's me lying there, then what am I?\". He responds by backing away, as if recoiling from the realization that she is indeed the \"Harbinger of Death.\" She returns to the wrecked Viper and, after carefully wrapping the remains in a parachute shawl, she incinerates the body on a funeral [[pyre]].\n\nStarbuck's description as \"the harbinger of death\" and Leoben's caution to her not to venture into the woods, \"you might not like what you find,\" were elements of the episode's homage to the original ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]''. [[List of characters in the Planet of the Apes films#Dr. Zaius|Dr. Zaius]] gave [[List of characters in the Planet of the Apes films#Taylor|Colonel Taylor]] the same warning, and instructed [[List of characters in the Planet of the Apes films#Cornelius|Dr. Cornelius]] to read from the sacred scrolls that man was the harbinger of death. Like Taylor, Starbuck was a human astronaut and military officer exploring a post-apocalyptic Earth.\n\n=== Mutiny ===\nIn \"[[The Oath (Battlestar Galactica)|The Oath]]\", Captain Thrace discovers civilians and a few mutinous Marines and crewmen arming themselves for battle. She rushes back to her quarters to prepare for battle, grabbing her sidearms and ammunition. Kara then finds Lieutenant Margaret \"Racetrack\" Edmondson, Charlie Conner, and a few others preparing to execute Lee Adama. She kills a Marine holding Adama and wounds Lieutenant Hamish \"Skulls\" McCall. Along with Lee Adama, Kara runs into several other loyal Colonials including President Roslin, Admiral Adama, and Colonel Tigh. While searching for Adama, Kara and Lee free loyalists found in the brig which includes Anders, who is then shot by a mutinous marine upon leaving. Kara, refusing to leave his side, pressures Lee and those who escaped to leave her in order for them to search for Adama.\n\n=== The song ===\nIn the episode \"[[Someone to Watch Over Me (Battlestar Galactica)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]\", Starbuck encounters a pianist in [[List of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining) locations#J|Joe's Bar]] who is trying to compose a new song. At first she becomes annoyed by his repetitious playing, stating he reminds her of her father when he did nothing but play the piano and she mentions how her father left her and her mother to pursue it as a career. Over the course of the episode, Starbuck befriends the pianist and ends up working with him to try to finish his song.\n\nToward the end, the piano player writes down the notes Starbuck hums out on a sheet of paper. The pattern reminds Starbuck of a drawing of colored dots the Cylon-Human child, [[Hera Agathon]] had given to her earlier. She lines the child's drawing up with the notes the composer had drawn and they match exactly.\n\nWhen Starbuck and the pianist play the notes, the song is instantly recognized by [[Saul Tigh]] and Tory Foster \u2013 who are sitting at a nearby table with [[Ellen Tigh]] \u2013 as the song (\"[[Music of Battlestar Galactica (reimagining)#All Along the Watchtower|All Along the Watchtower]]\") they heard in their heads when they learned they were the final Cylons. Ellen, of course, remembers it from Earth. A bewildered Saul asks Starbuck where she heard the song. Starbuck responds she played it as a kid and begins to mention her father, but stops short when she realizes the piano player, her father, was either a figment of her imagination or a vision.\n\nIn the episode \"[[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak, Part I]]\" Starbuck tries to get answers from Anders about the song, even turning notes into numbers to see if there is a mathematical solution.\n\nIn \"[[Daybreak (Battlestar Galactica)|Daybreak, Part II and III]]\", after getting the coordinates from Anders for the Cylon Colony, Starbuck joins in on the rescue mission for Hera. After saving Hera, and as the Colony is being destroyed, Starbuck is ordered by Admiral Adama to jump the ''Galactica'' away to safety. Although she has no coordinates, Adama tells her to make a blind jump to anywhere. Recalling the musical notes and the numbers she extrapolated from it, she inputs them into the computer; the resulting jump puts ''Galactica'' near a habitable planet the fleet decides to settle on. It is revealed this new planet is our world, some 150,000 years ago; Admiral Adama names it \"Earth\", believing it better matched the dream the fleet had been seeking than did the original Earth (which had been found destroyed by nuclear war).\n\nOnce settled on the world, Kara says a final goodbye to Admiral Adama and tells Lee she's leaving - her 'job is done', having indeed led the human race to their end (the end of their journey) - and will not be coming back.  Kara then disappears into thin air and is not seen again. Seeing her gone, Lee tells her ghost she \"won't be forgotten\", echoing a moment from the \"Daybreak\" episodes. What really happened to Kara is left ambiguous. According to Katee Sackhoff, \"So when she at the end was saying goodbye to [Anders], I think that she was saying goodbye to their bodily forms,\" she said. \"I think she knew, especially if he says, 'I'll see you on the other side,' I think she's with him. I think they're both dead, but I think she's with him.
