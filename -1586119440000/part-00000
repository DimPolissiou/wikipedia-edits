After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind. [[Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a broader [[hypercognitive]] ability of the human mind to register, monitor, and represent its own functioning.<ref>Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., & Spanoudis, G.

This is often characterized as the ability to \"put oneself into another's shoes\". Recent [[ethology|neuro-ethological]] studies of animal behaviour suggest that even rodents may exhibit ethical or empathetic abilities.<ref>de Waal, Franz B.M.

G. 1978\" /> The emerging field of [[social neuroscience]] has also begun to address this debate, by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks demanding the understanding of an intention, belief or other mental state in others.\n\nAn alternative account of theory of mind is given within [[Operant conditioning|operant]] psychology and provides significant [[empirical evidence]] for a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within what is called [[relational frame theory]]. According to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.<ref>Hayes, S.

Oakland, California: New Harbinger.</ref>\n\n==Philosophical and psychological roots==\nContemporary discussions of Theory of Mind have their roots in philosophical debate\u2014most broadly, from the time of Descartes' ''Second Meditation'', which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind. Most prominent recently are two contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature, to theory of mind: [[theory-theory]] and [[simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]]. The theory-theorist imagines a veritable theory\u2014\"folk psychology\"\u2014used to reason about others' minds. The theory is developed automatically and innately, though instantiated through social interactions.<ref>Carruthers, P. (1996). Simulation and self-knowledge: a defence of the theory-theory. In P. Carruthers & P.K. Smith, Eds. ''Theories of theories of mind.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>  It is also closely related to  [[Social perception|person perception]] and  [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]] from social psychology.\n\nThe intuitive assumption that others are minded is an apparent tendency we all share. We [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] non-human animals, inanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. [[Daniel Dennett]] referred to this tendency as taking an \"[[intentional stance]]\" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict future behavior.<ref>Dennett, D. (1987). The Intentional Stance. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref> However, there is an important distinction between taking an \"intentional stance\" toward something and entering a \"shared world\" with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.\n\nThe philosophical roots of the relational frame theory (RFT) account of Theory of Mind arise from contextual psychology and refer to the study of organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with a historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on contextualism, a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.<ref>{{cite web | title=Functional Contextualism | publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science | url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/functional_contextualism_0 | first=Eric | last=Fox | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the development of this ability in human [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], has identified several behavioral precursors to theory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with other people are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full-fledged theory. \n\n[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] identified the infant's understanding of attention in others, a social skill found by 7 to 9 months of age, as a \"critical precursor\" to the development of theory of mind.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\" /> Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as \"of interest\", and that seeing can induce beliefs. Attention can be directed and shared by the act of pointing, a joint attention behavior that requires taking into account another person's mental state, particularly whether the person notices an object or finds it of interest. {{anchor|protodeclarative}} Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest (\"protodeclarative pointing\") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention and interests of another may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\"/>\n\nUnderstanding of others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or \"aboutness\", is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The \"intentional stance\" has been defined by [[Daniel Dennett]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dennett | first1 = Daniel C. | year = 1987 | title = Reprint of Intentional systems in cognitive ethology: The Panglossian paradigm defended (to p. 260) | journal = The Brain and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 343\u2013390 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00016393}}</ref> as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires.

For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that is, that they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults.

Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.\n\nWhile much research has been done on infants, theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood and into late adolescence as the synapses (neuronal connections) in the prefrontal cortex develop. The prefrontal cortex is thought to be involved in planning and decision-making.<ref name=\"Laghi 2016 207\u2013216\">{{citation | last = Laghi | first = Fiorenzo | year = 2016 | title = The Role of Nice and Nasty Theory of Mind in Teacher-Selected Peer Models for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 207\u2013216 | doi = 10.1177/0748175615596784 | last2 = Lonigro | first2 = Antonia | last3 = Levanto | first3 = Simona | last4 = Ferraro | first4 = Maurizio | last5 = Baumgartner | first5 = Emma | last6 = Baiocco | first6 = Roberto }}</ref> Children seem to develop theory of mind skills sequentially. The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may have '''false beliefs''' and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in individualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later.<ref>{{citation | last = Etel | first = Evren | year = 2015 | title = Social Competence, Theory of Mind, and Executive Function in Institution-reared Turkish Children | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 519\u2013529 | doi = 10.1177/0165025414556095 | last2 = Yagmurlu | first2 = Bilge }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\nThere is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (''r'' = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Milligan|first=Karen|last2=Astington|first2=Janet Wilde|last3=Dack|first3=Lisa Ain | title = Language and theory of mind: meta-analysis of the relation between language ability and false-belief understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 622&ndash;646 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01018.x | pmid = 17381794 | date = March\u2013April 2007 | ref = harv }}</ref> One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2\u20135). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.\n\nPragmatic theories of communication<ref>{{Cite book|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Dan.|first=Sperber|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=Wilson, Deirdre.|isbn=978-0631198789|edition=  2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=32589501}}</ref> assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey. Since a verbal utterance is often underdetermined, and therefore, it can have different meanings depending on the actual context theory of mind abilities can play a crucial role in understanding the communicative and informative intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some empirical results<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=Gy\u00f6rgy|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|pmid=29934630|pmc=6015048|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.9534T}}</ref> suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners, which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.\n\nCarol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. One idea was that the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development. The belief is that this type of language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of others.<ref name=\"Miller child\">{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Carol A. | title = Developmental relationships between language and theory of mind | journal = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 142&ndash;154 | doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2006/014) | pmid = 16782686 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }} [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32501769/Miller_06_offprint.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1508793985&Signature=CJF5VXW6%2B%2FaiCFjyDr%2FfqeLHkh8%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_What_Is_a_Theory_of_Mind.pdf Pdf.]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref> This has been suggested empirically by findings indicating that participation in family discussion predict scores on theory of mind tasks,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffman | first1 = Ted | last2 = Slade | first2 = Lance | last3 = Crowe | first3 = Elena | title = The relation between children's and mothers' mental state language and theory-of-mind understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 734&ndash;751 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00435 | pmid = 12038548 | date = May\u2013June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://web.psy.otago.ac.nz/pdfs/Ted%27s%20PDF%27s/2002ChiDev.pdf Pdf.]</ref> as well as findings showing that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with their parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Woolfe | first1 = Tyron | last2 = Want | first2 = Stephen C. | last3 = Siegal | first3 = Michael | title = Signposts to development: theory of mind in deaf children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 768&ndash;778 | doi =  10.1111/1467-8624.00437| pmid = 12038550 | date = May\u2013June 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.70.4337 }} [http://www.tyronwoolfe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Signposts_Child_Development.pdf Pdf.]</ref>\n\nAnother explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a child's understanding of mental state words such as \"''think''\" and \"''believe''\". Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language.<ref name=\"Miller child\" /> Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Chris | last2 = Pure | first2 = Kiran | last3 = Furrow | first3 = David | title = Children's understanding of the modal expression of speaker certainty and uncertainty and its relation to the development of a representational theory of mind | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 722&ndash;730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02815.x | pmid = 2364747 | jstor = 1130957 | date = June 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nA third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence (\"Jimmy thinks the world is flat\") from its embedded complement (\"the world is flat\") and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development. Recognizing these sentential complements as being independent of one another is a relatively complex syntactic skill and has been shown to be related to increased scores on theory of mind tasks in children.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = de Villiers | first1 = Jill G. | last2 = Pyers | first2 = Jennie E.  | title = Complements to cognition: a longitudinal study of the relationship between complex syntax and false-belief-understanding | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1037&ndash;1060 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00073-4 | date = January\u2013March 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these hypotheses, there is also evidence that the neural networks between the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely connected. The temporoparietal junction has been shown to be involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well as perceive and reproduce words. The temporoparietal junction also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces, voices, and biological motion, in addition to theory of mind. Since all of these areas are located so closely together, it is reasonable to conclude that they work together.

Many researchers suggest that the theory of mind impairment is simply due to the normal decline in cognitive function.<ref>{{citation | last = Duval | first = C\u00e9line | year = 2011 | title = Age Effects on Different Components of Theory of Mind | journal = Consciousness and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 627\u2013642 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2010.10.025  | pmid = 21111637 | last2 = Piolino | first2 = Pascale | last3 = Benjanin | first3 = Alexandre | last4 = Eustache | first4 = Francis | last5 = Desgranges | first5 = B\u00e9atrice}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultural variations ===\nResearchers have proposed that five key aspects of theory of mind develop sequentially for all children between the ages of three to five.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Henry M.|last2=Liu|first2=David|date=2004-03-01|title=Scaling of Theory-of-Mind Tasks|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=75|issue=2|pages=523\u2013541|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00691.x|pmid=15056204|issn=1467-8624}}</ref> This five-step theory of mind scale consists of the development of diverse desires (DD), diverse beliefs (DB), knowledge access (KA), false beliefs (FB), and hidden emotions (HE).<ref name=\":2\" /> Australian, American and European children acquire theory of mind in this exact order,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Shahaeian|first=Ameneh|last2=Peterson|first2=Candida C.|last3=Slaughter|first3=Virginia|last4=Wellman|first4=Henry M.|title=Culture and the sequence of steps in theory of mind development.|journal=Developmental Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=5|pages=1239\u20131247|doi=10.1037/a0023899|pmid=21639620|year=2011}}</ref> and studies with children in Canada, India, Peru, Samoa, and Thailand indicate that they all pass the false belief task at around the same time, suggesting that the children develop theory of mind consistently around the world.<ref>Callaghan, T., Rochat, P., Lillard, A., Claux, M.

Because of these different cultural values, Iranian and Chinese children might take longer to understand that other people have different beliefs and opinions. This suggests that the development of theory of mind is not universal and solely determined by innate brain processes but also influenced by social and cultural factors.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Empirical investigation==\nWhether children younger than 3 or 4 years old may have any theory of mind is a topic of debate among researchers. It is a challenging question, due to the difficulty of assessing what pre-linguistic children understand about others and the world.  Tasks used in research into the development of Theory of Mind must take into account the ''[[umwelt]]''\u2014(the German word ''Umwelt'' means \"environment\" or \"surrounding world\")\u2014of the pre-verbal child.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== False-belief task ===\n\nOne of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is gaining the ability to attribute ''false belief'': that is, to recognize that others can have beliefs about the world that are diverging. To do this, it is suggested, one must understand how knowledge is formed, that people's beliefs are based on their knowledge, that mental states can differ from reality, and that people's behavior can be predicted by their mental states. Numerous versions of the false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task done by Wimmer and Perner (1983).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}</ref>\n\nIn the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the [[Sally\u2013Anne test|\"'Sally-Anne' test\"]] or \"'Sally-Anne' task\"), children are told or shown a story involving two characters. For example, the child is shown two dolls, Sally and Anne, who have a basket and a box, respectively. Sally also has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room. While she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.\n\nAnother example is when a boy leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that the boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.<ref name = Mitchell>{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Peter | contribution =  Acquiring a theory of mind | editor-last1 = Slater | editor-first1 = Alan | editor-last2 = Bremner | editor-first2 = J.

For instance, when they show [[hindsight bias]], defined as: \"the inclination to see events that have already happened as being more predictable than they were before they took place.\"<ref>Mitchell, P.

In the \"Unexpected contents\", or \"Smarties\" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called \"[[Smarties]]\". After the child guesses (usually) \"Smarties\", it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who has not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she responds that another person will think that \"Smarties\" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils.

While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (''e.g.'', a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action.  The examiner asks the child two control questions: \"When we first took the picture, where was the object?\" and \"Where is the object now?\".  The subject is also asked a \"false-photograph\" question: \"Where is the object in the picture?\" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: \"Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?\" and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized:  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards.  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with [[looking time]] as the dependent variable. For instance, 9-month-old infants prefer looking at behaviors performed by a human hand over those made by an inanimate hand-like object.<ref>Woodward, Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach, Cognition (1998)</ref> Other paradigms look at rates of imitative behavior, the ability to replicate and complete unfinished goal-directed acts,<ref name=\"Meltzoff, A. 1995\"/> and rates of pretend play.<ref name=\"Leslie, A.

Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being \"reliable\", compared to someone whose visual perception was \"unreliable\". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden. Infants who experienced the reliable looker were surprised and therefore looked longer when the person searched for the toy in the incorrect location compared to the correct location. In contrast, the looking time for infants who experienced the unreliable looker did not differ for either search locations. These findings suggest that 16-month-old infants can differentially attribute beliefs about a toy's location based on the person's prior record of visual perception.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/a0016715 |title=The effect of a looker's past reliability on infants' reasoning about beliefs |year=2009 |last1=Poulin-Dubois |first1=Diane |last2=Chow |first2=Virginia |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=1576\u201382 |pmid=19899915|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/d34efb3d2c99e90169a129bbcdee343b2f9dd6be }}</ref>\n\n==Deficits==\nThe theory of mind impairment describes a difficulty someone would have with perspective-taking.

He suggests that typically developing human beings, unlike autistic individuals, are born with a set of skills (such as social referencing ability) that later lets them comprehend and react to other people's feelings.  Other scholars emphasize that autism involves a specific developmental delay, so that autistic children vary in their deficiencies, because they experience difficulty in different stages of growth.

However, because the study used only six subjects with autism, and because the spatial resolution of PET imaging is relatively poor, these results should be considered preliminary.\n\nA subsequent fMRI study scanned normally developing adults and adults with HFA while performing a \"reading the mind in the eyes\" task: viewing a photo of a human's eyes and choosing which of two adjectives better describes the person's mental state, versus a gender discrimination control.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Baron-Cohen | first1 = Simon | display-authors = etal | title = Social intelligence in the normal and autistic brain: an fMRI study | journal = [[European Journal of Neuroscience]] | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 1891&ndash;1898 | doi = 10.1046/j.1460-9568.1999.00621.x | pmid = 10336657 | date = June 1999 | ref = harv }}</ref>  The authors found activity in [[orbitofrontal cortex]], STS, and amygdala in normal subjects, and found no amygdala activation and abnormal STS activation in subjects with autism.\n\nA more recent PET study looked at brain activity in individuals with HFA and Asperger syndrome while viewing Heider-Simmel animations (see above) versus a random motion control.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Castelli  | year = 2002 | title = Autism, Asperger syndrome and brain mechanisms for the attribution of mental states to animated shapes | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 125 | issue = Pt 8| pages = 1839\u20131849 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awf189 | pmid = 12135974 | first1 = F | last2 = Frith | first2 = C | last3 = Happ\u00e9 | first3 = F | last4 = Frith | first4 = U }}</ref>  In contrast to normally developing subjects, those with autism showed no STS or FFA activation, and significantly less mPFC and amygdala activation.  Activity in [[extrastriate cortex|extrastriate regions]] V3 and LO was identical across the two groups, suggesting intact lower-level visual processing in the subjects with autism.  The study also reported significantly less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group.  Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations in subjects with autism. A more informative analysis would be to compute functional connectivity after regressing out evoked responses from all-time series.\n\nA subsequent study, using the incongruent/congruent gaze-shift paradigm described above, found that in high-functioning adults with autism, posterior STS (pSTS) activation was undifferentiated while they watched a human shift gaze toward a target and then toward adjacent empty space.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pelphrey  | year = 2005 | title = Neural basis of eye gaze processing deficits in autism | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 128 | issue = Pt 5| pages = 1038\u20131048 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awh404 | pmid = 15758039 | first1 = K.

Both explanations involve an impairment in the ability to link eye gaze shifts with intentional explanations.  This study also found a significant anticorrelation between STS activation in the incongruent-congruent contrast and social subscale score on the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]], but not scores on the other subscales.\n\nIn 2011, an fMRI study demonstrated that the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=NeuroImage |year=2011 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=1832\u20131838 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.067 |pmid=21356316 |vauthors=Lombardo MV, Chakrabarti B, Bullmore ET, MRC AIMS Consortium, Baron-Cohen S |title=Specialization of right temporo-parietal junction for mentalizing and its relation to social impairments in autism }}</ref>  rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information, irrespective of whether it is about oneself or others.

While many theories make claims about its role in the development of human language and social cognition few of them specify in detail any evolutionary neurophysiological precursors. A recent theory claims that Theory of Mind has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2018).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0112-x |title=Theory of Mind: Towards an Evolutionary Theory |year=2018 |last=Tsoukalas |first=Ioannis |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38\u201366}}[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCwSs2TrvPwwSU8rDyUkvtLYAuYfylMD/view?usp=sharing Pdf.]</ref> Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.\n\n==Non-human==\n{{see also|Animal consciousness|Theory of mind in animals}}\n\nAn open question is whether other animals besides humans have a [[genetics|genetic]] endowment and [[social psychology|social]] environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind in the same way that human children do.<ref name=\"Premack, D. G. 1978\"/> This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]] or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], [[consciousness]] and [[qualia]]. One difficulty with non-human studies of theory of mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.\n\nNon-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). A study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.<ref name=\"Call, J. 1998\"/> Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition.

Different people may develop more, or less, effective theory of mind. [[Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] maintain that theory of mind is a byproduct of a broader [[hypercognitive]] ability of the human mind to register, monitor, and represent its own functioning.<ref>Demetriou, A., Mouyi, A., & Spanoudis, G.

This is often characterized as the ability to \"put oneself into another's shoes\". Recent [[ethology|neuro-ethological]] studies of animal behaviour suggest that even rodents may exhibit ethical or empathetic abilities.<ref>de Waal, Franz B.M. (2007), \"Commiserating Mice\" ''Scientific American'', 24 June 2007</ref> While empathy is known as emotional perspective-taking, theory of mind is defined as cognitive perspective-taking.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hynes|first=Catherine A.|last2=Baird|first2=Abigail A.|last3=Grafton|first3=Scott T.|title=Differential role of the orbital frontal lobe in emotional versus cognitive perspective-taking|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=44|issue=3|pages=374\u2013383|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.06.011|pmid=16112148|year=2006}}</ref>\n\nResearch on theory of mind, in humans and animals, adults and children, normally and atypically developing, has grown rapidly in the 35 years since [[David Premack|Premack]] and Guy Woodruff's paper, \"Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?\".<ref name=\"Premack, D. G. 1978\" /> The emerging field of [[social neuroscience]] has also begun to address this debate, by imaging the brains of humans while they perform tasks demanding the understanding of an intention, belief or other mental state in others.\n\nAn alternative account of theory of mind is given within [[Operant conditioning|operant]] psychology and provides significant [[empirical evidence]] for a functional account of both perspective-taking and empathy. The most developed operant approach is founded on research on derived relational responding and is subsumed within what is called [[relational frame theory]]. According to this view, empathy and perspective-taking comprise a complex set of derived relational abilities based on learning to discriminate and respond verbally to ever more complex relations between self, others, place, and time, and through established relations.<ref>Hayes, S.

Oakland, California: New Harbinger.</ref>\n\n==Philosophical and psychological roots==\nContemporary discussions of Theory of Mind have their roots in philosophical debate\u2014most broadly, from the time of Descartes' ''Second Meditation'', which set the groundwork for considering the science of the mind. Most prominent recently are two contrasting approaches in the philosophical literature, to theory of mind: [[theory-theory]] and [[simulation theory of empathy|simulation theory]]. The theory-theorist imagines a veritable theory\u2014\"folk psychology\"\u2014used to reason about others' minds. The theory is developed automatically and innately, though instantiated through social interactions.<ref>Carruthers, P. (1996). Simulation and self-knowledge: a defence of the theory-theory. In P. Carruthers & P.K. Smith, Eds. ''Theories of theories of mind.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>  It is also closely related to  [[Social perception|person perception]] and  [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]] from social psychology.\n\nThe intuitive assumption that others are minded is an apparent tendency we all share. We [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] non-human animals, inanimate objects, and even natural phenomena. [[Daniel Dennett]] referred to this tendency as taking an \"[[intentional stance]]\" toward things: we assume they have intentions, to help predict future behavior.<ref>Dennett, D. (1987). The Intentional Stance. Cambridge: MIT Press.</ref> However, there is an important distinction between taking an \"intentional stance\" toward something and entering a \"shared world\" with it. The intentional stance is a detached and functional theory we resort to during interpersonal interactions. A shared world is directly perceived and its existence structures reality itself for the perceiver. It is not just automatically applied to perception; it in many ways constitutes perception.\n\nThe philosophical roots of the relational frame theory (RFT) account of Theory of Mind arise from contextual psychology and refer to the study of organisms (both human and non-human) interacting in and with a historical and current situational context. It is an approach based on contextualism, a philosophy in which any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context and in which a radically functional approach to truth and meaning is adopted. As a variant of contextualism, RFT focuses on the construction of practical, scientific knowledge. This scientific form of contextual psychology is virtually synonymous with the philosophy of operant psychology.<ref>{{cite web | title=Functional Contextualism | publisher=Association for Contextual Behavioral Science | url=http://www.contextualpsychology.org/functional_contextualism_0 | first=Eric | last=Fox | accessdate=March 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nThe study of which animals are capable of attributing knowledge and mental states to others, as well as the development of this ability in human [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]], has identified several behavioral precursors to theory of mind. Understanding attention, understanding of others' intentions, and imitative experience with other people are hallmarks of a theory of mind that may be observed early in the development of what later becomes a full-fledged theory. In studies with non-human animals and pre-verbal humans, in particular, researchers look to these behaviors preferentially in making inferences about mind.\n\n[[Simon Baron-Cohen]] identified the infant's understanding of attention in others, a social skill found by 7 to 9 months of age, as a \"critical precursor\" to the development of theory of mind.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\" /> Understanding attention involves understanding that seeing can be directed selectively as attention, that the looker assesses the seen object as \"of interest\", and that seeing can induce beliefs. Attention can be directed and shared by the act of pointing, a joint attention behavior that requires taking into account another person's mental state, particularly whether the person notices an object or finds it of interest. {{anchor|protodeclarative}} Baron-Cohen speculates that the inclination to spontaneously reference an object in the world as of interest (\"protodeclarative pointing\") and to likewise appreciate the directed attention and interests of another may be the underlying motive behind all human communication.<ref name=\"Baron-Cohen, S. 1991 pp. 233-251\"/>\n\nUnderstanding of others' intentions is another critical precursor to understanding other minds because intentionality, or \"aboutness\", is a fundamental feature of mental states and events. The \"intentional stance\" has been defined by [[Daniel Dennett]]<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dennett | first1 = Daniel C. | year = 1987 | title = Reprint of Intentional systems in cognitive ethology: The Panglossian paradigm defended (to p. 260) | journal = The Brain and Behavioral Sciences | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 343\u2013390 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00016393}}</ref> as an understanding that others' actions are goal-directed and arise from particular beliefs or desires.

For example, the infant uses his own experiences, orienting his head/eyes toward an object of interest to understand the movements of others who turn toward an object, that is, that they will generally attend to objects of interest or significance. Some researchers in comparative disciplines have hesitated to put a too-ponderous weight on imitation as a critical precursor to advanced human social-cognitive skills like mentalizing and empathizing, especially if true imitation is no longer employed by adults. A test of imitation by Alexandra Horowitz<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Horowitz | first1 = Alexandra C. | year = 2003 | title = Do humans ape? or Do apes human?

Horowitz points out that the precise psychological state underlying imitation is unclear and cannot, by itself, be used to draw conclusions about the mental states of humans.\n\nWhile much research has been done on infants, theory of mind develops continuously throughout childhood and into late adolescence as the synapses (neuronal connections) in the prefrontal cortex develop. The prefrontal cortex is thought to be involved in planning and decision-making.<ref name=\"Laghi 2016 207\u2013216\">{{citation | last = Laghi | first = Fiorenzo | year = 2016 | title = The Role of Nice and Nasty Theory of Mind in Teacher-Selected Peer Models for Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development | volume = 49 | issue = 3 | pages = 207\u2013216 | doi = 10.1177/0748175615596784 | last2 = Lonigro | first2 = Antonia | last3 = Levanto | first3 = Simona | last4 = Ferraro | first4 = Maurizio | last5 = Baumgartner | first5 = Emma | last6 = Baiocco | first6 = Roberto }}</ref> Children seem to develop theory of mind skills sequentially. The first skill to develop is the ability to recognize that others have diverse desires. Children are able to recognize that others have diverse beliefs soon after. The next skill to develop is recognizing that others have access to different knowledge bases. Finally, children are able to understand that others may have '''false beliefs''' and that others are capable of hiding emotions. While this sequence represents the general trend in skill acquisition, it seems that more emphasis is placed on some skills in certain cultures, leading to more valued skills to develop before those that are considered not as important. For example, in individualistic cultures such as the United States, a greater emphasis is placed on the ability to recognize that others have different opinions and beliefs. In a collectivistic culture, such as China, this skill may not be as important and therefore may not develop until later.<ref>{{citation | last = Etel | first = Evren | year = 2015 | title = Social Competence, Theory of Mind, and Executive Function in Institution-reared Turkish Children | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 39 | issue = 6 | pages = 519\u2013529 | doi = 10.1177/0165025414556095 | last2 = Yagmurlu | first2 = Bilge }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\nThere is evidence to believe that the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (''r'' = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Milligan|first=Karen|last2=Astington|first2=Janet Wilde|last3=Dack|first3=Lisa Ain | title = Language and theory of mind: meta-analysis of the relation between language ability and false-belief understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 622&ndash;646 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01018.x | pmid = 17381794 | date = March\u2013April 2007 | ref = harv }}</ref> One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2\u20135). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must be something else going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.\n\nPragmatic theories of communication<ref>{{Cite book|title=Relevance : communication and cognition|last=Dan.|first=Sperber|date=2001|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=Wilson, Deirdre.|isbn=978-0631198789|edition=  2nd|location=Oxford|oclc=32589501}}</ref> assume that infants must possess an understanding of beliefs and mental states of others to infer the communicative content that proficient language users intend to convey. Since a verbal utterance is often underdetermined, and therefore, it can have different meanings depending on the actual context theory of mind abilities can play a crucial role in understanding the communicative and informative intentions of others and inferring the meaning of words. Some empirical results<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Gergely|first2=Gy\u00f6rgy|date=2018-06-22|title=Communicative mind-reading in preverbal infants|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|pages=9534|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27804-4|pmid=29934630|pmc=6015048|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2018NatSR...8.9534T}}</ref> suggest that even 13-month-old infants have an early capacity for communicative mind-reading that enables them to infer what relevant information is transferred between communicative partners, which implies that human language relies at least partially on theory of mind skills.\n\nCarol A. Miller posed further possible explanations for this relationship. One idea was that the extent of verbal communication and conversation involving children in a family could explain theory of mind development. The belief is that this type of language exposure could help introduce a child to the different mental states and perspectives of others.<ref name=\"Miller child\">{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Carol A. | title = Developmental relationships between language and theory of mind | journal = American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 142&ndash;154 | doi = 10.1044/1058-0360(2006/014) | pmid = 16782686 | date = May 2006 | ref = harv }} [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32501769/Miller_06_offprint.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&Expires=1508793985&Signature=CJF5VXW6%2B%2FaiCFjyDr%2FfqeLHkh8%3D&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DA_What_Is_a_Theory_of_Mind.pdf Pdf.]{{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref> This has been suggested empirically by findings indicating that participation in family discussion predict scores on theory of mind tasks,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ruffman | first1 = Ted | last2 = Slade | first2 = Lance | last3 = Crowe | first3 = Elena | title = The relation between children's and mothers' mental state language and theory-of-mind understanding | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 734&ndash;751 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8624.00435 | pmid = 12038548 | date = May\u2013June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://web.psy.otago.ac.nz/pdfs/Ted%27s%20PDF%27s/2002ChiDev.pdf Pdf.]</ref> as well as findings showing that deaf children who have hearing parents and may not be able to communicate with their parents much during early years of development tend to score lower on theory of mind tasks.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Woolfe | first1 = Tyron | last2 = Want | first2 = Stephen C. | last3 = Siegal | first3 = Michael | title = Signposts to development: theory of mind in deaf children | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 768&ndash;778 | doi =  10.1111/1467-8624.00437| pmid = 12038550 | date = May\u2013June 2002 | ref = harv | citeseerx = 10.1.1.70.4337 }} [http://www.tyronwoolfe.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Signposts_Child_Development.pdf Pdf.]</ref>\n\nAnother explanation of the relationship between language and theory of mind development has to do with a child's understanding of mental state words such as \"''think''\" and \"''believe''\". Since a mental state is not something that one can observe from behavior, children must learn the meanings of words denoting mental states from verbal explanations alone, requiring knowledge of the syntactic rules, semantic systems, and pragmatics of a language.<ref name=\"Miller child\" /> Studies have shown that understanding of these mental state words predicts theory of mind in four-year-olds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Moore | first1 = Chris | last2 = Pure | first2 = Kiran | last3 = Furrow | first3 = David | title = Children's understanding of the modal expression of speaker certainty and uncertainty and its relation to the development of a representational theory of mind | journal = [[Child Development (journal)|Child Development]] | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 722&ndash;730 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8624.1990.tb02815.x | pmid = 2364747 | jstor = 1130957 | date = June 1990 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nA third hypothesis is that the ability to distinguish a whole sentence (\"Jimmy thinks the world is flat\") from its embedded complement (\"the world is flat\") and understand that one can be true while the other can be false is related to theory of mind development. Recognizing these sentential complements as being independent of one another is a relatively complex syntactic skill and has been shown to be related to increased scores on theory of mind tasks in children.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = de Villiers | first1 = Jill G. | last2 = Pyers | first2 = Jennie E.  | title = Complements to cognition: a longitudinal study of the relationship between complex syntax and false-belief-understanding | journal = Cognitive Development | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1037&ndash;1060 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2014(02)00073-4 | date = January\u2013March 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to these hypotheses, there is also evidence that the neural networks between the areas of the brain responsible for language and theory of mind are closely connected. The temporoparietal junction has been shown to be involved in the ability to acquire new vocabulary, as well as perceive and reproduce words. The temporoparietal junction also contains areas that specialize in recognizing faces, voices, and biological motion, in addition to theory of mind. Since all of these areas are located so closely together, it is reasonable to conclude that they work together.

It is a challenging question, due to the difficulty of assessing what pre-linguistic children understand about others and the world.  Tasks used in research into the development of Theory of Mind must take into account the ''[[umwelt]]''\u2014(the German word ''Umwelt'' means \"environment\" or \"surrounding world\")\u2014of the pre-verbal child.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\n=== False-belief task ===\n\nOne of the most important milestones in theory of mind development is gaining the ability to attribute ''false belief'': that is, to recognize that others can have beliefs about the world that are diverging. To do this, it is suggested, one must understand how knowledge is formed, that people's beliefs are based on their knowledge, that mental states can differ from reality, and that people's behavior can be predicted by their mental states. Numerous versions of the false-belief task have been developed, based on the initial task done by Wimmer and Perner (1983).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wimmer | first1 = H. | last2 = Perner | first2 = J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013128 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}</ref>\n\nIn the most common version of the false-belief task (often called the [[Sally\u2013Anne test|\"'Sally-Anne' test\"]] or \"'Sally-Anne' task\"), children are told or shown a story involving two characters. For example, the child is shown two dolls, Sally and Anne, who have a basket and a box, respectively. Sally also has a marble, which she places into her basket, and then leaves the room. While she is out of the room, Anne takes the marble from the basket and puts it into the box. Sally returns, and the child is then asked where Sally will look for the marble. The child passes the task if she answers that Sally will look in the basket, where Sally put the marble; the child fails the task if she answers that Sally will look in the box, where the child knows the marble is hidden, even though Sally cannot know this, since she did not see it hidden there. To pass the task, the child must be able to understand that another's mental representation of the situation is different from their own, and the child must be able to predict behavior based on that understanding.\n\nAnother example is when a boy leaves chocolate on a shelf and then leaves the room. His mother puts it in the fridge. To pass the task, the child must understand that the boy, upon returning, holds the false belief that his chocolate is still on the shelf.<ref name = Mitchell>{{citation | last = Mitchell | first = Peter | contribution =  Acquiring a theory of mind | editor-last1 = Slater | editor-first1 = Alan | editor-last2 = Bremner | editor-first2 = J.

In the \"Unexpected contents\", or \"Smarties\" task, experimenters ask children what they believe to be the contents of a box that looks as though it holds a candy called \"[[Smarties]]\". After the child guesses (usually) \"Smarties\", it is shown that the box in fact contained pencils. The experimenter then re-closes the box and asks the child what she thinks another person, who has not been shown the true contents of the box, will think is inside. The child passes the task if he/she responds that another person will think that \"Smarties\" exist in the box, but fails the task if she responds that another person will think that the box contains pencils.

The examiner asks the child two control questions: \"When we first took the picture, where was the object?\" and \"Where is the object now?\".  The subject is also asked a \"false-photograph\" question: \"Where is the object in the picture?\" The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object at the time of the question. However, the last question might be misinterpreted as: \"Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?\" and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nTo make it easier for animals, young children, and individuals with classical (Kanner-type) autism to understand and perform theory of mind tasks, researchers have developed tests in which verbal communication is de-emphasized:  some whose administration does not involve verbal communication on the part of the examiner, some whose successful completion does not require verbal communication on the part of the subject, and some that meet both of the foregoing standards.  One category of tasks uses a preferential looking paradigm, with [[looking time]] as the dependent variable.

Therefore, their looking-times measures would give researchers an indication of what infants might be inferring, or their implicit understanding of events. One recent study using this paradigm found that 16-month-olds tend to attribute beliefs to a person whose visual perception was previously witnessed as being \"reliable\", compared to someone whose visual perception was \"unreliable\". Specifically, 16-month-olds were trained to expect a person's excited vocalization and gaze into a container to be associated with finding a toy in the reliable-looker condition or an absence of a toy in the unreliable-looker condition. Following this training phase, infants witnessed, in an object-search task, the same persons either searching for a toy in the correct or incorrect location after they both witnessed the location of where the toy was hidden.

The study also reported significantly less functional connectivity between STS and V3 in the autism group.  Note, however, that decreased temporal correlation between activity in STS and V3 would be expected simply from the lack of an evoked response in STS to intent-laden animations in subjects with autism.

This study also found a significant anticorrelation between STS activation in the incongruent-congruent contrast and social subscale score on the [[Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised]], but not scores on the other subscales.\n\nIn 2011, an fMRI study demonstrated that the right [[temporoparietal junction]] (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other.<ref>{{vcite journal |journal=NeuroImage |year=2011 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=1832\u20131838 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.067 |pmid=21356316 |vauthors=Lombardo MV, Chakrabarti B, Bullmore ET, MRC AIMS Consortium, Baron-Cohen S |title=Specialization of right temporo-parietal junction for mentalizing and its relation to social impairments in autism }}</ref>  rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired.

A recent theory claims that Theory of Mind has its roots in two defensive reactions, namely immobilization stress and tonic immobility, which are implicated in the handling of stressful encounters and also figure prominently in mammalian childrearing practices (Tsoukalas, 2018).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0112-x |title=Theory of Mind: Towards an Evolutionary Theory |year=2018 |last=Tsoukalas |first=Ioannis |journal= Evolutionary Psychological Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 38\u201366}}[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CCwSs2TrvPwwSU8rDyUkvtLYAuYfylMD/view?usp=sharing Pdf.]</ref> Their combined effect seems capable of producing many of the hallmarks of theory of mind, e.g., eye-contact, gaze-following, inhibitory control and intentional attributions.\n\n==Non-human==\n{{see also|Animal consciousness|Theory of mind in animals}}\n\nAn open question is whether other animals besides humans have a [[genetics|genetic]] endowment and [[social psychology|social]] environment that allows them to acquire a theory of mind in the same way that human children do.<ref name=\"Premack, D. G. 1978\"/> This is a contentious issue because of the problem of inferring from [[ethology|animal behavior]] the existence of [[thought|thinking]] or of particular thoughts, or the existence of a concept of [[self (psychology)|self]] or [[self-awareness]], [[consciousness]] and [[qualia]]. One difficulty with non-human studies of theory of mind is the lack of sufficient numbers of naturalistic observations, giving insight into what the evolutionary pressures might be on a species' development of theory of mind.\n\nNon-human research still has a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points in the evolution of what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). A study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.<ref name=\"Call, J. 1998\"/> Part of the difficulty in this line of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, as it is in the nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using [[plover]]s<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ristau |first1=Carolyn A. |year=1991 |chapter=Aspects of the cognitive ethology of an injury-feigning bird, the piping plovers |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKzhZYiQfZEC&pg=PA91 |editor1-first=Carolyn A. |editor1-last=Ristau |title=Cognitive Ethology: Essays in Honor of Donald R.

The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more \"mature\" films. After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called \"[[L.A. 2017]]\". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'', before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films).\n\nBased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''. The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases the terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called ''[[Savage (1973 TV film)|Savage]]'', starring [[Martin Landau]]. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|223}} However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.\n\nStudio producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel [[Jaws (novel)|about an enormous killer shark]]. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs. But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as \"Jawsmania.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|248}} ''Jaws'' made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|250}} It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]].\n\nRejecting offers to direct ''[[Jaws 2]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|year=1997|title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography|location=London|publisher=Harper Collins|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145 145]|isbn=978-0-00-638444-1|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145}}</ref> ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], which became ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War&nbsp;II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4&nbsp;million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1979/01941.php \"1941, Box Office Information.\"] ''The Numbers'', September 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nSpielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.\n\n===1980s===\nNext, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]]). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). ''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blade Runner|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820185400/https://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|archivedate=August 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. ''E.T.'' went on to become the top-grossing film of all time.

Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'' led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]] due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, ''Temple of Doom'' is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984.

Starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and future talk-show superstar [[Oprah Winfrey]], the film was a box office smash and critics hailed Spielberg's successful foray into the dramatic genre. [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his Great Films archive. The film received eleven [[Academy Award]] nominations, including two for Goldberg and Winfrey. However, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination.\n\nIn 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]] and a young [[Christian Bale]]. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues.

Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor [[Sean Connery]] in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] for the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, ''Always'' was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Steven Spielberg in 1990.jpg|thumb|left|Spielberg in March 1990]]\nIn 1991, Spielberg directed ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', about a middle-aged [[Peter Pan]], played by [[Robin Williams]], who returns to [[Neverland]]. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300&nbsp;million worldwide (from a $70&nbsp;million budget).\n\nIn 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend [[George Lucas]]'s [[Industrial Light & Magic]] company, the film would eventually become the highest-grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7&nbsp;million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest-grossing film ever.\n\nSpielberg's next film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', was based on the true story of [[Oskar Schindler]], a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.<ref>The screenplay, adapted from [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel, was originally in the hands of fellow director [[Martin Scorsese]], but Spielberg negotiated with Scorsese to trade scripts.

In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.\n\nIn 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]],<ref>{{cite magazine|author = Army Archered|title = Spielberg to take break after completing 'List'|magazine = Variety|date = June 17, 1993|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|accessdate = February 11, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203554/http://variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|archive-date = October 11, 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> with partners [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]].

The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481&nbsp;million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with [[Paramount Pictures]] (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the ''Indiana Jones'' series). Later, Spielberg and [[Tom Hanks]] produced a [[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] based on [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]''. The ten-part [[HBO]] mini-series follows Easy Company of the [[101st Airborne Division]]'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment.

In 2005, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked Spielberg number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time.\n\nAlso in 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks), based on the H. G. Wells book of the same name (Spielberg had been a huge fan of the book and the original 1953 film). It starred Tom Cruise and [[Dakota Fanning]], and, as with past Spielberg films, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) provided the [[visual effects]]. Unlike ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', which depicted friendly alien visitors, ''War of the Worlds'' featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nSpielberg's film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', about the events following the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being ''Schindler's List''). The film is based on ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'', a book by Canadian journalist [[George Jonas]]. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''. The film received strong critical praise, but underperformed at the U.S. and world box-office; it remains one of Spielberg's most controversial films to date.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Yossi Melman and Steven Hartov|date=January 17, 2006|title=Munich: Fact and Fantasy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1687815,00.html|publisher=The Guardian Unlimited|volume=|accessdate=April 10, 2018|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> ''Munich'' received five Academy Awards nominations, including Best Picture, Film Editing, Original Music Score (by John Williams), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg.

Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. <!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series. : Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an \"ordinary character\"-->In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,<ref name=\"McBride\">{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 978-0-571-19177-2}}</ref> and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.<ref>{{cite book| title = E.T. DVD Production Notes Booklet| publisher = Universal|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nA strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''. According to Warren Buckland,<ref>Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster</ref> these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''. Each of his films feature this shot utilized by the director, and the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.\n\nThe most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The absence of Elliott's father in ''E.T.'' is the most famous example of this theme. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife. In ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', the main character, Celie, has been impregnated by her father multiple times. ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, including ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.\n\nMost of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Though some critics accuse his films of being a little overly sentimental, Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} He is still a highly praised director as well as being credited as one of the most influential directors of all time. The influence comes from directors [[Frank Capra]] and [[John Ford]].<ref name=\"culture show\">{{cite video| title = The Culture Show| medium = TV|publisher=BBC|date = November 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Marriages and children ===\nSpielberg met actress [[Amy Irving]] in 1976 at the suggestion of director [[Brian De Palma]], who knew he was looking for an actress to play in ''Close Encounters''. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer [[Julia Phillips]], \"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|293}} Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his \"bachelor funky\" house.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|294}} They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship. Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: \"I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend,\" she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|295}} As a result, they broke up in 1979, but remained close friends. Then in 1984 they renewed their romance, and in November 1985 they married, after the birth of their son, Max Samuel. But after 3 1/2 years of marriage, many of the same competing stresses of their careers caused them to divorce in 1989. They agreed to maintain homes near each other to facilitate the shared custody and parenting of their son.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|403}} Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history.<ref>{{cite news|title = 'Most costly' celebrity divorces|work=BBC News|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6552597.stm|date = April 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSpielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress [[Kate Capshaw]], whom he met when he cast her in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.

In it, he discussed Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker, saying \"there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films\" and that \"Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious\", concluding that he has only received \"limited, begrudging recognition\" from critics.<ref name=\"Rowley\" />\n*[[Shia LaBeouf]], who worked with Spielberg on a number of films including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and various [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] productions (such as the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]), described his experiences working with the director in a wide-ranging interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in 2016. He stated, \"I grew up with this idea, [that] if you got to Spielberg, that's where it is \u2013 I'm not talking about fame, and I'm not talking about money. You get there, and you realize you're not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. You're meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. He's less a director than he is a fucking company.\" He went on to discuss his on-set actor/director relationship with Spielberg, as well as the films they made together, \"Spielberg's sets are very different \u2013 everything has been so meticulously planned. You got to get this line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what you're doing for a living.\" He concluded his point by stating: \"I don't like the movies that I made with Spielberg. The only movie that I liked that we made together was [the first] ''Transformers'' [film].\" Later in the interview, LaBeouf recited and criticised the advice given to him by Spielberg following the mixed reaction to both ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', and LaBeouf's performance in the film. He claims Spielberg told him not to read about himself in the media, but LaBeouf felt irritated by what he perceived to be non-advice and a lack of understanding, saying \"There's no way to not do that. For me to not read that means I need to not take part in society. The generation previous to mine didn't have the immediate response [of the internet].

After this, and an episode of ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of ''[[The Name of the Game (TV series)|The Name of the Game]]'' called \"[[L.A. 2017]]\". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on ''Night Gallery'' and did some work for shows such as ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]'' and ''The Psychiatrist'', before landing the first series episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' (previous episodes were actually TV films).\n\nBased on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a [[Richard Matheson]] adaptation called ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]''. The film is about a psychotic [[Peterbilt 281]] [[tanker truck]] driver who chases the terrified driver ([[Dennis Weaver]]) of a small [[Plymouth Valiant]] and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic [[Dilys Powell]] was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (''[[Something Evil]]'') was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called ''[[Savage (1973 TV film)|Savage]]'', starring [[Martin Landau]]. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|223}} However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.\n\nStudio producers [[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]] offered Spielberg the director's chair for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', a thriller-horror film based on the [[Peter Benchley]] novel [[Jaws (novel)|about an enormous killer shark]]. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs. But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three Academy Awards (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing more than $470&nbsp;million worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as \"Jawsmania.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|248}} ''Jaws'' made Spielberg a household name and one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, allowing him a great deal of autonomy for his future projects.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|250}} It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]].\n\nRejecting offers to direct ''[[Jaws 2]]'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Baxter|first=John|year=1997|title=Steven Spielberg: The Unauthorised Biography|location=London|publisher=Harper Collins|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145 145]|isbn=978-0-00-638444-1|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780006384441/page/145}}</ref> ''[[King Kong (1976 film)|King Kong]]'' and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]], which became ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, ''Close Encounters'' was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other [[Academy Awards]] nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, [[Vilmos Zsigmond]], and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'', a big-budgeted World War&nbsp;II farce, was not nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4&nbsp;million worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics.<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1979/01941.php \"1941, Box Office Information.\"] ''The Numbers'', September 27, 2012.</ref>\n\nSpielberg then revisited his ''Close Encounters'' project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released ''Close Encounters: The Special Edition'' in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.\n\n===1980s===\nNext, Spielberg teamed with ''[[Star Wars]]'' creator and friend [[George Lucas]] on an action adventure film, ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', the first of the [[Indiana Jones]] films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by [[Harrison Ford]] (whom Lucas had previously cast in his ''[[Star Wars]]'' films as [[Han Solo]]). The film was considered an homage to the cliffhanger serials of the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]]. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). ''Raiders'' is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre. The film also led to Ford's casting in [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blade Runner|url=http://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820185400/https://www.gradesaver.com/blade-runner/wikipedia/casting-and-characters/|archivedate=August 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. ''E.T.'' went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. It was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, winning 4 of them.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/et-spielberg-fantasy|title=ET: The Extra-Terrestrial: No 7 best sci-fi and fantasy film of all time|last=Wise|first=Damon|date=October 21, 2010|work=The Guardian|access-date=October 18, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\nBetween 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: ''[[Poltergeist (1982 film)|Poltergeist]]'' (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie|The Twilight Zone]]'' (for which he directed the segment \"Kick The Can\"),<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1556111/story.jhtml|title= Rewind: Major-Studio flicks that belong in the Grind House|first = Karl|last = Heitmueller|date = April 3, 2007|accessdate =January 2, 2009|publisher = MTV|quote = Ultimate A-lister Steven Spielberg co-produced this big-budget adaptation of Rod Serling's classic '60s TV show....}}</ref> and ''[[The Goonies]]'' (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).<ref>{{cite journal|title = This way to the children's crusade|first = Richard|last = Corliss|date = January 7, 1985|accessdate =January 2, 2009|quote = he wrote the story and served as an executive producer of The Goonies....|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959559,00.html|journal = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref> Spielberg appeared in a cameo on [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s music video for the movie's theme song, \"[[The Goonies 'R' Good Enough]]\".<ref>{{youtube|LxLhytQ67fs|Cyndi Lauper \u2013 The Goonies 'R' Good Enough}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Steven Spielberg and [[Chandran Rutnam]] on a location in Sri Lanka during the filming of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.]]\nHis next directorial feature was the ''Raiders'' prequel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced ''[[Gremlins]]'' led to the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13 rating]] due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, ''Temple of Doom'' is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984. It was on this project that Spielberg also met his future wife, actress [[Kate Capshaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|title=Steven Spielberg Biography|publisher=Biography.com|date=December 18, 1947|accessdate=January 31, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514201106/https://www.biography.com/articles/Steven-Spielberg-9490621|archivedate=May 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Spielberg released ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]],'' an adaptation of [[Alice Walker]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Color Purple|novel of the same name]], about a generation of empowered African-American women during depression-era America. Starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and future talk-show superstar [[Oprah Winfrey]], the film was a box office smash and critics hailed Spielberg's successful foray into the dramatic genre. [[Roger Ebert]] proclaimed it the best film of the year and later entered it into his Great Films archive. The film received eleven [[Academy Award]] nominations, including two for Goldberg and Winfrey. However, Spielberg did not get a Best Director nomination.\n\nIn 1987, as China began opening to Western capital investment, Spielberg shot the first American film in Shanghai since the 1930s, an adaptation of [[J. G. Ballard]]'s autobiographical novel ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', starring [[John Malkovich]] and a young [[Christian Bale]]. The film garnered much praise from critics and was nominated for several Oscars, but did not yield substantial box office revenues. Reviewer [[Andrew Sarris]] called it the best film of the year and later included it among the best films of the decade.<ref>{{cite web| title = Andrew Sarris' Top 10 lists 1958\u20132005| url = http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/sarris.html#y1977| accessdate = October 21, 2006| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010210193008/http://alumnus.caltech.edu/~ejohnson/critics/sarris.html#y1977| archive-date = February 10, 2001| url-status=dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Spielberg was also a co-producer of the 1987 film ''[[Batteries Not Included|*batteries not included]]''.\n\nAfter two forays into more serious dramatic films, Spielberg then directed the third Indiana Jones film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]''. Once again teaming up with Lucas and Ford, Spielberg also cast actor [[Sean Connery]] in a supporting role as Indy's father. The film earned generally positive reviews and was another box office success, becoming the highest-grossing film worldwide that year; its total box office receipts even topped those of Tim Burton's much-anticipated film ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which had been the bigger hit domestically. Also in 1989, he re-united with actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] for the romantic comedy-drama ''[[Always (1989 film)|Always]]'', about a daredevil pilot who extinguishes forest fires. Spielberg's first romantic film, ''Always'' was only a moderate success and had mixed reviews.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Steven Spielberg in 1990.jpg|thumb|left|Spielberg in March 1990]]\nIn 1991, Spielberg directed ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', about a middle-aged [[Peter Pan]], played by [[Robin Williams]], who returns to [[Neverland]]. Despite innumerable rewrites and creative changes coupled with mixed reviews, the film proved popular with audiences, making over $300&nbsp;million worldwide (from a $70&nbsp;million budget).\n\nIn 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with the film version of [[Michael Crichton]]'s novel ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', about a theme park with genetically engineered dinosaurs. With revolutionary special effects provided by friend [[George Lucas]]'s [[Industrial Light & Magic]] company, the film would eventually become the highest-grossing film of all time (at the worldwide box office) with $914.7&nbsp;million. This would be the third time that one of Spielberg's films became the highest-grossing film ever.\n\nSpielberg's next film, ''[[Schindler's List]]'', was based on the true story of [[Oskar Schindler]], a man who risked his life to save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust.<ref>The screenplay, adapted from [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel, was originally in the hands of fellow director [[Martin Scorsese]], but Spielberg negotiated with Scorsese to trade scripts. (At the time, Spielberg held the script for a remake of ''[[Cape Fear (1962 film)|Cape Fear]]''.)</ref> ''Schindler's List'' earned Spielberg his first [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (it also won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]]). With the film a huge success at the box office, Spielberg used the profits to set up the [[Shoah Foundation]], a non-profit organization that archives filmed testimony of Holocaust survivors. In 1997, the [[American Film Institute]] listed it among the 10 Greatest American Films ever Made (#9) which moved up to (#8) when the list was remade in 2007.\n\nIn 1994, Spielberg took a hiatus from directing to spend more time with his family and build his new studio, [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]],<ref>{{cite magazine|author = Army Archered|title = Spielberg to take break after completing 'List'|magazine = Variety|date = June 17, 1993|url = https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|accessdate = February 11, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011203554/http://variety.com/article/VR1117862199.html?categoryid=2&cs=1&query=dark+AND+angel|archive-date = October 11, 2007|url-status = dead}}</ref> with partners [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] and [[David Geffen]]. In 1996, he directed the sequel to 1993's ''Jurassic Park'' with ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'', which generated over $618&nbsp;million worldwide despite mixed reviews, and was the second biggest film of 1997 behind [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (which topped the original ''Jurassic Park'' to become the new recordholder for box office receipts).\n[[File:Steven Spielberg - GianAngelo Pistoia 1.jpg|thumb|right|Spielberg receiving the [[Golden Lion]] by Italian filmmaker [[Gillo Pontecorvo]] at the [[50th Venice International Film Festival]], 1993]]\n\nHis next film, ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', was based on a true story (like ''Schindler's List''), specifically about an African slave rebellion.

Miller ([[Tom Hanks]]) sent to bring home a [[paratrooper]] whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours, June 5\u20136, of the Normandy landing. The film was a huge box office success, grossing over $481&nbsp;million worldwide and was the biggest film of the year at the North American box office (worldwide it made second place after Michael Bay's ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]''). Spielberg won his second Academy Award for his direction. The film's graphic, realistic depiction of combat violence influenced later war films such as ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]''. The film was also the first major hit for DreamWorks, which co-produced the film with [[Paramount Pictures]] (as such, it was Spielberg's first release from the latter that was not part of the ''Indiana Jones'' series). Later, Spielberg and [[Tom Hanks]] produced a [[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|TV mini-series]] based on [[Stephen Ambrose]]'s book ''[[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]]''. The ten-part [[HBO]] mini-series follows Easy Company of the [[101st Airborne Division]]'s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. The series won a number of awards at the [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] and the [[Emmy Award|Emmys]].\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2001, Spielberg filmed fellow director and friend [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s final project, ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' which Kubrick was unable to begin during his lifetime. A futuristic film about a humanoid [[android (robot)|android]] longing for love, ''A.I.'' featured groundbreaking visual effects and a multi-layered, allegorical storyline, adapted by Spielberg himself. Though the film's reception in the US was relatively muted, it performed better overseas for a worldwide total box office gross of $236&nbsp;million.\n\nSpielberg and actor [[Tom Cruise]] collaborated for the first time for the futuristic [[neo-noir]] ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', based upon [[The Minority Report|the science fiction short story]] written by [[Philip K.

It received mixed reviews but performed relatively well at the box office. In 2005, ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine ranked Spielberg number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time.\n\nAlso in 2005, Spielberg directed a modern adaptation of ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'' (a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks), based on the H. G. Wells book of the same name (Spielberg had been a huge fan of the book and the original 1953 film). It starred Tom Cruise and [[Dakota Fanning]], and, as with past Spielberg films, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) provided the [[visual effects]]. Unlike ''E.T.'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind'', which depicted friendly alien visitors, ''War of the Worlds'' featured violent invaders. The film was another huge box office smash, grossing over $591&nbsp;million worldwide.\n\nSpielberg's film ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', about the events following the 1972 [[Munich Massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games, was his second film essaying Jewish relations in the world (the first being ''Schindler's List''). The film is based on ''[[Vengeance (Jonas book)|Vengeance]]'', a book by Canadian journalist [[George Jonas]]. It was previously adapted into the 1986 made-for-TV film ''[[Sword of Gideon]]''.

Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. <!-- This is especially evident in the [[Indiana Jones]] series. : Archaeologist, adventurer and relic hunter is not really an \"ordinary character\"-->In an [[American Film Institute|AFI]] interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood,<ref name=\"McBride\">{{cite book| last = McBride| first = Joseph| title = Steven Spielberg| publisher = Faber and Faber|year=1997| isbn = 978-0-571-19177-2}}</ref> and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.<ref>{{cite book| title = E.T. DVD Production Notes Booklet| publisher = Universal|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nA strong consistent [[theme (literature)|theme]] in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'', ''[[A.I. Artificial Intelligence]]'' and ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''. According to Warren Buckland,<ref>Directed by Steven Spielberg: Poetics of the Contemporary Hollywood Blockbuster</ref> these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'', ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'', ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', ''[[The Terminal]]'', ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'', and ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]''. Each of his films feature this shot utilized by the director, and the water scenes in ''Jaws'' are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In ''Empire of the Sun'', Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.\n\nThe most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in ''Hook'' starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of the film regains the respect of his children. The absence of Elliott's father in ''E.T.'' is the most famous example of this theme. In ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son \"self reliance,\" which is not how Indy saw it). Even [[Oskar Schindler]], from ''[[Schindler's List]]'', is reluctant to have a child with his wife. In ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', the main character, Celie, has been impregnated by her father multiple times. ''[[Munich (film)|Munich]]'' depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are exceptions; Brody in ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' is a committed family man, while John Anderton in ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore, to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, including ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'' (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (early in the film, another secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.\n\nMost of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Though some critics accuse his films of being a little overly sentimental, Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} He is still a highly praised director as well as being credited as one of the most influential directors of all time. The influence comes from directors [[Frank Capra]] and [[John Ford]].<ref name=\"culture show\">{{cite video| title = The Culture Show| medium = TV|publisher=BBC|date = November 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\n=== Marriages and children ===\nSpielberg met actress [[Amy Irving]] in 1976 at the suggestion of director [[Brian De Palma]], who knew he was looking for an actress to play in ''Close Encounters''. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer [[Julia Phillips]], \"I met a real heartbreaker last night.\"<ref name=McBride />{{rp|293}} Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his \"bachelor funky\" house.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|294}} They lived together for four years, but the stresses of their professional careers took a toll on their relationship. Irving wanted to be certain that whatever success she attained as an actress would be her own: \"I don't want to be known as Steven's girlfriend,\" she said, and chose not to be in any of his films during those years.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|295}} As a result, they broke up in 1979, but remained close friends. Then in 1984 they renewed their romance, and in November 1985 they married, after the birth of their son, Max Samuel. But after 3 1/2 years of marriage, many of the same competing stresses of their careers caused them to divorce in 1989. They agreed to maintain homes near each other to facilitate the shared custody and parenting of their son.<ref name=McBride />{{rp|403}} Their divorce was recorded as the third most costly celebrity divorce in history.<ref>{{cite news|title = 'Most costly' celebrity divorces|work=BBC News|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6552597.stm|date = April 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSpielberg subsequently developed a relationship with actress [[Kate Capshaw]], whom he met when he cast her in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]''.

In it, he discussed Spielberg's strengths as a filmmaker, saying \"there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films\" and that \"Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious\", concluding that he has only received \"limited, begrudging recognition\" from critics.<ref name=\"Rowley\" />\n*[[Shia LaBeouf]], who worked with Spielberg on a number of films including ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' and various [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] productions (such as the [[Transformers (film series)|''Transformers'' film series]]), described his experiences working with the director in a wide-ranging interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' in 2016. He stated, \"I grew up with this idea, [that] if you got to Spielberg, that's where it is \u2013 I'm not talking about fame, and I'm not talking about money. You get there, and you realize you're not meeting the Spielberg you dream of. You're meeting a different Spielberg, who is in a different stage in his career. He's less a director than he is a fucking company.\" He went on to discuss his on-set actor/director relationship with Spielberg, as well as the films they made together, \"Spielberg's sets are very different \u2013 everything has been so meticulously planned. You got to get this line out in 37 seconds. You do that for five years, you start to feel like not knowing what you're doing for a living.\" He concluded his point by stating: \"I don't like the movies that I made with Spielberg. The only movie that I liked that we made together was [the first] ''Transformers'' [film].\" Later in the interview, LaBeouf recited and criticised the advice given to him by Spielberg following the mixed reaction to both ''Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'', and LaBeouf's performance in the film. He claims Spielberg told him not to read about himself in the media, but LaBeouf felt irritated by what he perceived to be non-advice and a lack of understanding, saying \"There's no way to not do that. For me to not read that means I need to not take part in society. The generation previous to mine didn't have the immediate response [of the internet]. If you were Mark Hamill [in ''Star Wars''], you could lie to yourself.

{"title_page": "Optimizing compiler", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn [[computing]], an '''optimizing compiler''' is a [[compiler]] that tries to minimize or maximize some attributes of an [[executable]] computer program. Common requirements are to minimize a [[computer program|program]]'s execution time, [[memory (computers)|memory]] requirement, and [[Energy conservation|power]] consumption (the last two being popular for [[portable computer]]s).\n\nCompiler optimization is generally implemented using a sequence of ''optimizing transformations'', algorithms which take a program and transform it to produce a semantically equivalent output program that uses fewer resources and/or executes faster. It has been shown that some code optimization problems are [[NP-complete]], or even [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]. In practice, factors such as the [[programmer]]'s willingness to wait for the compiler to complete its task place upper limits on the optimizations that a compiler implementer might provide. (Optimization is generally a very [[CPU]]- and memory-intensive process.) In the past, computer memory limitations were also a major factor in limiting which optimizations could be performed. Because of these factors, optimization rarely produces \"optimal\" output in any sense, and in fact, an \"optimization\" may impede performance in some cases; rather, they are heuristic methods for improving resource usage in typical programs.\n\n== Types of optimization ==\nTechniques used in optimization can be broken up among various ''scopes'' which can affect anything from a single statement to the entire program. Generally speaking, locally scoped techniques are easier to implement than global ones but result in smaller gains. Some examples of scopes include:\n\n;[[Peephole optimization]]s: Usually performed late in the compilation process after [[machine code]] has been generated. This form of optimization examines a few adjacent instructions (like \"looking through a peephole\" at the code) to see whether they can be replaced by a single instruction or a shorter sequence of instructions. For instance, a multiplication of a value by&nbsp;2 might be more efficiently executed by [[Bit shift|left-shifting]] the value or by adding the value to itself (this example is also an instance of [[strength reduction]]).\n;Local optimizations: These only consider information local to a [[basic block]].<ref name=\"Cooper_2003\">{{cite book |author-first1=Keith D. |author-last1=Cooper |author-link1=Keith D. Cooper |author-first2=Linda |author-last2=Torczon |title=Engineering a Compiler |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] |date=2003 |orig-year=2002-01-01 |pages=404, 407 |isbn=978-1-55860-698-2}}</ref> Since basic blocks have no control flow, these optimizations need very little analysis (saving time and reducing storage requirements), but this also means that no information is preserved across jumps.\n;Global optimizations: These are also called \"intraprocedural methods\" and act on whole functions.<ref name=\"Cooper_2003\"/> This gives them more information to work with but often makes expensive computations necessary. Worst case assumptions have to be made when function calls occur or global variables are accessed (because little information about them is available).\n;[[Loop optimization]]s: These act on the statements which make up a loop, such as a ''for'' loop (e.g., [[loop-invariant code motion]]). Loop optimizations can have a significant impact because many programs spend a large percentage of their time inside loops.\n;{{anchor|Prescient store}}Prescient store optimizations: Allow store operations to occur earlier than would otherwise be permitted in the context of [[Threads (computer science)|threads]] and locks. The process needs some way of knowing ahead of time what value will be stored by the assignment that it should have followed. The purpose of this relaxation is to allow compiler optimization to perform certain kinds of code rearrangement that preserve the semantics of properly synchronized programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa245162(v=vs.60).aspx |title=MSDN - Prescient Store Actions |accessdate=2014-03-15 |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n;Interprocedural, whole-program or [[link-time optimization]]: These analyze all of a program's source code. The greater quantity of information extracted means that optimizations can be more effective compared to when they only have access to local information (i.e., within a single function). This kind of optimization can also allow new techniques to be performed. For instance, function [[inline expansion|inlining]], where a call to a function is replaced by a copy of the function body.\n;Machine code optimization and [[object code optimizer]]: These analyze the executable task image of the program after all of an executable machine code has been [[linker (computing)|linked]]. Some of the techniques that can be applied in a more limited scope, such as macro compression (which saves space by collapsing common sequences of instructions), are more effective when the entire executable task image is available for analysis.<ref name=\"MCO\">{{cite journal\n | type=Ph.D. dissertation\n | title=Machine Code Optimization - Improving Executable Object Code\n | author=Clinton F.

Thus similar optimization techniques can be used across languages. However, certain language features make some kinds of optimizations difficult. For instance, the existence of pointers in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] makes it difficult to optimize array accesses (see [[alias analysis]]). However, languages such as [[PL/1]] (that also supports pointers) nevertheless have available sophisticated optimizing compilers to achieve better performance in various other ways. Conversely, some language features make certain optimizations easier. For example, in some languages functions are not permitted to have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]]. Therefore, if a program makes several calls to the same function with the same arguments, the compiler can immediately infer that the function's result need be computed only once. In languages where functions are allowed to have side effects, another strategy is possible. The optimizer can determine which function has no side effects, and restrict such optimizations to side effect free functions. This optimization is only possible when the optimizer has access to the called function.\n;Machine independent vs. machine dependent: Many optimizations that operate on abstract programming concepts (loops, objects, structures) are independent of the machine targeted by the compiler, but many of the most effective optimizations are those that best exploit special features of the target platform. E.g.: Instructions which do several things at once, such as decrement register and branch if not zero.\n\nThe following is an instance of a local machine dependent optimization. To set a [[Processor register|register]] to 0, the obvious way is to use the constant '0' in an instruction that sets a register value to a constant. A less obvious way is to [[XOR]] a register with itself. It is up to the compiler to know which instruction variant to use. On many [[RISC]] machines, both instructions would be equally appropriate, since they would both be the same length and take the same time. On many other [[microprocessor]]s such as the [[Intel]] [[x86]] family, it turns out that the XOR variant is shorter and probably faster, as there will be no need to decode an immediate operand, nor use the internal \"immediate operand register\". (A potential problem with this is that XOR may introduce a data dependency on the previous value of the register, causing a [[instruction pipeline|pipeline]] stall. However, processors often have XOR of a register with itself as a special case that does not cause stalls.)\n\n== Factors affecting optimization ==\n;The machine itself: Many of the choices about which optimizations can and should be done depend on the characteristics of the target machine. It is sometimes possible to parameterize some of these machine dependent factors, so that a single piece of compiler code can be used to optimize different machines just by altering the machine description parameters. [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] is a compiler which exemplifies this approach.\n\n;The architecture of the target CPU: Number of [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[processor register|registers]]: To a certain extent, the more registers, the easier it is to optimize for performance. [[Local variable]]s can be allocated in the registers and not on the [[Call stack|stack]]. Temporary/intermediate results can be left in registers without writing to and reading back from memory.\n*[[RISC]] vs [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]]: CISC instruction sets often have variable instruction lengths, often have a larger number of possible instructions that can be used, and each instruction could take differing amounts of time. RISC instruction sets attempt to limit the variability in each of these: instruction sets are usually constant length, with few exceptions, there are usually fewer combinations of registers and memory operations, and the instruction issue rate (the number of instructions completed per time period, usually an integer multiple of the clock cycle) is usually constant in cases where memory latency is not a factor. There may be several ways of carrying out a certain task, with CISC usually offering more alternatives than RISC. Compilers have to know the relative costs among the various instructions and choose the best instruction sequence (see [[instruction selection]]).\n*[[Instruction pipeline|Pipelines]]: A pipeline is essentially a CPU broken up into an [[assembly line]]. It allows use of parts of the CPU for different instructions by breaking up the execution of instructions into various stages: instruction decode, address decode, memory fetch, register fetch, compute, register store, etc. One instruction could be in the register store stage, while another could be in the register fetch stage. Pipeline conflicts occur when an instruction in one stage of the pipeline depends on the result of another instruction ahead of it in the pipeline but not yet completed. Pipeline conflicts can lead to [[pipeline stall]]s: where the CPU wastes cycles waiting for a conflict to resolve.\n:Compilers can ''schedule'', or reorder, instructions so that pipeline stalls occur less frequently.\n* [[Superscalar|Number of functional units]]: Some CPUs have several [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALUs]] and [[floating point unit|FPUs]]. This allows them to execute multiple instructions simultaneously. There may be restrictions on which instructions can pair with which other instructions (\"pairing\" is the simultaneous execution of two or more instructions), and which functional unit can execute which instruction. They also have issues similar to pipeline conflicts.\n: Here again, instructions have to be scheduled so that the various functional units are fully fed with instructions to execute.\n\n;The architecture of the machine:\n* [[CPU cache|Cache]] size (256&nbsp;kiB\u201312&nbsp;MiB) and type (direct mapped, 2-/4-/8-/16-way associative, fully associative): Techniques such as [[inline expansion]] and [[loop unrolling]] may increase the size of the generated code and reduce code locality. The program may slow down drastically if a highly utilized section of code (like inner loops in various algorithms) suddenly cannot fit in the cache. Also, caches which are not fully associative have higher chances of cache collisions even in an unfilled cache.\n* Cache/Memory transfer rates: These give the compiler an indication of the penalty for cache misses. This is used mainly in specialized applications.\n\n;Intended use of the generated code:\n:;[[Debugging]]: While writing an application, a programmer will recompile and test often, and so compilation must be fast. This is one reason most optimizations are deliberately avoided during the test/debugging phase. Also, program code is usually \"stepped through\" (see [[Program animation]]) using a [[symbolic debugger]], and optimizing transformations, particularly those that reorder code, can make it difficult to relate the output code with the line numbers in the original source code. This can confuse both the debugging tools and the programmers using them.\n:;General purpose use: Prepackaged software is very often expected to be executed on a variety of machines and CPUs that may share the same instruction set, but have different timing, cache or memory characteristics. So, the code may not be tuned to any particular CPU, or may be tuned to work best on the most popular CPU and yet still work acceptably well on other CPUs.\n:;Special-purpose use: If the software is compiled to be used on one or a few very similar machines, with known characteristics, then the compiler can heavily tune the generated code to those specific machines (if such options are available). Important special cases include code designed for [[parallel computing|parallel]] and [[vector processor]]s, for which special [[parallelizing compiler]]s are employed.\n:;[[Embedded system]]s: These are a common case of special-purpose use. Embedded software can be tightly tuned to an exact CPU and memory size. Also, system cost or reliability may be more important than the code's speed. So, for example, compilers for embedded software usually offer options that reduce code size at the expense of speed, because memory is the main cost of an embedded computer. The code's timing may need to be predictable, rather than as fast as possible, so code caching might be disabled, along with compiler optimizations that require it.\n\n== Common themes ==\nTo a large extent, compiler optimization techniques have the following themes, which sometimes conflict.\n\n;Optimize the common case: The common case may have unique properties that allow a ''[[fast path]]'' at the expense of a ''slow path''. If the fast path is taken most often, the result is better overall performance.\n\n;Avoid redundancy: Reuse results that are already computed and store them for later use, instead of recomputing them.\n\n;Less code: Remove unnecessary computations and intermediate values. Less work for the CPU, cache, and memory usually results in faster execution. Alternatively, in [[embedded systems]], less code brings a lower product cost.\n\n;Fewer jumps by using ''straight line code'', also called ''[[branch (computer science)#Branch-free code|branch-free code]]'': Less complicated code. Jumps (conditional or [[unconditional branch]]es) interfere with the prefetching of instructions, thus slowing down code. Using inlining or loop unrolling can reduce branching, at the cost of increasing [[binary file]] size by the length of the repeated code. This tends to merge several [[basic block]]s into one.\n\n;Locality: Code and data that are accessed closely together in time should be placed close together in memory to increase spatial [[locality of reference]].\n\n;Exploit the memory hierarchy: Accesses to memory are increasingly more expensive for each level of the [[memory hierarchy]], so place the most commonly used items in registers first, then caches, then main memory, before going to disk.\n\n;Parallelize: Reorder operations to allow multiple computations to happen in parallel, either at the instruction, memory, or thread level.\n\n;More precise information is better: The more precise the information the compiler has, the better it can employ any or all of these optimization techniques.\n\n;Runtime metrics can help: Information gathered during a test run can be used in [[profile-guided optimization]]. Information gathered at runtime (ideally with minimal [[computational overhead|overhead]]) can be used by a [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compiler to dynamically improve optimization.\n\n;Strength reduction: Replace complex or difficult or expensive operations with simpler ones. For example, replacing division by a constant with multiplication by its reciprocal, or using [[induction variable analysis]] to replace multiplication by a loop index with addition.\n\n== Specific techniques ==\n=== Loop optimizations ===\n{{Main|Loop optimization}}\n\nSome optimization techniques primarily designed to operate on loops include:\n\n;[[Induction variable analysis]]: Roughly, if a variable in a loop is a simple linear function of the index variable, such as <code>j := 4*i + 1</code>, it can be updated appropriately each time the loop variable is changed. This is a [[strength reduction]], and also may allow the index variable's definitions to become [[dead code]]. This information is also useful for [[bounds-checking elimination]] and [[dependence analysis]], among other things.\n\n;[[Loop fission]] or loop distribution: Loop fission attempts to break a loop into multiple loops over the same index range but each taking only a part of the loop's body. This can improve [[locality of reference]], both of the data being accessed in the loop and the code in the loop's body.\n\n;[[Loop fusion]] or loop combining or loop ramming or loop jamming : Another technique which attempts to reduce loop overhead. When two adjacent loops would iterate the same number of times (whether or not that number is known at compile time), their bodies can be combined as long as they make no reference to each other's data.\n\n;[[Loop inversion]]: This technique changes a standard ''while'' loop into a ''do/while'' (also known as ''repeat/until'') loop wrapped in an ''if'' conditional, reducing the number of jumps by two, for cases when the loop is executed. Doing so duplicates the condition check (increasing the size of the code) but is more efficient because jumps usually cause a [[pipeline stall]]. Additionally, if the initial condition is known at compile-time and is known to be [[Side effect (computer science)|side-effect]]-free, the ''if'' guard can be skipped.\n\n;[[Loop interchange]]: These optimizations exchange inner loops with outer loops. When the loop variables index into an array, such a transformation can improve locality of reference, depending on the array's layout.\n\n;[[Loop-invariant code motion]]: If a quantity is computed inside a loop during every iteration, and its value is the same for each iteration, it can vastly improve efficiency to hoist it outside the loop and compute its value just once before the loop begins. This is particularly important with the address-calculation expressions generated by loops over arrays. For correct implementation, this technique must be used with [[loop inversion]], because not all code is safe to be hoisted outside the loop.\n\n;[[Loop nest optimization]]: Some pervasive algorithms such as matrix multiplication have very poor cache behavior and excessive memory accesses. Loop nest optimization increases the number of cache hits by performing the operation over small blocks and by using a loop interchange.\n\n;[[Loop reversal]]: Loop reversal reverses the order in which values are assigned to the index variable. This is a subtle optimization which can help eliminate [[dependence analysis|dependencies]] and thus enable other optimizations. Furthermore, on some architectures, loop reversal contributes to smaller code, as when the loop index is being decremented, the condition that needs to be met in order for the running program to exit the loop is a comparison with zero. This is often a special, parameter-less instruction, unlike a comparison with a number, which needs the number to compare to. Therefore, the amount of bytes needed to store the parameter is saved by using the loop reversal. Additionally, if the comparison number exceeds the size of word of the platform, in standard loop order, multiple instructions would need to be executed in order to evaluate the comparison, which is not the case with loop reversal.\n\n;[[Loop unrolling]]: Unrolling duplicates the body of the loop multiple times, in order to decrease the number of times the loop condition is tested and the number of jumps, which hurt performance by impairing the instruction pipeline. A \"fewer jumps\" optimization. Completely unrolling a loop eliminates all overhead, but requires that the number of iterations be known at compile time.\n\n;[[Loop splitting]]: Loop splitting attempts to simplify a loop or eliminate dependencies by breaking it into multiple loops which have the same bodies but iterate over different contiguous portions of the index range. A useful special case is ''[[loop peeling]]'', which can simplify a loop with a problematic first iteration by performing that iteration separately before entering the loop.\n\n;[[Loop unswitching]]: Unswitching moves a conditional from inside a loop to outside the loop by duplicating the loop's body inside each of the if and else clauses of the conditional.\n\n;[[Software pipelining]]: The loop is restructured in such a way that work done in an iteration is split into several parts and done over several iterations. In a tight loop, this technique hides the latency between loading and using values.\n\n;[[Automatic parallelization]]: A loop is converted into multi-threaded or vectorized (or even both) code in order to utilize multiple processors simultaneously in a shared-memory multiprocessor (SMP) machine, including multi-core machines.\n\n=== Data-flow optimizations ===\n[[Dataflow|Data-flow]] optimizations, based on [[data-flow analysis]], primarily depend on how certain properties of data are propagated by control edges in the [[control flow graph]]. Some of these include:\n\n;[[Common subexpression elimination]]: In the expression <code>(a + b) - (a + b)/4</code>, \"common subexpression\" refers to the duplicated <code>(a + b)</code>. Compilers implementing this technique realize that <code>(a + b)</code> will not change, and so only calculate its value once.\n\n; [[Constant folding|Constant folding and propagation]]<ref name=\"MuchnickAssociates1997\">{{cite book|author1=Steven Muchnick|author2=Muchnick and Associates|title=Advanced Compiler Design Implementation|url=https://archive.org/details/advancedcompiler00much|url-access=registration|quote=constant folding.|date=15 August 1997|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-320-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/advancedcompiler00much/page/329 329]\u2013}}</ref>: replacing expressions consisting of constants (e.g., <code>3 + 5</code>) with their final value (<code>8</code>) at compile time, rather than doing the calculation in run-time. Used in most modern languages.\n\n;[[Induction variable recognition and elimination]]: see discussion above about ''induction variable analysis''.\n\n;[[Strict aliasing|Alias classification and pointer analysis]]: in the presence of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s, it is difficult to make any optimizations at all, since potentially any variable can have been changed when a memory location is assigned to. By specifying which pointers can alias which variables, unrelated pointers can be ignored.\n\n;[[Dead store]] elimination: removal of assignments to variables that are not subsequently read, either because the lifetime of the variable ends or because of a subsequent assignment that will overwrite the first value.\n\n=== SSA-based optimizations ===\nThese optimizations are intended to be done after transforming the program into a special form called Static Single Assignment (see [[SSA (compilers)|SSA]] form), in which every variable is assigned in only one place. Although some function without SSA, they are most effective with SSA. Many optimizations listed in other sections also benefit with no special changes, such as register allocation.\n\n;[[Global value numbering]]: GVN eliminates redundancy by constructing a [[value graph (compilers)|value graph]] of the program, and then determining which values are computed by equivalent expressions. GVN is able to identify some redundancy that [[common subexpression elimination]] cannot, and vice versa.\n\n;[[Sparse conditional constant propagation]]: Combines constant propagation, [[constant folding]], and [[dead code elimination]], and improves upon what is possible by running them separately.<ref>Wegman, Mark N. and Zadeck, F. Kenneth. \"[http://bears.ece.ucsb.edu/class/ece253/papers/wegman91.pdf Constant Propagation with Conditional Branches].\" ''ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems'', 13(2), April 1991, pages 181-210.</ref><ref>Click, Clifford and Cooper, Keith. \"[https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/96451/TR95-252.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Combining Analyses, Combining Optimizations]\", ''ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems'', 17(2), March 1995, pages 181-196</ref> This optimization symbolically executes the program, simultaneously propagating constant values and eliminating portions of the [[control flow graph]] that this makes unreachable.\n\n=== Code generator optimizations ===\n;[[Register allocation]]: The most frequently used variables should be kept in processor registers for fastest access. To find which variables to put in registers an interference-graph is created. Each variable is a vertex and when two variables are used at the same time (have an intersecting liverange) they have an edge between them. This graph is colored using for example [[Chaitin's algorithm]] using the same number of colors as there are registers. If the coloring fails one variable is \"spilled\" to memory and the coloring is retried.\n\n;[[Instruction selection]]: Most architectures, particularly [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architectures and those with many [[addressing mode]]s, offer several different ways of performing a particular operation, using entirely different sequences of instructions. The job of the instruction selector is to do a good job overall of choosing which instructions to implement which operators in the low-level [[intermediate representation]] with. For example, on many processors in the [[68000 family]] and on the x86 architecture, complex addressing modes can be used in statements like \"lea 25(a1,d5*4), a0\", allowing a single instruction to perform a significant amount of arithmetic with less storage.\n\n;[[Instruction scheduling]]: Instruction scheduling is an important optimization for modern pipelined processors, which avoids stalls or bubbles in the pipeline by clustering instructions with no dependencies together, while being careful to preserve the original semantics.\n\n;[[Rematerialization]]: Rematerialization recalculates a value instead of loading it from memory, preventing a memory access. This is performed in tandem with register allocation to avoid spills.\n\n;Code factoring: If several sequences of code are identical, or can be parameterized or reordered to be identical, they can be replaced with calls to a shared subroutine. This can often share code for subroutine set-up and sometimes tail-recursion.<ref name=\"keil\">Cx51 Compiler Manual, version 09.2001, p155, Keil Software Inc.</ref>\n\n;Trampolines ([[Trampoline (computing)]]): Many {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} CPUs have smaller subroutine call instructions to access low memory. A compiler can save space by using these small calls in the main body of code. Jump instructions in low memory can access the routines at any address. This multiplies space savings from code factoring.<ref name=\"keil\" />\n\n;Reordering computations: Based on [[integer linear programming]], restructuring compilers enhance data locality and expose more parallelism by reordering computations. Space-optimizing compilers may reorder code to lengthen sequences that can be factored into subroutines.\n\n=== Functional language optimizations ===\nAlthough many of these also apply to non-functional languages, they either originate in, are most easily implemented in, or are particularly critical in [[functional language]]s such as [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] and [[ML programming language|ML]].\n\n;Removing [[recursion]]: Recursion is often expensive, as a function call consumes stack space and involves some overhead related to parameter passing and flushing the instruction cache. [[Tail recursion|Tail recursive]] algorithms can be converted to [[iteration]], which does not have call overhead and uses a constant amount of stack space, through a process called tail recursion elimination or [[tail call optimization]]. Some functional languages (e.g., [[Scheme (programming language)#Proper tail recursion|Scheme]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]) mandate that tail calls be optimized by a conforming implementation, due to their prevalence in these languages.\n\n;[[Deforestation (computer science)|Deforestation]] ([[data structure]] fusion): Because of the high level nature by which data structures are specified in functional languages such as Haskell, it is possible to combine several recursive functions which produce and consume some temporary data structure so that the data is passed directly without wasting time constructing the data structure.\n\n;[[Partial evaluation]]\n\n=== Other optimizations ===\n{{underlinked|section|small=no|reason=Please help separate and categorize these further and create detailed pages for them, especially the more complex ones, or link to one where one exists.|date=December 2017}}\n\n;[[Bounds-checking elimination]]: Many languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], enforce bounds checking of all array accesses. This is a severe performance [[Bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]] on certain applications such as scientific code. Bounds-checking elimination allows the compiler to safely remove bounds checking in many situations where it can determine that the index must fall within valid bounds, for example if it is a simple loop variable.\n\n;Branch offset optimization (machine dependent): Choose the shortest branch displacement that reaches target\n\n;Code-block reordering: Code-block reordering alters the order of the basic blocks in a program in order to reduce conditional branches and improve locality of reference.\n\n;[[Dead code elimination]]: Removes instructions that will not affect the behaviour of the program, for example definitions which have no uses, called [[dead code]]. This reduces code size and eliminates unnecessary computation.\n\n;Factoring out of invariants ([[loop invariant]]s): If an expression is carried out both when a condition is met and is not met, it can be written just once outside of the conditional statement. Similarly, if certain types of expressions (e.g., the assignment of a constant into a variable) appear inside a loop, they can be moved out of it because their effect will be the same no matter if they're executed many times or just once. Also known as total redundancy elimination. A more powerful optimization is [[partial redundancy elimination]] (PRE).\n\n;Inline expansion or [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] expansion: When some code invokes a [[Subroutine|procedure]], it is possible to directly insert the body of the procedure inside the calling code rather than transferring control to it. This saves the overhead related to procedure calls, as well as providing great opportunity for many different parameter-specific optimizations, but comes at the cost of space; the procedure body is duplicated each time the procedure is called inline. Generally, inlining is useful in performance-critical code that makes a large number of calls to small procedures. A \"fewer jumps\" optimization. The [[Statement (computer science)|statements]] of [[Imperative programming|imperative]] programming languages are also an example of such an optimization. Although statements could be implemented with [[subroutine|function calls]] they are almost always implemented with code inlining.\n\n;[[Jump threading]]: In this pass, consecutive conditional jumps predicated entirely or partially on the same condition are merged. \n: E.g., {{c-lang|if (c) { foo; } if (c) {{(}} bar; {{)}}}} to {{c-lang|if (c) {{(}} foo; bar; {{)}}}}, \n:and {{c-lang|if (c) { foo; } if (!c) {{(}} bar; {{)}}}} to {{c-lang|if (c) { foo; } else {{(}} bar; {{)}}}}.\n\n;Macro compression: A space optimization that recognizes common sequences of code, creates subprograms (\"code macros\") that contain the common code, and replaces the occurrences of the common code sequences with calls to the corresponding subprograms.<ref name=\"MCO\"/> This is most effectively done as a machine code optimization, when all the code is present.

This technique complements [[lazy evaluation]], but can be used only when the tests are not dependent on one another. [[Minimal evaluation|Short-circuiting]] semantics can make this difficult.\n\n=== Interprocedural optimizations ===\n[[Interprocedural optimization]] works on the entire program, across procedure and file boundaries. It works tightly with intraprocedural counterparts, carried out with the cooperation of a local part and global part. Typical interprocedural optimizations are: procedure [[inlining]], interprocedural dead code elimination, interprocedural constant propagation, and [[procedure reordering]]. As usual, the compiler needs to perform interprocedural analysis before its actual optimizations. Interprocedural analyses include alias analysis, [[array access analysis]], and the construction of a [[call graph]].\n\nInterprocedural optimization is common in modern commercial compilers from [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Sun Microsystems]]. For a long time the open source [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] was criticized{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} for a lack of powerful interprocedural analysis and optimizations, though this is now improving.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is [[Open64]].\n\nDue to the extra time and space required by interprocedural analysis, most compilers do not perform it by default. Users must use compiler options explicitly to tell the compiler to enable interprocedural analysis and other expensive optimizations.\n\n== Problems with optimization ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=August 2018}}\n\nEarly in the history of compilers, compiler optimizations were not as good as hand-written ones. As compiler technologies have improved, good compilers typically generate code good enough to generally no longer warrant the much higher effort to program hand-optimized code in assembly language (except for in a few special cases).\n\nFor RISC CPU architectures, and even more so for [[VLIW]] hardware, compiler optimization is the key for obtaining efficient code, because RISC instruction sets are so compact that it is hard for a human to manually schedule or combine small instructions to get efficient results. Indeed, these architectures were designed to rely on compiler writers for adequate performance.\n\nHowever, optimizing compilers are by no means perfect. There is no way that a compiler can guarantee that, for all program source code, the fastest or smallest possible equivalent compiled program is output; such a compiler is fundamentally impossible because it would solve the [[halting problem]] (assuming Turing completeness).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThis may be proven by considering a call to a function, foo(). This function returns nothing and does not have side effects (no I/O, does not modify global variables and \"live\" data structures, etc.). The fastest possible equivalent program would be simply to eliminate the function call. However, if the function foo() in fact does ''not'' return, then the program with the call to foo() would be different from the program without the call; the optimizing compiler will then have to determine this by solving the halting problem.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of other more practical issues with optimizing compiler technology:\n* Optimizing compilers focus on relatively shallow constant-factor performance improvements and do not typically improve the algorithmic complexity of a solution. For example, a compiler will not change an implementation of [[bubble sort]] to use [[mergesort]] instead.\n* Compilers usually have to support a variety of conflicting objectives, such as cost of implementation, compilation speed and quality of generated code.\n* A compiler typically only deals with a part of a program at a time, often the code contained within a single file or module; the result is that it is unable to consider contextual information that can only be obtained by processing the other files.\n* The [[computational overhead|overhead]] of compiler optimization: Any extra work takes time; [[Interprocedural optimization|whole-program optimization]] is time consuming for large programs.\n* The often complex interaction between optimization phases makes it difficult to find an optimal sequence in which to execute the different optimization phases.\n\nMoreover, optimization algorithms are complicated and, especially when being used to compile large, complex programming languages, they can have bugs which introduce errors in the generated code or cause internal errors during compilation. Compiler errors of any kind can be disconcerting to the user, but especially so in this case, since it may not be clear that the optimization logic is at fault.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2931074&CFID=827491623&CFTOKEN=57038897 | title=Toward understanding compiler bugs in GCC and LLVM | first=Chengnian |display-authors=et al | last=Sun | journal=ISSTA 2016: Proceedings of the 25th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis | date=July 18\u201320, 2016 | pages=294\u2013305| doi=10.1145/2931037.2931074 | isbn=9781450343909 | series=Issta 2016 }}</ref> In the case of internal errors, the problem can be partially ameliorated by a \"fail-safe\" programming technique in which the optimization logic in the compiler is coded such that a failure is trapped, a warning message issued, and the rest of the compilation proceeds to successful completion.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Fail-safe programming in compiler optimization | first=Jonathan L. | last=Schilling | journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices | volume=28 | issue=8 | date=August 1993 | pages=39\u201342 | doi=10.1145/163114.163118}}</ref>\n\nWork to improve optimization technology continues. One approach is the use of so-called [[post-pass optimizer]]s (some commercial versions of which date back to mainframe software of the late 1970s<ref>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358728.358732 Software engineering for the Cobol environment]. Portal.acm.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-10.</ref>). These tools take the executable output by an \"optimizing\" compiler and optimize it even further. [[Post pass optimizer]]s usually work on the [[assembly language]] or [[machine code]] level (contrast with compilers that optimize intermediate representations of programs). The performance of post-pass compilers are limited by the fact that much of the information available in the original source code is not always available to them.\n\nAs processor performance continues to improve at a rapid pace, while memory bandwidth improves more slowly, optimizations that reduce memory bandwidth requirements (even at the cost of making the processor execute relatively more instructions) will become more useful. Examples of this, already mentioned above, include [[loop nest optimization]] and [[rematerialization]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n\nEarly compilers of the 1960s were often primarily concerned with simply compiling code correctly or efficiently \u2013 compile times were a major concern. One of the earliest notable optimizing compilers was that for [[BLISS]] (1970), which was described in ''[[The Design of an Optimizing Compiler]]'' (1975). By the late 1980s optimizing compilers were sufficiently effective that programming in assembly language declined. This co-evolved with the development of RISC chips and advanced processor features such as instruction scheduling and speculative execution which were designed to be targeted by optimizing compilers, rather than by human-written assembly code.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n== List of static code analyses ==\n* [[Alias analysis]]\n* [[Pointer analysis]]\n* [[Shape analysis (software)|Shape analysis]]\n* [[Escape analysis]]\n* [[Array access analysis]]\n* [[Dependence analysis]]\n* [[Control flow analysis]]\n* [[Data flow analysis]]\n** [[Use-define chain]] analysis\n** [[Live variable analysis]]\n** [[Available expression]] analysis\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Algorithmic efficiency]]\n* [[Compile time function execution]]\n* [[Full employment theorem]]\n* [[Just-in-time compilation]] (JIT)\n* [[LLVM]]\n* [[Program optimization]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/Programming/CompilerOptimization/ Citations from CiteSeer]\n* [http://www.agner.org/optimize/#manuals Optimization manuals] by Agner Fog - documentation about x86 processor architecture and low-level code optimization\n\n{{Compiler optimizations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Optimizing Compiler}}\n[[Category:Compiler construction]]\n[[Category:Compiler optimizations| ]]\n[[Category:Programming language implementation]]\n[[Category:Compiler theory]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\n\nIn [[computing]], an '''optimizing compiler''' is a [[compiler]] that tries to minimize or maximize some attributes of an [[executable]] computer program. Common requirements are to minimize a [[computer program|program]]'s execution time, [[memory (computers)|memory]] requirement, and [[Energy conservation|power]] consumption (the last two being popular for [[portable computer]]s).\n\nCompiler optimization is generally implemented using a sequence of ''optimizing transformations'', algorithms which take a program and transform it to produce a semantically equivalent output program that uses fewer resources and/or executes faster. It has been shown that some code optimization problems are [[NP-complete]], or even [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]. In practice, factors such as the [[programmer]]'s willingness to wait for the compiler to complete its task place upper limits on the optimizations that a compiler implementer might provide. (Optimization is generally a very [[CPU]]- and memory-intensive process.) In the past, computer memory limitations were also a major factor in limiting which optimizations could be performed. Because of these factors, optimization rarely produces \"optimal\" output in any sense, and in fact, an \"optimization\" may impede performance in some cases; rather, they are heuristic methods for improving resource usage in typical programs.\n\n== Types of optimization ==\nTechniques used in optimization can be broken up among various ''scopes'' which can affect anything from a single statement to the entire program. Generally speaking, locally scoped techniques are easier to implement than global ones but result in smaller gains. Some examples of scopes include:\n\n;[[Peephole optimization]]s: Usually performed late in the compilation process after [[machine code]] has been generated. This form of optimization examines a few adjacent instructions (like \"looking through a peephole\" at the code) to see whether they can be replaced by a single instruction or a shorter sequence of instructions. For instance, a multiplication of a value by&nbsp;2 might be more efficiently executed by [[Bit shift|left-shifting]] the value or by adding the value to itself (this example is also an instance of [[strength reduction]]).\n;Local optimizations: These only consider information local to a [[basic block]].<ref name=\"Cooper_2003\">{{cite book |author-first1=Keith D. |author-last1=Cooper |author-link1=Keith D.

Worst case assumptions have to be made when function calls occur or global variables are accessed (because little information about them is available).\n;[[Loop optimization]]s: These act on the statements which make up a loop, such as a ''for'' loop (e.g., [[loop-invariant code motion]]). Loop optimizations can have a significant impact because many programs spend a large percentage of their time inside loops.\n;{{anchor|Prescient store}}Prescient store optimizations: Allow store operations to occur earlier than would otherwise be permitted in the context of [[Threads (computer science)|threads]] and locks. The process needs some way of knowing ahead of time what value will be stored by the assignment that it should have followed. The purpose of this relaxation is to allow compiler optimization to perform certain kinds of code rearrangement that preserve the semantics of properly synchronized programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa245162(v=vs.60).aspx |title=MSDN - Prescient Store Actions |accessdate=2014-03-15 |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n;Interprocedural, whole-program or [[link-time optimization]]: These analyze all of a program's source code. The greater quantity of information extracted means that optimizations can be more effective compared to when they only have access to local information (i.e., within a single function). This kind of optimization can also allow new techniques to be performed. For instance, function [[inline expansion|inlining]], where a call to a function is replaced by a copy of the function body.\n;Machine code optimization and [[object code optimizer]]: These analyze the executable task image of the program after all of an executable machine code has been [[linker (computing)|linked]]. Some of the techniques that can be applied in a more limited scope, such as macro compression (which saves space by collapsing common sequences of instructions), are more effective when the entire executable task image is available for analysis.<ref name=\"MCO\">{{cite journal\n | type=Ph.D. dissertation\n | title=Machine Code Optimization - Improving Executable Object Code\n | author=Clinton F.

Thus similar optimization techniques can be used across languages. However, certain language features make some kinds of optimizations difficult. For instance, the existence of pointers in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] makes it difficult to optimize array accesses (see [[alias analysis]]). However, languages such as [[PL/1]] (that also supports pointers) nevertheless have available sophisticated optimizing compilers to achieve better performance in various other ways. Conversely, some language features make certain optimizations easier. For example, in some languages functions are not permitted to have [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]]. Therefore, if a program makes several calls to the same function with the same arguments, the compiler can immediately infer that the function's result need be computed only once. In languages where functions are allowed to have side effects, another strategy is possible. The optimizer can determine which function has no side effects, and restrict such optimizations to side effect free functions. This optimization is only possible when the optimizer has access to the called function.\n;Machine independent vs. machine dependent: Many optimizations that operate on abstract programming concepts (loops, objects, structures) are independent of the machine targeted by the compiler, but many of the most effective optimizations are those that best exploit special features of the target platform. E.g.: Instructions which do several things at once, such as decrement register and branch if not zero.\n\nThe following is an instance of a local machine dependent optimization. To set a [[Processor register|register]] to 0, the obvious way is to use the constant '0' in an instruction that sets a register value to a constant. A less obvious way is to [[XOR]] a register with itself. It is up to the compiler to know which instruction variant to use. On many [[RISC]] machines, both instructions would be equally appropriate, since they would both be the same length and take the same time. On many other [[microprocessor]]s such as the [[Intel]] [[x86]] family, it turns out that the XOR variant is shorter and probably faster, as there will be no need to decode an immediate operand, nor use the internal \"immediate operand register\". (A potential problem with this is that XOR may introduce a data dependency on the previous value of the register, causing a [[instruction pipeline|pipeline]] stall. However, processors often have XOR of a register with itself as a special case that does not cause stalls.)\n\n== Factors affecting optimization ==\n;The machine itself: Many of the choices about which optimizations can and should be done depend on the characteristics of the target machine. It is sometimes possible to parameterize some of these machine dependent factors, so that a single piece of compiler code can be used to optimize different machines just by altering the machine description parameters. [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] is a compiler which exemplifies this approach.\n\n;The architecture of the target CPU: Number of [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[processor register|registers]]: To a certain extent, the more registers, the easier it is to optimize for performance. [[Local variable]]s can be allocated in the registers and not on the [[Call stack|stack]]. Temporary/intermediate results can be left in registers without writing to and reading back from memory.\n*[[RISC]] vs [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]]: CISC instruction sets often have variable instruction lengths, often have a larger number of possible instructions that can be used, and each instruction could take differing amounts of time. RISC instruction sets attempt to limit the variability in each of these: instruction sets are usually constant length, with few exceptions, there are usually fewer combinations of registers and memory operations, and the instruction issue rate (the number of instructions completed per time period, usually an integer multiple of the clock cycle) is usually constant in cases where memory latency is not a factor. There may be several ways of carrying out a certain task, with CISC usually offering more alternatives than RISC. Compilers have to know the relative costs among the various instructions and choose the best instruction sequence (see [[instruction selection]]).\n*[[Instruction pipeline|Pipelines]]: A pipeline is essentially a CPU broken up into an [[assembly line]]. It allows use of parts of the CPU for different instructions by breaking up the execution of instructions into various stages: instruction decode, address decode, memory fetch, register fetch, compute, register store, etc. One instruction could be in the register store stage, while another could be in the register fetch stage. Pipeline conflicts occur when an instruction in one stage of the pipeline depends on the result of another instruction ahead of it in the pipeline but not yet completed. Pipeline conflicts can lead to [[pipeline stall]]s: where the CPU wastes cycles waiting for a conflict to resolve.\n:Compilers can ''schedule'', or reorder, instructions so that pipeline stalls occur less frequently.\n* [[Superscalar|Number of functional units]]: Some CPUs have several [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALUs]] and [[floating point unit|FPUs]]. This allows them to execute multiple instructions simultaneously. There may be restrictions on which instructions can pair with which other instructions (\"pairing\" is the simultaneous execution of two or more instructions), and which functional unit can execute which instruction. They also have issues similar to pipeline conflicts.\n: Here again, instructions have to be scheduled so that the various functional units are fully fed with instructions to execute.\n\n;The architecture of the machine:\n* [[CPU cache|Cache]] size (256&nbsp;kiB\u201312&nbsp;MiB) and type (direct mapped, 2-/4-/8-/16-way associative, fully associative): Techniques such as [[inline expansion]] and [[loop unrolling]] may increase the size of the generated code and reduce code locality. The program may slow down drastically if a highly utilized section of code (like inner loops in various algorithms) suddenly cannot fit in the cache. Also, caches which are not fully associative have higher chances of cache collisions even in an unfilled cache.\n* Cache/Memory transfer rates: These give the compiler an indication of the penalty for cache misses. This is used mainly in specialized applications.\n\n;Intended use of the generated code:\n:;[[Debugging]]: While writing an application, a programmer will recompile and test often, and so compilation must be fast. This is one reason most optimizations are deliberately avoided during the test/debugging phase. Also, program code is usually \"stepped through\" (see [[Program animation]]) using a [[symbolic debugger]], and optimizing transformations, particularly those that reorder code, can make it difficult to relate the output code with the line numbers in the original source code. This can confuse both the debugging tools and the programmers using them.\n:;General purpose use: Prepackaged software is very often expected to be executed on a variety of machines and CPUs that may share the same instruction set, but have different timing, cache or memory characteristics. So, the code may not be tuned to any particular CPU, or may be tuned to work best on the most popular CPU and yet still work acceptably well on other CPUs.\n:;Special-purpose use: If the software is compiled to be used on one or a few very similar machines, with known characteristics, then the compiler can heavily tune the generated code to those specific machines (if such options are available). Important special cases include code designed for [[parallel computing|parallel]] and [[vector processor]]s, for which special [[parallelizing compiler]]s are employed.\n:;[[Embedded system]]s: These are a common case of special-purpose use. Embedded software can be tightly tuned to an exact CPU and memory size. Also, system cost or reliability may be more important than the code's speed. So, for example, compilers for embedded software usually offer options that reduce code size at the expense of speed, because memory is the main cost of an embedded computer. The code's timing may need to be predictable, rather than as fast as possible, so code caching might be disabled, along with compiler optimizations that require it.\n\n== Common themes ==\nTo a large extent, compiler optimization techniques have the following themes, which sometimes conflict.\n\n;Optimize the common case: The common case may have unique properties that allow a ''[[fast path]]'' at the expense of a ''slow path''. If the fast path is taken most often, the result is better overall performance.\n\n;Avoid redundancy: Reuse results that are already computed and store them for later use, instead of recomputing them.\n\n;Less code: Remove unnecessary computations and intermediate values. Less work for the CPU, cache, and memory usually results in faster execution. Alternatively, in [[embedded systems]], less code brings a lower product cost.\n\n;Fewer jumps by using ''straight line code'', also called ''[[branch (computer science)#Branch-free code|branch-free code]]'': Less complicated code. Jumps (conditional or [[unconditional branch]]es) interfere with the prefetching of instructions, thus slowing down code. Using inlining or loop unrolling can reduce branching, at the cost of increasing [[binary file]] size by the length of the repeated code. This tends to merge several [[basic block]]s into one.\n\n;Locality: Code and data that are accessed closely together in time should be placed close together in memory to increase spatial [[locality of reference]].\n\n;Exploit the memory hierarchy: Accesses to memory are increasingly more expensive for each level of the [[memory hierarchy]], so place the most commonly used items in registers first, then caches, then main memory, before going to disk.\n\n;Parallelize: Reorder operations to allow multiple computations to happen in parallel, either at the instruction, memory, or thread level.\n\n;More precise information is better: The more precise the information the compiler has, the better it can employ any or all of these optimization techniques.\n\n;Runtime metrics can help: Information gathered during a test run can be used in [[profile-guided optimization]]. Information gathered at runtime (ideally with minimal [[computational overhead|overhead]]) can be used by a [[Just-in-time compilation|JIT]] compiler to dynamically improve optimization.\n\n;Strength reduction: Replace complex or difficult or expensive operations with simpler ones. For example, replacing division by a constant with multiplication by its reciprocal, or using [[induction variable analysis]] to replace multiplication by a loop index with addition.\n\n== Specific techniques ==\n=== Loop optimizations ===\n{{Main|Loop optimization}}\n\nSome optimization techniques primarily designed to operate on loops include:\n\n;[[Induction variable analysis]]: Roughly, if a variable in a loop is a simple linear function of the index variable, such as <code>j := 4*i + 1</code>, it can be updated appropriately each time the loop variable is changed. This is a [[strength reduction]], and also may allow the index variable's definitions to become [[dead code]]. This information is also useful for [[bounds-checking elimination]] and [[dependence analysis]], among other things.\n\n;[[Loop fission]] or loop distribution: Loop fission attempts to break a loop into multiple loops over the same index range but each taking only a part of the loop's body. This can improve [[locality of reference]], both of the data being accessed in the loop and the code in the loop's body.\n\n;[[Loop fusion]] or loop combining or loop ramming or loop jamming : Another technique which attempts to reduce loop overhead. When two adjacent loops would iterate the same number of times (whether or not that number is known at compile time), their bodies can be combined as long as they make no reference to each other's data.\n\n;[[Loop inversion]]: This technique changes a standard ''while'' loop into a ''do/while'' (also known as ''repeat/until'') loop wrapped in an ''if'' conditional, reducing the number of jumps by two, for cases when the loop is executed. Doing so duplicates the condition check (increasing the size of the code) but is more efficient because jumps usually cause a [[pipeline stall]]. Additionally, if the initial condition is known at compile-time and is known to be [[Side effect (computer science)|side-effect]]-free, the ''if'' guard can be skipped.\n\n;[[Loop interchange]]: These optimizations exchange inner loops with outer loops. When the loop variables index into an array, such a transformation can improve locality of reference, depending on the array's layout.\n\n;[[Loop-invariant code motion]]: If a quantity is computed inside a loop during every iteration, and its value is the same for each iteration, it can vastly improve efficiency to hoist it outside the loop and compute its value just once before the loop begins. This is particularly important with the address-calculation expressions generated by loops over arrays. For correct implementation, this technique must be used with [[loop inversion]], because not all code is safe to be hoisted outside the loop.\n\n;[[Loop nest optimization]]: Some pervasive algorithms such as matrix multiplication have very poor cache behavior and excessive memory accesses. Loop nest optimization increases the number of cache hits by performing the operation over small blocks and by using a loop interchange.\n\n;[[Loop reversal]]: Loop reversal reverses the order in which values are assigned to the index variable. This is a subtle optimization which can help eliminate [[dependence analysis|dependencies]] and thus enable other optimizations. Furthermore, on some architectures, loop reversal contributes to smaller code, as when the loop index is being decremented, the condition that needs to be met in order for the running program to exit the loop is a comparison with zero. This is often a special, parameter-less instruction, unlike a comparison with a number, which needs the number to compare to. Therefore, the amount of bytes needed to store the parameter is saved by using the loop reversal. Additionally, if the comparison number exceeds the size of word of the platform, in standard loop order, multiple instructions would need to be executed in order to evaluate the comparison, which is not the case with loop reversal.\n\n;[[Loop unrolling]]: Unrolling duplicates the body of the loop multiple times, in order to decrease the number of times the loop condition is tested and the number of jumps, which hurt performance by impairing the instruction pipeline. A \"fewer jumps\" optimization. Completely unrolling a loop eliminates all overhead, but requires that the number of iterations be known at compile time.\n\n;[[Loop splitting]]: Loop splitting attempts to simplify a loop or eliminate dependencies by breaking it into multiple loops which have the same bodies but iterate over different contiguous portions of the index range. A useful special case is ''[[loop peeling]]'', which can simplify a loop with a problematic first iteration by performing that iteration separately before entering the loop.\n\n;[[Loop unswitching]]: Unswitching moves a conditional from inside a loop to outside the loop by duplicating the loop's body inside each of the if and else clauses of the conditional.\n\n;[[Software pipelining]]: The loop is restructured in such a way that work done in an iteration is split into several parts and done over several iterations. In a tight loop this technique hides the latency between loading and using values.\n\n;[[Automatic parallelization]]: A loop is converted into multi-threaded or vectorized (or even both) code in order to utilize multiple processors simultaneously in a shared-memory multiprocessor (SMP) machine, including multi-core machines.\n\n=== Data-flow optimizations ===\n[[Dataflow|Data-flow]] optimizations, based on [[data-flow analysis]], primarily depend on how certain properties of data are propagated by control edges in the [[control flow graph]]. Some of these include:\n\n;[[Common subexpression elimination]]: In the expression <code>(a + b) - (a + b)/4</code>, \"common subexpression\" refers to the duplicated <code>(a + b)</code>. Compilers implementing this technique realize that <code>(a + b)</code> will not change, and so only calculate its value once.\n\n; [[Constant folding|Constant folding and propagation]]<ref name=\"MuchnickAssociates1997\">{{cite book|author1=Steven Muchnick|author2=Muchnick and Associates|title=Advanced Compiler Design Implementation|url=https://archive.org/details/advancedcompiler00much|url-access=registration|quote=constant folding.|date=15 August 1997|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-1-55860-320-2|pages=[https://archive.org/details/advancedcompiler00much/page/329 329]\u2013}}</ref>: replacing expressions consisting of constants (e.g., <code>3 + 5</code>) with their final value (<code>8</code>) at compile time, rather than doing the calculation in run-time. Used in most modern languages.\n\n;[[Induction variable recognition and elimination]]: see discussion above about ''induction variable analysis''.\n\n;[[Strict aliasing|Alias classification and pointer analysis]]: in the presence of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s, it is difficult to make any optimizations at all, since potentially any variable can have been changed when a memory location is assigned to. By specifying which pointers can alias which variables, unrelated pointers can be ignored.\n\n;[[Dead store]] elimination: removal of assignments to variables that are not subsequently read, either because the lifetime of the variable ends or because of a subsequent assignment that will overwrite the first value.\n\n=== SSA-based optimizations ===\nThese optimizations are intended to be done after transforming the program into a special form called Static Single Assignment (see [[SSA (compilers)|SSA]] form), in which every variable is assigned in only one place. Although some function without SSA, they are most effective with SSA. Many optimizations listed in other sections also benefit with no special changes, such as register allocation.\n\n;[[Global value numbering]]: GVN eliminates redundancy by constructing a [[value graph (compilers)|value graph]] of the program, and then determining which values are computed by equivalent expressions. GVN is able to identify some redundancy that [[common subexpression elimination]] cannot, and vice versa.\n\n;[[Sparse conditional constant propagation]]: Combines constant propagation, [[constant folding]], and [[dead code elimination]], and improves upon what is possible by running them separately.<ref>Wegman, Mark N. and Zadeck, F. Kenneth. \"[http://bears.ece.ucsb.edu/class/ece253/papers/wegman91.pdf Constant Propagation with Conditional Branches].\" ''ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems'', 13(2), April 1991, pages 181-210.</ref><ref>Click, Clifford and Cooper, Keith. \"[https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/96451/TR95-252.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Combining Analyses, Combining Optimizations]\", ''ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems'', 17(2), March 1995, pages 181-196</ref> This optimization symbolically executes the program, simultaneously propagating constant values and eliminating portions of the [[control flow graph]] that this makes unreachable.\n\n=== Code generator optimizations ===\n;[[Register allocation]]: The most frequently used variables should be kept in processor registers for fastest access. To find which variables to put in registers an interference-graph is created. Each variable is a vertex and when two variables are used at the same time (have an intersecting liverange) they have an edge between them. This graph is colored using for example [[Chaitin's algorithm]] using the same number of colors as there are registers. If the coloring fails one variable is \"spilled\" to memory and the coloring is retried.\n\n;[[Instruction selection]]: Most architectures, particularly [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] architectures and those with many [[addressing mode]]s, offer several different ways of performing a particular operation, using entirely different sequences of instructions. The job of the instruction selector is to do a good job overall of choosing which instructions to implement which operators in the low-level [[intermediate representation]] with. For example, on many processors in the [[68000 family]] and on the x86 architecture, complex addressing modes can be used in statements like \"lea 25(a1,d5*4), a0\", allowing a single instruction to perform a significant amount of arithmetic with less storage.\n\n;[[Instruction scheduling]]: Instruction scheduling is an important optimization for modern pipelined processors, which avoids stalls or bubbles in the pipeline by clustering instructions with no dependencies together, while being careful to preserve the original semantics.\n\n;[[Rematerialization]]: Rematerialization recalculates a value instead of loading it from memory, preventing a memory access. This is performed in tandem with register allocation to avoid spills.\n\n;Code factoring: If several sequences of code are identical, or can be parameterized or reordered to be identical, they can be replaced with calls to a shared subroutine. This can often share code for subroutine set-up and sometimes tail-recursion.<ref name=\"keil\">Cx51 Compiler Manual, version 09.2001, p155, Keil Software Inc.</ref>\n\n;Trampolines ([[Trampoline (computing)]]): Many {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} CPUs have smaller subroutine call instructions to access low memory. A compiler can save space by using these small calls in the main body of code. Jump instructions in low memory can access the routines at any address. This multiplies space savings from code factoring.<ref name=\"keil\" />\n\n;Reordering computations: Based on [[integer linear programming]], restructuring compilers enhance data locality and expose more parallelism by reordering computations. Space-optimizing compilers may reorder code to lengthen sequences that can be factored into subroutines.\n\n=== Functional language optimizations ===\nAlthough many of these also apply to non-functional languages, they either originate in, are most easily implemented in, or are particularly critical in [[functional language]]s such as [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]] and [[ML programming language|ML]].\n\n;Removing [[recursion]]: Recursion is often expensive, as a function call consumes stack space and involves some overhead related to parameter passing and flushing the instruction cache. [[Tail recursion|Tail recursive]] algorithms can be converted to [[iteration]], which does not have call overhead and uses a constant amount of stack space, through a process called tail recursion elimination or [[tail call optimization]]. Some functional languages (e.g., [[Scheme (programming language)#Proper tail recursion|Scheme]] and [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]) mandate that tail calls be optimized by a conforming implementation, due to their prevalence in these languages.\n\n;[[Deforestation (computer science)|Deforestation]] ([[data structure]] fusion): Because of the high level nature by which data structures are specified in functional languages such as Haskell, it is possible to combine several recursive functions which produce and consume some temporary data structure so that the data is passed directly without wasting time constructing the data structure.\n\n;[[Partial evaluation]]\n\n=== Other optimizations ===\n{{underlinked|section|small=no|reason=Please help separate and categorize these further and create detailed pages for them, especially the more complex ones, or link to one where one exists.|date=December 2017}}\n\n;[[Bounds-checking elimination]]: Many languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], enforce bounds checking of all array accesses. This is a severe performance [[Bottleneck (software)|bottleneck]] on certain applications such as scientific code. Bounds-checking elimination allows the compiler to safely remove bounds checking in many situations where it can determine that the index must fall within valid bounds, for example if it is a simple loop variable.\n\n;Branch offset optimization (machine dependent): Choose the shortest branch displacement that reaches target\n\n;Code-block reordering: Code-block reordering alters the order of the basic blocks in a program in order to reduce conditional branches and improve locality of reference.\n\n;[[Dead code elimination]]: Removes instructions that will not affect the behaviour of the program, for example definitions which have no uses, called [[dead code]]. This reduces code size and eliminates unnecessary computation.\n\n;Factoring out of invariants ([[loop invariant]]s): If an expression is carried out both when a condition is met and is not met, it can be written just once outside of the conditional statement. Similarly, if certain types of expressions (e.g., the assignment of a constant into a variable) appear inside a loop, they can be moved out of it because their effect will be the same no matter if they're executed many times or just once. Also known as total redundancy elimination. A more powerful optimization is [[partial redundancy elimination]] (PRE).\n\n;Inline expansion or [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] expansion: When some code invokes a [[Subroutine|procedure]], it is possible to directly insert the body of the procedure inside the calling code rather than transferring control to it. This saves the overhead related to procedure calls, as well as providing great opportunity for many different parameter-specific optimizations, but comes at the cost of space; the procedure body is duplicated each time the procedure is called inline. Generally, inlining is useful in performance-critical code that makes a large number of calls to small procedures. A \"fewer jumps\" optimization. The [[Statement (computer science)|statements]] of [[Imperative programming|imperative]] programming languages are also an example of such an optimization. Although statements could be implemented with [[subroutine|function calls]] they are almost always implemented with code inlining.\n\n;[[Jump threading]]: In this pass, consecutive conditional jumps predicated entirely or partially on the same condition are merged. \n: E.g., {{c-lang|if (c) { foo; } if (c) {{(}} bar; {{)}}}} to {{c-lang|if (c) {{(}} foo; bar; {{)}}}}, \n:and {{c-lang|if (c) { foo; } if (!c) {{(}} bar; {{)}}}} to {{c-lang|if (c) { foo; } else {{(}} bar; {{)}}}}.\n\n;Macro compression: A space optimization that recognizes common sequences of code, creates subprograms (\"code macros\") that contain the common code, and replaces the occurrences of the common code sequences with calls to the corresponding subprograms.<ref name=\"MCO\"/> This is most effectively done as a machine code optimization, when all the code is present. The technique was first used to conserve space in an interpretive byte stream used in an implementation of [[SPITBOL compiler|Macro Spitbol]] on microcomputers.<ref name=\"MicroSpitbol\">\n{{cite book\n | title = MICRO SPITBOL\n | author1 = Robert B.

This technique complements [[lazy evaluation]], but can be used only when the tests are not dependent on one another. [[Minimal evaluation|Short-circuiting]] semantics can make this difficult.\n\n=== Interprocedural optimizations ===\n[[Interprocedural optimization]] works on the entire program, across procedure and file boundaries. It works tightly with intraprocedural counterparts, carried out with the cooperation of a local part and global part. Typical interprocedural optimizations are: procedure [[inlining]], interprocedural dead code elimination, interprocedural constant propagation, and [[procedure reordering]]. As usual, the compiler needs to perform interprocedural analysis before its actual optimizations. Interprocedural analyses include alias analysis, [[array access analysis]], and the construction of a [[call graph]].\n\nInterprocedural optimization is common in modern commercial compilers from [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Sun Microsystems]]. For a long time the open source [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] was criticized{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} for a lack of powerful interprocedural analysis and optimizations, though this is now improving.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is [[Open64]].\n\nDue to the extra time and space required by interprocedural analysis, most compilers do not perform it by default. Users must use compiler options explicitly to tell the compiler to enable interprocedural analysis and other expensive optimizations.\n\n== Problems with optimization ==\n{{essay-like|section|date=August 2018}}\n\nEarly in the history of compilers, compiler optimizations were not as good as hand-written ones. As compiler technologies have improved, good compilers typically generate code good enough to generally no longer warrant the much higher effort to program hand-optimized code in assembly language (except for in a few special cases).\n\nFor RISC CPU architectures, and even more so for [[VLIW]] hardware, compiler optimization is the key for obtaining efficient code, because RISC instruction sets are so compact that it is hard for a human to manually schedule or combine small instructions to get efficient results. Indeed, these architectures were designed to rely on compiler writers for adequate performance.\n\nHowever, optimizing compilers are by no means perfect. There is no way that a compiler can guarantee that, for all program source code, the fastest or smallest possible equivalent compiled program is output; such a compiler is fundamentally impossible because it would solve the [[halting problem]] (assuming Turing completeness).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThis may be proven by considering a call to a function, foo(). This function returns nothing and does not have side effects (no I/O, does not modify global variables and \"live\" data structures, etc.). The fastest possible equivalent program would be simply to eliminate the function call. However, if the function foo() in fact does ''not'' return, then the program with the call to foo() would be different from the program without the call; the optimizing compiler will then have to determine this by solving the halting problem.\n\nAdditionally, there are a number of other more practical issues with optimizing compiler technology:\n* Optimizing compilers focus on relatively shallow constant-factor performance improvements and do not typically improve the algorithmic complexity of a solution. For example, a compiler will not change an implementation of [[bubble sort]] to use [[mergesort]] instead.\n* Compilers usually have to support a variety of conflicting objectives, such as cost of implementation, compilation speed and quality of generated code.\n* A compiler typically only deals with a part of a program at a time, often the code contained within a single file or module; the result is that it is unable to consider contextual information that can only be obtained by processing the other files.\n* The [[computational overhead|overhead]] of compiler optimization: Any extra work takes time; [[Interprocedural optimization|whole-program optimization]] is time consuming for large programs.\n* The often complex interaction between optimization phases makes it difficult to find an optimal sequence in which to execute the different optimization phases.\n\nMoreover, optimization algorithms are complicated and, especially when being used to compile large, complex programming languages, they can have bugs which introduce errors in the generated code or cause internal errors during compilation. Compiler errors of any kind can be disconcerting to the user, but especially so in this case, since it may not be clear that the optimization logic is at fault.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2931074&CFID=827491623&CFTOKEN=57038897 | title=Toward understanding compiler bugs in GCC and LLVM | first=Chengnian |display-authors=et al | last=Sun | journal=ISSTA 2016: Proceedings of the 25th International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis | date=July 18\u201320, 2016 | pages=294\u2013305| doi=10.1145/2931037.2931074 | isbn=9781450343909 | series=Issta 2016 }}</ref> In the case of internal errors, the problem can be partially ameliorated by a \"fail-safe\" programming technique in which the optimization logic in the compiler is coded such that a failure is trapped, a warning message issued, and the rest of the compilation proceeds to successful completion.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Fail-safe programming in compiler optimization | first=Jonathan L. | last=Schilling | journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices | volume=28 | issue=8 | date=August 1993 | pages=39\u201342 | doi=10.1145/163114.163118}}</ref>\n\nWork to improve optimization technology continues. One approach is the use of so-called [[post-pass optimizer]]s (some commercial versions of which date back to mainframe software of the late 1970s<ref>[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=358728.358732 Software engineering for the Cobol environment]. Portal.acm.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-10.</ref>). These tools take the executable output by an \"optimizing\" compiler and optimize it even further. [[Post pass optimizer]]s usually work on the [[assembly language]] or [[machine code]] level (contrast with compilers that optimize intermediate representations of programs). The performance of post-pass compilers are limited by the fact that much of the information available in the original source code is not always available to them.\n\nAs processor performance continues to improve at a rapid pace, while memory bandwidth improves more slowly, optimizations that reduce memory bandwidth requirements (even at the cost of making the processor execute relatively more instructions) will become more useful. Examples of this, already mentioned above, include [[loop nest optimization]] and [[rematerialization]].\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n\nEarly compilers of the 1960s were often primarily concerned with simply compiling code correctly or efficiently \u2013 compile times were a major concern. One of the earliest notable optimizing compilers was that for [[BLISS]] (1970), which was described in ''[[The Design of an Optimizing Compiler]]'' (1975). By the late 1980s optimizing compilers were sufficiently effective that programming in assembly language declined. This co-evolved with the development of RISC chips and advanced processor features such as instruction scheduling and speculative execution which were designed to be targeted by optimizing compilers, rather than by human-written assembly code.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n== List of static code analyses ==\n* [[Alias analysis]]\n* [[Pointer analysis]]\n* [[Shape analysis (software)|Shape analysis]]\n* [[Escape analysis]]\n* [[Array access analysis]]\n* [[Dependence analysis]]\n* [[Control flow analysis]]\n* [[Data flow analysis]]\n** [[Use-define chain]] analysis\n** [[Live variable analysis]]\n** [[Available expression]] analysis\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Algorithmic efficiency]]\n* [[Compile time function execution]]\n* [[Full employment theorem]]\n* [[Just-in-time compilation]] (JIT)\n* [[LLVM]]\n* [[Program optimization]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/Programming/CompilerOptimization/ Citations from CiteSeer]\n* [http://www.agner.org/optimize/#manuals Optimization manuals] by Agner Fog - documentation about x86 processor architecture and low-level code optimization\n\n{{Compiler optimizations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Optimizing Compiler}}\n[[Category:Compiler construction]]\n[[Category:Compiler optimizations| ]]\n[[Category:Programming language implementation]]\n[[Category:Compiler theory]]\n", "name_user": "Pelirodri1248", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSpecific techniques", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimizing_compiler"}
