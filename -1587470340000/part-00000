First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007.\n\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]] (effectively division 4), Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]] (effectively division 3), Section B [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]] (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\n\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] at [[Aviva Stadium|Lansdowne Road]] (now known as the [[Aviva Stadium]]). In 2008, the final was played at the [[RDS Arena|Royal Dublin Society Grounds]] (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be way too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000- 14,000.\n\nThe competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters as being \"elitist\" (as most of the competing schools are fee-paying; in fact only one non fee-paying school has won the cup, De La Salle Churchtown) and for putting undue pressure on its participants. It is also the subject of satire through the [[Ross O'Carroll Kelly]] newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has been praised though with \"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\".<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/edmund-van-esbeck-irish-game-in-debt-to-schools-rugby-182795.html Irish game in debt to schools rugby]</ref>\n\n[[Blackrock College]] are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having lifted the Cup 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined.<ref name=\"multiple\">\n[http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThree schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; [[Blackrock College]] in the competition's maiden year in 1887, [[Castleknock College]] who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. [[St. Fintan's High School]] are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season and are coached by Belvedere College 2008 Senior Cup winning captain Thomas Sexton and vice-captain Peter Synnott.\n\nTo date only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935\u201336, 1942\u201343, 1945, 1948, 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1962, 1964, 1981\u201382, 1986\u201387, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013\u201314, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Newbridge College (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\n\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), [[Newbridge College]] (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and [[Blackrock College]] (2017) with 1 each. This happened to [[Blackrock College]] for the first time in 2017.\n\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\n\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary\u2019s College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick\u2019s Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on the 19 March. \n\nGrainey video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley.\n\nIn September 1967 The then Minister for Education Donogh O\u2019Malley\u2019s introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985 De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College to bring the cup to Churchtown. In 2020 the daughter of the De La Salle coach, Jane Farley produced a wonderful Newstalk podcast documentary called \"Class Rugby\" which in a blast of music, memories and politics takes you back to the 1980's with a band of Churchtown teenagers as they take on the established rugby-playing private schools of Leinster.\n\nIn 2020 the final between Newbridge College and Clongowes Wood College had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, as a result the title has been shared for the first time. 2020 was also the year that for the first time in the 133 year history of the competition that no Dublin School reached the final.\n\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College, <ref>Leinster Schools Senior Rugby Cup Centenary Celebration 1886-1986</ref>1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion ([[Blackrock College]]) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Players such as [[Denis Hickie]], who captained his [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]] team to win the cup in 1994, and [[Gordon D'Arcy]] have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from [[Blackrock College]], with players such as [[Hugo_MacNeill_(rugby_union)|Hugo MacNeill]], [[Brendan Mullin]], [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Victor Costello]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Bob Casey (rugby player)|Bob Casey]], [[Leo Cullen (rugby player)|Leo Cullen]] and more recently [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Ian Madigan]], [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]] and [[Joey Carbery]]. Terenure College has also produced many Irish international players including Mick Hipwell (also Lion's 1971), Kevin Flynn, Paul Haycock, Niall Hogan (Irish Captain 1995), Conor O'Shea (former head coach Italian national team), Ciaran Clarke, and Girvan Dempsey. De La Salle Churchtown produced the following Internationals - Des Fitzgerald (34 caps) played in 2 RWCs. Named to Lions Team to mark centenary of IRB\nTom Clancy (9 caps), Brian Glennon (1 cap), Niyi Adeolokun (1 cap), Lar Hudson (7 caps) and Austin Quirke (6 caps for France).\n\n==Roll of honour== *Most Recent Win Donates Order if Number of Wins Equal*\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"width:25%; background:silver;\"| '''School'''\n!  style=\"width:30%; background:silver;\"| '''Location'''\n!  style=\"width:5%; background:silver;\"| '''Titles'''\n!  style=\"width:40%; background:silver;\"| '''Winning years'''\n\n|-\n|[[File:sq3 skywhitesky.svg|23x23px]] [[Blackrock College]]\n|[[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 69 \n|1887-88, 1890, 1893\u201397, 1900\u201305, 1907-1910, 1912, 1915-1919, 1925, 1927-1930, 1933-1936, 1939, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1956, 1957, 1960, 1962,1964, 1967, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018\n'''SCT & JCT''' '''Double''' 27 times - '''1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, proof 1935, 1936, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackwhiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Belvedere College]]\n| [[Great Denmark Street]] , [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 12\n|1923\u201324, 1938, 1946, 1951, 1968, 1971\u201372, '''2005 (Double)''', 2008, 2016\u201317\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackpurplewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[Terenure College]]\n|[[Terenure]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 10\n|1952, '''1958 (Double)''', 1979\u201380, 1984, 1992\u201393, 1997, 2001, 2003\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 purplewhitepurple.svg|23x23px]] [[Clongowes Wood College]]\n| [[Clane]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 9\n|1926, 1978, 1988, 1991, 1998, 2000, 2010\u201311, '''2020 Shared''' \n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 navyskyyellow.svg|23x23px]] [[Castleknock College]]\n| [[Castleknock]], [[Dublin]]\n| 8\n|1913, '''1920 (Double)''', 1931, 1937, 1944, 1947, 1959, 1965\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 bluewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]]\n|[[Rathmines]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 5\n|1961, 1966, 1969, 1994, 2002\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 bluewhiteblue.svg|23x23px]] [[St. Andrew's College (Ireland)|St. Andrew's College]]\n| [[Booterstown]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 4\n| 1906, 1911, 1921\u201322\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 whiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Newbridge College]]\n| [[Newbridge, County Kildare|Newbridge]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 3\n|1941, 1970, '''2020 Shared (Double)''' \n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 skynavy.svg|23x23px]] [[St Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]]\n|[[Ailesbury Road]], [[Dublin 4]]\n| 3\n|2007, '''2012 (Double)''', '''2019 (Double)'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 maroonyellowmaroon.svg|23x23px]] [[De La Salle College Churchtown|De La Salle Churchtown]]\n| [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]], [[Dublin]]\n| 2\n|1983, 1985\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 redyellowblack.svg|23x23px]] [[C.B.C.

In September 2013, [http://www.beauchamps.ie Beauchamps Solicitors] became the new title sponsor for the Leinster Schools Senior Cup. For the duration of this partnership with Beauchamps, the Senior Cup will be known as the \"Beauchamps Leinster Schools Senior Cup\".<ref>http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/domestic/10954.php#.Us166rR0mPx</ref>\n\nThe competition receives extensive coverage in Ireland's broadsheets, in particular ''[[The Irish Independent]]'' and ''[[The Irish Times]]''. Both publish previews of each year's competition and provide match reports for each game played.\n\nIn years gone by the competition's final on St Patrick's Day would sometimes be broadcast on [[TG4]], however, this was discontinued in the early 2000s. From 2005 onwards, however, [[Setanta Sports]] began extensive coverage of school's rugby. This included the finals of all provincial finals and coverage of the Leinster Schools Junior Cup. The Leinster Senior Cup was most prominent, however, with coverage from every game played at Donnybrook and every round of the competition.\n\n[[FreeSports]] replaced [[Eir Sport]] as the competition broadcaster ahead of the 2019 competition where they will broadcast eight games live.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.the42.ie/leinster-senior-schools-cup-freesports-tv-coverage-4433241-Jan2019/|title =Leinster Rugby announces new TV deal for 2019 Senior Schools Cup|date=11 January 2019|work=The 42|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Leinster School of the Year Award==\nIn 2008, Leinster Rugby instituted a new award for overall performance of a school at every level of schools rugby.

He takes part in several campaigns with the school, including the Leinster Junior Cup. The school's name is an homage to that in Paul Howard's books, as Siggins had coined the name \"Ross O'Carroll Kelly\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Schools Junior Cup]]\n* [[Leinster Rugby]]\n* [[Connacht Schools Senior Cup]]\n* [[Munster Schools Rugby Senior Cup]]\n* [[Ulster Schools Senior Cup]]\n* [[Ireland national schoolboy rugby union team]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090629185401/http://www.cbcrugby.com/ CBC Monkstown Rugby]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=20&docID=1436 This Year's Draw]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie Leinster Rugby]\n* [http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]\n* [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/sport/2009/0121/1232474670860.html 2009 Irish Times Preview]\n* [https://www.leinsterrugby.ie/irfu-conclude-incomplete-201920-season-immediate-effect/]\n\n{{Rugby union in Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:High school rugby union competitions in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Rugby union competitions in Leinster]]\n[[Category:1887 establishments in Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n{{Infobox Sports league|title=Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Cup|sport=Rugby Union|founded=1887|teams=16 (season 2018\u201319)|most_champs=[[Blackrock College]]<br>69|}}\n\n[[File:Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup.jpg|right|275px|The Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup]]\nThe '''Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup''' is the premier [[rugby union]] competition for secondary schools affiliated to the [[Leinster Branch]] of the [[IRFU]]. First held in 1887, the Cup celebrated its 120th anniversary in 2007.\n\nSchools Senior Cup Rugby is divided into 4 tiers in two sections and each cup competition bears a name as follows: Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby Senior Development Cup]] (effectively division 4), Section A [[Leinster Schools Rugby McMullen Cup]] (effectively division 3), Section B [[Leinster Schools Vinnie Murray Cup]] (effectively division 2), Section B Leinster Schools Senior Challenge Cup (effectively division 1).\n\nAttendances are high for a schoolboy competition, with up to 25,000 present at the final. This match traditionally takes place on [[Saint Patrick's Day]] at [[Aviva Stadium|Lansdowne Road]] (now known as the [[Aviva Stadium]]). In 2008, the final was played at the [[RDS Arena|Royal Dublin Society Grounds]] (RDS) after Donnybrook proved to be way too small for the 2007 final, (Lansdowne Road was closed for redevelopment) and has been the home since. Since the move to the RDS the attendance has decreased and is now typically 10,000- 14,000.\n\nThe competition has been subject to criticism from various quarters as being \"elitist\" (as most of the competing schools are fee-paying; in fact only one non fee-paying school has won the cup, De La Salle Churchtown) and for putting undue pressure on its participants. It is also the subject of satire through the [[Ross O'Carroll Kelly]] newspaper column and novels. The competition and schools rugby in the four provinces has been praised though with \"Irish (rugby) game in debt to schools rugby\".<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/edmund-van-esbeck-irish-game-in-debt-to-schools-rugby-182795.html Irish game in debt to schools rugby]</ref>\n\n[[Blackrock College]] are the most successful school in the Cup's history, having lifted the Cup 69 times, an accumulative total larger than all other teams combined.<ref name=\"multiple\">\n[http://www.leinsterrugby.ie/members/index.asp?locID=422&docID=-1 Statistics compiled by Des Daly, Irish Rugby Statistician]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThree schools have won the Cup at their first attempt; [[Blackrock College]] in the competition's maiden year in 1887, [[Castleknock College]] who won the first of their eight Leinster titles at the first time of asking when they defeated Blackrock in the 1913 final and Clongowes Wood College who first won the cup in 1926. [[St. Fintan's High School]] are the most recent 'new' school to the competition, making their debut in 2016/17 season and are coached by Belvedere College 2008 Senior Cup winning captain Thomas Sexton and vice-captain Peter Synnott.\n\nTo date only six schools have achieved the Senior and Junior Cup \"double\". These are Blackrock, who have achieved this feat 27 times (1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, 1935\u201336, 1942\u201343, 1945, 1948, 1953\u201354, 1956\u201357, 1962, 1964, 1981\u201382, 1986\u201387, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2013\u201314, 2018), St Michaels twice (2012 & 2019), Newbridge College (2020), Belvedere (2005), Terenure (1958) and Castleknock College (1920).\n\nEven more rare is to lose both the Senior and Junior Cup Finals in the same year. This depressing feat has been achieved by seven schools on 12 occasions. Terenure College leads with 4 (1957, 1964, 1969 & 1987), followed by Belvedere College with 3 (1930, 1944 & 1962), next St Michaels College (2010), St Mary's College (1943), [[Newbridge College]] (1939), Cistercian College Roscrea (1910) and [[Blackrock College]] (2017) with 1 each. This happened to [[Blackrock College]] for the first time in 2017.\n\nBlackrock College have only been defeated in successive finals on two occasions. In the 1920s they were runners up three times in a row, defeated by St Andrews in 1921 & 1922 followed by Belvedere in 1923. The second occasion was in 1979 & 1980 when they were defeated in successive finals by Terenure College.\n\nThe 91st Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final in 1977 between Blackrock College and St Mary\u2019s College finished level at 12 points each at the end of normal time. Having played 70 minutes the two sides now faced an additional 15 minutes extra time. Six minutes into extra time Blackrock got a try from fullback Patrick Hinkson. Hugo MacNeill kicked the sideline conversion. Two further MacNeill penalties in the second half of extra time sealed victory for Blackrock. Among the future Irish senior internationals playing that day were Hugo MacNeill and Paul Dean. The 1977 Leinster Senior Schools Cup Final was played on Sunday 20 March 1977 and not the normal St Patrick\u2019s Day. This decision was made to protect the Lansdowne Road pitch following poor weather prior to the Ireland v France Five Nations fixture on the 19 March. \n\nGrainey video footage is available on archives on www.rte.ie. The edition of Sports Club was broadcast 31 March 1977. The commentator is Fred Cogley.\n\nIn September 1967 The then Minister for Education Donogh O\u2019Malley\u2019s introduced free secondary school education. Only very few Rugby Playing secondary schools opted to join the \"Free Education\" scheme. To date only one of these non-fee paying schools has managed to win the Senior Cup. In 1983 and 1985 De La Salle Churchtown beat Castleknock College and Blackrock College to bring the cup to Churchtown. In 2020 the daughter of the De La Salle coach, Jane Farley produced a wonderful Newstalk podcast documentary called \"Class Rugby\" which in a blast of music, memories and politics takes you back to the 1980's with a band of Churchtown teenagers as they take on the established rugby-playing private schools of Leinster.\n\nIn 2020 the final between Newbridge College and Clongowes Wood College had to be cancelled due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, as a result the title has been shared for the first time. 2020 was also the year that for the first time in the 133 year history of the competition that no Dublin School reached the final.\n\nFour captains have gained the distinction of lifting the cup twice, Larry McMahon (Blackrock College, 1929 and 1930), Garret Gill (Blackrock College, <ref>Leinster Schools Senior Rugby Cup Centenary Celebration 1886-1986</ref>1962 and 1963), Jonny Mion ([[Blackrock College]]) in 1989 and 1990, Barry Gibney (Blackrock College) in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThe Cup, and the Schools who play for it, have a history of producing fine rugby players, many of whom go on to play for [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]]. Players such as [[Denis Hickie]], who captained his [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]] team to win the cup in 1994, and [[Gordon D'Arcy]] have impressive senior cup records. The most international players produced have come from [[Blackrock College]], with players such as [[Hugo_MacNeill_(rugby_union)|Hugo MacNeill]], [[Brendan Mullin]], [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Victor Costello]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Bob Casey (rugby player)|Bob Casey]], [[Leo Cullen (rugby player)|Leo Cullen]] and more recently [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Ian Madigan]], [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]] and [[Joey Carbery]]. Terenure College has also produced many Irish international players including Mick Hipwell (also Lion's 1971), Kevin Flynn, Paul Haycock, Niall Hogan (Irish Captain 1995), Conor O'Shea (former head coach Italian national team), Ciaran Clarke, and Girvan Dempsey. De La Salle Churchtown produced the following Internationals - Des Fitzgerald (34 caps) played in 2 RWCs. Named to Lions Team to mark centenary of IRB\nTom Clancy (9 caps), Brian Glennon (1 cap), Niyi Adeolokun (1 cap), Lar Hudson (7 caps) and Austin Quirke (6 caps for France).\n\n==Roll of honour==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  style=\"width:25%; background:silver;\"| '''School'''\n!  style=\"width:30%; background:silver;\"| '''Location'''\n!  style=\"width:5%; background:silver;\"| '''Titles'''\n!  style=\"width:40%; background:silver;\"| '''Winning years'''\n\n|-\n|[[File:sq3 skywhitesky.svg|23x23px]] [[Blackrock College]]\n|[[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 69 \n|1887-88, 1890, 1893\u201397, 1900\u201305, 1907-1910, 1912, 1915-1919, 1925, 1927-1930, 1933-1936, 1939, 1940, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1956, 1957, 1960, 1962,1964, 1967, 1974, 1975, 1977, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1995, 1996, 1999, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018\n'''SCT & JCT''' '''Double''' 27 times - '''1910, 1912, 1927, 1933, proof 1935, 1936, 1942, 1943, 1945, 1948, 1953, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1962, 1964, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1995, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2018'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackwhiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Belvedere College]]\n| [[Great Denmark Street]] , [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 12\n|1923\u201324, 1938, 1946, 1951, 1968, 1971\u201372, '''2005 (Double)''', 2008, 2016\u201317\n\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 blackpurplewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[Terenure College]]\n|[[Terenure]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 10\n|1952, '''1958 (Double)''', 1979\u201380, 1984, 1992\u201393, 1997, 2001, 2003\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 navyskyyellow.svg|23x23px]] [[Castleknock College]]\n| [[Castleknock]], [[Dublin]]\n| 8\n|1913, '''1920 (Double)''', 1931, 1937, 1944, 1947, 1959, 1965\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 purplewhitepurple.svg|23x23px]] [[Clongowes Wood College]]\n| [[Clane]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 8\n|1926, 1978, 1988, 1991, 1998, 2000, 2010\u201311\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 bluewhite.svg|23x23px]] [[St Mary's College, Dublin|St. Mary's College]]\n|[[Rathmines]], [[Dublin|Dublin City]]\n| 5\n|1961, 1966, 1969, 1994, 2002\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 bluewhiteblue.svg|23x23px]] [[St. Andrew's College (Ireland)|St. Andrew's College]]\n| [[Booterstown]], [[D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n| 4\n| 1906, 1911, 1921\u201322\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 skynavy.svg|23x23px]] [[St Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]]\n|[[Ailesbury Road]], [[Dublin 4]]\n| 3\n|2007, '''2012(Double)''', '''2019(Double)'''\n|-\n|[[Image:sq2 whiteblack.svg|23x23px]] [[Newbridge College]]\n| [[Newbridge, County Kildare|Newbridge]], [[County Kildare]]\n| 2\n|1941, 1970\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 maroonyellowmaroon.svg|23x23px]] [[De La Salle College Churchtown|De La Salle Churchtown]]\n| [[Churchtown, Dublin|Churchtown]], [[Dublin]]\n| 2\n|1983, 1985\n|-\n|[[Image:sq3 redyellowblack.svg|23x23px]] [[C.B.C.

From 2005 onwards, however, [[Setanta Sports]] began extensive coverage of school's rugby. This included the finals of all provincial finals and coverage of the Leinster Schools Junior Cup. The Leinster Senior Cup was most prominent, however, with coverage from every game played at Donnybrook and every round of the competition.\n\n[[FreeSports]] replaced [[Eir Sport]] as the competition broadcaster ahead of the 2019 competition where they will broadcast eight games live.<ref>{{citeweb|url= https://www.the42.ie/leinster-senior-schools-cup-freesports-tv-coverage-4433241-Jan2019/|title =Leinster Rugby announces new TV deal for 2019 Senior Schools Cup|date=11 January 2019|work=The 42|accessdate=11 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Leinster School of the Year Award==\nIn 2008, Leinster Rugby instituted a new award for overall performance of a school at every level of schools rugby.

There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the British royal family.\n\nThose who at the time are entitled to the [[style (manner of address)|style]] [[Royal Highness|His or Her Royal Highness (HRH)]], and any styled [[Majesty|His or Her Majesty (HM)]], are normally considered members, including those so styled before the beginning of the current monarch's reign. By this criterion, a list of the current royal family will usually include the monarch, the children and male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, the children of the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]], and all of their current or widowed spouses.\n\nSome members of the royal family have official residences named as the places from which announcements are made in the [[Court Circular]] about official engagements they have carried out. The state duties and staff of some members of the royal family are funded from a parliamentary annuity, the amount of which is fully refunded by the Queen to the Treasury.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_main_provisions.htm Sovereign Grant Act: main provisions]</ref>\n\nSince 1917, when [[King George V]] changed the name of the royal house from [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], members of the royal family have belonged, either by birth or by marriage, to the [[House of Windsor]]. Senior titled members of the royal family do not usually use a [[surname]], although since 1960 [[Mountbatten-Windsor]], incorporating [[Prince Philip]]'s adopted surname of [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]], has been prescribed as a surname for Elizabeth II's direct descendants who do not have royal styles and titles, and it has sometimes been used when required for those who do have such titles. The royal family are regarded as British [[cultural icon]]s, with young adults from abroad naming the family among a group of people that they most associated with [[British culture]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Culture, attraction and soft power|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/as-others-see-us-report.pdf|publisher=British Council|date=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Status==\nOn 30 November 1917, King George V issued [[letters patent]] defining the styles and titles of members of the royal family; the text of the notice from the ''[[The London Gazette|London Gazette]]'' is:<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30428 |date=14 December 1917 |page=13086 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|''Whitehall'', 11''th December'', 1917.<br />\n:The KING has been pleased by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], bearing date the 30th ultimo, to define the styles and titles to be borne henceforth by members of the royal family.  It is declared by the Letters Patent that the children of any Sovereign of the United Kingdom and the children of the sons of any such Sovereign and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names or with their other titles of honour; that save as aforesaid the titles of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness, and the titular dignity of Prince and Princess shall cease except those titles already granted and remaining unrevoked; and that the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes.}}\n\nIn 1996, Queen Elizabeth II modified these letters patent, and this Notice appeared in the ''London Gazette'':<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54510 |date=30 August 1996 |page=11603 |nolink=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The QUEEN has been pleased by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm dated 21st August 1996, to declare that a former wife (other than a widow until she shall remarry) of a son of a Sovereign of these Realms, of a son of a son of a Sovereign and of the eldest living son of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales shall not be entitled to hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness.}}\n\nOn 31 December 2012, letters patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the royal family to additional persons to be born, and this Notice appeared in the ''London Gazette'':<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |date=8 January 2013 |page=213 |nolink=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The QUEEN has been pleased by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] dated 31 December 2012 to declare that all the children of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour.}}\n\nMembers and relatives of the British royal family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the [[British Empire]], sometimes for extended periods as [[viceroy]]s, or for specific ceremonies or events. Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Aside from the monarch, their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve, if eligible and when appointed by letters patent, as a [[Counsellor of State]], two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown (within stipulated limits) if the monarch is indisposed or abroad. In the other countries of [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State, although they may perform ceremonial and social duties on behalf of individual states or the organisation.\n\nThe Queen, her consort, her children and grandchildren, as well as all former sovereigns' children and grandchildren, hold places in the first sections of the official [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|orders of precedence in England and Wales]], [[Order of precedence in Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Order of precedence in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. Wives of the said enjoy their husbands' precedence, and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well. However, the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the royal family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra, who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall, who is otherwise the realm's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Davies|first = Caroline|date =  24 December 2005|title = First royal Sandringham Christmas for Camilla|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506237/First-royal-Sandringham-Christmas-for-Camilla.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last = Eden|first = Richard|date =  24 June 2012|title = The Queen tells the Duchess of Cambridge to curtsy to the 'blood princesses'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9351571/The-Queen-tells-the-Duchess-of-Cambridge-to-curtsy-to-the-blood-princesses.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> She did not alter the relative precedence of other born-princesses, such as the daughters of her younger sons.\n\n== Public role ==\nThe British royal family support [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her state and national duties.

There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the British royal family.\n\nThose who at the time are entitled to the [[style (manner of address)|style]] [[Royal Highness|His or Her Royal Highness (HRH)]], and any styled [[Majesty|His or Her Majesty (HM)]], are normally considered members, including those so styled before the beginning of the current monarch's reign. By this criterion, a list of the current royal family will usually include the monarch, the children and male-line grandchildren of the monarch and previous monarchs, the children of the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]], and all of their current or widowed spouses.\n\nSome members of the royal family have official residences named as the places from which announcements are made in the [[Court Circular]] about official engagements they have carried out. The state duties and staff of some members of the royal family are funded from a parliamentary annuity, the amount of which is fully refunded by the Queen to the Treasury.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/leg_sovereign_grant_main_provisions.htm Sovereign Grant Act: main provisions]</ref>\n\nSince 1917, when [[King George V]] changed the name of the royal house from [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], members of the royal family have belonged, either by birth or by marriage, to the [[House of Windsor]]. Senior titled members of the royal family do not usually use a [[surname]], although since 1960 [[Mountbatten-Windsor]], incorporating [[Prince Philip]]'s adopted surname of [[Mountbatten family|Mountbatten]], has been prescribed as a surname for Elizabeth II's direct descendants who do not have royal styles and titles, and it has sometimes been used when required for those who do have such titles. The royal family are regarded as British [[cultural icon]]s, with young adults from abroad naming the family among a group of people that they most associated with [[British culture]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Culture, attraction and soft power|url=https://www.britishcouncil.org/sites/default/files/as-others-see-us-report.pdf|publisher=British Council|date=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Status==\nOn 30 November 1917, King George V issued [[letters patent]] defining the styles and titles of members of the royal family; the text of the notice from the ''[[The London Gazette|London Gazette]]'' is:<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30428 |date=14 December 1917 |page=13086 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|''Whitehall'', 11''th December'', 1917.<br />\n:The KING has been pleased by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], bearing date the 30th ultimo, to define the styles and titles to be borne henceforth by members of the royal family.  It is declared by the Letters Patent that the children of any Sovereign of the United Kingdom and the children of the sons of any such Sovereign and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names or with their other titles of honour; that save as aforesaid the titles of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness, and the titular dignity of Prince and Princess shall cease except those titles already granted and remaining unrevoked; and that the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes.}}\n\nIn 1996, Queen Elizabeth II modified these letters patent, and this Notice appeared in the ''London Gazette'':<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=54510 |date=30 August 1996 |page=11603 |nolink=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The QUEEN has been pleased by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of the Realm dated 21st August 1996, to declare that a former wife (other than a widow until she shall remarry) of a son of a Sovereign of these Realms, of a son of a son of a Sovereign and of the eldest living son of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales shall not be entitled to hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness.}}\n\nOn 31 December 2012, letters patent were issued to extend a title and a style borne by members of the royal family to additional persons to be born, and this Notice appeared in the ''London Gazette'':<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |date=8 January 2013 |page=213 |nolink=yes }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The QUEEN has been pleased by Letters Patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] dated 31 December 2012 to declare that all the children of the eldest son of The Prince of Wales should have and enjoy the style, title and attribute of Royal Highness with the titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their Christian names or with such other titles of honour.}}\n\nMembers and relatives of the British royal family historically represented the monarch in various places throughout the [[British Empire]], sometimes for extended periods as [[viceroy]]s, or for specific ceremonies or events. Today, they often perform ceremonial and social duties throughout the United Kingdom and abroad on behalf of the United Kingdom. Aside from the monarch, their only constitutional role in the affairs of government is to serve, if eligible and when appointed by letters patent, as a [[Counsellor of State]], two or more of whom exercise the authority of the Crown (within stipulated limits) if the monarch is indisposed or abroad. In the other countries of [[Commonwealth of Nations|the Commonwealth]] royalty do not serve as Counsellors of State, although they may perform ceremonial and social duties on behalf of individual states or the organisation.\n\nThe Queen, her consort, her children and grandchildren, as well as all former sovereigns' children and grandchildren, hold places in the first sections of the official [[Order of precedence in England and Wales|orders of precedence in England and Wales]], [[Order of precedence in Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Order of precedence in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. Wives of the said enjoy their husbands' precedence, and husbands of princesses are unofficially but habitually placed with their wives as well. However, the Queen changed the private order of precedence in the royal family in favour of Princesses Anne and Alexandra, who henceforth take private precedence over the Duchess of Cornwall, who is otherwise the realm's highest ranking woman after the Queen herself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Davies|first = Caroline|date =  24 December 2005|title = First royal Sandringham Christmas for Camilla|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1506237/First-royal-Sandringham-Christmas-for-Camilla.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last = Eden|first = Richard|date =  24 June 2012|title = The Queen tells the Duchess of Cambridge to curtsy to the 'blood princesses'|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9351571/The-Queen-tells-the-Duchess-of-Cambridge-to-curtsy-to-the-blood-princesses.html|accessdate =9 January 2013|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref> She did not alter the relative precedence of other born-princesses, such as the daughters of her younger sons.\n\n== Public role ==\nThe British royal family support [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in her state and national duties.

It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J. Falzone, \"Terence V. Powderly: Politician and Progressive Mayor of Scranton, 1878-1884,\" ''Pennsylvania History'' 41.3 (1974): 289-309.</ref> While the Catholic Church had prohibited membership in secret organizations since the mid-18th century, by the late 1880s with the influence of Archbishop [[James Gibbons]] of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], it supported the Knights of Labor as representing workingmen and union organizing.\n\nThe landmark [[Coal strike of 1902]], was called by anthracite miners across the region and led by the [[United Mine Workers]] under [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]]. The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated.

R.R. yards, Scranton, Pa. between 1890 and 1901.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] yards in Scranton, ca.1895]]\n\nBy the [[United States Census]] of 1900, the population of Scranton was about 102,026, making it the third-largest city in Pennsylvania and 38th-largest U.S. city.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/42/4269000.html|title=Scranton(city) QuickFacts|accessdate=2007-07-24}}</ref>\nAt the turn of the 20th century, wealthy businessmen and industrialists built impressive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansions in the Hill and Green Ridge sections of the city. Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

It is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]]'s [[Wyoming Valley]] and hosts a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] building for the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania]]. With a population of 77,291, it is the largest city in the [[Scranton\u2013Wilkes-Barre\u2013Hazleton, PA Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which has a population of about 570,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.com/scranton-wilkes-barre-pa-area.htm |title=Scranton, Wilkes, Barre Metro Area |publisher=Usa.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The city is conventionally divided into 8 districts: North Scranton, Southside, Westside, the Hill Section, Central City, Minooka, East Mountain, and Green Ridge, though these areas do not have legal status.\n\nScranton is the geographic and cultural center of the [[Lackawanna River]] valley and Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the largest of the former [[anthracite coal]] mining communities in a contiguous quilt-work that also includes [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Nanticoke, Pennsylvania|Nanticoke]], [[Pittston, Pennsylvania|Pittston]], and [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]]. Scranton was incorporated on February 14, 1856, as a [[borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] in [[Luzerne County]] and as a [[city (Pennsylvania)|city]] on April 23, 1866. It became a major industrial city, a center of mining and railroads, and attracted thousands of new immigrants. It was the site of the [[Scranton General Strike]] in 1877.\n\nPeople in northern Luzerne County sought a new county in 1839 but the [[Wilkes-Barre]] area resisted losing its assets. Lackawanna County did not gain independent status until 1878. Under legislation allowing the issue to be voted by residents of the proposed territory, voters favored the new county by a proportion of 6 to 1, with Scranton residents providing the major support. The city was designated as the county seat when [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] was established in 1878, and a judicial district was authorized in July 1879.\n\nThe city's nickname \"Electric City\" began when electric lights were introduced in 1880 at the [[Dickson Manufacturing Company]]. Six years later, the United States's first [[streetcar]]s powered only by electricity began operating in the city.<ref>http://explorepahistory.com/hmarker.php?markerId=1-A-39E</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html|title=Pennsylvania Historical Marker Search|website=www.phmc.state.pa.us}}</ref>{{dubious| the claim is widespread, but it simply means a single line was set up as electric.|date=May 2016}} Rev.

But while the national economy boomed after the war, demand for the region's coal declined as other forms of energy became more popular, which also harmed the rail industry. Foreseeing the decline, city leaders formulated the Scranton Plan in 1945 to diversify the local economy beyond coal, but the city's economy continued to decline. The [[Knox Mine disaster]] of 1959 essentially ended coal mining in the region. Scranton's population dropped from its peak of 143,000 in [[1930 United States Census|1930 census]] to 88,000 in the [[1980 United States Census|1980 census]]. The city's economy and population stabilized in the 1980s and 1990s. The city now has large health care and manufacturing sectors.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-industrial (1776\u20131845)===\nPresent-day Scranton and its surrounding area had been long inhabited by the native [[Lenape|Lenape tribe]], from whose language \"Lackawanna\" (or ''lac-a-wa-na,'' meaning \"stream that forks\"), is derived. In 1778, Isaac Tripp, the area's first known white settler, built his home here; it still stands in North Scranton, formerly a separate town known as Providence. More settlers from Connecticut came to the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries after the [[American Revolutionary War]], as their state claimed this area as part of their colonial charter.\n\nIn the 1840s there would have been at least 4 mentions of the office.  They gradually established mills and other small businesses in a village that became known as Slocum Hollow. People in the village during this time carried the traits and accent of their New England settlers, which were somewhat different from most of Pennsylvania. Some area settlers from Connecticut participated in what was known as the [[Pennamite Wars]], where settlers competed for control of the territory which had been included in royal colonial land grants to both states. (This claim between Connecticut and Pennsylvania was settled by negotiation with the federal government after independence.)\n\n===Arrival of industry (1846\u20131899)===\n[[File:George Inness - The Lackawanna Valley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton in 1855, as depicted by [[George Inness]]'s painting ''The Lackawanna Valley'', noting [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] of the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] ]]\n[[File:Scranton-1.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Scranton, as depicted on an 1890 panoramic map]] Though [[anthracite coal]] was being mined in Carbondale to the north and Wilkes-Barre to the south, the industries that precipitated the city's early rapid growth were [[iron]] and [[steel]]. In the 1840s, brothers Selden T. and [[George W. Scranton]], who had worked at [[Oxford Furnace]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], founded what became Lackawanna Iron & Coal, later developing as the [[Lackawanna Steel Company]]. It initially started producing iron nails, but that venture failed due to low-quality iron. The [[Erie Railroad]]'s construction in New York State was delayed by its having to acquire iron rails as imports from England. The Scrantons' firm decided to switch its focus to producing [[Rail profile|T-rails]] for the Erie; the company soon became a major producer of rails for the rapidly expanding railroads.\n\nIn 1851, the Scrantons built the [[Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (L&W) northward, with recent Irish immigrants supplying most of the labor, to meet the Erie Railroad in [[Great Bend, Pennsylvania]]. Thus they could transport manufactured rails from the Lackawanna Valley to New York and the Midwest. They also invested in coal mining operations in the city to fuel their steel operations, and to market it to businesses. In 1856, they expanded the railroad eastward as the [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]] (DL&W), in order to tap into the New York City metropolitan market. This railroad, with its hub in Scranton, was Scranton's largest employer for almost one hundred years.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Coal Company built a [[gravity railroad]] in the 1850s through the city for the purpose of transporting coal. The gravity railroad was replaced by a steam railroad built in 1886 by the Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad (later absorbed by the Erie Railroad).  The [[Delaware and Hudson]] (D&H) Canal Company, which had its own gravity railroad from Carbondale to [[Honesdale]], built a [[steam railroad]] that entered Scranton in 1863.\n\nDuring this short period of time, the city rapidly transformed from a small, agrarian-based village of people with New England roots to a multicultural, industrial-based city. From 1860 to 1900, the city's population increased more than tenfold. Most new immigrants, such as the Irish, Italians, and south Germans and Polish, were Catholic, a contrast to the majority-Protestant early settlers of colonial descent. National, ethnic, religious and class differences were wrapped into political affiliations, with many new immigrants joining the Democratic Party (and, for a time in the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party|Greenbacker-Labor]] Party.)\n\nIn 1856, the Borough of Scranton was officially incorporated. It was incorporated as a city of 35,000 in 1866 in Luzerne County, when the surrounding boroughs of Hyde Park (now part of the city's West Side) and Providence (now part of North Scranton) were merged with Scranton. Twelve years later in 1878, the state passed a law enabling creation of new counties where a county's population surpassed 150,000, as did Luzerne's. The law appeared to enable the creation of [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]], and there was considerable political agitation around the authorizing process. Scranton was designated by the state legislature as the county seat of the newly-formed county, which was also established as a separate judicial district, with state judges moving over from Luzerne County after courts were organized in October 1878. This was the last county in the state to be organized.\n\nCreation of the new county, which enabled both more local control and political patronage, helped begin the [[Scranton General Strike]] of 1877. This was in part due to the larger [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877|Great Railroad Strike]], in which railroad workers began to organize and participate in walkouts after wage cuts in [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]]. The national economy had lagged since the Panic of 1873, and workers in many industries struggled with low wages and intermittent work. In Scranton, mineworkers followed the railroad men off the job, as did others. A protest of 5,000 strikers ended in violence, with a total of four men killed, and 20 to 50 injured, including the mayor. He had established a militia, but called for help from the governor and state militia. Governor [[John Hartranft]] eventually brought in federal troops to quell the strike. The workers gained nothing in wages, but began to organize more purposefully into labor unions that could wield more power.\n\nThe nation's first successful, continuously-operating electrified [[streetcar]] (trolley) system was established in the city in 1886, inspiring the nickname \"The Electric City\". In 1896, the city's various streetcar companies were consolidated into the [[Scranton Railway|Scranton Railway Company]], which ran trolleys until 1954. By 1890, three other railroads had built lines to tap into the rich supply of coal in and around the city, including the Erie Railroad, the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] and finally the [[New York, Ontario and Western Railway]] (NYO&W).\n\nAs the vast rail network spread above ground, an even larger network of railways served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who in the early years were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the [[coal breaker|breakers]]. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not have to search for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.\n\nBusiness was booming at the end of the 19th century. The tonnage of coal mined increased virtually every year, as did the steel manufactured by the Lackawanna Steel Company. At one point the company had the largest steel plant in the United States, and it was still the second-largest producer at the turn of the 20th century. By 1900, the city had a population of more than 100,000.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Scranton was home to a series of early [[International League]] baseball teams.\n\n===Labor history===\nGiven its industrial basis, Scranton has had a notable labor history; various coal worker unions struggled throughout the coal-mining era to improve working conditions, raise wages, and guarantee fair treatment for workers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Azzarelli, Margo L. |author2=Marnie Azzarelli|title=Labor Unrest in Scranton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sy4LDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2016|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=9781625856814}}</ref>  The Panic of 1873 and other economic difficulties caused a national recession and loss of business. As the economy contracted, the railroad companies reduced wages of workers in most classes (while sometimes reserving raises for their top management). A major strike of railroad workers in August 1877, part of the [[Great Railroad Strike]], attracted workers from the steel industry and mining as well, and developed as the [[Scranton General Strike]]. Four rioters were killed during unrest during the strike, after the mayor mustered a militia. With violence suppressed by militia and federal troops, workers finally returned to their jobs, not able to gain any economic relief. [[William Walker Scranton]], from the prominent family, was then general manager of Lackawanna Iron and Coal. He later founded [[Scranton Steel Company]].\n\nThe labor issues and growth of industry in Scranton contributed to Lackawanna County being established by the state legislature in 1878, with territory taken from Luzerne County. Scranton was designated as the county seat. This strengthened its local government.\n\nThe unions failed to gain higher wages that year, but in 1878 they elected labor leader [[Terence V. Powderly]] of the [[Knights of Labor]] as mayor of Scranton. After that, he became national leader of the KoL, a predominately{{dubious|Perhaps a bare majority, although the situation may have been different in Scranton.|date=May 2016}} Catholic organization that had a peak membership of 700,000 about 1880.<ref>Vincent J.

The strike was settled by a compromise brokered by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. A statue of John Mitchell was installed in his honor on the grounds of the Lackawanna County Courthouse in Scranton, \"the site of the Coal Strike of 1902 negotiations in which President Roosevelt participated. Because of the significance of these negotiations, the statue and the Courthouse were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997. John Mitchell is buried in Cathedral Cemetery in Scranton.\"<ref>{{cite article|author=Sarah Scinto|title=Labor leader's grave restored|url=http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/labor-leader-s-grave-restored-1.1577236|publisher=Scranton Times-Tribune|date=October 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Growth, prosperity and consequences (1900\u20131945)===\n[[File:D.L. & W.

Most were descended from colonists and belonged to the Republican Party. The industrial workers, who tended to be later immigrants from Ireland and southern and eastern Europe, were predominately Catholic. With a flood of immigrants in the market, they suffered poor working conditions and wages.\n\nIn 1902, the dwindling local iron ore supply, labor issues, and an aging plant cost the city the industry on which it was founded. The Lackawanna Steel Company and many of its workers were moved to [[Lackawanna, New York]], developed on [[Lake Erie]] just south of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. With a port on the lake, the company could receive iron ore shipped from the [[Mesabi Range]] in Minnesota, which was being newly mined. \n[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 377) BHL40563374 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|250px|City Hall and Soldiers Monument, ca. 1919, from ''National Geographic Magazine'']]\n\nScranton forged ahead as the capital of the anthracite coal industry. Attracting the thousands of workers needed to mine coal, the city developed new neighborhoods dominated by Italian and Eastern European immigrants, who brought their foods, cultures and religions. Many of the immigrants joined the Democratic Party. Their national churches and neighborhoods were part of the history of the city. Several [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches were founded and built during this period. A substantial Jewish community was also established, with most members coming from the Russian Empire and eastern Europe. Working conditions for miners were improved by the efforts of labor leaders such as [[John Mitchell (United Mine Workers)|John Mitchell]], who led the [[United Mine Workers]].\n\nThe sub-surface mining weakened whole neighborhoods, however, damaging homes, schools, and businesses when the land collapsed. In 1913 the state passed the Davis Act to establish the Bureau of Surface Support in Scranton. Because of the difficulty in dealing with the coal companies, citizens organized the [[Scranton Surface Protection Association]], chartered by the Court of Common Pleas on November 24, 1913 \"to protect the lives and property of the citizens of the City of Scranton and the streets of said city from injury, loss and damage caused by mining and mine caves.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\nIn 1915 and 1917, the city and Commonwealth sought injunctions to prevent coal companies from undermining city streets but lost their cases. North Main Avenue and Boulevard Avenue, \"both entitled to surface support, caved in as a result\" of court decisions that went against civil authorities and allowed the coal companies to continue their operations.<ref name=\"kashuba\"/>\n\n\"The case of 'Penman v. Jones' came out differently. The Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co. had leased coal lands to the Lackawanna Iron & Steel Co., an allied interest, which passed the leases on to the Scranton Coal Co. Areas of central Scranton, the Hill Section, South Side, Pine Brook, Green Ridge and Hyde Park were affected by their mining activities. Mr. Penman was the private property owner in the case. The coal operators were defeated in this case.\"<ref name=\"kashuba\">[http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/scranton-takes-on-mining-cave-ins-1.1046286 Cheryl A.

The [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]], commonly referred to as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to [[Wilkes-Barre]]. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of [[Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania|Clarks Summit]] and [[Dalton, Pennsylvania|Dalton]]. They could travel to [[Lake Winola]] and [[Montrose, Pennsylvania|Montrose]] using the [[Scranton, Montrose and Binghamton Railroad|Northern Electric]] Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in transportation modes.<ref>''The Scranton Republican,'' July 5, 1934, \"Railway Firm's New Financial Setup Revealed\", p. 1</ref>\n\nStarting in the early 1920s, the [[Scranton Button Company]] (founded in 1885 and a major maker of shellac buttons) became one of the primary makers of phonograph records. They pressed records for [[Emerson Records|Emerson]] (whom they bought in 1924), as well as [[Regal Records (1921)|Regal]], [[Cameo Records|Cameo]], [[Romeo Records|Romeo]], [[Banner Records|Banner]], [[Domino Records (1924)|Domino]], [[Conqueror Records|Conqueror]]. In July 1929, the company merged with Regal, Cameo, Banner, and the U.S. branch of [[Path\u00e9 Records|Path\u00e9]] (makers of Path\u00e9 and [[Perfect Records|Perfect]]) to become the [[American Record Corporation]]. By 1938, the Scranton company was also pressing records for [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]], [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]], and [[Vocalion Records|Vocalion]]. In 1946, the company was acquired by [[Capitol Records]], which continued to produce [[phonograph records]] through the end of the vinyl era.\n\nBy the mid-1930s, the city population had swelled beyond 140,000<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> due to growth in the mining and [[silk]] textile industries. World War II created a great demand for energy, which led to the highest production from [[mining]] in the area since World War I.\n\n{{Clear}}<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Washington Avenue, Scranton, PA.jpg|Washington Ave. in 1907\nImage:Burning Culm Dump, Scranton, PA.jpg|Burning [[Spoil tip|culm]] dump c. 1908\nImage:Old Post Office, Scranton, PA.jpg|Old post office in 1911\n</gallery>\n\n===Post-World War II (1946\u20131984)===\nAfter World War II, coal lost favor to [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] as a heating fuel, largely because the latter types were more convenient to use. While some U.S. cities prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes and population of Scranton (and the rest of Lackawanna and [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne]] counties) began to diminish. Coal production and rail traffic declined rapidly throughout the 1950s, causing a loss of jobs.\n\nThe [[Knox Mine Disaster]] of January 1959 virtually ended the mining industry in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The waters of the [[Susquehanna River]] flooded the mines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |title=The Citizens Voice \u2013 Knox mine disaster remains in our memory because it is a story of right and wrong |publisher=Zwire.com |accessdate=2011-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107061533/http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=10845647&BRD=2259&PAG=461&dept_id=460522&rfi=8 |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msha.gov/District/Dist_01/Reports/Knox/cover.htm |title=cover |publisher=Msha.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-08-29}}</ref> The DL&W Railroad, nearly bankrupted by the drop in coal traffic and the effects of Hurricane Diane, merged in 1960 with the Erie Railroad.\nDemand for public transportation also declined as new highways were built by federal subsidies and people purchased automobiles. In 1952, the Laurel Line ceased passenger service. The Scranton Transit Company, whose trolleys had given the city its nickname, transferred all operations to buses as the 1954 holiday season approached; by the end of 1971, it ceased all operations. The city was left without any public transportation system for almost a year until the Lackawanna County government formed [[County of Lackawanna Transit System|COLTS]], which began operations in late 1972 with 1950s-era GM busses from New Jersey.\n\nScranton had been the hub of its operations until the [[Erie Lackawanna]] merger, after which it no longer served in this capacity. This was another severe blow to the local labor market. The NYO&W Railroad, which depended heavily on its Scranton branch for freight traffic, was abandoned in 1957. Mine [[subsidence]] was a spreading problem in the city as pillar supports in abandoned mines began to fail; cave-ins sometimes consumed entire blocks of homes. The area was left scarred by abandoned coal mining structures, strip mines, and massive [[culm dump]]s, some of which caught fire and burned for many years until they were extinguished through government efforts. In 1970, the Secretary of Mines for Pennsylvania suggested that so many underground voids had been left by mining underneath Scranton that it would be \"more economical\" to abandon the city than make them safe.<ref>{{cite book |title=Facts & Trivia |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |year=1998 |publisher=Siena |location=Bristol |isbn=0-75252-822-X |page=74}}</ref> In 1973, the last mine operations in Lackawanna County (which were in what is now [[McDade Park]], and another on the Scranton/[[Dickson City]] line) were closed.

The show was notable for its variety of awards including 5 Emmy Awards, 3 NAACP Image Awards, one Golden Globe Award, and many others.\n\nThe city is imagined as a member of the class of interstellar [[Okies]] in [[James Blish]]'s 1962 novel, ''[[A Life for the Stars]]'', in which 2273 AD Scranton, equipped with a space drive, flies away and leaves an impoverished Earth behind.\n\nIn 2017, Scranton got national recognition from late night television host [[John Oliver]] when he made jokes about how infatuated Scranton community members were with the little train that runs during the weather reports on Scranton's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-affiliated TV station [[WNEP-TV]]. The train had been featured in multiple of their Talkback16 segments. After a followup segment, Oliver donated a train set to WNEP. It was too big for their backyard, so they donated it to The [[Electric City Trolley Museum]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://wnep.com/2017/09/24/thousands-flock-to-electric-city-trolley-museum-to-see-the-new-backyard-train/ |title=John Oliver Reacts to Thousands Flocking to See the New Backyard Train |last=Whitehead |first=Anja |publisher=[[WNEP]] |date=25 September 2017 |access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\nThe main highways that serve Scranton are [[Interstate 81 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 81]], which runs North to [[Binghamton, New York]] and [[Ontario]] and south to Wilkes-Barre, [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] and [[Tennessee]]; [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]], which runs east to [[Milford, Pennsylvania|Milford]] and New England States; [[Interstate 380 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 380]], which runs southwest to [[Pocono Pines, Pennsylvania|Pocono Pines]] and [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|Interstate 80]] east to New York City and west to San Francisco; [[Interstate 476]]/[[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] Northeast Extension, which runs south to Allentown and Philadelphia; [[U.S. Route 6 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 6]], which runs east to Carbondale/Honesdale and parallel to I-84 to New England States and west to [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]]; and [[U.S. Route 11 in Pennsylvania|U.S. Route 11]], which runs parallel to I-81.\n\nScranton's provider of public transportation is the [[County of Lackawanna Transit System]] (COLTS). COLTS buses provide extensive service within the city and more limited service that reaches in all directions to [[Carbondale, Pennsylvania|Carbondale]], [[Covington Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Daleville]], [[Pittston]], and [[Benton Township, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Fleetville]]. The other bussing company is the [[Luzerne County Transportation Authority]] (LCTA), which mainly runs through The Minooka section (closest to Luzerne County) and Downtown Scranton by The Mall at Steamtown. LCTA takes passengers from Scranton to the [[Mohegan Sun Pocono]] racino in [[Plains, Pennsylvania|Plains]]\n\nThe [[Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport]] is located in nearby [[Avoca, Pennsylvania|Avoca]]. The [[airport]] is serviced by [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]], and [[United Airlines|United]].<ref>{{cite web |title=KAVP - Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport |url=https://www.airnav.com/airport/KAVP |website=AirNav |accessdate=17 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Martz Trailways]] and [[Greyhound Lines]] provide coach bus transportation from its downtown station to New York City, Philadelphia and other places in the Northeast.\n\nPrivate operators such as Posten Taxi and McCarthy Flowered Cabs service the Scranton area. They are hired by telephone through central dispatch and cannot be hailed on the street as in larger cities.\n\n===Railroads===\nRail transportation, vital to the city's historic growth, remains important today.\n\nThe [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] runs freight trains on the former [[Delaware, Lackawanna & Western]] (DL&W) line between Scranton and Binghamton, having taken over operations from the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] ([[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] division) in 2015. The [[Reading Blue Mountain & Northern Railroad]] serves the former DL&W Keyser Valley branch in the city.\n\nThe [[Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad]], as designated operator of county-owned rail lines, oversees the former Delaware and Hudson line from Scranton north to Carbondale, the former [[Delaware, Lackawanna & Western|DL&W]] line east to the [[Delaware Water Gap]] and the former [[Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad]] third-rail [[interurban streetcar]] line south to Montage Mountain, [[Moosic]]. These lines host the seasonal passenger trains of both the [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] and the [[Electric City Trolley Museum]] and are under the jurisdiction of the [[Pennsylvania Northeast Regional Rail Authority]].\n\nThe PNRRA was created by [[Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania|Lackawanna County]] and [[Monroe County, Pennsylvania|Monroe County]] to oversee the use of common rail freight lines in [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]], including one formerly owned by [[Conrail]] running from Scranton, through the [[the Poconos|Pocono Mountains]] towards [[New Jersey]] and the New York City market.\n\nOne of its primary objectives is to re-establish rail passenger service to [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] and thence by connection to New York.\nAs of 2011, regular passenger train service to Scranton is slated to be restored under a plan to extend [[NJ Transit]] service from Hoboken via the [[Lackawanna Cut-Off]].<ref name=\"njt\">{{cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/tm/tm_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=Project019To|title=Lackawanna Cutoff|publisher=[[New Jersey Transit]]|date=October 2009|accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref><ref name=\"njarp_2009\">{{cite web|title=NJ-ARP Annual Report 2008\u20132009 |date=November 19, 2009 |url=http://www.nj-arp.org/annrpt_09.pdf |accessdate=2011-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101043557/http://www.nj-arp.org/annrpt_09.pdf |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}</ref> The trains would pass the Lackawanna Station building and pull in at [[Scranton (NJT station)|a new Scranton station]] on Lackawanna Avenue along the northernmost track east of Bridge 60 (the railroad bridge over the [[Lackawanna River]]) and the Cliff Street underpass.<ref>NEW JERSEY \u2013 PENNSYLVANIA LACKAWANNA CUT-OFF\nPASSENGER RAIL SERVICE RESTORATION PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT, [[U.S. Department of Transportation]], [[Federal Transit Administration]] and NEW JERSEY TRANSIT in Cooperation with the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], June 2008.</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\n===Primary and secondary education===\nThe city's public schools are operated by the [[Scranton School District (Pennsylvania)|Scranton School District]] (SSD), which serves almost 10,000 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/document/846172/enrollment_public_school_2009-10_xls |title=Enterprise Portal |publisher=Portal.state.pa.us |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}</ref> The city has two public high schools for grades 9\u201312: [[Scranton High School (Pennsylvania)|Scranton High School]] just northwest of the downtown and [[West Scranton High School]] located on the West Side of the city.

[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\n\nMost Haredi and Hasidic seminaries likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

These are usually structured around continuing / [[adult education]], and accept both men and women.

[[Bar-Ilan University]] operates a ''midrasha'', and students in all disciplines may then continue Torah study in parallel with their academic studies (with a requirement of at least seven courses in Judaism<ref>[https://midrasha.biu.ac.il/en/node/406 Bar-Ilan ''Midrasha'']</ref>).\n\nMost Haredi and Hasidic seminaries likewise offer certificates, and sometimes degrees, in Education.

Wozencraft classified ''C. coreanus'' (Abe, 1923) as one of its synonyms.<ref name=wozencraft2005/>\n\nThere remains taxonomic confusion over the Mongolian wolf. In 1941, Pocock had referred to the [[Tibetan wolf]] as ''C. l. laniger'' and classified it as a synonym under ''C. l. chanco''.<ref name=pocock1941/> However, Wozencraft included ''C. l. laniger'' as a synonym for ''C. l. filchneri'' Matschie (1907).<ref name=wozencraft2005/> There are some researchers who still refer to Pocock's classification of the Tibetan wolf as ''C. l. chanco'', which has caused taxonomic confusion.
