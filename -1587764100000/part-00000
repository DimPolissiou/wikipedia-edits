Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nDespite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in eighteen months, when faster telegraph service was established.  Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\n[[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety. The mochila could hold {{convert|20|lb|0}} of mail along with the {{convert|20|lb|0}} of material carried on the horse.<ref>Riders were issued a Bible, a horn to alert employees at stations of their approach, a rifle, two Colt revolvers and ammunition for self-defense.

In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\n\nIt is unknown if riders tried crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to [[San Francisco]]. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about {{convert|75|mi|sigfig=2}} per day.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}\n<!-- No contemporary linking, please.

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |title=Pony Express: ''Romance'' versus ''Reality'' \n |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] \n |accessdate=December 10, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021120155/https://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |archivedate=October 21, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\n[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail.

It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}\n\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\n\n==Famous riders==\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&nbsp;\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:\n\n<blockquote>Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred{{efn|One historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that the \"orphans preferred\" ad is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.{{sfnp|Thompson|2005}}}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered one hundred dollars a month{{snd}}a handsome sum for that time.{{sfnp|Reinfeld|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAOQ83qZ2cC&pg=PA49 49]}} Author [[Mark Twain]] described the riders in his travel memoir ''[[Roughing It]]'' as: \"...&nbsp;usually a little bit of a man\". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}} There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company,{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=73\u201374}} but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their ''Saddles & Spurs'' (1972).{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=74\u201376}}\n\n{{For|the list of Pony Express riders|Category:Pony Express riders}}\n\n===First riders===\n[[File:Riders Pony Express.jpg|thumb|\"Billy\" Richardson, Johnny Fry, Charles Cliff, Gus Cliff]]\n\nThe identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either [[Johnny Fry]] or [[Johnson William Richardson|Billy Richardson]].{{sfnp|Root|Hickman|1946|loc=Note 358}}<ref name=\"NPSStables\" />{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs2e.htm Chap 2 p. 5]}}<ref name=\"museum\" /> Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A.

First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on the significance of the event for St. Joseph. Then William H. Russell and Alexander Majors addressed the gala crowd about how the Pony Express was just a \"precursor\" to the construction of a transcontinental railroad. At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15&nbsp;pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider.

At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains. A career as a scout for the Army under General [[Phillip Sheridan]] following the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a frontiersman.<ref>Buffalo Bill's Wild West, R.L.

Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to [[Jeremy Dehut]] in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\n\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.

Many people used the Pony Express as a communication link. It also encouraged catalogues to be created, allowing people to buy goods and have them brought by horse to the customers.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|pp=25\u201329}} It became the West's most direct means of east\u2013west communication before the [[First transcontinental telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new U.S. state of California with the rest of the [[United States]].\n\nDespite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in eighteen months, when faster telegraph service was established.  Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the [[American Old West|American West]]. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of individual young, hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the [[Frontier Thesis|Frontier]] times.\n\n==Inception and founding==\n[[File:Alexander Majors Pony Express.jpg|thumb|upright|Alexander Majors]]\n\nThe idea of a fast mail route to the Pacific coast was prompted largely by California's newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After [[California gold rush|gold was discovered there in 1848]], thousands of [[prospectors]], investors and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000.{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p=9}} The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the [[American Civil War]] approached.\n\n[[William Hepburn Russell|William Russell]], [[Alexander Majors]], and [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and [[drayage]] business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.{{sfn|Peters|1996|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nRussell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Hepburn-Russell|title=William Hepburn Russell {{!}} American businessman|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-03}}</ref> Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell & Co. After Morehead was bought out and retired, Waddell merged his company with Russell's, changing the name to Waddell & Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors & Waddell.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=4\u20135}} They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. Government for fast mail delivery.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932|p=76}}\n\nBy utilizing a short route and using mounted riders rather than traditional [[stagecoach]]es, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, a duration many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per {{convert|1/2|oz|g}}, then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.\n\nRussell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 120 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.<ref name=\"museum\">\n{{cite web\n|title=Pony Express National Museum\n|url=http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|publisher=City of St Joseph\n|accessdate=December 10, 2012\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312171306/http://www.ci.st-joseph.mo.us/history/ponyexpress.cfm\n|archivedate=March 12, 2013\n|df=mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nMajors was a religious man and resolved \"by the help of God\" to overcome all difficulties.

They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the mochila did. The mochila was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a ''cantina,'' or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these cantinas, which were padlocked for safety. The mochila could hold {{convert|20|lb|0}} of mail along with the {{convert|20|lb|0}} of material carried on the horse.<ref>Riders were issued a Bible, a horn to alert employees at stations of their approach, a rifle, two Colt revolvers and ammunition for self-defense.

Riders, who could not weigh over {{convert|125|lb}}, changed about every {{convert|75|\u2013|100|mi|sigfig=2}}, and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.\n\nIt is unknown if riders tried crossing the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in winter, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860 there was a telegraph station in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], [[Nevada Territory]]. The riders received $100 a month as pay. A comparable wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43\u2013$1 per day.\n\nAlexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project.

Through Nebraska it followed the [[Great Platte River Road]], cutting through [[Gothenburg, Nebraska]], clipping the edge of Colorado at [[Julesburg, Colorado]], and passing [[Courthouse Rock]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], and [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], before arriving at [[Fort Laramie]] in Wyoming. From there it followed the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], passing [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], [[Devil's Gate (Wyoming)|Devil's Gate]], and [[Split Rock (Wyoming)|Split Rock]], to [[Fort Caspar]], through [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] to [[Fort Bridger]] and then down to Salt Lake City. From Salt Lake City it generally followed the [[Central Nevada Route]] blazed by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers#History|Corps of Topographical Engineers]] in 1859. This route roughly follows today's [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the [[Great Basin]], the [[Central Nevada Route|Utah-Nevada Desert]], and the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] near [[Lake Tahoe]] before arriving in [[Sacramento]]. Mail was then sent via steamer down the [[Sacramento River]] to [[San Francisco]]. On a few instances when the steamer was missed, riders took the mail via horseback to [[Oakland, California]].\n\n===Stations===\nThere were 190 stations along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were very basic.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=113}} The route was divided up into five divisions.{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994}} To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from {{convert|5|to|25|mi|0}} apart as the terrain would allow for. At each ''swing station,'' riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while \"home stations\" provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be whisked across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about {{convert|75|mi|sigfig=2}} per day.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}\n<!-- No contemporary linking, please.

Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders sped along the route, over snow-covered trails and into Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California's newspapers received word of Lincoln's election only seven days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an \"unrivaled feat at the time\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |title=Pony Express: ''Romance'' versus ''Reality'' \n |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] \n |accessdate=December 10, 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021120155/https://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2a5a2_ponyexpress.html \n |archivedate=October 21, 2012 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Attacks==\n[[File:Pony Express Stolen Mail 1860.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Stolen Pony Express mail.

It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.\nIn the brief history of the Pony Express, it only happened once that the mail did not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.\n\nApproximately 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named [[Numaga]]. For three days Numaga fasted and argued for peace.{{sfnp|Angel|1881|p=151}}\nMeanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the [[Carson River]] near present-day [[Lake Lahontan]]. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.{{sfnp|Michno|2007|p=89-90}}\n\nDuring the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and approximately 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. The Paiute war cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. government troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860,.{{sfnp|Frajola|Kramer|Walske|2005|p=18}}\n\nDuring this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (mochila) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.\n\n==Famous riders==\nIn 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work&nbsp;\u2013 riders had to be tough and lightweight. A famous advertisement allegedly read:\n\n<blockquote>Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred{{efn|One historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that the \"orphans preferred\" ad is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.{{sfnp|Thompson|2005}}}}</blockquote>\n\nThe Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, there were also about 400 other employees, including station keepers, stock tenders and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered one hundred dollars a month{{snd}}a handsome sum for that time.{{sfnp|Reinfeld|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PSAOQ83qZ2cC&pg=PA49 49]}} Author [[Mark Twain]] described the riders in his travel memoir ''[[Roughing It]]'' as: \"...&nbsp;usually a little bit of a man\". Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenage boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}} There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company,{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=73\u201374}} but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their ''Saddles & Spurs'' (1972).{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|pp=74\u201376}}\n\n{{For|the list of Pony Express riders|Category:Pony Express riders}}\n\n===First riders===\n[[File:Riders Pony Express.jpg|thumb|\"Billy\" Richardson, Johnny Fry, Charles Cliff, Gus Cliff]]\n\nThe identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either [[Johnny Fry]] or [[Johnson William Richardson|Billy Richardson]].{{sfnp|Root|Hickman|1946|loc=Note 358}}<ref name=\"NPSStables\" />{{sfnp|Godfrey|1994|loc=[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/poex/hrs/hrs2e.htm Chap 2 p. 5]}}<ref name=\"museum\" /> Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A.

At the conclusion of all the speeches, approximately 7:15&nbsp;pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street where the ferry boat ''Denver'', under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1955|p=58}}{{sfnp|Bradley|1913|p= 31}} On April 9 at 6:45&nbsp;pm, the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah.

With it was a letter of congratulations from [[James Buchanan|President Buchanan]] to California [[John G.

At the age of 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short {{convert|45|mi|adj=on}} delivery run from the township of Julesburg which lay to the west. After some months he was transferred to Slade's Division in Wyoming where he made the longest non-stop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. The distance of {{convert|322|mi}} over one of the most dangerous sections of the entire trail was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required to complete this section.{{sfnp|Settle|Settle|1972|p=162}}  On one occasion when carrying mail he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains.

Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday's Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland's Station near Fort Churchill, {{convert|75|mi}} to the east.\n\nHis greatest ride, {{convert|120|mi}} in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln's inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Pony Bob Haslam's record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday's Station. When he reached Buckland's Station his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith's Creek for a total distance of {{convert|190|mi}} without a rest. After a rest of nine hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail where, at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock.

It was said to be 300 miles and was done a few minutes inside of twenty-four hours. I do not vouch for the distance being correct, as I only have it from the division superintendent, A.E. Lewis, who said that the distance given was taken by his English roadometer which was attached to the front wheel of his buggy which he used to travel over his division with, and which was from St. Joe to Fort Kearney.<ref name=\"Visscher\" />|Jack Keetley}}\n\n===Billy Tate===\nBilly Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider who rode the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute uprising of 1860 he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some big rocks where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.{{sfnp|McNesse|2009|p=105}}\n\n==Horses==\n[[File:Pony express crop.jpg|thumb|upright|Frank E.

The horses were ridden at a fast trot, canter or gallop, around {{convert|10|to|15|mph}} and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to {{convert|25|mph}}. Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe various types of horse ridden by riders of the Pony Express included [[Morgan_horse|Morgans]] and thoroughbreds which were often used on the eastern end of the trail.

His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of {{convert|10|mi}} or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight [[saddle]]s were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\nThe mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time-consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a ''mochila'' (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.{{sfnp|Chapman|1932}}\n\n==Closing==\nDuring its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered approximately 35,000 letters between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California.<ref>{{ cite web |title=Replica of a Pony Express mochila |publisher=Smithsonian National Postal Museum |accessdate=July 21, 2014 |url=http://arago.si.edu/index.asp?con=2&cmd=1&id=17889&img=1&pg=1}}</ref> Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, [[Russell, Majors and Waddell]] did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to [[Jeremy Dehut]] in March 1861, who had taken over the southern Congressionally favored [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line. The so-called 'Stagecoach King', [[Ben Holladay]], acquired the Russell, Majors and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.\n\nShortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the [[American Civil War]] caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|transcontinental telegraph]] reached Salt Lake City and connected [[Omaha, Nebraska]], and [[Sacramento, California]].<!--<h Museum]</ref>--> Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=The First Transcontinental Telegraph System Was Completed October 24, 1861\n|work=AmericasLibrary.gov: America's Story from America's Library\n|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]\n|url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/jb/civil/jb_civil_telegrap_1.html\n|accessdate=September 14, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nDespite the subsidy, the Pony Express was a financial failure.

Until the 1950s most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders and station keepers or who were interested in stations or Forts along the Pony Express route.\n\nThe most complete books on the Pony Express are ''The Story of the Pony Express'' and ''Saddles and Spurs'' by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express amongst many historians.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01914.html |title=Russell, William Hepburn |encyclopedia=American National Biography |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{main|Pony Express National Historic Trail}}\n[[File:Pony-express-statue.jpg|thumb|Pony Express statue in St. Joseph, Missouri]]\nFrom 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company [[Wells Fargo]], which provided secure mail service.

{"title_page": "Music of Grand Theft Auto V", "text_new": "The music for the 2013 [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', developed by [[Rockstar North]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]], was composed by [[The Alchemist (record producer)|The Alchemist]], [[Oh No (musician)|Oh No]] and [[Tangerine Dream]] in collaboration with [[Woody Jackson]]. The game is the first entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] to make use of an original score. In collaboration with each other, the musicians produced over twenty hours of music which scores the game's missions. Some of the works produced by the musicians throughout [[Development of Grand Theft Auto V|the game's development]] influenced some of the in-game missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. ''Grand Theft Auto V'' also has an in-game radio that can tune into sixteen stations playing more than 441 tracks of licensed music, as well as two talk radio stations. The composers of the score wanted it to accompany the licensed music, as opposed to detracting from it.\n\nThe game's music has been released on three official soundtracks: ''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V'', released alongside the initial launch of the game, consists of three volumes comprising the score, and selections from the in-game radio; ''The Cinematographic Score \u2014 GTA 5'', an electronic album released in March 2014, comprises tracks composed and produced by Tangerine Dream founder [[Edgar Froese]]; and ''Welcome to Los Santos'', released with the [[Microsoft Windows]] version of the game, features songs from the in-game radio station \"The Lab\", produced by The Alchemist and Oh No. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected appropriately with the gameplay.\n\n== Production and composition ==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = GTA V Main Theme.ogg\n |title        = \"Welcome to Los Santos\"\n |description  = \"Welcome to Los Santos\", the game's main theme, was composed by [[Oh No (musician)|Oh No]].

Their work was mostly complete later in development but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. [[Edgar Froese]], Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/>\n\nJackson\u2019s initial role was to provide score for Trevor\u2019s missions, and he took influence from artists such as [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other\u2019s work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. \"Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing\", Jackson said.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Froese had interpolated [[funk]] sounds with Jackson\u2019s [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] it. The Alchemist opined, \"We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there&nbsp;...&nbsp;We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> [[DJ Shadow]] then mixed the team's creations together and matched it to the gameplay.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich considered \"how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score\" a challenge.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\nPavlovich found that while Rockstar assigned the team missions to write music for, some of their random creations influenced other missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. He discussed a \"stem-based\" system used to make music fit dynamic game factors where the team would compose music to underscore outcomes players could make immediately after completing missions.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Each of these stems, Froese reflected, included up to 62 five-minute [[WAV]] files, which were sent to Pavlovich in New York. \"He then created, very professionally, a mix down for each of the eight stems needed for a mission and sent out the material to the other artists involved\", Froese elaborated.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> Oh No drew from scenes within the game to make his work feel contextually pertinent with the action onscreen. The iconographic introduction of Los Santos early in the game, for example, inspired him to \"create a smooth [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] vibe that embodied\" the city.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> He supplied horns, electric and bass guitars, and percussion parts to fit with the car chase scenes. \"We wanted everything to set the right tone\", he explained.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\nThe Rockstar team wanted to synergise the game world's depiction of California with the radio stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate \"Cali feel\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural [[California Sound|saturation of pop music]] necessitated the Non-Stop-Pop FM station; he said that \"the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out&nbsp;...&nbsp;We wanted that. It really connects you to the world\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He felt that greater discernment was required for licensed music choices than in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' because ''Grand Theft Auto V''{{'}}s music plays a pivotal role in generating Californian atmosphere.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Music \"reflects the environment in which the game is set\", he said.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/> Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio but they refined the number to 241.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> The tracks are shared between fifteen stations, with an additional two [[Talk radio|talk-back]] stations<ref name=\"GTA V Soundtrack\"/> and a radio station for custom audio files on the PC version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52419/self-radio-create-your-own-custom-radio-station-in-gtav-pc |title=Self Radio: Creating Your Own Custom Radio Station in GTAV PC |author=R* L |work=Rockstar Newswire |publisher=Rockstar Games |date=15 April 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6u8QtlBB4 |archivedate=11 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some tracks were written specifically for the game, such as [[Rapping|rapper]] and producer [[Flying Lotus]]' original work composed for the FlyLo FM station he hosts.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundtrack\"/> Pavlovich noted how the team would first develop an idea of what each station would sound like, and then select a DJ to match the station\u2019s genre, such as [[Kenny Loggins]] who hosts the [[classic rock]] station Los Santos Rock Radio.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He felt that to strike a balance between the radio and the score was a meticulous process, and cited a scenario where players would drive to a mission objective while listening to the radio, with the score taking over once players left the vehicle and proceeded to the mission's next stage.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/>\n\n== Soundtracks ==\n=== ''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V'' ===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = ''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V''\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = various artists\n| cover        =\n| alt          =\n| released     = 24 September 2013\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       = Vox Recording (Los Angeles, CA) \u2013 ''The Score''<ref name=\"soundtrack notes\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Music of Grand Theft Auto V|others=Various Artists|year=2014|type=album liner notes|publisher=[[Mass Appeal Records]]; [[Rockstar Games]]}}</ref>\n| genre        = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length       = 216:13 <small>(full soundtrack)</small><br>63:17 <small>(Volume 1)</small><br>78:40 <small>(Volume 2)</small><br>74:16 <small>(Volume 3)</small>\n| label        = {{hlist|[[Rockstar Games]]|[[Mass Appeal Magazine#Mass Appeal Records|Mass Appeal]]}}\n| producer     = {{hlist|Woody Jackson|Ivan Pavlovich}} {{small|(''The Score'')}}<ref name=\"soundtrack notes\"/>\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n| misc         = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Rockstar Games]]\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[Max Payne 3#Soundtrack|Max Payne 3 Official Soundtrack]]\n | prev_year  = 2012\n | title      = The Music of Grand Theft Auto V\n | year       = 2013\n | next_title = [[#Welcome to Los Santos|Welcome to Los Santos]]\n | next_year  = 2015\n}}\n}}\n'''''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V''''' was released digitally on 24 September 2013 in three volumes, including an original score composed for the game in addition to selections from songs that were licensed for the in-game radio.

We wanted that.

Each station's DJ was selected with the mindset that they would match the genre of music the station hosts; for example, in developing Los Santos Rock Radio the team licensed [[classic rock]] tracks,

''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', developed by [[Rockstar North]] and published by [[Rockstar Games]], was composed by [[The Alchemist (record producer)|The Alchemist]], [[Oh No (musician)|Oh No]] and [[Tangerine Dream]] in collaboration with [[Woody Jackson]]. The game is the first entry in the [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' series]] to make use of an original score. In collaboration with each other, the musicians produced over twenty hours of music which scores the game's missions. Some of the works produced by the musicians throughout [[Development of Grand Theft Auto V|the game's development]] influenced some of the in-game missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. ''Grand Theft Auto V'' also has an in-game radio that can tune into sixteen stations playing more than 441 tracks of licensed music, as well as two talk radio stations. The composers of the score wanted it to accompany the licensed music, as opposed to detracting from it.\n\nThe game's music has been released on three official soundtracks: ''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V'', released alongside the initial launch of the game, consists of three volumes comprising the score, and selections from the in-game radio; ''The Cinematographic Score \u2014 GTA 5'', an electronic album released in March 2014, comprises tracks composed and produced by Tangerine Dream founder [[Edgar Froese]]; and ''Welcome to Los Santos'', released with the [[Microsoft Windows]] version of the game, features songs from the in-game radio station \"The Lab\", produced by The Alchemist and Oh No. Critical reception to the soundtracks was positive, as reviewers felt that the music connected appropriately with the gameplay.\n\n== Production and composition ==\n{{Listen\n |filename     = GTA V Main Theme.ogg\n |title        = \"Welcome to Los Santos\"\n |description  = \"Welcome to Los Santos\", the game's main theme, was composed by [[Oh No (musician)|Oh No]].

Their work was mostly complete later in development but they continued composing until its final build was submitted for manufacturing. [[Edgar Froese]], Tangerine Dream's founding member, initially rejected the offer of producing music for a video game. After he was flown to the studio and shown the game, he was impressed by its scale and cinematic nature, and changed his mind. Froese's first eight months of work on the score produced 62 hours of music.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He recorded with Tangerine Dream in Austria but further work was conducted at Jackson's United States studio, which The Alchemist and Oh No used as well.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/>\n\nJackson\u2019s initial role was to provide score for Trevor\u2019s missions, and he took influence from artists such as [[The Mars Volta]] and [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. When he learnt that the team would be building off each other\u2019s work, he voiced concern that the finished product could be disjointed. After sharing his work with the team, he was particularly impressed by Froese's contributions. \"Edgar evolved the music, made it into a whole other thing\", Jackson said.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Froese had interpolated [[funk]] sounds with Jackson\u2019s [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] influences. Froese and Jackson then sent their work between The Alchemist and Oh No, who heavily [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] it. The Alchemist opined, \"We were sampling, taking a piece form here, a piece from there&nbsp;...&nbsp;We pitched stuff up, chopped it, tweaked it. Then we chose the tracks that worked and everyone came in and layered on that\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> [[DJ Shadow]] then mixed the team's creations together and matched it to the gameplay.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich considered \"how to make the hip-hop and rock score not sound like they were instrumentals of songs on the radio, but rather something unique to the score\" a challenge.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\nPavlovich found that while Rockstar assigned the team missions to write music for, some of their random creations influenced other missions and sparked inspiration for further score development. He discussed a \"stem-based\" system used to make music fit dynamic game factors where the team would compose music to underscore outcomes players could make immediately after completing missions.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Each of these stems, Froese reflected, included up to 62 five-minute [[WAV]] files, which were sent to Pavlovich in New York. \"He then created, very professionally, a mix down for each of the eight stems needed for a mission and sent out the material to the other artists involved\", Froese elaborated.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> Oh No drew from scenes within the game to make his work feel contextually pertinent with the action onscreen. The iconographic introduction of Los Santos early in the game, for example, inspired him to \"create a smooth [[West Coast hip hop|West Coast]] vibe that embodied\" the city.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/> He supplied horns, electric and bass guitars, and percussion parts to fit with the car chase scenes. \"We wanted everything to set the right tone\", he explained.<ref name=\"Know The Score\"/>\n\nThe Rockstar team wanted to synergise the game world's depiction of California with the radio stations by licensing tracks that imparted an appropriate \"Cali feel\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Pavlovich noted that Los Angeles' cultural [[California Sound|saturation of pop music]] necessitated the Non-Stop-Pop FM station; he said that \"the first time you get off an airplane in L.A. and you hear the radio and the pop just seeps out&nbsp;...&nbsp;We wanted that. It really connects you to the world\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He felt that greater discernment was required for licensed music choices than in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' because ''Grand Theft Auto V''{{'}}s music plays a pivotal role in generating Californian atmosphere.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> Music \"reflects the environment in which the game is set\", he said.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/> Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio but they refined the number to 241.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> The tracks are shared between fifteen stations, with an additional two [[Talk radio|talk-back]] stations<ref name=\"GTA V Soundtrack\"/> and a radio station for custom audio files on the PC version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/52419/self-radio-create-your-own-custom-radio-station-in-gtav-pc |title=Self Radio: Creating Your Own Custom Radio Station in GTAV PC |author=R* L |work=Rockstar Newswire |publisher=Rockstar Games |date=15 April 2015 |accessdate=6 April 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6u8QtlBB4 |archivedate=11 October 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Some tracks were written specifically for the game, such as [[Rapping|rapper]] and producer [[Flying Lotus]]' original work composed for the FlyLo FM station he hosts.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundtrack\"/> Pavlovich noted how the team would first develop an idea of what each station would sound like, and then select a DJ to match the station\u2019s genre, such as [[Kenny Loggins]] who hosts the [[classic rock]] station Los Santos Rock Radio.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He felt that to strike a balance between the radio and the score was a meticulous process, and cited a scenario where players would drive to a mission objective while listening to the radio, with the score taking over once players left the vehicle and proceeded to the mission's next stage.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/>\n\n== Soundtracks ==\n=== ''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V'' ===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = ''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V''\n| type         = soundtrack\n| artist       = various artists\n| cover        =\n| alt          =\n| released     = 24 September 2013\n| recorded     =\n| venue        =\n| studio       = Vox Recording (Los Angeles, CA) \u2013 ''The Score''<ref name=\"soundtrack notes\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Music of Grand Theft Auto V|others=Various Artists|year=2014|type=album liner notes|publisher=[[Mass Appeal Records]]; [[Rockstar Games]]}}</ref>\n| genre        = [[Soundtrack]]\n| length       = 216:13 <small>(full soundtrack)</small><br>63:17 <small>(Volume 1)</small><br>78:40 <small>(Volume 2)</small><br>74:16 <small>(Volume 3)</small>\n| label        = {{hlist|[[Rockstar Games]]|[[Mass Appeal Magazine#Mass Appeal Records|Mass Appeal]]}}\n| producer     = {{hlist|Woody Jackson|Ivan Pavlovich}} {{small|(''The Score'')}}<ref name=\"soundtrack notes\"/>\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   =\n| next_year    =\n| misc         = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Rockstar Games]]\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[Max Payne 3#Soundtrack|Max Payne 3 Official Soundtrack]]\n | prev_year  = 2012\n | title      = The Music of Grand Theft Auto V\n | year       = 2013\n | next_title = [[#Welcome to Los Santos|Welcome to Los Santos]]\n | next_year  = 2015\n}}\n}}\n'''''The Music of Grand Theft Auto V''''' was released digitally on 24 September 2013 in three volumes, including an original score composed for the game in addition to selections from songs that were licensed for the in-game radio.

We wanted that. It really connects you to the world\".<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> He felt that music licensing for the game involved a greater discernment than in ''Grand Theft Auto IV'', as the music in ''Grand Theft Auto V'' played a greater role in building a Californian atmosphere.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/> \"It reflects the environment in which the game is set\", he explained.<ref name=\"Pav THR Interview\"/> Initially, the team planned to license over 900 tracks for the radio, but over time they refined the total number of tracks to 241.<ref name=\"GTA V Soundscape\"/>\n\nThe tracks are shared between eighteen stations, and the radio also includes two [[Talk radio|talk-back]] stations.<ref name=\"GTA V soundtrack\">{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/inside-the-grand-theft-auto-v-soundtrack-20130828 |title= Inside the 'Grand Theft Auto V' Soundtrack |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|date=28 August 2013 |first= Evan |last= Shamoon |accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game; for example, [[Rapping|rapper]] and producer [[Flying Lotus]] hosts the station FlyLo FM which includes original work he composed for the game.<ref name=\"GTA V soundtrack\"/> As Pavlovich noted, for each of the radio stations, over time the team would develop an understanding of where the station's music was going and then select a DJ to host the station. Each station's DJ was selected with the mindset that they would match the genre of music the station hosts; for example, in developing Los Santos Rock Radio the team licensed [[classic rock]] tracks,

Curry was critical of \"groupthink\", and was engaging actively with the climate change denial community, because she believes that some of them brought up valid points, and that lumping the good with the bad could lead to missed opportunities to improve the science. \n\nCurry is critical of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), a United Nations\u2013sponsored body who reports the consensus on climate science.

Wong and [[Tong Li]] to write a chapter that focuses on Alzheimer\u2019s disease and how it leads to major defects within the brain. Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is one of Price\u2019s most researched topics. The disease causes people to have progressive memory loss and also problems with cognitive development. Price has found that the neuroscience behind AD is characterized by neuronal loss, which means the failure of functioning neurons, or the lack of [[neurofibrillary tangles]] within parts of the brain. In his publication, he talked about the neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and how they were most commonly found in the central superior nucleus. He further described that NFTs help determine the duration of the disease as well. Patients who had a longer duration of AD had less NFTs than patients who had a shorter duration of AD. The number of NFTs in the nuclei reflect on how the rate of progression, so if a small number of NFTs are found, then they have a greater chance of becoming better. This disease affects the person\u2019s everyday life due to the decline in cognitive abilities and memory loss. In cases of AD, there are various kinds of techniques used to detect any impairments or defects within the brain. One of the techniques used is a [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) which are most likely used to detect any evidence of atrophy with relation to the [[hippocampus]] and [[entorhinal cortex]]. Another technique is called [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and is used to look within the parietal and temporal lobes to detect any decreased glucose or blood flow. Alzheimer\u2019s Disease, overall, has many symptoms that involve abnormalities within different parts of the brain that are important for memory storage and cognitive development. Price expands his interest and knowledge towards this neurodegenerative disease in most of his research.\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !!

Because they mimic, or interfere with, hormonal function, adverse effects can include problems with reproduction, growth and development, immune function, and metabolic function.  As an example, dioxins and dioxin-like compounds influence the hormone Dehydoepiandosterone (DHEA), which has a role in the determination of male of female sex characteristics.
