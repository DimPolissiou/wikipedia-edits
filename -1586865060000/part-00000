It is located in the southern end of the state. The state has a total land area of {{convert|16,842|km2}}. \n\n== Geography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe state covers a landmass of about 18,050&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between Longitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.45' East and Latitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.30' North. It is geographically located in [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Nigeria's Midwest]], bounded in the north and west by [[Edo State]], the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States, southeast by [[Bayelsa State]], and on the southern extreme is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-lace with rivulets and streams, which form part of the [[Niger Delta|Niger River Delta]].\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State was defined out of the former [[Bendel State]] on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.  There was yet another state request proposed as \"Niger State\" comprising the Asaba and Aboh divisions of the old Midwest region. The then Military President, Gen. [[Ibrahim Babangida]], recognized Delta state but chose \"Asaba\" a prominent town within the \"Northwestern lower Niger\" as capital city. The proposed capital was a virgin land in the heart of the two constituent divisions that constitutes the Northwestern lower Niger. Delta state was once integrated in the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976 and later Bendel state, from 1976 to 1991. The name \"Bendel\" (Ben-Del) coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State is predominantly inhabited by the [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]];  the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], the [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] Izon and the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]] . The population of other groups in the state are negligible. The [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]] are the most predominant people inhabiting the state and currently are more than 3 million people. The Igbo populating Delta State and Onitsha or nearby are referred to as people of the good land ([[Igbo language|Igbo]] : [[Anioma people|Anoma]]) and reside throughout the state mostly because of trade. The Itsekiri speak a language very closely related to [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] but have been culturally influenced by the [[Edo_people|Edo]] from neighbouring Edo state, as well as the Urhobo, [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] and [[Portuguese people| Portuguese]]. The Izon are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State while the [[Olukumi]] are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct due to acculturation and assimilation. \n\nThe vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing [[African Traditional Religion|Traditional Religion]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]], a member of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], was elected Governor and chief executive of Delta State in April 2015. His deputy is Barr. Kingsley Otuaro. The state has three National Senatorial Districts (South, North and Central).  In 2011 and 2013, the elected senators were [[James Manager]], [[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]] and Emmanuel Aguariavwodo who replaced Pius Ewherido who died in 2013 at National Hospital, Abuja. In 2015, Chief Ighoyeta Amori was elected Senator of Delta Central but his election was annulled and Senator Ovie [[Omo-Agege]] sworn in as Senator of Delta Central, James Manager retained his position and Chief Peter Nwaoboshi was elected Senator of Delta North. The Executive, Legislative and Judicial Chambers are housed in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] with a government house annex in [[Warri]].\n\n===Past & Present Administrations<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://deltastate.gov.ng/former-administrations | title=Past Administrations &#124; Delta State Government}}</ref>===\n*[[Ifeanyi Okowa]] - 29 May, 2015 to date ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Emmanuel Uduaghan]] - 29 May 2007 to 29 May 2015 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[James Ibori]] - 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Walter Feghabo]] - 12 August 1998 to 29 May 1999 (Military)\n*[[John Dungs]] - 22 August 1996 to 12 August 1998 (Military)\n*[[Ibrahim Kefas]] - 26 September 1994 to 22 August 1996 (Military)\n*[[Bassey Asuquo]] - 10 December 1993 to 26 September 1994 (Military)\n*[[Abdulkadir Shehu]] - 17 November 1993 - 10 December 1993 (Military)\n*[[Luke Chijiuba Ochulor]] - 28 August 1991 - January 1992 (Military)\n*[[Felix Ibru]] - January 1992 - November 1993 ([[Social Democratic Party|SDP]])\n\n===Local government areas===\n{{see also|List of villages in Delta State}}\nDelta State consists of 25 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (shown with 2006 population figures):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

But these minerals are under-utilized. \n\nDelta state also has huge deposits of crude oil and is also one of the largest producers of petroleum products in Nigeria. Sales of petroleum products is what majorly drives its economy.\n\n== Higher education ==\nDelta state has one of the highest numbers of tertiary institutions in any Nigerian state. This is a product of the people's thirst for knowledge and academic work. Some of these institutions are: \n*[[Federal University of Petroleum Resources Effurun|Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun]]\n*[[Delta State University, Abraka|Delta State University]]\n*[[Delta State Polytechnic]]s (three different Polytechnics, one at Oghara, one at Ogwashi-Uku and another at Ozoro)\n*The Film and Broadcast Academy, Ozoro\n*College of Education (two different state colleges, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]]).\n*Federal College of Education Technical, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*College of Education, Mosogar\n*Delta State College of Health Technology, [[Ughelli]]\n*[[Petroleum Training Institute]], [[Effurun]]<ref>http://www.edusbaze.com/tag/www-pti-edu-ng/</ref>\n*[[Western Delta University]], [[Oghara]]\n*Novena University, Ogume-Amai\n*National Open University of Nigeria (three study centres, one at Asaba, one at [[Emevor]] and another at [[Owhrode]]).\n*Delta State School of Marine Technology, Burutu\n*Nigerian Maritime University, Okerenkoko, [[Warri]]\n*Conarina School of Maritime & Transport Technology, Oria-[[Abraka]]\n*University of Information and Communication Technology, [[Agbor]]\n*State School of Midwifery, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]\n*School of Nursing (two schools, one at [[Agbor]] and another at [[Warri]])\n*Baptist School of Nursing, [[Eku]]\n*Edwin Clark University, Kiagbodo\n*Eagle Heights University, Omadino, Warri\n*Admiralty University of Nigeria at [[Ibusa]] and [[Sapele]]\n\n== Tourist attractions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State has some historical, cultural and socio-political tourist centers that attract visitors from around the globe. Some of these sites of tourism include:\n* '''The Nana's Palace''' built by Chief [[Nana Olomu]] of Ebrohim. He was a powerful 19th century indigenous entrepreneur who traded with the British. The relationship eventually turned sour. Later, he surrendered (not without putting up a fight) and was exiled to Ghana. His personal effects are housed in this grand palace.\n* '''The River Ethiope '''which is reputed to be the deepest inland waterway in Africa (at 176&nbsp;km). Its source is at the foot of a giant silk-cotton tree at Umuaja in Ukwuani Local Government Area of the state and flows through seven Local Government Areas in the State. It is a place of worship for Olokun traditional religion and also a common site for faithfuls of the [[Igbe religion|Igbe Religious Movement]].\n* '''The Araya Bible Site '''which houses a copy of the [[Holy Bible]]. It is believed that the bible descended to this spot miraculously from heaven around August, 1914. The bible dropped on rain-soaked yam and it didn't get wet. The site now attracts thousands of Christians yearly.\n* '''Demas Nwoko Edifice '''which was built using traditional materials, designs and construction techniques of the Igbo civilization and the Benin Empire by [[Demas Nwoko]], an architect, builder and artist of international repute from Idumuje-Ugboko, in Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State.\n* '''The Mungo Park House''' which is now the site of the National Museum, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]. The house was constructed by the Royal Niger Company (RNC) in 1886 and was used as a colonial administrative headquarters, a military house, the colonial administrative divisional headquarters, the RNC Constabulary building,  and the seat of the Urban District Council at different times.\n* The '''[[River Niger Bridge (Onitsha)|Niger Bridge]]''' which connects Delta State (by extension, western Nigeria) to the Eastern part of Nigeria. It is a beauty to behold. It was completed in 1965 and cost \u00a35 million.

It is located in the southern end of the state. The state has a total land area of {{convert|16,842|km2}}. \n\n== Geography ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThe state covers a landmass of about 18,050&nbsp;km\u00b2, of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between Longitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.45' East and Latitude 5\u00b000 and 6\u00b0.30' North. It is geographically located in [[Mid-Western Region, Nigeria|Nigeria's Midwest]], bounded in the north and west by [[Edo State]], the east by [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], and [[Rivers State|Rivers]] States, southeast by [[Bayelsa State]], and on the southern extreme is the [[Bight of Benin]] which covers about 160 kilometres of the state's coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-lace with rivulets and streams, which form part of the [[Niger Delta|Niger River Delta]].\n\n== History ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State was defined out of the former [[Bendel State]] on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province.  There was yet another state request proposed as \"Niger State\" comprising the Asaba and Aboh divisions of the old Midwest region. The then Military President, Gen. [[Ibrahim Babangida]], recognized Delta state but chose \"Asaba\" a prominent town within the \"Northwestern lower Niger\" as capital city. The proposed capital was a virgin land in the heart of the two constituent divisions that constitutes the Northwestern lower Niger. Delta state was once integrated in the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976 and later Bendel state, from 1976 to 1991. The name \"Bendel\" (Ben-Del) coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nDelta State is predominantly inhabited by the [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]];  the [[Igbo people|Igbo]], the [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] Izon and the [[Yoruboid languages|Yoruboid]] [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] and [[Olukumi people|Olukumi]] . The population of other groups in the state are negligible. The [[Edoid languages|Edoid]] [[Urhobo-Isoko]] are the most predominant people inhabiting the state and currently are more than 3 million people. The Igbo populating Delta State and Onitsha or nearby are referred to as people of the good land ([[Igbo language|Igbo]] : [[Anioma people|Anoma]]) and reside throughout the state mostly because of trade. The Itsekiri speak a language very closely related to [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] but have been culturally influenced by the [[Edo_people|Edo]] from neighbouring Edo state, as well as the Urhobo, [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] and [[Portuguese people| Portuguese]]. The Izon are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State while the [[Olukumi]] are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct due to acculturation and assimilation. \n\nThe vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing [[African Traditional Religion|Traditional Religion]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n[[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]], a member of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]], was elected Governor and chief executive of Delta State in April 2015. His deputy is Barr. Kingsley Otuaro. The state has three National Senatorial Districts (South, North and Central).  In 2011 and 2013, the elected senators were [[James Manager]], [[Arthur Okowa Ifeanyi]] and Emmanuel Aguariavwodo who replaced Pius Ewherido who died in 2013 at National Hospital, Abuja. In 2015, Chief Ighoyeta Amori was elected Senator of Delta Central but his election was annulled and Senator Ovie [[Omo-Agege]] sworn in as Senator of Delta Central, James Manager retained his position and Chief Peter Nwaoboshi was elected Senator of Delta North. The Executive, Legislative and Judicial Chambers are housed in [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]] with a government house annex in [[Warri]].\n\n===Past & Present Administrations<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://deltastate.gov.ng/former-administrations | title=Past Administrations &#124; Delta State Government}}</ref>===\n*[[Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa]] - 29 May, 2015 to date ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Emmanuel Eweta Uduaghan]] - 29 May 2007 to 29 May 2015 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[James Onanefe Ibori]] - 29 May 1999 to 29 May 2007 ([[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|PDP]])\n*[[Walter Feghabo]] - 12 August 1998 to 29 May 1999 (Military)\n*[[John Dungs]] - 22 August 1996 to 12 August 1998 (Military)\n*[[Ibrahim Kefas]] - 26 September 1994 to 22 August 1996 (Military)\n*[[Bassey Asuquo]] - 10 December 1993 to 26 September 1994 (Military)\n*[[Abdulkadir Shehu]] - 17 November 1993 - 10 December 1993 (Military)\n*[[Luke Chijiuba Ochulor]] - 28 August 1991 - January 1992 (Military)\n*[[Felix Ibru]] - January 1992 - November 1993 ([[Social Democratic Party|SDP]])\n\n===Local government areas===\n{{see also|List of villages in Delta State}}\nDelta State consists of 25 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (shown with 2006 population figures):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some of these sites of tourism include:\n* '''The Nana's Palace''' built by Chief [[Nana Olomu]] of Ebrohim. He was a powerful 19th century indigenous entrepreneur who traded with the British. The relationship eventually turned sour. Later, he surrendered (not without putting up a fight) and was exiled to Ghana. His personal effects are housed in this grand palace.\n* '''The River Ethiope '''which is reputed to be the deepest inland waterway in Africa (at 176&nbsp;km). Its source is at the foot of a giant silk-cotton tree at Umuaja in Ukwuani Local Government Area of the state and flows through seven Local Government Areas in the State. It is a place of worship for Olokun traditional religion and also a common site for faithfuls of the [[Igbe religion|Igbe Religious Movement]].\n* '''The Araya Bible Site '''which houses a copy of the [[Holy Bible]]. It is believed that the bible descended to this spot miraculously from heaven around August, 1914. The bible dropped on rain-soaked yam and it didn't get wet. The site now attracts thousands of Christians yearly.\n* '''Demas Nwoko Edifice '''which was built using traditional materials, designs and construction techniques of the Igbo civilization and the Benin Empire by [[Demas Nwoko]], an architect, builder and artist of international repute from Idumuje-Ugboko, in Aniocha North Local Government Area, Delta State.\n* '''The Mungo Park House''' which is now the site of the National Museum, [[Asaba, Delta|Asaba]]. The house was constructed by the Royal Niger Company (RNC) in 1886 and was used as a colonial administrative headquarters, a military house, the colonial administrative divisional headquarters, the RNC Constabulary building,  and the seat of the Urban District Council at different times.\n* The '''[[River Niger Bridge (Onitsha)|Niger Bridge]]''' which connects Delta State (by extension, western Nigeria) to the Eastern part of Nigeria. It is a beauty to behold. It was completed in 1965 and cost \u00a35 million. It was damaged during the civil war, but later repaired.\n* '''Lander Brothers Anchorage, Asaba''' which was built in memory of early British explorers. The complex has a museum, a graveyard, and many artworks and writings.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Fragmentary skeletal material from Thailand has been tentatively attributed to ''Siamosaurus'', as two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] indicates spinosaurids may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

They are also oval in cross section and have distinct carinae, but unlike the Khok Kruat morphotype, the entire length of the crown has wrinkled enamel, and the flutes are coarser and fewer in number, with 11 to 16 on each side. The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n=== Possible material ===\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nThe first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

In this study, the teeth of ''Siamosaurus'' and a Morrocan spinosaurid were compared to those of crocodilians using [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]]. Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did. This could explain the absence of long-snouted crocodilian fossils from that time and place.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite thesis|last=Lauprasert|first=Komsorn|title=Evolution and palaeoecology of crocodiles in the mesozoic of Khorat plateau, Thailand|date=2006|publisher=Chulalongkorn University|url=https://cuir.car.chula.ac.th/handle/123456789/14411|language=en}}</ref> A similar scenario was proposed for spinosaurids by Hone and colleagues in 2010, who noted that compared to large crocodilians and obligate aquatic predators, they could more easily travel from one body of water to another in search for prey.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n=== Aquatic habits ===\n\nA 2010 publication by French palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues found that the [[isotopes of oxygen|oxygen isotope]] ratios of spinosaurid bones indicated [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. Isotope ratios of spinosaurid teeth from various localities, including Thailand and China, were compared with isotopic compositions from contemporaneous theropods, turtles, and crocodilians. The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

It is the first spinosaurid reported from Asia is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] were assigned to the spinosaurid species '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''', which may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Fragmentary skeletal material from Thailand has been tentatively attributed to ''Siamosaurus'', asTwo partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at the base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise ridges. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]].

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm|}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and a flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to DMR TF 2043a.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm|}}. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm|}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm|}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm|}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in dentition to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''Spinosaurus''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that semiaquatic habits and piscivory may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological niche, the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.
