The Twinkle protein is involved in the production of mtDNA by functioning as an adenine nucleotide dependent DNA [[helicase]], an enzyme that binds to DNA and temporarily unwinds the double helix of the DNA molecule so that it can replicate.<ref name=\"GHR TWNK\"/> They also serve as [[primase]]s able to initiate DNA replication.\n\nThey function as hexameric or heptameric DNA helicases, which unwinds the double stranded DNA in the 5\u2019 to 3\u2019 direction in short segments. The proteins unwind single stranded mitochondrial DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma. These enzymes function similar to the [[T7 phage]] helicase (gp4); however, Twinkle and/ or Twinky are capable of both unwinding and recombining DNA making them bifunctional helicases.\n\nTheir functions as a helicase include the binding of both single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA), and catalyzing DNA unwinding. The energy required for DNA unwinding is supplied by the hydrolysis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]].  It has different binding affinities for each of its specific binding sites when binding either the ssDNA or the dsDNA.\n\n== Disease association ==\nMutations occurring on the TWNK gene are associated with health conditions such as Perrault Syndrome, ataxia neuropathy spectrum, infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia, and most prominently progressive external ophthalmoplegia.<ref name=\"GHR TWNK\"/>\n\nOne of the best known mutations of this gene is associated with [[infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia]] or IOSCA.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=56652 |title=TWNK twinkle mtDNA helicase [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene | work = NCBI }}</ref>  IOSCA is a [[neurodegenerative]] disease whose symptoms appear in children after one year of age.

Twinkle protein serves as the mitochondrial DNA helicase that binds to DNA and aids to unwind the double helix of the DNA molecules.by allowing unwinding of the double helix replication of mtDNA is achieved. Any form of mutation in twinkle protein can result in to mtDNA disease. The disease can be categorized in to two groups. The first category includes disease that impairs the respiratory function due to the primary mutation of the mtDNA. The second category is usually known as mtDNA maintenance disease. The cause of mtDNA maintenance diseases is because of the dysfunction of the replication and maintenance apparatus of mtDNA, programmed by nuclear genes. Infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) are associated with multiple deletions of mtDNA. \u00a0PEO in humans and most mammals is associated with an eye disorder which involves the individual gradually losing the ability to move the eyes as well as the eyebrows. These disorders in recent times have been established to be occurring in the population with the frequencies of single mutation projected to increase.\n\nTransgenic mice expressing human PEO patient mutations have progressive respiratory chain disfunction due to accumulation of [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] deletions, but show no signs of premature aging.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyynismaa

The proteins unwind single stranded mitochondrial DNA binding protein and mtDNA polymerase gamma. These enzymes function similar to the [[T7 phage]] helicase (gp4); however, Twinkle and/ or Twinky are capable of both unwinding and recombining DNA making them bifunctional helicases.\n\nTheir functions as a helicase include the binding of both single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and double stranded DNA (dsDNA), and catalyzing DNA unwinding. The energy required for DNA unwinding is supplied by the hydrolysis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]].  It has different binding affinities for each of its specific binding sites when binding either the ssDNA or the dsDNA.\n\n== Disease association ==\nMutations occurring on the TWNK gene are associated with health conditions such as Perrault Syndrome, ataxia neuropathy spectrum, infantile-onset spinocerebellar ataxia, and most prominently progressive external ophthalmoplegia.<ref name=\"GHR TWNK\"/>\n\nOne of the best known mutations of this gene is associated with [[infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia]] or IOSCA.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene?Db=gene&Cmd=DetailsSearch&Term=56652 |title=TWNK twinkle mtDNA helicase [Homo sapiens (human)] - Gene | work = NCBI }}</ref>  IOSCA is a [[neurodegenerative]] disease whose symptoms appear in children after one year of age.

I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial.

as letting his strings \"go dead\".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Iron Maiden | series = [[That Metal Show]] | serieslink =  | credits = [[Eddie Trunk]], [[Jim Florentine]], [[Don Jamieson

''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref

The album was announced on 18 July 2012 and released on 24 September.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maidens-steve-harris-announces-first-ever-solo-album-british-lion/ |title=Iron Maiden's Steve Harris Announces First Ever Solo Album ''British Lion'' |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |date=18 July 2012 |accessdate=18 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223010938/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/iron-maidens-steve-harris-announces-first-ever-solo-album-british-lion/ |archivedate=23 February 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nFollowing the initial announcement of the album's release in July 2012, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' revealed that the project originated with a band, named British Lion, which Harris had been mentoring in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |title=Maiden's Harris announces solo album |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=18 July 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130119104531/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/maidens-harris-announces-solo-album/ |archivedate=19 January 2013 }}</ref> Harris confirmed this during an interview with ''Classic Rock'' the following month, explaining that he became involved after \"Graham Leslie [guitar] came to me with a cassette of songs... and I thought they were really good, so I said I\u2019d try to help his band do something. I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

as letting his strings \"go dead\".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Iron Maiden | series = [[That Metal Show]] | serieslink =  | credits = [[Eddie Trunk]], [[Jim Florentine]], [[Don Jamieson

stage, remarking that, although \"there are no shows arranged yet\", \"I know we\u2019ll be playing clubs, which is great because I\u2019ve not played clubs for years\", and that he intends to release a follow up album in the future.<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> A European club tour, taking place in February and March, was eventually announced on 10 January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kielty |first=Martin

2013, ''British Lion'' holds a score of 56 at the aggregate review site [[Metacritic]], indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> ''[[Record Collector]]'' awarded the album 3/5 and

''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref name=\"Revolver\"/> [[AllMusic]] gave it a score of 2.5/5, deeming it \"a serviceable slab of unpretentious yet utterly forgettable '80s retro-metal that adheres to every clich\u00e9 in the

himself in something a bit different with a group of excellent musicians.\"<ref name=\"Kerrang!\"/> ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' were also very positive towards the release, praising the \"infectious

Throughout its length west of Austin, US&nbsp;290 cuts across mountainous hills comprising the [[Texas Hill Country]] and the [[Edwards Plateau]]; between Austin and Houston, the highway then travels through gradually hilly grasslands and pine forests comprising the [[Gulf Coastal Plains]].\n\nUS&nbsp;290 originally traveled from [[U.S. Route 80 in Texas|US&nbsp;80]] in [[Scroggins Draw, Texas|Scroggins Draw]] to terminate in San Antonio; though the highway still retains its designation from southeast of Segovia to [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]], [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] and [[U.S. Route 87 in Texas|US&nbsp;87]] replaced much of the old routing. US&nbsp;290 also received several minor re-routings east of Austin that moved it further north, eliminating the old SH&nbsp;20; the old routings were replaced by [[Texas State Highway 71|SH&nbsp;71]] and [[Texas State Highway 21|SH&nbsp;21]]. Because of the aforementioned truncations in its length, US&nbsp;290 no longer intersects with its \"parent\" route, [[U.S. Route 90 in Texas|US&nbsp;90]], apart from two ramps at the highway's current eastern terminus in Houston.\n\n==Route description==\nUS&nbsp;290 begins from [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] roughly {{convert|12|mi|km}} southeast of the small town of [[Segovia, Texas|Segovia]].

The two highways travel together for eleven blocks in downtown Fredericksburg before US&nbsp;87 splits south of US&nbsp;290 at an intersection directly south of the [[National Museum of the Pacific War]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> Traveling due south, US&nbsp;290 returns to an eastward path after crossing the [[Pedernales River]], where it serves as a major artery for Fredericksburg's agricultural district, including [[Wildseed Farms]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> The highway then runs parallel to the Pedernales River, and after passing [[Stonewall, Texas|Stonewall]], serves the south side of [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park#LBJ Ranch|LBJ Ranch]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> As the Pedernales River arcs further north, US&nbsp;290 continues east through several wineries before approaching [[Johnson City, Texas|Johnson City]] and bordering the north side of the [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park#Johnson City|LBJ Johnson City Unit]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> US&nbsp;290 runs along Main Street throughout downtown Johnson City as it joins [[U.S. Route 281 in Texas|US&nbsp;281]] and heads south.<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/>\n\nAfter traveling through additional hilly terrain, US&nbsp;290 splits east from US&nbsp;281 and twists through slopes in the Edwards Plateau, where an intersection with [[Ranch to Market Road 3232|RM&nbsp;3232]] in the unincorporated community of [[Henly, Texas|Henly]] provides access to [[Pedernales Falls State Park]]. US&nbsp;290 then curves south to serve downtown [[Dripping Springs, Texas|Dripping Springs]], and then serves various residential areas as it crosses into southwest [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> The highway then begins a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 71|SH&nbsp;71]] at a series of traffic lights and travels through Austin's Oak Hill district before becoming a five-to-six-lane freeway. In the community of [[Sunset Valley, Texas|Sunset Valley]], US&nbsp;290 has interchanges with [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Loop&nbsp;1]] (MoPac Expressway) and [[Texas State Highway Loop 360|Loop&nbsp;360]] (Capital of Texas Highway) providing access to the [[Barton Creek Greenbelt]], and is then designated as Ben White Boulevard while it travels through south-central Austin, crossing the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] in the process. Shortly afterward, US&nbsp;290 splits north from SH&nbsp;71 in a stack interchange to run concurrent with [[Interstate 35 in Texas|I-35]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/>\n\n[[File:The Y in Oak Hill Austin Texas 2018.jpg|thumb|left|The west end of US&nbsp;290's concurrency with SH&nbsp;71 is located near the Oak Hill district in Austin.]]\nUpon beginning its concurrency with I-35, US&nbsp;290 travels through the suburban Riverside and Travis Heights districts while also serving [[St. Edward's University]]. After crossing the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], I-35 and US 290 cut between downtown Austin and the East Cesar Chavez district, being the only major highways to serve the [[Austin Convention Center]] and the [[Texas State Capitol]]. Just prior to bordering the east side of the main [[University of Texas at Austin]] campus, I-35 and US&nbsp;290 split into two decks for about {{convert|2|mi|km}}, resurfacing close to the former [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport|Mueller Airport]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> US&nbsp;290 then splits due east from I-35 southeast of the former [[Highland Mall]] as a four-lane freeway. Not long after, US&nbsp;290 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 183 in Texas|US&nbsp;183]] and promptly becomes a tolled freeway designated as the Manor Expressway. It then travels through much of industrial East Austin and Daffan before reverting to a four-lane divided highway after an interchange with [[Texas State Highway 130|SH&nbsp;130]], less than a mile shy of [[Manor, Texas|Manor]].<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> US&nbsp;290 then makes its way through rolling meadows dotted with suburban areas in northeast Travis County, then travels through southern [[Elgin, Texas|Elgin]] where it forms a brief concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 95|SH&nbsp;95]]. Passing through the town of [[McDade, Texas|McDade]], US&nbsp;290 cuts through piney woods north of the [[Lost Pines Forest]] and has an interchange with [[Texas State Highway 21|SH&nbsp;21]] west of [[Paige, Texas|Paige]]. US&nbsp;290 continues east, running parallel to the [[Austin and Northwestern Railroad]] east branch until approaching [[Giddings, Texas|Giddings]], where the highway travels along Austin Street, intersecting [[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|US&nbsp;77]] near the town's center.<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/>\n\n[[File:Houston, TX - IH610 US290 - exit12 w18th st - Hempstead rd.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;290 approaching its eastern terminus at I-610 in Houston.]]\nUS&nbsp;290 travels southeast to [[Ledbetter, Texas|Ledbetter]], where it then travels through additional grassland before bounding northeast to [[Burton, Texas|Burton]]. The highway then enters [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]], where it briefly joins [[Texas State Highway 36|SH&nbsp;36]] to serve [[Blinn College]] and bypass the city as a four-lane freeway. After exiting Brenham, US&nbsp;290 runs parallel to the old [[Washington County Railroad (1856\u20131868)|Washington County Railroad]] and goes through [[Chappell Hill, Texas|Chappell Hill]] to serve every historic landmark there, then crosses the [[Brazos River]] to move through a rural auto-industrial area.<ref name=\"Google Maps\"/> [[Texas State Highway 6|SH&nbsp;6]] joins US&nbsp;290 north of [[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]], where the two highways become a four-lane freeway notable for its role as a [[hurricane evacuation route]]. Running parallel to the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] from the north, US&nbsp;290 finally comes right next to it roughly {{convert|3|mi|km}} prior to intersecting [[Texas State Highway 99|SH&nbsp;99]]. The highway is then designated as Northwest Freeway (legally as the Ronald Reagan Memorial Highway<ref>\"[http://www.legis.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=79R&Bill=HB540 Bill: HB 540 Legislative Session: 79(R)].\" ''[[Texas Legislature]]''.

The route was designated as '''Texas State Highway Loop 318''' throughout its entire length on January 18, 1960. On February 28, 1973, the section from then-SH 90 westward became part of SH 105. It was established in 1990 when the mainline of US&nbsp;290 was rerouted along with [[Texas State Highway 36|SH&nbsp;36]] around the western and southern sides of Brenham.<ref name=\"TxDOT BU 290-F\"/> The routing begins to the west of town at an intersection with SH&nbsp;36. The business route continues east into downtown on Main Street. Before reaching downtown, the route splits into two parallel one-way streets: Main Street carrying westbound traffic and Alamo Street carrying eastbound traffic. It passes through downtown, meeting the business routing of State Highway 36 and the western terminus of [[Texas State Highway 105|SH&nbsp;105]]. At this intersection, the business route turns south on Market Street, and continues out of Brenham, rejoining the mainline US&nbsp;290 near an intersection with [[Farm to Market Road 577|FM&nbsp;577]].<ref name=\"Mapbook 452\">{{Texas Mapbook|year=2014|page=452|accessdate=December 3, 2014|link=no}}</ref><ref name=\"Mapbook 453\">{{Texas Mapbook|year=2014|page=453|accessdate=December 3, 2014|link=no}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n===Hempstead\u2013Hockley===\n{{infobox road small\n|state=TX\n|type=US\n|route=290\n|subtype=BUS\n|name=Business US Highway 290-H\n|location=[[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]]\u2013[[Hockley, Texas|Hockley]]\n|length_mi=16.991\n|length_round=3\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"TxDOT BU 290-H\" />\n|formed=1995\n}}\n'''Business U.S. Highway 290-H (Bus.

Its current western terminus is at [[Interstate 10 (Texas)|Interstate 10]] southeast of [[Segovia, Texas|Segovia]], and its eastern terminus is at [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]] in northwest [[Houston]].<ref name=\"TXDOT US 290\"/>  It is the main highway between [[Houston]] and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and is a cutoff for travelers wanting to bypass [[San Antonio]] on [[Interstate 10 (Texas)|Interstate 10]]. Throughout its length west of Austin, US&nbsp;290 cuts across mountainous hills comprising the [[Texas Hill Country]] and the [[Edwards Plateau]]; between Austin and Houston, the highway then travels through gradually hilly grasslands and pine forests comprising the [[Gulf Coastal Plains]].\n\nUS&nbsp;290 originally traveled from [[U.S. Route 80 in Texas|US&nbsp;80]] in [[Scroggins Draw, Texas|Scroggins Draw]] to terminate in San Antonio; though the highway still retains its designation from southeast of Segovia to [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]], [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]] and [[U.S. Route 87 in Texas|US&nbsp;87]] replaced much of the old routing. US&nbsp;290 also received several minor re-routings east of Austin that moved it further north, eliminating the old SH&nbsp;20; the old routings were replaced by [[Texas State Highway 71|SH&nbsp;71]] and [[Texas State Highway 21|SH&nbsp;21]]. Because of the aforementioned truncations in its length, US&nbsp;290 no longer intersects with its \"parent\" route, [[U.S. Route 90 in Texas|US&nbsp;90]], apart from two ramps at the highway's current eastern terminus in Houston.\n\n==Route description==\nUS&nbsp;290 begins from [[Interstate 10 in Texas|I-10]]'s exit 477 roughly {{convert|12|mi|km}} southeast of the small town of [[Segovia, Texas|Segovia]]. It begins to travel due east through rural farmlands in the Texas Hill Country before reaching [[Harper, Texas|Harper]], where it is the main west\u2013east road in the town. Afterwards, US&nbsp;290 begins making slight curves as it crosses through several creeks and tributaries amidst additional farmland, where it eventually joins [[U.S. Route 87 in Texas|US&nbsp;87]] and runs as Main Street through [[Fredericksburg, Texas|Fredericksburg]]. The two highways travel together for eleven blocks in downtown Fredericksburg before US&nbsp;87 splits south of US&nbsp;290 at an intersection directly south of the [[National Museum of the Pacific War]]. Traveling due south, US&nbsp;290 returns to an eastward path after crossing the [[Pedernales River]], where it serves as an important artery for Fredericksburg's agricultural district, including [[Wildseed Farms]]. The highway then runs parallel to the Pedernales River, and after passing [[Stonewall, Texas|Stonewall]], serves the south side of [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park]]'s ranch area. As the Pedernales River arcs further north, US&nbsp;290 continues east through several wineries before approaching [[Johnson City, Texas|Johnson City]] and bordering the north side of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park's city unit. US&nbsp;290 is designated as Main Street throughout downtown Johnson City as it joins [[U.S. Route 281 in Texas|US&nbsp;281]] and heads south.\n\nAfter traveling through additional hilly terrain, US&nbsp;290 splits east from US&nbsp;281 and twists through slopes in the Edwards Plateau, where an intersection with [[Ranch to Market Road 3232|RM&nbsp;3232]] in the unincorporated community of [[Henly, Texas|Henly]] provides access to [[Pedernales Falls State Park]]. US&nbsp;290 then makes a [[sigmoid curve]] to serve downtown [[Dripping Springs, Texas|Dripping Springs]], and then serves various residential areas as it crosses into southwest [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. The highway then begins a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 71|SH&nbsp;71]] at a series of traffic lights and travels through Austin's Oak Hill district before becoming a five-to-six-lane freeway. In the community of [[Sunset Valley, Texas|Sunset Valley]], US&nbsp;290 has interchanges with [[Texas State Highway Loop 1|Loop&nbsp;1]] (MoPac Expressway) and [[Texas State Highway Loop 360|Loop&nbsp;360]] (Capital of Texas Highway) providing access to the [[Barton Creek Greenbelt]], and is then designated as Ben White Boulevard while it travels through south-central Austin, crossing the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]] in the process. Shortly afterward, US&nbsp;290 splits north from SH&nbsp;71 in a stack interchange to run concurrent with [[Interstate 35 in Texas|I-35]] via exit 230.\n\n[[File:The Y in Oak Hill Austin Texas 2018.jpg|thumb|left|The west end of US&nbsp;290's concurrency with SH&nbsp;71 is located near the Oak Hill district in Austin.]]\nUpon beginning its concurrency with I-35, US&nbsp;290 travels through the suburban Riverside and Travis Heights districts while also serving [[St. Edward's University]]. After crossing the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], I-35 and US 290 cut between downtown Austin and the East Cesar Chavez district, being the only major highways to serve the [[Austin Convention Center]] and the [[Texas State Capitol]]. Just prior to bordering the east side of the main [[University of Texas at Austin]] campus, I-35 and US&nbsp;290 split into two decks for about {{convert|2|mi|km}}, resurfacing close to the former [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport|Mueller Airport]]. US&nbsp;290 then splits due east from I-35 exit 238B southeast of the former [[Highland Mall]] as a four-lane freeway. Not long after, US&nbsp;290 has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 183 in Texas|US&nbsp;183]] and promptly becomes a tolled freeway designated as the Manor Expressway. It then travels through much of industrial East Austin and Daffan before reverting to a four-lane divided highway after an interchange with [[Texas State Highway 130|SH&nbsp;130]], less than a mile shy of [[Manor, Texas|Manor]]. US&nbsp;290 then makes its way through rolling meadows dotted with suburban areas in northeast Travis County, then travels through southern [[Elgin, Texas|Elgin]] where it forms a brief concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 95|SH&nbsp;95]]. Passing through the town of [[McDade, Texas|McDade]], US&nbsp;290 cuts through piney woods north of the [[Lost Pines Forest]] and has an interchange with [[Texas State Highway 21|SH&nbsp;21]] west of [[Paige, Texas|Paige]]. US&nbsp;290 continues east, running parallel to the [[Austin and Northwestern Railroad]] east branch until approaching [[Giddings, Texas|Giddings]], where the highway is designated as Austin Street, intersecting [[U.S. Route 77 in Texas|US&nbsp;77]] near the town's center.\n\n[[File:Houston, TX - IH610 US290 - exit12 w18th st - Hempstead rd.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;290 approaching its eastern terminus at I-610 in Houston.]]\nUS&nbsp;290 travels southeast to [[Ledbetter, Texas|Ledbetter]], where it then travels through additional grassland before bounding northeast to [[Burton, Texas|Burton]]. The highway then enters [[Brenham, Texas|Brenham]], where it briefly joins [[Texas State Highway 36|SH&nbsp;36]] to serve [[Blinn College]] and bypass the city as a four-lane freeway. After exiting Brenham, US&nbsp;290 runs parallel to the old [[Washington County Railroad (1856\u20131868)|Washington County Railroad]] and goes through [[Chappell Hill, Texas|Chappell Hill]] to serve every historic landmark there, then crosses the [[Brazos River]] to move through a rural auto-industrial area. [[Texas State Highway 6|SH&nbsp;6]] joins US&nbsp;290 north of [[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]], where the two highways become a four-lane freeway notable for its role as a [[hurricane evacuation route]].

The route was designated as '''Texas State Highway Loop 318''' throughout its entire length on January 18, 1960. On February 28, 1973, the section from then-SH 90 westward became part of SH 105. It was established in 1990 when the mainline of US&nbsp;290 was rerouted along with [[Texas State Highway 36|SH&nbsp;36]] around the western and southern sides of Brenham.<ref name=\"TxDOT BU 290-F\"/> The routing begins to the west of town at an intersection with SH&nbsp;36. The business route continues east into downtown on Main Street. Before reaching downtown, the route splits into two parallel one-way streets: Main Street carrying westbound traffic and Alamo Street carrying eastbound traffic. It passes through downtown, meeting the business routing of State Highway 36 and the western terminus of [[Texas State Highway 105|SH&nbsp;105]]. At this intersection, the business route turns south on Market Street, and continues out of Brenham, rejoining the mainline US&nbsp;290 near an intersection with [[Farm to Market Road 577|FM&nbsp;577]].<ref name=\"Mapbook 452\">{{Texas Mapbook|year=2014|page=452|accessdate=December 3, 2014|link=no}}</ref><ref name=\"Mapbook 453\">{{Texas Mapbook|year=2014|page=453|accessdate=December 3, 2014|link=no}}</ref>{{Clear}}\n\n===Hempstead\u2013Hockley===\n{{infobox road small\n|state=TX\n|type=US\n|route=290\n|subtype=BUS\n|name=Business US Highway 290-H\n|location=[[Hempstead, Texas|Hempstead]]\u2013[[Hockley, Texas|Hockley]]\n|length_mi=16.991\n|length_round=3\n|length_ref=<ref name=\"TxDOT BU 290-H\" />\n|formed=1995\n}}\n'''Business U.S. Highway 290-H (Bus.

The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people.

The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98.

According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]]. After his return he practised asceticism on a mountain in western Java, where his bodily existence came to an end.<ref name=\"Noorduyn 2006 437\">{{cite book | last =Noorduyn | first =J. | publisher= KITLV Press | title = Three Old Sundanese poems | year =2006| page =437\n}}</ref>  The manuscript dated from pre-Islamic Sunda.

Hirt and W. W. Rockhill, there are Chinese sources concerning the Sunda Kingdom. At the time of the Southern Sung Dynasty, the inspector of trade with foreign countries, [[Chau Ju-kua]], collected reports from sailors and merchants who had visited foreign countries. His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling. The people are working in agriculture, their houses are on poles and the roofs are thatched with the bark of the leaves of palm trees and the walls were made with wooden boards tied together with rattan. Both men and women wrap round their loins a piece of cotton, and in cutting their hair they only leave it half an inch long. The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island. Here the capital of Sunda is called ''Daio'' which refer to Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran]]\nEuropean explorers, mainly Portuguese based in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], also reported the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\".

It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nOne of the few remnant is the 7th century [[Bojongmenje]] Hindu temple near [[Bandung]] was dicsovered in 2002. It was one of the earliest temple structure in Java, older than [[Dieng temples|temples of Dieng]] in Central Java, and probably linked to the \nSunda Kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King Purnawarman, who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[File:Building in Keraton Kasepuhan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Keraton Kasepuhan]] of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]]. By 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost its important eastern port of [[Cirebon]].]]\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\n[[File:Bird\u2019s-eye View of the City of Bantam de Bry.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Banten (town)|Port of Banten]] in the 16th century.

The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfill his duty as a king, he renovate and beautify the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations. ''Dayeuh'' Pakuan Pajajaran served as the capital of Sunda Kingdom approximately for almost a hundred years (1482 \u2013 1579), until it was razed and destroyed by the [[Sultanate of Banten]] in 1579.\n\nBecause Pakuan, the capital city of the Sunda kingdom laid between two parallel rivers, Ciliwung and Cisadane, it was called ''Pajajaran'' (lit. place laid between two parallel things) or [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom. The later name \u2013 Pajajaran \u2013 is more familiar for people residing in West Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] of [[Sultanate of Mataram|Mataram]] region (current [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Solo, Central Java|Solo]]).\n\n==Government and economy==\n===Administration===\n[[File:Makuta Binokasih.jpg|thumb|upright|''Makuta Binokasih Sanghyang Pak\u00e9'', the royal crown of Sunda kingdom.

On the other hand, the term \"Pakuan\" and \"Pajajaran\" or \"Dayeuh\" refer to its capital which corresponds to the modern city of Bogor. The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago. The ports of Sunda participated in international trades in the region.\n\nIn [[Suma Oriental]], written in 1512-1515, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], a Portuguese explorer report about the ports of Sunda:\n{{quotation|First the king of ''\u00c7umda'' (Sunda) with his great city of ''Dayo'', the town and lands and port of ''Bantam'', the port of ''Pomdam'' (Pontang), the port of ''Cheguide'' (Cigede), the port of ''Tamgaram'' (Tangerang), the port of ''Calapa'' ([[Sunda Kalapa|Kelapa]]), and the port of ''Chemano'' (Chi Manuk or Cimanuk), this is Sunda, because the river of Chi Manuk is the limit of both kingdoms.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |p = 166 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nAnother Portuguese explorer, Diogo do Couto, wrote that the Sunda kingdom is thriving and abundant; it lies between Java and Sumatra, separated from the latter by the  [[Sunda Strait]]. Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the strait, for nearly the space of forty leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}}; the strait's widest point is about twenty-five and narrowest point only twelve leagues{{vague|whose leagues? Not likely English units.  How long are they?|date=January 2010}} broad. Bantam is about the midpoint. All the islands are well timbered, but have little water. A small one called Macar, at the entrance of Sunda Strait, is said to have much gold.\n\nHe also noted that the principal ports of the Sunda kingdom were Banten, Ache, Chacatara (Jakarta), which annually receive twenty sommas, ships from Chienheo, China, to ship the eight thousand ''bahars'', which are equal to 3,000,000&nbsp;kg<!--unless some unit other than 100 kg was called a quintal here, was \"thirty thousand quintals--> of pepper the kingdom produced.\n\nBantam is situated at 6\u00b0 south latitude, in the middle of a bay, three leagues from point to point. The town is eight hundred and fifty fathoms{{vague|English fathoms, or something else?|date=January 2010}} in length, and the seaport extends about 400. A river capable of admitting junks and galleys flows through the middle of the town: a small branch of this river admits boats and small craft.\n\nThere is a brick fort, the walls of which are seven palms thick{{vague|human palms or palm trees?|date=July 2012}}, with wooden bulwarks, armed with two tiers of artillery. The anchorage is good, with a muddy or sandy bottom and a depth from two to six fathoms.\n\n==Culture and society==\n===Religion===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=320|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=KITLV 87602 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|image2=KITLV 87603 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest at Telaga near Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|footer=Hindu ritual objects; bells, small statue, [[trishula]] and ornament of ritual staff made of bronze, from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java. These objects was belongs to Brahmin Hindu priest, Hinduism was a dominant faith in Sunda Kingdom.}}\n\n[[Hinduism]] was one of the earliest religious influences established in West Java since the era of [[Tarumanagara]], circa early 5th century CE. In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality. ''\" ... ini na lakukeuneun, talatah sang sadu jati. Hongkara namo Sewaya, sembah ing hulun di Sanghyang Panca Tatagata; panca ngaran ing lima, tata ma ngaran ing sabda, gata ma ngaran ing raga, ya eta ma pahayueun sareanana .., \"'', \" ... this has to be done, the true mandate of the good-hearted (or trusted one).

Sunda kingdom period, circa 14th century.]]\nThe culture of Sunda kingdom centred on agricultural activity, especially [[rice]] cultivation. [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich. The land of Sunda has as much as four thousands horses which come there from Priaman (Sumatera) and other islands to be sold. It has up to forty elephants; these are for the king\u2019s array. An inferior gold, of six carats, is found. There is abundance tamarinds which serve the native for vinegar.\n\nThe city where the king is most of the year is the great city of Dayo. The city has well-built houses of the palm leaf and wood. They say that the king\u2019s house has three hundred and thirty wooden pillars as thick as a wine cask, and five fathoms (8 m) high, and beautiful timber work on the top of the pillars, and a very well-built house. The city is two days journey from the chief port, which is called [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]].\n\nThe people of the sea coast get along well with the merchants in the land. They are accustomed to trade. These people of Sunda very often come to Malacca to trade. They bring cargo lancharas, ships of a hundred and fifty tons. Sunda has up to six junks and many lancharas of the sunda kind, with masts like a crane, and steps between each so that they are easy to navigate.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe people of Sunda are said to be truthful. They, with great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n[[File:Padrao sunda kelapa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luso Sundanese padr\u00e3o|''Padr\u00e3o'' of Sunda Kalapa]] (1522), a stone pillar with a [[cross]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] commemorating a treaty between [[Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought as the successor of [[Tarumanagara]] which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE). However, according to the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'',<ref>[[Friedrich Hirth]] and [[W.W. Rockhill]] ''[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31403797/ Chao Jukua, His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu-fan-chi]'' St Petersburg, 1911.</ref> written around 1225 by [[Zhao Rugua]], ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), was still part of ''San-fo-tsi '' (Srivijaya) 15 tributaries.\n\nKingdom of Sunda has established relations with its eastern neighbour; the kaleidoscope of Javanese kingdoms, from the era of Medang Mataram back in the 8th century, all the way to Majapahit in 14th century and Demak in 16th century. The popular hero, King [[Sanjaya of Mataram]] known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Medang court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese [[Horren inscription]], mentioned ''\u00e7atru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat square in Majapahit]] in 1357, killing all of Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]].

The impact of the Sunda kingdom theme on popular culture can be seen in the following:\n\n# '''Saur Sepuh''' (1987\u20131991), a radio drama and film by Niki Kosasih. Begun as a popular radio drama program in the late 1980s, Saur Sepuh is set in 15th century Java, and is about Brama Kumbara, a fictional king of Madangkara, itself a fictional kingdom neighbour of the Pajajaran. Several films and TV series are also based on the Saur Sepuh story.\n# '''[[Prabu Siliwangi]]''' (1988), a film directed by Sofyan Sharna, about the fictionalised lifestory of [[King Siliwangi]].\n# '''[[Prabu Siliwangi]]''' (2009), a novel written by E Rokajat Asura, also about King Siliwangi.\n# '''Dyah Pitaloka''' (2007), a novel written by Hermawan Aksan, about Sundanese Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]], focussed around the [[Gajah Mada#The Bubat Accident|Bubat War]].

The example is ''suvarna'' (lit:\"good color\") used to describe gold. ''Sunda'' is also another name for Hindu God [[Vishnu]]. In Sanskrit, the term ''Sundara'' (masculine) or ''Sundari'' (feminine) means \"beautiful\" or \"excellence\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&script=ia&tran_input=Sunda&direct=au|title=Sunda, Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit|last=Glashoff|first=Klaus|website=spokensanskrit.org|access-date=2018-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web\n| url         = http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/?iencoding=iast&q=sunda&lang=sans&action=Search\n| title       = Sunda in Sanskrit Dictionary\n| accessdate  = 20 November 2014\n| publisher   = Sanskrit Dictionary\n}}\n</ref> The term ''Sunda'' also means bright, light, purity, cleanness and white.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |url         = http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |title       = Watak Budaya Sunda\n |access-date  = 24 October 2011\n |last        = Kurnia\n |first       = Iwan\n |date        = 14 August 2007\n |publisher   = Kasundaan.org\n |language    = Indonesian\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831145939/http://www.kasundaan.org/id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=53&Itemid=82\n |archive-date = 31 August 2011\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe name ''Sunda'' is also known in Hindu mythology of [[Sunda and Upasunda]], as one of the powerful [[Asura]] brothers that received the boon of invulnerability from [[Brahma]]. The powerful Asura brothers then set out to conquering the world, and menacing the Gods. In the  end they fought each other over [[Tilottama]], a beautiful [[Apsara]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/sunda|title=Sunda, \u015aunda, Shunda: 6 definitions|last=www.wisdomlib.org|website=www.wisdomlib.org|access-date=2018-06-04|date=29 June 2012}}</ref> The story of Sunda and Upasunda is found in the [[Mahabharata]], Book I: Adi Parva. It is not clear however, whether the [[eponym]]ous ''Sunda'' was derived from this Hindu myth.\n\nIt seems that by the 10th century, the name ''Sunda'' was used by foreigners, possibly by early Indian explorers, Malay Srivijayan traders and colonizer, also Javanese neighbours, as a toponym to identify the Western parts of Java. The [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat inscription]] dated from 854 Saka (932 CE) confirmed this. The name is then used by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] to identify  their western neighbour, also rival and enemy, as mentioned in [[Horren inscription]] (c. 11th century) from Kediri.\n\nAn early 13th century Chinese account reported the pepper port of ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), which probably refer to the port of Banten or Sunda Kalapa. By the 15th to 16th century, after the consolidation of the kingdom by [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], the name ''Sunda'' has shifted from a possibly eponymous toponymy, into a name that identify a kingdom and its people. Thus subsequently gave birth, name and identity to the [[ethnogenesis]] of the [[Sundanese people]].\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:KITLV 87649 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Batoetoelis at Buitenzorg - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|[[Batutulis inscription]] (dated 1533), in [[Bogor]], commemorate the great King of Sunda [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]] (rule 1482-1521).]]\nKnowledge of the kingdom among [[Sundanese people]] has been kept alive through Sundanese ''[[Pantun Sunda|Pantun]]'' oral tradition, the chant of poetic verses about the golden age of Sunda Pajajaran, and the legend of [[Prabu Siliwangi]], the most popular king of Sunda.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rFvsBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi#v=onepage&q=Pantun%20Sunda%20Siliwangi&f=false|title=Java Essay: The History and Culture of a Southern Country|last=Iguchi|first=Masatoshi|date=2017-01-25|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|isbn=9781784628857|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=chJvAAAAMAAJ&q=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi&dq=Pantun+Sunda+Siliwangi|title=Kebudayaan Sunda: Zaman Pajajaran|last=Ekajati|first=Edi Suhardi|date=2005|publisher=Pustaka Jaya|isbn=9789794193341|language=id}}</ref>\n\nSeveral stone inscriptions mention the kingdom, such as [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Juru Pangambat]], [[Jayabupati inscription|Jayabupati]], [[Kawali inscription|Kawali]], and [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]].

The inscription was in old [[Javanese script]], but the language used was [[Old Malay]]. It translates as follows:\n\n{{quotation|This memorial stone is to remark the saying of Rakryan Juru Pangambat (Royal Hunter), in 854 Saka, that the order of government is returned to the power of king of Sunda.}}\n\nThe inscription chandrasengkala ([[chronogram]]) written 458 Saka, however some historians suggested that the year of the inscription must be read backward as 854 Saka (932 AD) because the Sunda kingdom could not have existed in 536 AD, in the era of the Kingdom of Tarumanagara (358-669 AD).\n\nAnother reference to the kingdom is the [[Jayabupati inscription]] which consists of 40 lines written on four pieces of stone found on the Cicatih river bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]]. The inscription is written in old [[Javanese script]]. The four inscriptions are now stored at the National Museum in Jakarta, under the codes D 73 (Cicatih), D 96, D 97 and D 98. The contents of the inscriptions (according to Pleyte):\n\n{{quotation|Peace and well-being.

O being known by thee.., all the spirits.}}\n\nThe date of the Jayabupati inscription may be 11 October 1030. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years, from 952 to 964 saka (1030 - 1042 AD). The inscription has an East Javanese style in lettering, language, and style, and mentions the current king by name.\n\nCopperplate letters dating to the 15th century, including royal instructions, also imply the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. The copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of collecting taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nKebantenan II inscription (Sunda Sembawa I) copperplate inscription announces Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482\u20131521), the king staying in Pakuan, approving an already delineated sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') put at the disposal of the ''wiku'' (priests), which must not be split as it houses facilities for worship, which belong to the king. Kebantenan III inscription (Sunda Sembawa II) copperplate announces the king of Sunda's sanctions of holy construction in Sunda Sembawa. The Kebantenan IV (Gunung Samaya) inscription says that Sri Baduga Maharaja, who ruled in Pakuan, sanctioned a sacred place (''tanah devasana'') at Gunung (mount) Samya (Rancamaya), the mentions a similar sacred estate to the one described in the Kebantenan II inscription.\n\nThe primary source that contains information about the daily life of late 15th to early 16th century Sunda Kingdom was found in [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript. The names of places, culture and customs, was described in great detail, it is one of the important specimen of Old [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] literature. The main character is Prince Jaya Pakuan alias Bujangga Manik, a Sundanese Hindu hermit, who, though a prince at the court of [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], preferred to live a life of a man of religion. As a hermit he made two journeys from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]] to central and eastern Java and back, the second one including a visit to [[Bali]].

His report on far countries, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written from 1178 to 1225 AD, mentions the deepwater harbour of Sin-t\u2019o (Sunda). Chu-fan-chi reported that:\n\n{{quotation|All along the shores, people are dwelling. The people are working in agriculture, their houses are on poles and the roofs are thatched with the bark of the leaves of palm trees and the walls were made with wooden boards tied together with rattan. Both men and women wrap round their loins a piece of cotton, and in cutting their hair they only leave it half an inch long. The [[Black pepper|pepper]] grown on the hills (of this country) is small-grained, but heavy and superior to that of [[Tuban|Ta-pan]] (eastern Java). The country produces pumpkins, sugar cane, [[bottle gourd]], beans and [[egg plant]]s. As, however, there is no regular government in this country, the people are given to brigandage, on which account foreign traders rarely go there.}}\n\nAccording to this source, the kingdom of Sunda produced high quality black pepper. The kingdom located in the western parts of Java near [[Sunda Strait]], corresponds to today Banten, Jakarta and west part of West Java province. According to this source, the port of Sunda was under [[Srivijaya]] mandala domination. Port of Sunda was highly possible refer to [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]] instead of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]. Its capital is located 10 kilometres inland southward in [[Banten Girang]] near Mount [[Pulosari]].\n \nThe Chinese book \u201cshun-feng hsiang-sung\" from about 1430 AD relates:\n\n{{quotation|In this voyage eastward from Sunda, along the north coast of Java, ships steered 97 1/2o for three watches to make [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]]; they then followed the coast (past Tanjung Indramayu), finally steering 187 1/2o for four watches to reach Cirebon. Ships from Banten proceeded eastward along the north coast of Java, past [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]], past Indramayu head, past Cirebon.}}\n\nAccording to this source the port of Sunda was located west of [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]] and later identified as [[Banten (town)|port of Banten]].\n\n===European account===\n[[File:Java-Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Old map of Java still thought that land of Sunda in the west is separated with the rest of Java island. Here the capital of Sunda is called ''Daio'' which refer to Dayeuh Pakuan Pajajaran]]\nEuropean explorers, mainly Portuguese based in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]], also reported the existence of the Sunda Kingdom. [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] (1513) mentioned a Western Java kingdom that had established trade relation with them as ... ''Reg\u00f1o de \u00c7umda'' ..., which means \"The Kingdom of Sunda\". Also the report of [[Antonio Pigafetta]] (1522) that mentioned Sunda as a [[Piper cubeba|pepper]] producing region.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}}\n\nTom\u00e9 Pires from Portugal wrote in his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental|Summa Oriental]] (1513\u20131515)\u201d:\n\n{{quotation|Some people affirm that the Sunda kingdom take up half of the whole island of Java; others, to whom more authority is attributed, say that the Sunda kingdom must be a third part of the island and an eight more.

The people hold that whoever passes this strait (the river Cimanuk) into the South Sea is carried off by violent currents and unable to return.<ref name=\"Heuken\">{{cite book  | last =SJ  | first =Adolf Heuken  | publisher= Cipta Loka Caraka  | title = Sumber-sumber asli sejarah Jakarta, Jilid I: Dokumen-dokumen sejarah Jakarta sampai dengan akhir abad ke-16 | year =1999| accessdate = |page = 34 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe Portuguese report is dated from a later period of the kingdom, shortly before its fall to forces of the [[Sultanate of Banten]].\n\n==History==\n{{Very long section|date=February 2020}}{{History of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Bojongmenje 1.jpg|thumb|left|The ruin of [[Bojongmenje]] Hindu temple in [[Priangan]] highlands, estimated built in the 7th century.]]\n\nThe history of Sunda Kingdom spanned for almost a millennium, between 7th to 16th century. It is not sure however, whether it was actually a continuous polity or not, nor whether its rulers belongs to a single continuous lineage of dynasty or not. This is because the scarcity of evidences, historical records and archaeological findings that plausibly connected to this kingdom.\n\nOne of the few remnant is the 7th century [[Bojongmenje]] Hindu temple near [[Bandung]] was dicsovered in 2002. It was one of the earliest temple structure in Java, older than [[Dieng temples|temples of Dieng]] in Central Java, and probably linked to the \nSunda Kingdom.\n\nThe earlier period is unclear, and quite speculative at its best. Much owed to only two manuscripts dated from much later period, the [[Carita Parahyangan]] and Wangsakerta manuscripts. The history of later period however, after late 14th century, is quite clear. Especially after the reign of King Wastu Kancana and Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja). This is contributed mainly to the availability of historical sources, including numbers of foreign reports, especially Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]]; several stone inscriptions especially [[Batutulis inscription|Batutulis]]; and native primary historical manuscripts of [[Bujangga Manik]] and [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]].\n\n====Formation and growth====\nAccording to the Wangsakerta manuscript, King Tarusbawa from Sunda Sambawa, a vassal kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], succeeded his father-in-law as the 13th king of Tarumanagara. Tarumanagara's prestige and power had been declining, likely due to a series of invasions from [[Srivijaya]]. Wishing to restore the glory of King Purnawarman, who reigned from the Purasaba (capital city) of Sundapura, in 670 AD Tarusbawa renamed Tarumanagara to the Sunda Kingdom. This event is confirmed by a Chinese source mentioning Tarumanagara's last envoy was in 669 AD. Tarusbawa sent his emissary to the Chinese Emperor at the time to advise him of his ascension to the throne in 669 AD. He was crowned on the ninth of the month of Jesta, in 591 Saka, which corresponds to 18 May 669 AD.\n\n====Separation of Galuh and Sunda Kingdom====\n[[File:Sunda-Galuh.gif|thumb|right|[[Citarum River]] separates Sunda and Galuh]] According to the Wangsakerta manuscript, Wretikandayun, the lord of another former vassal kingdom of Tarumanagara, [[Galuh Kingdom]], used the establishment of the Sunda Kingdom as an excuse to split eastern Taruma from Tarusbawa's Sunda. Since the crown prince of Galuh was the son-in-law of [[Queen Shima]] of [[Kalingga]], a Hindu kingdom in central Java, Wretikandayun, supported by Kalingga, demanded that the remnant of what was known as Tarumanagara's territory be divided into two kingdoms. Finding himself in an unfortunate position and unwilling to risk a civil war, King Tarusbawa granted Wretikandayun's demand. In 670 AD, Tarumanagara was divided into two kingdoms: the Sunda Kingdom in the west, and the Galuh Kingdom in the east, separated by the Tarum (Citarum) River.\n\n====Sanna and Purbasora====\n[[File:Cangkuang 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple a shrine for Shiva, dated from the 8th century Galuh Kingdom.]]\nWretikandayun, the King of Galuh has two sons; Sempakwaja and Mandiminyak. Despite being the eldest son, Sempakwaja was not chosen as the successor because he was toothless, a shameful physical defect considered unsuitable for a king at that time. Thus, his younger brother, Mandiminyak (r. 702-709) inherited the Galuh throne from Wretikandayun instead. Sempakwaja then established a rural principality of Galunggung Kingdom. \n\nSempakwaja has a son named Purbasora, while King Mandiminyak also has a son named Sena or Bratasena. However, there was a circulating rumours in the palace; that actually instead of cousins; Purbasora and Sena were actually brothers. This was because Prince Sena was the result of a forbidden affair between Mandiminyak and his own sister in-law; the beautiful wife of Sempakwaja.\n\nAfter the death of Mandiminyak, Prince Bratasena or Sena (r. 709-716), ascends as the new king; as the third monarch of Galuh. According to Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts; King Sena of Galuh married to Princess Sannaha of Kalingga in Central Java, and they had Sanjaya as their son and heir. In an attempt to nurture a good relations with the neighboring Sunda Kingdom, King Sena established a friendship with King Tarusbawa of Sunda. This friendship encouraged Tarusbawa to take Sanjaya as his son-in-law.\n\nPurbasora, son of Batara Danghyang Guru Sempakwaja of the Galunggung Kingdom, also grandson of Wretikandayun, the founder of Galuh, deeply resent the reign of his cousin; King Sena. This was because he felt that instead of Sena that had a doubtful scandalous origin, he is more deserving to the throne of Galuh. With the aid of his father-in-law, King Indraprahasta, from a kingdom near present-day [[Cirebon]], Purbasora rebelled, launched his coup and usurped Sena as the king of Galuh in 716. Defeated, Sena fled to [[Kalingga]], the kingdom of his wife's grandmother, Queen Shima.\n\nSince the crown prince of Sunda died before King Tarusbawa, Princess Tejakencana (the daughter of the crown prince) was hailed as the heiress of Sunda. She married Rakeyan Jamri, son of Bratasena (the third king of Galuh Kingdom and a son of Wretikandayun) and Princess Sanaha (from [[Kalingga]]). In 723, Jamri succeeded Tarusbawa as the second king of Sunda. As the lord of Sunda, he was known as Prabu Harisdarma and laterwhen he ascended the throne of Galuh he was known as [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]].\n\n====Sanjaya and Balangantrang====\n[[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of Sena, determined to take revenge to Purbasora's rebellion. He requested aid from King Tarusbawa of Sunda, a friend of Sena. His wish was realised when he became the king of Sunda, reigning on behalf of his wife.\n\nHe prepared a special force, which he placed in the Gunung Sawal area with the help of Rabuyut Sawal, also a dear friend of Sena. This special force was led by Sanjaya, while the Sunda army was led by Patih Anggada. The raid was launched at nightfall. Almost all of Purbasora's family was wiped out, except for Bimaraksa, Purbasora's son-in-law; the minister of Galuh escaped with a handful of guards.\n\nBimaraksa, also known as Ki Balangantrang, was the Senapati (army general) of the kingdom. Balangantrang was also the grandson of Wretikandayun, as a child of his second son, Resi Guru Jantaka or Rahyang Kidul, and was also considered unfit to succeed Wretikandayun because he suffered from a [[hernia]]. Balangantrang hid in the village of G\u00e8g\u00e8r Sunten and raised anti-Sanjaya forces. He was supported by the kings of Kuningan and also by the remnants of the Indraprahasta army. Indraphrasta was annihilated by Sanjaya as revenge for helping Purbasora to oust Sena.\n\nSena asked Sanjaya to honour all of the Galuh royal family, except Purbasora. Sanjaya himself was not interested in ruling Galuh. He merely attacked it to fulfill his father's wish to take revenge on Purbasora's family. After defeating Purbasora, Sanjaya asked his granduncle, Sempakwaja, in Galunggung to order Demunawan, the younger brother of Purbasora, to reign in Galuh. But Sempakwaja declined, fearing this to be Sanjaya's trick to annihilate Demunawan.\n\nSanjaya himself could not find Balangantrang, so he accepted the Galuh throne. Realizing that he was unwelcomed at the Galuh court, and also that he was a Sunda king who must reside in Pakuan, he put Premana Dikusuma, grandson of Purbasora, in charge of Galuh. Premana Dikusuma at that time was a vassal king. At the age of 43 (born in 683 AD), he was already known as Rsi or an ascetic monk, because of his passion for learning and spiritual teaching since a young age, he is also known as Bagawat Sajalajaya.\n\nSanjaya also had legitimate right to Kalingga's throne (from his grandmother's side). Thus in 732 AD he chose to live in [[Kalingga]] (in the northern part of central Java) and later established the [[Mataram Kingdom]] and [[Sanjaya Dynasty]]. In 732 he gave his right to western Java to his son from Tejakencana, Prince Tamperan (Rakeyan Panaraban). Rakeyan was a half-brother of Rakai Panangkaran, Sanjaya's son from Sudiwara (daughter of Dewasinga, king of southern Kalingga).\n\n====Reunification of Sunda and Galuh====\nThe [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdoms of Sunda and Galuh coexisted under a strange and complex relationship; occasionally united under one ruler, and at other times as separated kingdoms under different rulers, albeit allied or related.\nThe two kingdoms united as the Sunda Kingdom under the following kings:\n* Sanjaya (723 \u2013 732 AD) with the capital city in Kawali Galuh (present-day [[Ciamis]] city)\n* Tamperan or Rakeyan Panaraban (in 732 - 739 AD) with the capital in Kawali Galuh\n* Wuwus (819 \u2013 891 AD) with the capital city in Pakuan (present-day [[Bogor]] City)\n* Darmaraksa (891 \u2013 895 AD) with the capital in Pakuan\n* Prabu Guru Darmasiksa with the capital city in Sawunggalah (present-day [[Kuningan]] city)\n* Rakeyan Jayadarma resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ragasuci (1297\u20131303 AD) resided in Saunggalah\n* Prabu Citraganda (1303\u20131311 AD) resided in Pakuan\n* Prabu Lingga Dewata (1311\u20131333 AD) perhaps resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Ajiguna Wisesa (1333\u20131340 AD) resided in Kawali.\n* Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana (1340\u20131357 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Mangkubumi Suradipati/Prabu Bunisora (1357\u20131371 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Prabu Raja Wastu/Niskala Wastu Kancana (1371\u20131475 AD) resided in Kawali\n* Sri Baduga Maharaja (1482 to 1521 AD) resided in Pakuan\n\n====Rakryan Juru Pangambat====\nAccording to [[Kebon Kopi II inscription]], dated from 854 Saka (932 CE), discovered in Kebon Kopi village, [[Bogor]], a noble which also a skilled hunter named Juru Pangambat, declared that the authority (order) is returned to the king of Sunda.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|381}} This inscription was written in [[Kawi alphabet]], however curiously the language being used is [[Old Malay]]. Archaeologist [[F. D. K. Bosch]], that had studied the inscription, proposed that the use of Old Malay suggests [[Srivijaya]]n influence on Western Java. French historian, Claude Guillot from [[\u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame-Orient]] proposed that this was a declaration of independence (possibly from Srivijaya) of the Kingdom of Sunda.\n\n====Jayabupati====\n[[File:Sanghyang Tapak inscription.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]]]]\nAccording to [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]], dated from 952 saka (1030 CE) found in Cicatih River bank in Cibadak, [[Sukabumi]], Maharaja Sri Jayabupati established a sacred sanctuary of Sanghyang Tapak. Strangely the style of the inscriptions reveal an East Javanese style of script. Not only letters, language, and style, but the noble name of the king is similar to royal names in [[Dharmawangsa]]'s court of East Javanese [[Medang kingdom]]. This has led to suggestions that Sunda Kingdom at this time probably was under the influence of East Java, possibly a vassal. Or probably Jayabupati consciously subscribed to Javanese culture among Sundanese population.\n\nSri Jayabupati in [[Carita Parahyangan]] is mentioned as Prabu Detya Maharaja. According to Pustaka Nusantara, Parwa III sarga 1, Sri Jayabupati reigned for 12 years (952-964) Saka (1030-1042). The 11th century [[Horren inscription]] of Southern Kediri, reported that ''\u00e7atru Sunda'' (enemy from Sunda) had invaded and menacing villages in East Java. It was not clear however, which Sundanese faction has committed such [[brigandage]] as far east to Kediri, nor whether Sri Jayabupati was responsible for this.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nAfter Sri Jayabupati, there is no stone inscription discovered mentioning the next ruler. There is no tangible evidence discovered from the period between 11th to 14th century. Most of our current knowledge about this period came from Carita Parahyangan and Wangsakerta manuscripts.\n\nThe Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] source, ''[[Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1200, [[Chou Ju-kua]] identified the two most powerful and richest kingdoms in the [[Indonesian archipelago]] as [[Srivijaya]] and Java ([[Kediri (historical kingdom)|Kediri]]). According to this source, in the early 13th Century, [[Srivijaya]] still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda). The source describes the port of Sunda as strategic and thriving, [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda being among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture and their houses were built on wooden poles (''rumah panggung''). However, robbers and thieves plagued the country.<ref>{{cite book | author= Drs. R. Soekmono| title= ''Pengantar Sejarah Kebudayaan Indonesia 2'', 2nd ed. | publisher = Penerbit Kanisius | date= 1973 | location =Yogyakarta| pages =60 }}</ref> It was uncertain which port of Sunda was referred to by Chou Ju-kua, it probably referred to the port of [[Banten (town)|Banten]], and not Kalapa. It seems that by early 13th century, the maritime trade was still dominated by Srivijayan mandala based in Sumatra. The port of Sunda still pretty much served as a trading post or colony of Srivijaya. Nevertheless, the Sunda Kingdom in the inland west Java still enjoyed internal autonomy.\n\n====Rakeyan Jayadarma====\nAccording to Pustaka Rajyarajya i Bhumi Nusantara parwa II sarga 3, Rakeyan Jayadarma was the son-in-law of Mahisa Campaka of [[Singhasari]]. During the reign of Prabu Guru Dharmasiksa (1175\u20131297) Prince Jayadharma married Dyah Singamurti, also known as Dyah Lembu Tal. Sangrama Wijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]), the first King of [[Majapahit]], was the son of the Sunda king, Rakeyan Jayadharma. Except for Gajah Mada, who insisted on incorporating the Sunda Kingdom within the Majapahit realm, this is the likely reason why Majapahit kings were reluctant to attack the Sunda Kingdom. There was a sacred alliance between the Sunda Kingdom and the Majapahit Kingdom.\n\n====Golden age====\nThe name \"Sunda\" appeared again in Javanese source. This time the [[Pararaton]] reported that in 1336, during the reign of Majapahit Queen [[Tribhuwana Wijayatunggadewi]], at the inauguration of his newly appointed position as Patih Amangkubhumi (Prime Minister), [[Gajah Mada]] declared [[Palapa oath]], which stated his foreign policy to unify the archipelago under Majapahit domination. Gajah Mada said ''\"Lamun huwus kalah nusantara isun amukti palapa, lamun kalah ring Gurun, ring Seran, Ta\u00f1jung Pura, ring Haru, ring Pahang, Dompo, ring Bali, Sunda, Palembang, Tumasik, samana isun amukti palapa\"''. Sunda was mentioned as one of kingdoms targeted by Mada's overseas campaign. It seems by early 14th century, Kingdom of Sunda has grown quite prosperous and took part in international maritime trade. Quite significantly, so the kingdom has attracted the interest of Majapahit Prime Minister.\n\n====Maharaja Lingga Buana====\n{{Further|Battle of Bubat}}\nThe [[Carita Parahyangan]] and [[Pararaton]] simply named him as ''Pr\u011bbu Maharaja''. While the Wangsakerta manuscript give a detailed name of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. He resided in Kawali Galuh. He died in the [[Battle of Bubat]], Majapahit, in 1357, fell victim to a [[Stratagem (deception)|stratagem]] crafted by the Majapahit prime minister, [[Gajah Mada]]. The tragedy's prelude came with the intention of [[Hayam Wuruk]], the king of Majapahit, to marry Princess [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi|Dyah Pitaloka]] (also known as Citraresmi), a daughter of Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana. Delighted by the prospect to foster an alliance with the most powerful kingdom in the region, the Sunda king and his royal family came to Majapahit, sailing through the Java Sea, to accompany and marry his daughter to Hayam Wuruk. The Sunda party erected the encampment on Bubat square in the northern part of [[Trowulan]], Majapahit capital, and awaited the proper wedding ceremony. Gajah Mada however, saw this event as an opportunity to demand Sunda's submission to Majapahit overlordship, and insisted that instead of becoming the queen of Majapahit, the princess was to be presented as a concubine for the Majapahit king, as a token of her kingdom's submission. The Sunda king was angered and humiliated by Gajah Mada's demand.\n\nAs a result, there was a skirmish between the Sunda royal family and the [[Majapahit]] army. The Majapahit army decimated the Sunda royal family; almost the entire [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] royal party, including the princess, perished in this tragedy. Tradition mentioned that Princess Dyah Pitaloka committed suicide to defend the honour and pride of her country. After his death, Prabu Maharaja Lingga Buana was revered by the Sundanese as Prabu Wangi (lit. king with pleasant fragrance) because of his heroic defence of his honour against Majapahit, and his descendants, the later kings of Sunda, were called Siliwangi (lit. successor of Wangi). The story of the [[Battle of Bubat]] is the main theme of the book [[Kidung Sunda]].\n\n====Niskala Wastu Kancana====\n{{main|Niskala Wastu Kancana}}\n[[File:KITLV 87612 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Inscribed stone at Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|One of [[Kawali inscription]]s]]\nKing Niskala Wastu Kancana was the youngest son of Prabu Maharaja and the brother of Princess Pitaloka Citraresmi, both perished in Majapahit. In 1371, Prince Wastu ascended to throne, stylized as Prabu Raja Wastu Kancana. According to [[Kawali inscription]], approximately dated from second half of the 14th century, mentioned that King Prabu Raja Wastu constructed the defensive structures; walls and moats surrounding Kawali city, and renovated Surawisesa palace.<ref name=\"Sejarah Jawa Barat\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dvR7CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA52&dq=Niskala+Wastu+Kancana#v=onepage&q=Niskala%20Wastu%20Kancana&f=false|title=Sejarah Daerah Jawa Barat|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> The construction of moats and other defensive measures, was probably as a response to a perceived foreign threat. Since the relations between Sunda and its eastern neighbour, the powerful \nMajapahit empire, was badly deteriorated after the Bubat incident. Niskala Wastu resided in Kawali palace of Galuh, and ruled for 104 years (1371\u20131475).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|392}} His reign is remembered as a long era of peace and prosperity.\n\nThe copperplate inscription of Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) reads that Raja Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana sent an order through Hyang Ningrat Kancana to the Susuhunan of Pakuan Pajajaran to take care of ''dayohan'' in Jayagiri and Sunda Sembawa, banning the collection of taxes from the residents because they were knowledgeable about the (Hindu) religion and worshiped the gods.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana was buried in Nusalarang, while his successor Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned ''Prebu Niskala Wastu Kancana surup di Nusalarang ring giri Wanakusumah'', while his successor was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu'''. In Carita Parahyangan, Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana is not mentioned completely, but only referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh). At this point, the Sunda Kingdom capital was still located in Galuh, more precisely in Kawali city.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|391}}\n\n====Ningrat Kancana====\nNiskala Wastu Kancana's son, named as Tohaan di Galuh (Lord of Galuh) in Carita Parahyangan, succeeded him as the king. He was mentioned in Kebantenan I (Jayagiri) inscription as Hyang Ningrat Kancana and in \nBatutulis inscription as Rahyang Dewa Niskala.\n\nThe new king however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\"<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}} The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or non-Hindu (Muslim) woman.\n\nAccording to Batutulis inscription, Rahyang Dewa Niskala was buried in Gunatiga. This information is supported by Carita Parahyangan manuscript that mentioned that Tohaan di Galuh was ''nu surup di Gunung Tilu''' died or buried in Gunung Tilu. Gunatiga and Gunung Tilu means \"Three mountains\" which corresponds to Gunung Tilu mountain range located east of the town of [[Kuningan]]. Today, Gunung Tilu marked as the boundary between West Java and [[Central Java]] provinces, located between [[Kuningan Regency]] and [[Brebes Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gn.+Tilu/@-7.1188884,108.6816571,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x2e6f73efb54d5283:0x8ef28fb8de770294!8m2!3d-7.1188889!4d108.6991667!5m1!1e4|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=2018-06-17}}</ref>\n\n====Sri Baduga Maharaja====\n{{main|Sri Baduga Maharaja}}\n[[File:KITLV 87605 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Hindu-Javanese sculpture at Telaga in Kuningan - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Statue of a Hindu god from Talaga near Kuningan, West Java, dated from Sunda Kingdom.]]\nSang Ratu Jayadewata or also known as Sri Baduga Maharaja, is a grandchild of Prabu Wastu Kancana or Prabu Niskala Wastu. Jayadewata is often linked with a popular character [[King Siliwangi|Prabu Siliwangi]] in the Sundanese oral tradition of [[Pantun]].\n\nKing Jayadewata moved the government seat from [[Kawali]] back to [[Pakuan Pajajaran|Pakuan]] in 1482. It is not clear however, the reason behind the transfer of capital westward from Kawali to Pakuan Pajajaran. It might be a geopolitical move to secure the capital away from the eastern threat from [[Demak Sultanate|Islamic state of Demak]] in Central Java. As by 1482, according to ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a Cirebon chronicle, Cirebon declared its independence from Sunda and no longer sent tribute to the Sunda court.\n\nBased on Kebantenan copperplate inscription, he established a sacred estate (''tanah devasasana'') at Mount Samya (Rancamaya) and ordered that anyone entering was forbidden to disturb this area and forbade the imposition of taxes and other levies because this devasana contained royal facilities for worship. He also announced that holy construction in Sunda Sembawa, which should be cared for and be undisturbed because the area stipulated is the residential area of the wiku (priests).\n\nAccording to [[Batutulis inscription]], Sri Baduga Maharaja built defensive [[moat]]s surrounding [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]; he built \"gugunungan\" (sacred mounds), established huts and sacred Samya forest, reserves for wood destined for offerings, and the Talaga Rena Mahawijaya Lake. Certainly, there was a good road to [[Sunda Kalapa]] (present-day Jakarta Metropolitan city) too, the most important harbour of the Sunda kingdom. At the time of Tome Pir\u00e9s visit to Pakuan, Sri Baduga Maharaja reigned over the Sunda kingdom (1482 to 1521).\n\nThe year of his coronation in 1482 has been mentioned as the birth date of the present-day city of [[Bogor]]. However, there was an important settlement at the site already, and Pakuan had been the capital of the Sunda kingdom under previous kings. The reign of Ratu Jayadewata was hailed as the \"golden age\" of the Sundanese people. The kingdom consolidated its rule and exercised power throughout western part of Java. It also marked the era of great prosperity resulting from efficient agriculture management and the thriving pepper trade in the region. This era of great wealth also marked the beginning of Sunda kingdom's decline.\n\n====Decline====\nDuring the reign of Sang Ratu Jayadewata, there was already a group of Sunda inhabitant that has converted to a new faith ([[Islam]]), as testified by Portuguese account. Tom\u00e9 Pires in 1513 reported, there is a significant numbers of [[Muslim]]s resides in the port of Cimanuk, the easternmost port of Sunda Kingdom, which is the estuarine of [[Cimanuk River]] in present-day town of [[Indramayu]]. According to Portuguese report, the port of Cirebon which  is located just east from Cimanuk, is already a Muslim port by this time, ruled by Javanese.\n\nProbably these new converts were the people referred to in Carita Parahyangan as \"those who felt no peace because have violated (strayed from) ''[[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian|Sanghyang Siksa]]''\". Nevertheless, during this time, Islamic influence has not yet penetrated inland into the capital. As mentioned in Carita Parahyangan '' ... mana mo kadatangan ku musuh ganal, musu(h) alit ...'', which means the capital is \"safe from rough/coarse enemy, (as well as) soft/subtle enemy\". The term \"coarse enemy\" refer to actual invading foreign army, while \"subtle enemy\" refer to the propagation of a new faith or new religion that might upset the established spiritual order of the kingdom.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|394}}\n\nThe Kingdom of Sunda anxiously watched the growing influence of the expansive Islamic [[Sultanate of Demak]] that finally succeed to destroy [[Kediri (city)|Daha]], the remnant of Hindu [[Majapahit]] court, in 1517. As a result of this event, only [[Blambangan]] in the eastern edge of Java, and Sunda in the western part remained Hindu kingdoms in Java. Meanwhile, in the land of Sunda, Muslim influences start to penetrated the kingdom.\n\n====Rise of Muslim States, Cirebon and Banten====\n[[File:Building in Keraton Kasepuhan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Keraton Kasepuhan]] of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]]. By 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost its important eastern port of [[Cirebon]].]]\n[[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, written circa the second half of 15th century (1450\u20131500) reported that the eastern boundary of Sunda Kingdom realm with its Javanese neighbour was the Cipamali river in present-day [[Brebes Regency]]. However, the Portuguese [[Suma Oriental]] in 1513 reported that the eastern border of Sunda Kingdom is located in the port of ''Chemano'' (Cimanuk), the estuarine of [[Manuk River]], which today corresponds to the town of [[Indramayu]]. Portuguese source also reported the presence of Muslim inhabitant and traders in Cimanuk. This means between 1450 and 1513 the Sunda kingdom has lost control on the area surrounding [[Cirebon]]; between Brebes and Indramayu. This signify the coastal Muslim Javanese push westward into once a traditional Sundanese area, as [[Demak Sultanate]] was responsible as the patron that led to the rise of Cirebon Sultanate.\n\nThe detail of Sunda Kingdom and its relations with the rise of [[Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon Sultanate]], mostly were taken from the account of ''Purwaka Caruban Nagari'', a manuscript of Cirebon chronicle explaining the advent of this Sultanate, which also claimed Cirebon as the rightful successor of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAccording to Purwaka Caruban Nagari, Sunda [[King Siliwangi]] married Nyai Subang Larang, daughter of Ki Gedeng Tapa, port master of Muara Jati, which corresponds with the port of [[Cirebon]]. They had three children; Prince Walangsungsang born in 1423, Princess Rara Santang born in 1426, and Prince Kian Santang (Raden Sangara) born in 1428.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\"/> Although Prince Walangsungsang was the first-born son of Sunda King, the prince did not earned the right as a crown prince of Sunda Kingdom. This was because his mother, Nyai Subang Larang was not the ''prameswari'' ([[queen consort]]). Another reason was probably because of his conversion to Islam, probably influenced by his mother, Subang Larang whom was a Muslim woman. In 16th century West Java, the state's religion was Hinduism, [[Sunda Wiwitan]] (Sundanese ancestral religion) and Buddhism. It was his half brother, King Siliwangi's son from his third wife Nyai Cantring Manikmayang, who was chosen as crown prince.\n\nWalangsungsang, assisted by Ki Gedheng Danusela, established a new settlement called Dukuh Alang-alang on 8 April 1445. After Ki Gedeng Alang-Alang's death in 1447, Walangsungsang appointed as the ruler of the town and established a court and assumed a new title as Prince Cakrabuana. King Siliwangi sent his envoy Tumenggung Jagabaya and Raja Sengara (Cakrabuana's younger brother), to bestow Prince Carkrabuana with the title Tumenggung Sri Mangana. Cirebon grew into a thriving port, yet Cakrabuana still loyal to his father and sent tribute to the main court of Sunda. At that time Cirebon was still the vassal of Sunda Kingdom.\n\nAfter his Resignation in 1479 CE, Cakrabuana was succeeded by his nephew, Sharif Hidayatullah (1448-1568), the son of Nyai Rara Santang (Syarifah Mudaim) and Sharif Abdullah of Egypt. He married his cousin, Nyi Mas Pakungwati daughter of Cakrabuana. He is popularly known with his posthumously name, [[Sunan Gunung Jati]]. In 1482, the Sunda kingdom lost one of its important ports, [[Cirebon]]. On 2 April 1482, Sunan Gunungjati, the ruler of [[Cirebon]] (and also the grandson of King Siliwangi), stated that Cirebon will no longer send tribute to [[Pajajaran]], which marked the proclamation of the [[Sultanate of Cirebon]] as independence from Sunda Pajajaran.<ref name=\"Kabupaten\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www.cirebonkab.go.id/sekilas-kab-cirebon/sejarah-kabupaten-cirebon\n |title      = Sejarah Kabupaten Cirebon\n |language   = Indonesian\n |publisher  = Cirebon Regency\n |accessdate = 16 January 2013\n}}</ref>\n\nThe character described in Purwaka Caruban Nagari, as [[King Siliwangi]], both timeline and storyline, matched the historic character of Dewa Niskala or Ningrat Kancana, referred as \"Tohaan di Galuh\" (Lord of Galuh) in \nCarita Parahyangan. Tohaan di Galuh was the son and heir of Niskala Wastu Kancana. Ningrat Kancana however, reigned for only seven years and subsequently demoted. Carita Parahyangan tell that ''\"... kena salah twa(h) bogo(h) ka estri larangan ti kaluaran ..,\"'' which translate as \"because (his) wrongdoing, fell in love with a forbidden outsider woman.\" The term \"outsider woman\" is interesting and has led to various proposition; could it be the new king fell in love with a foreigner, outsider, non-Sundanese, or even non-Hindu (Muslim) woman. It is possible that the outsider forbidden woman mentioned here was Nyai Subang Larang, a Muslim woman daughter of port master of Muara Jati (Cirebon).\n\nThe pressure from coastal Javan Islamic states drove the king of Sunda, [[Sri Baduga Maharaja]], to seek assistance from the Portuguese at [[Malacca]]. In 1512 and again in 1521, he sent his son, the crown prince Prabu Surawisesa also known as Ratu Sang Hyang (the Portuguese record it as Samian) to Malacca to request the Portuguese to sign a peace treaty, to trade in pepper and to build a fort at his main port of Sunda Kalapa.\n\nSunan Gunung Jati's son later also established the [[Sultanate of Banten]], which later become a menace for Hindu Sunda kingdom.\n\n====Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa====\nAfter Sri Baduga Maharaja's death in 1521, the succeeding kings, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkosa, also known as Ratu Sang Hyang whom the Portuguese called Ratu Samian, faced the threat of [[the Sultanate of Cirebon]] and [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] expanding nearer his kingdom. Under this threat, Prabu Surawisesa Jayaperkasa, who reigned from 1521 to 1535, concluded the treaty with [[Portuguese Malacca|Portuguese from Malacca]] to establish a warehouse and fortress at [[Sunda Kelapa]] in return for protection against the menace of these Islamic Sultanates.\n\n====Sunda\u2013Portuguese Treaty 1522====\n{{Main|Luso-Sundanese padr\u00e3o}}\nBy 1522, the Portuguese were ready to form a coalition with the King of Sunda to get access to his lucrative pepper trade. The commander of the fortress of Malacca at that time was Jorge de Albuquerque. He sent a ship, the S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o, under Captain Henrique Leme, to Sunda Kalapa with valuable gifts for the king of Sunda. Two written sources describe the concluding of the treaty in detail, the original Portuguese document of 1522 with the text of the treaty and the signatories of the witnesses, and a report on that event by [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] in his book ''Da \u00c1sia'', printed after 1777/78.\n\nAccording to these sources, the king welcomed them warmly upon their arrival. The crown prince had succeeded his father and was now King Prabu Surawisesa, although Barros called him King Sami\u00e3o. This Sunda ruler agreed to an arrangement of friendship with the King of Portugal and granted a fortress at the mouth of the Ciliwung River where the Portuguese could load as many ships as they wished with pepper. In addition, he pledged, dating from the start of construction on the fortress, each year he would donate one thousand sacks of pepper to the Portuguese king. The contract document was drafted into two copies and signed. On the said day in 1522, Henrique Leme of Portuguese and his entourage together with deputies of the King of Sunda, erected a commemoration stone, called [[Padr\u00e3o]], at the mouth of the Ciliwung River.\n\n====The fall of Sunda Kelapa====\nThis trade and defence treaty with the Portuguese, the [[Luso Sundanese Treaty]], was fallen apart tremendously due to Portuguese failure to deliver their promise to construct the fortress in Kalapa. The delay was caused by troubles in [[Portuguese Goa]] in [[India]]. To make things worse, [[Fatahillah]], a military general sent from Demak, managed to capture the [[Sunda Kalapa]] harbour just before the Portuguese returned.\n\nThe army of Paletehan or Fatahillah, also called Fadillah Khan (1487\u20131570), comprising around 1452 troops from the Cirebon-Demak alliance, conquered Sunda Kalapa. The Sunda military commander and his troops stationed in the port were all fallen. The harbour chief and his family, the royal minister, and all of the people working in the harbour were slaughtered. Most of the city was helplessly destroyed and razed, as the Sundanese reinforcements sent from Pakuan realised that their forces were too weak and retreated. Sunda Kingdom has lost its most important port, thus subsequently Sunda Kalapa Harbour was renamed [[Jayakarta]] or Jakarta by its Muslim conqueror.\n\nThirty Portuguese sailors, shipwrecked by storms, swam to the beach at Kalapa only to be killed by Fadillah Khan's men. The Portuguese recognised the political leadership had changed when they were not allowed to set foot on the land. As they were too weak for a battle, they set sail back to Malacca. The next year, a second attempt failed because of striking sailors angry at not having been paid.\n\n====Ongoing battles====\nThe failure to rely on Portuguese assistance has led Sunda Kingdom to fend for their own survival by themselves. Carita Parahyangan mentioned that during his 14 years of reign (1521\u20131535), King Sang Hyang (Surawisesa) has fought in 15 battles. Unbeatable, all in which he managed to repel the series of invading Muslim forces from Cirebon and Demak. He fought in Kalapa, Tanjung, Ancol Kiji, Wahanten Girang, Simpang, Gunung Batu, Saung Agung, Rumbut, Gunung, Gunung Banjar, Padang, Panggoakan, Muntur, Hanum, Pagerwesi, and Medangkahyangan.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}}\n\nThe war between Cirebon-Demak forces and the Sunda kingdom lasted for almost five years. The king lost around 1000 of his men. During this war, after Sunda Kalapa, Sunda Kingdom also lost another important port, the port of Banten to their Cirebon-Demak Muslim nemesis. [[Sunan Gunungjati]] (Syarif Hidayatullah) of Cirebon crowned his son, [[Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten|Hasanudin]], as the king of Banten under the auspices of the Sultan of Demak who, in turn, offered Hasanudin his sister's hand in marriage. Thus, a new dynasty was born at the same time as a new kingdom was created. Banten was established as the capital of this new sultanate, held as a [[province]] under [[Sultanate of Cirebon]].<ref>{{cite book\n  | last =Guillot\n  | first =Claude\n  | publisher= Gramedia Book Publishing Division\n  | title = The Sultanate of Banten\n  | year =1990\n| page =18\n| url =\n| accessdate =  }}</ref> Finally, in 1531, a peace treaty was concluded between King Surawisesa of Sunda and Syarif Hidayatullah of Cirebon.\n\nIn an apparent sorrow after the tremendous defeat and the loss of his two most important ports, Prabu Surawisesa established the [[Batutulis inscription]] in 1533 AD to commemorate his late father.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/kesedihan-di-balik-prasasti-batutulis-cw9x|title=Kesedihan di Balik Prasasti Batutulis - Tirto.ID|last=Teguh|first=Irfan|website=tirto.id|language=id|access-date=2018-06-22}}</ref> This action was probably an attempt to spiritually appeal for ancestral guidance, assistance and protection against the powerful Muslim enemy that now loomed by the gates. Because of ongoing battles, he often could not stay in his palace in [[Pakuan Pajajaran]].\n\n====Ratu Dewata====\nPrabu Ratu Dewata also known as Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata, was the successor of Prabu Surawisesa, however he was not his son. The reign of Prabu Ratu Dewata between 1535 and 1543 was known as a chaotic and difficult one full of hardship, as Islamic forces from Cirebon and Banten tried for multiple times to capture the Dayeuh Pakuan capital.\n\n====The period of chaos and terror====\nDuring Ratu Dewata reign, the Carita Parahyangan reported several calamities befell the kingdom; there was a sudden attack, a lot of enemies razed the city, thus a mass combat erupted in the grand yard (''[[alun-alun]]'').<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|398}} In this battle, the noble princes; Tohaan Serendet and Tohaan Ratu Sanghyang were killed. The chaos has widespread across the kingdom, the attack also occurred in Ciranjang and Sumedang. Another horrifying terror was the assassins of unknown origin slaughtering the [[rishi]]s, hermits and Hindu priests that resides in the mandalas (hermitage sanctuaries). It was reported that the Hindu priests and hermits of mandala Jayagiri, a sacred sanctuary established by the late King Jayadewata, were captured and drowned into the sea.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|400}} It is highly possible that the attack was launched by Muslim states of Banten or Cirebon.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|395}} This was a devastating attack straight to the spiritual core of the Sundanese Hindu community.\n  \nUnable to control the kingdom, instead of fulfilling his duty by maintaining the law and order, Prabu Ratu Dewata retreated himself to become a ''Raja Pandita'' (priestly king), submitted himself deeply into religious rituals as an apparently desperate appeal for gods' salvation.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Sunda Kingdom were already isolated and confined to inland, as one by one Sunda's ports were captured by Islamic forces of Banten and Cirebon.\n\n====Last kings and the fall of Sunda kingdom====\n[[File:Bird\u2019s-eye View of the City of Bantam de Bry.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Banten (town)|Port of Banten]] in the 16th century.

The successor of Ratu Dewata, King Ratu Sakti reigned from 1543 to 1551, was known as a ruthless king, whom indulge himself with women and sensual pleasure.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nThe next successor that ruled from 1551 to 1567, King Nilakendra, also known as Tohaan di Majaya, is also an incompetent ruler. Instead of fulfill his duty as a king, he renovate and beautify the palace. Squander kingdom's fortune by indulging himself in luxury, binge drinking and parties.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}}\n\nBecause of ongoing battles, ironically Tohaan di Majaya could not stay in his newly renovated palace. The last kings of Sunda could no longer reside in Pakuan Pajajaran, since in 1550s Hasanuddin, sultan of [[The Sultanate of Banten|Banten]] has launched a successful attack to Dayeuh Pakuan, captured and razed the capital. The surviving Sunda royalties, nobles and common people fled the fallen city, heading to mountainous wilderness. To disable the authority of Sunda royal institution, Sultan of Banten seize the sacred stone of ''Palangka Sriman Sriwacana'', and took it as a prized plunder to his capital, the port city of Banten. According to tradition, this sacred stone slab is an essential requirement for enthronement ceremony, thus disabling the surviving house of Sunda royals to properly crowned their new king.\n\nFrom 1567 to 1579, under the last king Raja Mulya, also known as Prabu Surya Kencana, the kingdom declined substantially. In Carita Parahyangan, his name is Nusiya Mulya. He ruled further inland in Pulasari, Pandeglang, or precisely in Kaduhejo village, Menes Subdistrict, at the slope of Mount Palasari. The kingdom helplessly fallen apart, the royal government can not be maintained anymore, particularly after 1576 due to constant pressure from Banten, and finally collapsed completely in 1579. Thereafter, [[the Sultanate of Banten]] took over most of the former Sunda Kingdom's territory, thus ultimately put an end to a millennium of Hindu-Buddhist Dharmic civilization of West Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|396}} By this time, Java has turned more and more Islamic. Only the kingdom of [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]] on the eastern edge was the last surviving Hindu kingdom in Java, well until its demise in early 18th century.\n\n==Capital==\nThroughout Sunda's history, the centre of cultural and political power often oscillated between Western [[Priangan]] region; initially identified as \"Sunda\", and Eastern Priangan region; traditionally identified as \"Galuh\". The two traditional sites are located in and around modern [[Bogor]] city and the town of [[Ciamis]]. Two most important capitals are [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], the capital of Sunda; and [[Kawali]], the capital of Galuh.\n\n===Kawali===\n{{Main|Kawali}}\n[[File:KITLV 87620 - Isidore van Kinsbergen - Bronzes of a priest Kawali near Tjiamis - Before 1900.tif|thumb|right|Hindu Brahmin's ritual objects, including bronze bell and holy water container from Kawali, the historic capital of Galuh Kingdom.]]\nThe capital of Galuh Kingdom of eastern [[Priangan]] region, has moved for several times. In older period, the capital was located around the Karang Kamulyan site by the banks of [[Ci Tanduy|Citanduy]] river. By early 14th century, the capital was moved further northwest upstream, in the area now known as [[Astana Gede inscription|Astana Gede]], near the current town of Kawali, [[Ciamis Regency]]. The city was located on eastern slope of Mount Sawal near the source of the Citanduy river. A [[Kawali inscription]] was discovered here. According to tradition, the keraton in Kawali is called ''Surawisesa'', expanded and renovated by King [[Niskala Wastu Kancana]]. Kawali served as the capital of the kingdom for several generations until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the government back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\n===Pakuan Pajajaran===\n{{Main|Pakuan Pajajaran}}\n[[File:Pakuanpajajaran.jpg|thumb|right|Location of Pakuan Pajajaran copied from book \"Kabudayaan Sunda Zaman Pajajaran\" Part 2\", 2005]]\nAfter the fall of [[Tarumanagara]] in the 7th century, King Tarusbawa built a new capital city inland near the source of the Cipakancilan river in present-day [[Bogor]]. According to [[Carita Parahyangan]], a manuscript from the 15th or 16th century, King Tarusbawa was only mentioned as ''Tohaan'' (Lord/King) of Sunda. He was the ancestor of a series of Sunda kings that reigned until 723. Pakuan served as the capital of Sunda during the reign of several kings, and the court shifted to Kawali until Sri Baduga Maharaja moved the court from Kawali back to Pakuan in 1482.\n\nThe city was permanently settled since at least the 10th century, but not gaining major political importance until King [[Sri Baduga Maharaja|Jayadewata]] established it as the royal capital of Sunda kingdom in the 15th century. In 1513, the city was visited by its first European visitor, [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]], the Portuguese envoy.<ref name=\"Zahorka\">{{cite book | title = The Sunda Kingdoms of West Java, From Tarumanagara to Pakuan Pajajaran with the Royal Center of Bogor | first = Herwig | last = Zahorka | publisher = Yayasan Cipta Loka Caraka | location = Jakarta | year = 2007 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xSRwAAAAMAAJ&q}}</ref>{{rp|40}} According to his report, the city of ''Daio'' (''Dayeuh'' is a Sundanese term for \"capital city\") was great city, with population around 50,000 inhabitants.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|404}}\n\nThe tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his beautiful ''Kadatwan'' (palace) called ''Sri Bima Punta Narayana Madura Suradipati'' at Pakuan Pajajaran, and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|393}}\n\nAfter the reign of King Jayadewata (Sri Baduga Maharaja), Pakuan Pajajaran served as the royal capital for several generations. ''Dayeuh'' Pakuan Pajajaran served as the capital of Sunda Kingdom approximately for almost a hundred years (1482 \u2013 1579), until it was razed and destroyed by the [[Sultanate of Banten]] in 1579.\n\nBecause Pakuan, the capital city of the Sunda kingdom laid between two parallel rivers, Ciliwung and Cisadane, it was called ''Pajajaran'' (lit. place laid between two parallel things) or [[Pakuan Pajajaran]]. Although primary local and European historical records referred to the kingdom in the western part of [[Java island]] as the Sunda Kingdom, the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], especially after the establishment of [[the Sultanate of Banten]] and [[The Sultanate of Cirebon|Cirebon]], referred to the kingdom (minus the coastal sultanates) as \"Pakuan Pajajaran\" Kingdom, or simply as Pakuan Kingdom or Pajajaran Kingdom. The later name \u2013 Pajajaran \u2013 is more familiar for people residing in West Java and the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] of [[Sultanate of Mataram|Mataram]] region (current [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Solo, Central Java|Solo]]).\n\n==Government and economy==\n===Administration===\n[[File:Makuta Binokasih.jpg|thumb|upright|''Makuta Binokasih Sanghyang Pak\u00e9'', the royal crown of Sunda kingdom.

On the other hand, the term \"Pakuan\" and \"Pajajaran\" or \"Dayeuh\" refer to its capital which corresponds to the modern city of Bogor. The tangible evidence on the existence of a kingdom as an administrative social structure, was found in [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] dated 952 Saka (1030 CE), that mentioned ''Prahajyan Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (Sunda Kingdom), with Sri Jayabhupati claimed as ''haji ri Su\u1e47\u1e0da'' (the king of Sunda).<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|402}}\n\nAccording to Tom\u00e9 Pires report (1513), the Sunda kingdom is ruled by a paramount ''raja'' (king or monarch), and the right of throne inheritance descended from a father to his son. However, in the case when a king did not produce a male heir, the successor is elected from the lesser kings, the rulers of regional towns or provinces.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|403}} These lesser kings is called ''Tohaan'' (lord) that acts as local governor, and mostly are related to the king, which means they belongs in the same dynasty.\n\nMuch of  our current knowledge on detailed social order and the bureaucracy structure of the kingdom, is owed to the Sundanese manuscript of [[Sanghyang siksakanda ng karesian]], compiled around 1518.\n{{quotation|\n| quote  = ''...nihan sinangguh dasa prebakti ngaranya.

The harvest ceremony also allowed the king's official to collect [[tax]] in the form of rice that can be stored in the state's ''[[Leuit]]'' (rice [[barn]]).\n\nAccording to Siksakanda ng Karesian, Sundanese farmers during the era of Sunda Kingdom did recognize ''sawah'' or the [[Paddy field|wet-field rice cultivation]]. However, the widespread rice cultivation system applied in the kingdom seems to be the ''ladang'' or the [[Upland rice|dry-field rice]] which is a much simpler form of cultivation that doesn't require an elaborate social structure to support it. This is corresponds with the geography and topography of West Java which dominated by the central [[Parahyangan]] Plateau, in contrast with Central and East Java that consists of river valleys between volcanoes. As the result, compared to Central and East Java, West Java at that time was more sparsely populated, consists of settlements, villages or hamlet quite isolated deep within highland valleys, which render direct administrative control from the kingdom's central government rather difficult.\n\nThe kingdom was also well known as the world's main producer of high quality [[black pepper|pepper]]. The kingdom participated in spice trade network in the archipelago.

In fact, West Java was one of the earliest place in Indonesia that being Indianized, also sparked the historic period of Indonesian history by producing the earliest inscription in Java. As Tarumanagara's successor, Sunda Kingdom has inherited this Hindu civilization influences.\n \nThe culture of the people in Sunda kingdom blends [[Hinduism]] with [[Sunda Wiwitan]]; a native [[shamanism]] belief, and also a traces of [[Buddhism]] is observeable. Several intact prehistoric [[megalithic]] sites, such as Cipari site in [[Kuningan]] and the Pangguyangan [[menhir]] and stepped pyramid in Cisolok, [[Sukabumi]], suggest that native shamanic [[animism]] and [[dynamism (metaphysics)|dynamism]] beliefs coexisted with Hinduism and Buddhism. The native belief, Sunda Wiwitan, persists today as a way of life for the [[Baduy people|Baduy]] or Kanekes people who resist Islam and other foreign influences.\n\nThe [[Cangkuang]] Hindu temple in Leles, [[Garut]], dated from the 8th century, was dedicated to [[Shiva]] and built during the Galuh kingdom. Buddhist influence came to West Java through the [[Srivijaya]] conquest, as the empire dominated West Java until the 11th century. The brick [[stupas]] in [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] indicate Buddhist influence in West Java, while nearby [[Cibuaya]] sites show Hindu influence.\n\nThe manuscript [[Carita Parahyangan]] clearly demonstrate [[Hinduism]] spirituality within the Sunda Kingdom society. This manuscript is opened with a legendary character named Sang Resi Guru that had a son named Rajaputra. Comprehensively the manuscript was written by Hindu scholar which demonstrate Hindu frame of references.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}} The Hindu pantheon, such as Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesvara, Rudra, Sadasiva, Yama, Varuna, Kuvera, Indra and Besravaka, were also mentioned in ancient Sundanese manuscript of [[Sewakadharma]] or also known as ''Serat Dewabuda'', dated 1357 Saka or 1435 CE.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{rp|379}}\n\nThe Sundanese manuscript of spiritual guidance, the [[Sanghyang Siksakanda ng Karesian]] also demonstrate Hinduism religious outlook and frame of references, although it seems already mixed with some sorts of Buddhism spirituality. ''\" ... ini na lakukeuneun, talatah sang sadu jati. Hongkara namo Sewaya, sembah ing hulun di Sanghyang Panca Tatagata; panca ngaran ing lima, tata ma ngaran ing sabda, gata ma ngaran ing raga, ya eta ma pahayueun sareanana .., \"'', \" ... this has to be done, the true mandate of the good-hearted (or trusted one).

Sunda kingdom period, circa 14th century.]]\nThe culture of Sunda kingdom centred on agricultural activity, especially [[rice]] cultivation. [[Dewi Sri|Nyi Pohaci Sanghyang Asri]] or Sanghyang Asri, the goddess of rice, is revered as the main deity or the highest goddess within Sundanese [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. The priest was concerning about the religious ceremonies and the king and his subjects participated in annual ceremonies and festivals such as the blessing of the rice seeds ceremonies and harvest festival. The annual ''[[Seren Taun]]'' rice harvest festival is still practised today in traditional [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] communities.\n\nAccording to the [[Bujangga Manik]] manuscript, the courtly culture of Sunda [[Kraton (Indonesia)|kraton]] and its nobles' etiquette in Pakuan Pajajaran was sophisticated. However no traces of the palace or buildings survived in the former capital, probably because their wood construction decayed over the centuries.\n\nThe [[Portugal|Portuguese]] source provide a glimpse of the culture and customs of the Sunda kingdom. In his report \u201c[[Suma Oriental]] (1512\u20131515)\u201d [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] wrote:\n\n{{quotation|Sunda kingdom is very rich. The land of Sunda has as much as four thousands horses which come there from Priaman (Sumatera) and other islands to be sold. It has up to forty elephants; these are for the king\u2019s array. An inferior gold, of six carats, is found. There is abundance tamarinds which serve the native for vinegar.\n\nThe city where the king is most of the year is the great city of Dayo. The city has well-built houses of the palm leaf and wood. They say that the king\u2019s house has three hundred and thirty wooden pillars as thick as a wine cask, and five fathoms (8 m) high, and beautiful timber work on the top of the pillars, and a very well-built house. The city is two days journey from the chief port, which is called [[Sunda Kalapa|Kalapa]].\n\nThe people of the sea coast get along well with the merchants in the land. They are accustomed to trade. These people of Sunda very often come to Malacca to trade. They bring cargo lancharas, ships of a hundred and fifty tons. Sunda has up to six junks and many lancharas of the sunda kind, with masts like a crane, and steps between each so that they are easy to navigate.<ref>{{cite book  |url = https://books.google.com/?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&pg=PA166&lpg=PA166&dq=Suma+Oriental+Sunda#v=onepage&q=Suma%20Oriental%20Sunda&f=false |title = The Suma Oriental of Tome Pires: An Account of the East, from Red Sea to China |last = Pires |first = Tome |date = 1512\u20131515 |work  = Armando Cortes\u00e3o |publisher  = Asian Educational Services, New Delhi 1990, 2005 |isbn = 81-206-0535-7 |accessdate = 16 January 2013 }}</ref>}}\n\nThe people of Sunda are said to be truthful. They, with great city of Dayo, the town and lands and port of Bantam, the port of Pontang, the port of Cheguide, the port of Tangaram, the Port of Tangaram, the port of Calapa, the port of chi Manuk. are justly governed. The king is a great sportsman and hunter. The kingdom descends from father to son. The women are handsome, and those of the nobles chaste, which is not the case with those of the lower classes. There are monasteries of convents for the women, into which the nobles put their daughters, when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes. The married women, when their husband die, must, as point of honour, die with them, and if they should be afraid of death they put into the convents. The inhabitants are not very warlike, much addicted to their idolatries. They are fond of rich arms, ornamented with gold and inlaid work. Their krises are gilt, and also the point of their lances.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n[[File:Padrao sunda kelapa.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Luso Sundanese padr\u00e3o|''Padr\u00e3o'' of Sunda Kalapa]] (1522), a stone pillar with a [[cross]] of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] commemorating a treaty between [[Portugal|Portuguese Kingdom]] and Hindu Sunda Kingdom, at [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].]]\nThe Kingdom is commonly thought as the successor of [[Tarumanagara]] which also flourished in the same location of Western Java. It seems that in its early history, around 10th to 11th century, Sunda Kingdom was stuck in between two competing mandalas; the Malay Srivijaya in Sumatra in the west and its Javanese neighbouring kingdom in the east.\n\nIn early of its history, the kingdom seems served as the vassal of [[Srivijaya]]n mandala. By the 10th century, the kingdom seems to break loose, liberated from Srivijayan mandala as stated by [[Kebon Kopi II inscription|Rakryan Juru Pangambat inscription]] (932 CE). However, according to the Chinese [[Song Dynasty]] book ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi]]'',<ref>[[Friedrich Hirth]] and [[W.W. Rockhill]] ''[http://ebook.lib.hku.hk/CADAL/B31403797/ Chao Jukua, His Work on the Chinese and Arab Trade in the Twelfth and Thirteenth centuries, entitled Chu-fan-chi]'' St Petersburg, 1911.</ref> written around 1225 by [[Zhao Rugua]], ''Sin-t'o'' (Sunda), was still part of ''San-fo-tsi '' (Srivijaya) 15 tributaries.\n\nKingdom of Sunda has established relations with its eastern neighbour; the kaleidoscope of Javanese kingdoms, from the era of Medang Mataram back in the 8th century, all the way to Majapahit in 14th century and Demak in 16th century. The popular hero, King [[Sanjaya of Mataram]] known as the Javanese Mataram King mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732), was also mentioned in Sundanese manuscript Carita Parahyangan; as having his root in Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Sanghyang Tapak inscription]] (1030) shows Javanese cultural influence, as the style of script, letters, language, and the title of the king is similar to royal names in East Javanese Medang court. However, the relations might be not quite harmonious, as according to 11th century East Javanese [[Horren inscription]], mentioned ''\u00e7atru Sunda'', which means the village of Horren was attacked by \"the enemy (from) Sunda\".<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\"/>{{Rp|388}}\n\nThe relations between Sundanese and Javanese kingdoms descended to a new low, when a disastrous incident took place in [[Battle of Bubat|Bubat square in Majapahit]] in 1357, killing all of Sundanese royal party, including the Sunda king Prabu Maharaja and Princess Tohaan [[Dyah Pitaloka Citraresmi]].
