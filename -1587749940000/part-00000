A light beam is diffracted into several orders.  By vibrating the material  with a pure sinusoid and tilting the AOM so the light is reflected from the flat sound waves into the first diffraction order, up to 90% deflection efficiency can be achieved. ]]\n\nAn '''acousto-optic modulator (AOM)''', also called a '''Bragg cell''', uses the [[acousto-optic effect]] to [[diffraction|diffract]] and shift the frequency of light using [[sound wave]]s (usually at [[radio-frequency]]).  They are used in [[laser]]s for [[Q-switching]], telecommunications for signal [[modulation]], and in [[spectroscopy]] for frequency control.  A [[piezoelectric transducer]] is attached to a material such as glass. An oscillating electric signal drives the transducer to vibrate, which creates sound waves in the material.  These can be thought of as moving periodic planes of expansion and compression that change the [[index of refraction]].  Incoming light scatters (see [[Brillouin scattering]]) off the resulting periodic index modulation and interference occurs similar to [[Bragg diffraction]].  The interaction can be thought of as a [[three-wave mixing process]] resulting in [[Sum-frequency generation]] or [[Difference-frequency generation]] between [[phonon]]s and [[photon]]s.\n\n==Principles of operation==\n\nA typical AOM operates under [[Bragg's law#Bragg condition|Bragg Condition]], where the incident light comes at Bragg angle <math>\\theta_B\\approx \\sin \\theta_B=\\frac{\\lambda}{2n\\Lambda}</math> from the [[Perpendicular|perperdicular]] of the sound wave's propagation. \n\n===Diffraction===\nWhen the incident light beam is at Bragg angle, a diffraction pattern emerges where an order of diffracted beam occurs at each angle \u03b8 that satisfies:\n\n:<math>2\\Lambda\\sin\\theta = m\\frac{\\lambda}{n}</math>\n\nHere, ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;...,&nbsp;\u22122,&nbsp;\u22121,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;+1,&nbsp;+2,&nbsp;... is the order of diffraction, <math>\\lambda</math> is the wavelength of light in vacuum, <math>n</math> is the [[refractive index]] of the crystal material (e.g. quartz), and <math>\\Lambda</math> is the wavelength of the sound.<ref>[http://jila1.nickersonm.com/papers/A%20Guide%20to%20Acousto-Optic%20Modulators.pdf \"A Guide to Acousto-Optic Modulators\"]</ref> <math>\\frac{\\lambda}{n}</math> itself is the wavelength of the light in the material. \n\nDiffraction from a sinusoidal modulation in a thin crystal mostly results in the ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;+1 diffraction orders. Cascaded diffraction in medium thickness crystals leads to higher orders of diffraction. In thick crystals with weak modulation, only [[Nonlinear optics#Phase matching|phasematched]] orders are diffracted; this is called [[Bragg diffraction]]. The angular deflection can range from 1 to 5000 beam widths (the number of resolvable spots). Consequently, the deflection is typically limited to tens of [[milliradian]]s.\n\n===Intensity===\nThe amount of light diffracted by the sound wave depends on the intensity of the sound.  Hence, the intensity of the sound can be used to modulate the intensity of the light in the diffracted beam.  Typically, the intensity that is diffracted into ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 order can be varied between 15&nbsp;% to 99&nbsp;% of the input light intensity. Likewise, the intensity of the ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1 order can be varied between 0&nbsp;% and 80&nbsp;%. \n\nAn expression of the efficiency in ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1 order is:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lekavich|first=J.|date=Apr 1986|title=Basics of acousto-optic devices|url=|journal=Lasers and Applications|volume=|pages=59\u201364|via=}}</ref>\n\n<math>\\eta=I_1/I=\\text{sin}{}^2(\\Delta\\phi/2)</math>\n\nwhere the external phase excursion <math>\\Delta\\phi=\\frac{\\pi}{\\lambda}\\sqrt{2\\left(\\frac{L}{H}\\right)M_2P}</math>.\n\nTo obtain the same efficiency for different wavelength, the RF power in the AOM has to be proportional to the square of the wavelength of the optical beam. Note that this formula also tells us that, when we start at a high RF power P, it might be higher than the first peak in the sine squared function, in which case as we increase P, we would settle at the second peak with a very high RF power, leading to overdriving the AOM and potential damage to the crystal or other components. To avoid this problem, one should always start with a very low RF power, and slowly increase it to settle at the first peak.\n\nNote that there are two configurations that satisfies Bragg Condition: If the incident beam's [[Wave vector|wavevector]]'s [[Vector component|component]] on the sound wave's propagation direction goes against the sound wave, the Bragg diffraction/scattering process will result in the maximum efficiency into m = +1 order, which has a positive frequency shift; However, if the incident beam goes along the sound wave, the maximum diffraction effeciency into m = -1 order is achieved, which has a negative frequency shift.\n\n===Frequency===\nOne difference from Bragg diffraction is that the light is scattering from moving planes.  A consequence of this is the frequency of the diffracted beam ''f'' in order ''m'' will be [[Doppler effect|Doppler]]-shifted by an amount equal to the frequency of the sound wave ''F''.\n:<math>f \\rightarrow f + mF</math>\n\nThis frequency shift can be also understood by the fact that [[Nonlinear optics#Phase matching|energy and momentum]] (of the [[photon]]s and [[phonon]]s) are conserved in the process.  A typical frequency shift varies from 27&thinsp;MHz, for a less-expensive AOM, to 1&thinsp;GHz, for a state-of-the-art commercial device. In some AOMs, two acoustic waves travel in opposite directions in the material, creating a [[standing wave]]. In this case the spectrum of the diffracted beam contains multiple frequency shifts, in any case integer multiples of the frequency of the sound wave.\n\n===Phase===\nIn addition, the phase of the diffracted beam will also be shifted by the phase of the sound wave. The phase can be changed by an arbitrary amount.\n\n===Polarization===\nCollinear [[Transverse wave|transverse]] acoustic waves or perpendicular [[longitudinal wave]]s can change the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. The acoustic waves induce a [[birefringence|birefringent]] phase-shift, much like in a [[Pockels cell]]{{dubious|date=February 2014}}. The acousto-optic tunable filter, especially the [[acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter|dazzler]], which can generate variable pulse shapes, is based on this principle.<ref>{{vcite journal |author=H.

The [[Jammu & Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] leader Moulana Masoodi served as his sponsor.

The western districts of the state under the name [[Azad Kashmir]] and his birthplace [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] along with [[Baltistan]] had passed to Pakistan control.

He started a monthly magazine called \"Voice of Kashmir\" reflecting his ideology.<ref name=\"grand old man\"/> Jointly with G. M.

Armed operations were started in November 1965, shortly after the failed [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]]. Maqbool Bhat and Mir Ahmad entered the Kashmir Valley attempting to recruit members. They were compromised and ended up killing a police official.  Captured and sentenced to death, Bhat nevertheless escaped from prison and made it back to Azad Kashmir. But he was accused of being an Indian spy by Pakistan and imprisoned in Pakistan.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=104-109}} Amanullah Khan was also imprisoned for 15 months in a Gilgit prison during 1970-72, accused of being an Indian agent.

[[Praveen Swami]] states that the organisation did not have enough funds and infrastructure, or support from other sources, to make an impact inside India.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=108-109}} Paul Staniland adds that \"State repression\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir also played a key role.{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=68-69}}\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the mid 1970s, with the organisation having fallen apart and the key leaders in jail, Amanullah Khan left Pakistan for the United Kingdom (UK). The [[British Mirpuris]], many of whom had been displaced by the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]], extended enthusiastic support. The UK chapter of the Plebiscite Front was converted into the [[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF) in May 1977 and formed an armed wing called the `National Liberation Army'. Amanullah Khan took charge as the General Secretary of JKLF the following February. JKLF opened branches in various countries in Europe and the Middle East as well as the US, and held well-attended conventions in [[Birmingham]] in 1981 and [[Luton]] in 1982.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=129-130}}\n\nPraveen Swami states that the JKLF made plans to bomb the March 1983 conference of non-aligned meeting in New Delhi and to hijack an airliner from New Delhi, both of which were aborted. After the arrival of [[Hashim Qureshi]] in the UK in January 1984, another hijacking was planned. However, on 3 February 1984, members of the National Liberation Army kidnapped the Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre in Birmingham and demanded the release of Maqbool Bhat as ransom. Amanullah Khan was named as the interlocuter. Unfortunately, the kidnappers panicked at the possibility of a police raid and, allegedly upon Amanullah Khan's instructions, shot the diplomat. India executed Maqbool Bhat six days later. A British court convicted two members of the JKLF for the killing of Mhatre. Hashim Quresi and Amanullah Khan were expelled from the UK.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=131-133}}\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nAmanullah Khan returned to Pakistan in 1984,{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|p=163}} establishing the JKLF headquarters at [[Muzaffarabad]].{{sfn|Ellis & Khan, Kashmiri diaspora|2003|p=176}} Pakistan under [[Zia ul-Haq]], which was already supporting [[Khalistan]]i militants in Punjab, was ready to support insurgency in Kashmir, and Khan was ready to work with the Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI). Following the [[1987 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election|rigged State election]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in 1987, the disaffected youth of the Kashmir Valley started crossing the [[Line of Control]] to Azad Kashmir to obtain arms and training. Khan's JKLF was their natural destination. Staniland states that the JKLF was \"reborn\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir in this period. It was led by young activists from Srinagar and its environs, the so-called `HAJY' group. The enormity of popular support received for their call for independence surprised them. Within two years, the JKLF in the Valley emerged as the \"vanguard and spearhead of a popular uprising\" against the Indian state.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=163-164}}{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=72-73}}\n\nHowever, a pro-independence JKLF was not in Pakistan's interest. Pakistan accepted the collaboration with JKLF only as a \"necessary compromise,\" because of the recognition that Islamist groups had very little currency in the Kashmir Valley. However, cadres of Islamist groups were also trained in JKLF training camps in Azad Kashmir. This quickly led to a dilution of the JKLF's nationalist ideology.{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=76,&nbsp;81}} Independence and Islam became interchangeable slogans. The Islamist attacks on [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s, liberal women, liquor shops and beauty parlours were never condemned by the JKLF.

The western districts of the state under the name [[Azad Kashmir]] and his birthplace [[Gilgit Agency|Gilgit]] along with [[Baltistan]] had passed to Pakistan control.

He started a monthly magazine called \"Voice of Kashmir\" reflecting his ideology.<ref name=\"grand old man\"/> Jointly with G. M. Lone, a member of the Azad Kashmir State Council, he established ''Kashmir Independence Committee'',  which lobbied the Azad Kashmir government to take a more active role in the Indian-controlled Kashmir.<ref name=\"JKLF facts\"/> In 1964, Khan was elected as the Secretary General of the [[Azad Kashmir Plebiscite Front]], inspired by the [[Jammu Kashmir Plebiscite Front]] started by [[Mirza Afzal Beg]] in the Indian-controlled Kashmir. Subsequently, in April 1965, the Kashmir Independence Committee was merged into the Azad Kashmir Plebiscite Front.<ref name=\"JKLF facts\">[http://jklfworld.blogspot.com/2010/09/mr-amanullah-khan-jklf-some-interesting.html Mr. Amanullah Khan & JKLF: Some Interesting Facts], Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, Retrieved 2016-04-26.</ref>{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=104-109}}\n\nThe [[National Liberation Front (Jammu Kashmir)|JK National Liberation Front]] (NLF) was an offshoot of the Plebiscite Front, established by Khan and [[Maqbool Bhat]] around August 1965 for carrying out armed insurgency in the Indian-controlled Kashmir. Armed operations were started in November 1965, shortly after the failed [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]]. Maqbool Bhat and Mir Ahmad entered the Kashmir Valley attempting to recruit members. They were compromised and ended up killing a police official.  Captured and sentenced to death, Bhat nevertheless escaped from prison and made it back to Azad Kashmir. But he was accused of being an Indian spy by Pakistan and imprisoned in Pakistan.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=104-109}} Amanullah Khan was also imprisoned for 15 months in a Gilgit prison during 1970-72, accused of being an Indian agent. He was released after protests broke out in Gilgit. Thirteen of his colleagues were sentenced to 14 years in prison, but released after a year.<ref name=Catch/> Khan was also tried [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] in [[Srinagar]], where he was accused of being an agent of Pakistan.<ref name=\"JKLF facts\"/><ref name=IndiaToday>\nMadhu Jain, [http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/kashmiri-pundits-are-our-brethren-amanullah-khan/1/316437.html `Everyone makes use of Kashmir'], India Today, 1 March 1990.\n</ref>\n\nFurther attempts by the NLF to infiltrate into Indian-controlled Kashmir also met with failure. [[Praveen Swami]] states that the organisation did not have enough funds and infrastructure, or support from other sources, to make an impact inside India.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=108-109}} Paul Staniland adds that \"State repression\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir also played a key role.{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=68-69}}\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the mid 1970s, with the organisation having fallen apart and the key leaders in jail, Amanullah Khan left Pakistan for the United Kingdom (UK). The [[British Mirpuris]], many of whom had been displaced by the construction of the [[Mangla Dam]], extended enthusiastic support. The UK chapter of the Plebiscite Front was converted into the [[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF) in May 1977 and formed an armed wing called the `National Liberation Army'. Amanullah Khan took charge as the General Secretary of JKLF the following February. JKLF opened branches in various countries in Europe and the Middle East as well as the US, and held well-attended conventions in [[Birmingham]] in 1981 and [[Luton]] in 1982.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=129-130}}\n\nPraveen Swami states that the JKLF made plans to bomb the March 1983 conference of non-aligned meeting in New Delhi and to hijack an airliner from New Delhi, both of which were aborted. After the arrival of [[Hashim Qureshi]] in the UK in January 1984, another hijacking was planned. However, on 3 February 1984, members of the National Liberation Army kidnapped the Indian diplomat Ravindra Mhatre in Birmingham and demanded the release of Maqbool Bhat as ransom. Amanullah Khan was named as the interlocuter. Unfortunately, the kidnappers panicked at the possibility of a police raid and, allegedly upon Amanullah Khan's instructions, shot the diplomat. India executed Maqbool Bhat six days later. A British court convicted two members of the JKLF for the killing of Mhatre. Hashim Quresi and Amanullah Khan were expelled from the UK.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=131-133}}\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nAmanullah Khan returned to Pakistan in 1984,{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|p=163}} establishing the JKLF headquarters at [[Muzaffarabad]].{{sfn|Ellis & Khan, Kashmiri diaspora|2003|p=176}} Pakistan under [[Zia ul-Haq]], which was already supporting [[Khalistan]]i militants in Punjab, was ready to support insurgency in Kashmir, and Khan was ready to work with the Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI). Following the [[1987 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election|rigged State election]] in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in 1987, the disaffected youth of the Kashmir Valley started crossing the [[Line of Control]] to Azad Kashmir to obtain arms and training. Khan's JKLF was their natural destination. Staniland states that the JKLF was \"reborn\" in the Indian-controlled Kashmir in this period. It was led by young activists from Srinagar and its environs, the so-called `HAJY' group. The enormity of popular support received for their call for independence surprised them. Within two years, the JKLF in the Valley emerged as the \"vanguard and spearhead of a popular uprising\" against the Indian state.{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=163-164}}{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=72-73}}\n\nHowever, a pro-independence JKLF was not in Pakistan's interest. Pakistan accepted the collaboration with JKLF only as a \"necessary compromise,\" because of the recognition that Islamist groups had very little currency in the Kashmir Valley. However, cadres of Islamist groups were also trained in JKLF training camps in Azad Kashmir. This quickly led to a dilution of the JKLF's nationalist ideology.{{sfn|Staniland, Networks of Rebellion|2014|pp=76,&nbsp;81}} Independence and Islam became interchangeable slogans. The Islamist attacks on [[Kashmiri Pandit]]s, liberal women, liquor shops and beauty parlours were never condemned by the JKLF. According to Hasim Qureshi such outrages were \"official Pakistan policy\" and the policy was endorsed by the Islamic Right as well as Amanullah Khan's JKLF. \"The ISI ran this movement on [[communalism|communal]] lines right from the beginning,\" says Qureshi, \"and for that Amanullah and his underlings became its agents.\"{{sfn|Swami, India, Pakistan and the Secret Jihad|2007|pp=167-169}}\n\nBy 1992, the majority of the JKLF militants were killed or captured and they were yielding ground to pro-Pakistan guerilla groups such as the [[Hizb-ul-Mujahideen]], strongly promoted by the Pakistani military authorities.
