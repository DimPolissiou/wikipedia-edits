The center is [[Gusinje]]. The municipality is located in northeastern region of Montenegro. Gusinje Municipality was created in 2014, when it was split from [[Plav Municipality]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223123018/http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |archivedate=2014-12-23 }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nGusinje and neighbouring [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] are part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range. The features of the area show heavy glaciation. They indicate that a 35km long and up to 200m wide [[glacier]] existed in the past in Plav-Gusinje.{{sfn|Abraham|2018|p=20}} The municipality's settlements stands at an elevation of about 1,000m. They are surrounded by some of the highest mountains in Montenegro. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro is located in the National Park \"Prokletije\" about 10km south of the town itself.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> [[Visitor (mountain)|Mount Visitor]] overlooks Gusinje and Plav. At the mountain's foothills stands the village of [[Martinaj]].\n\nGusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center near the village of [[Vusanje]] (Vuthaj). The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. \n\nThe town of Gusinje is the seat of the municipality. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. It covers 157 km\u00b2, 1.1% of the total area of Montenegro.<ref name=\"opstina5\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}}</ref> Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding. The territory of Vusanje covers about 1/3 of the municipality. The municipality's settlements are Dolia/Dolja, Dosugja/Dosu\u0111e, Grn\u010dar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar, Kolenovi\u0107i/Kolina, Krysheva/Kru\u0161evo, Martinaj/Martinovi\u0107i, Vi\u0161njevo/Vishnjeva, Vuthaj/Vusanje and the town of Gusinje/Gucia.<ref name=\"opstina5\"/>\n\n== History ==\nIn antiquity, the area of Gusinje was inhabited by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe of the Labeatae.<ref name=\"Opstina44\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=44}}</ref> Close to [[Lake Plav]] lived another tribe that of the Autariatae. The name of the area may come from an Illyrian toponym ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of Gusinje, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> From the Roman era, remains of a cemetery in Visnjevo and a church in Dolia have been bound. There is also evidence that a mine was operating in the region.<ref name=\"Opstina44\"/>\n\nIn 1330, the toponym ''Hotina Gora'' (mountains of Hoti) in the Plav and Gusinje regions on the [[Lim (river)|Lim]] river basin in 1330. It is the first mention of the Albanian tribe [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]].{{sfn|\u0160ufflay|2000|p=37}} This region is regarded as their original homeland before they moved southwards and settled to their historical territory. It is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. The vilayet of Plav was a relatively densely populated area with 15 villages and over 1,000 households. Most of the villages - with the exception of Gusinje - were concentrated around [[Lake Plav]] and to the north of it.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the Albanian tribal community (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which lived along the route as they were in rebellion against the Ottomans and were plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - near which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of pathways from Kelmendi. The original location of the fort was near the village of Grn\u0107ar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar. Modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. The surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. The fortress was also designed to stop the movement of the [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] tribes in the Upper Lim valley. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village of Gusinje had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref>\n\nIn time despite Ottoman expeditions and relocations of these communities in Sandzak, Kelmendi and other tribes like Ku\u010di, Triepshi, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] and [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Many of the settlements of Gusinje were also largely created by Kelmendi. The descendants of the communities although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> In 1703, the Ottomans tried again to expel Kelmendi entirely from the highlands. At that time, many were forced to resettle in the [[Pe\u0161ter|Pe\u0161ter plateau]]. Those who remained in their villages in Gusinje were allowed to do so on the condition that they convert to Islam.\n\nIn terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from Shala who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\n==Cultural monuments==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of the historical mosques of Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Triepshi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. It is a symbol of the influence of the Pashalik of Shkodra in the upper Lim valley. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. The oldest mosque in Gusinje was that of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] which was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in a fire in 1746-47.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\">{{harvnb|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe village of Vusanje/Vuthaj and its hamlets, which represent one third of the total territory of the municipality has three mosques. The oldest is that of upper Vusanje, built in 1710. The mosque of lower Vusanje was built in 1910 by the Gjonbalaj (today, ''d\u017eamija Djonbali\u0107a'') brotherhood and its third mosque was built by the Qosja (today, ''d\u017eamija \u0106osovi\u0107a''). Mosques are also found in the village of Martinaj (1800) and Kru\u0161evo.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\"/> In the village of Dolia, there is Catholic church which was built in 1936 and also houses an ethnographic museum. There is also an Orthodox church dedicated to St. George. It was built in 1926 in the reign of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Opstina Gusinje - Kultura |url=https://www.opstinagusinje.me/al/kultura-2/ |publisher=Municipality of Gusinje}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is ~93% Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}} A few (~6%) Orthodox Montenegrins and Serbs are found in the municipality. About half of the village of Dolia/Dolja are Catholics. They form the only Catholic community in Gusinje.\n\n<div><ul>\n<li style=\"display: inline-table;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Historical demography of Gusinje Municipality{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}}\n|-\n!

The center is [[Gusinje]]. The municipality is located in northeastern region of Montenegro. Gusinje Municipality was created in 2014, when it was split from [[Plav Municipality]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223123018/http://akter.co.rs/27-drutvo/76805-gusinje-nova-optina-u-crnoj-gori.html |archivedate=2014-12-23 }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nGusinje and neighbouring [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]] are part of the upper [[Lim (river)|Lim]] valley in the [[Prokletije]] range. The features of the area show heavy glaciation. They indiacate that a 35km long and 200m wide [[glacier]] existed in the past in Plav-Gusinje.{{sfn|Abraham|2018|p=20}} The municipality's settlements stands at an elevation of about 1,000m. They are surrounded by some of the highest mountains in Montenegro. [[Zla Kolata]], the highest mountain in Montenegro is located in the National Park \"Prokletije\" about 10km south of the town itself.<ref>{{Cite web|title = NACIONALNI PARK PROKLETIJE|url = http://www.nparkovi.me/sajt/np-prokletije|website = www.nparkovi.me|access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref> [[Visitor (mountain)|Mount Visitor]] overlooks Gusinje and Plav. At the mountain's foothills stands the village of [[Martinaj]].\n\nGusinje is traversed by the [[Vermosh River]] into which pours the [[Vruja Creek]] as it moves eastwards towards [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]]. Vruja is formed at [[Ali Pasha of Gusinje|Ali Pasha]]'s wellsprings (''Alipa\u0161ini izvori''/''Krojet e Ali Pash\u00ebs'') about 2km south of Gusinje's center near the village of [[Vusanje]] (Vuthaj). The part of Vermosh between the location where it meets Vruja and Plav is locally called ''Luca''. Vermosh then pours into [[Lake Plav]]. It is the first tributary of [[Lim (river)|Lim]]. \n\nThe town of Gusinje is the seat of the municipality. From 1953 to 2014, it was part of [[Plav Municipality]]. In 2014, it became again a distinct municipality. It covers 157 km\u00b2, 1.1% of the total area of Montenegro.<ref name=\"opstina5\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=5}}</ref> Much of the area of the municipality is mountainous land used in the past for livestock herding. The territory of Vusanje covers about 1/3 of the municipality. The municipality's settlements are Dolia/Dolja, Dosugja/Dosu\u0111e, Grn\u010dar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar, Kolenovi\u0107i/Kolina, Krysheva/Kru\u0161evo, Martinaj/Martinovi\u0107i, Vi\u0161njevo/Vishnjeva, Vuthaj/Vusanje and the town of Gusinje/Gucia.<ref name=\"opstina5\"/>\n\n== History ==\nIn antiquity, the area of Gusinje was inhabited by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe of the Labeatae.<ref name=\"Opstina44\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=44}}</ref> Close to [[Lake Plav]] lived another tribe that of the Autariatae. The name of the area may come from an Illyrian toponym ''Geusiae'' from which the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name of Gusinje, ''Guci(a)'', would have evolved.<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> From the Roman era, remains of a cemetery in Visnjevo and a church in Dolia have been bound. There is also evidence that a mine was operating in the region.<ref name=\"Opstina44\"/>\n\nIn 1330, the toponym ''Hotina Gora'' (mountains of Hoti) in the Plav and Gusinje regions on the [[Lim (river)|Lim]] river basin in 1330. It is the first mention of the Albanian tribe [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]].{{sfn|\u0160ufflay|2000|p=37}} This region is regarded as their original homeland before they moved southwards and settled to their historical territory. It is known that a medieval settlement was located in the territory of present-day Gusinje. Gusinje was mentioned as a caravan station on the Ragusa-Cattaro\u2013Scutari\u2013Pe\u0107 route, in the 14th century.<ref name=\"Opstina16\">{{harvnb|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=16}}</ref>{{sfn|Zajednica osnovnog obrazovanja i vaspitanja|1986|p=137}} In historical record, Gusinje appears in 1485 in the defter of the [[sanjak of Scutari]] as a village in the [[vilayet]] of Plav, a ''[[Hass (Ottoman)|hass-\u0131 h\u00fcmayun]]'' (imperial domain) that stood directly under the Ottoman Sultan. It had 96 households, 21 unmarried men and four widows.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=99}} This is was a big settlement compared to other villages in Montenegro and northern Albania. The vilayet of Plav was a relatively densely populated area with 15 villages and over 1,000 households. Most of the villages - with the exception of Gusinje - were concentrated around [[Lake Plav]] and to the north of it.{{sfn|Pulaha|1974|p=112}}\n\nGusinje stood at the intersection of the Ottoman trade routes between northern Albania, Montenegro and Kosovo. Thus, the trade that passed through Gusinje generated much wealth for the Sultan and the Ottoman officials who were granted taxing rights. This made the trade route a constant target for the Albanian tribal community (''fis'') of [[Kelmendi (tribe)|Kelmendi]], which lived along the route as they were in rebellion against the Ottomans and were plundering their trade routes. Venetian diplomat [[Mariano Bolizza]] who travelled in the region reported that at the end of 1612 the building of the fortress of Gusinje - near which the modern town developed - was completed.<ref name=\"Elsie151\"/> The location was chosen because it stands at the convergence of pathways from Kelmendi. The original location of the fort was near the village of Grn\u0107ar/G\u00ebrn\u00e7ar. Modern Gusinje stands ~6km to the west and ~10km to the north of the routes from the Kelmendi mountains (''malet e Kelmendit'') to modern [[Sandzak]]. The surrounding villages to the west and south ([[Vusanje]]) are Kelmendi settlements. The fortress was built at the reguest of Sem Zaus, the Ottoman bey of Podgorica who wanted to stop the attacks of Kelmendi and to be able to travel freely in his domain. The fortress was also designed to stop the movement of the [[Ku\u010di]] and [[Triepshi (tribe)|Triepshi]] tribes in the Upper Lim valley. In 1614, Mariano Bolizza reported that the village of Gusinje had 100 households and a garrisson of 237 men under Belo Juvanin.<ref name=\"Elsie151\">{{harvnb|Elsie|2003|p=151}}</ref>\n\nIn time despite Ottoman expeditions and relocations of these communities in Sandzak, Kelmendi and other tribes like Ku\u010di, Triepshi, [[Shala (tribe)|Shala]] and [[Hoti (tribe)|Hoti]] came to form many of the historical neighbourhoods ([[mahalla]]) of Gusinje of today. Many of the settlements of Gusinje were also largely created by Kelmendi. The descendants of the communities although initially Christian, willingly or forcefully converted to Islam, largely by the middle 18th century. At the beginning of the 18th century, Gusinje was the seat of the local [[kadiluk]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/> In 1703, the Ottomans tried again to expel Kelmendi entirely from the highlands. At that time, many were forced to resettle in the [[Pe\u0161ter|Pe\u0161ter plateau]]. Those who remained in their villages in Gusinje were allowed to do so on the condition that they convert to Islam.\n\nIn terms of military administration, the captaincy of Gusinje was part of the [[Bosnia Eyalet]] in 1724. An important family - which later developed into a brotherhood - in the development of Gusinje is that of the Omeragaj (today known as Omeragi\u0107)  from Shala who appeared in the village in the early 18th century {{sfn|Dedushaj|2012|p=18}}. Central Ottoman administration collapsed in the decades to come and the [[Pashalik of Scutari|Pashalik of Shkodra]] emerged as a regional power. Its downfall in 1831 brought back actual Ottoman rule. In 1852, in the register of the [[Kosovo Vilayet]], Gusinje is recorded with 1,500 households. It was a developing town that had 350 shops, eight [[madrasa]]s and five mosques. The captaincy of Gusinje in 1869 was part of the [[sanjak of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Opstina16\"/>\n\n==Cultural monuments==\nIn Gusinje there are a number of the historical mosques of Montenegro. The oldest preserved mosque in the town is \u010ceki\u0107a d\u017eamija or xhamia e Cekajve built by the Cekaj brotherhood of Triepshi. The second oldest is the Vezir's mosque (vezirova d\u017eamija/xhamia e vezirit) built by [[Kara Mahmud Bushati]] in 1765 on the existing site of another mosque originally built in 1626. It is a symbol of the influence of the Pashalik of Shkodra in the upper Lim valley. The New Mosque (nova d\u017eamija/xhamia e re) also known as Radon\u010di\u0107a was built by the Radon\u010di\u0107i brotherhood of Ku\u0107i in 1899. The oldest mosque in Gusinje was that of Sultan [[Ahmed I]] which was built during his reign between 1603 and 1617. It was burnt in a fire in 1746-47.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\">{{harvnb|Had\u017ei\u0107|2018|p=11}}</ref>\n\nThe village of Vusanje/Vuthaj and its hamlets, which represent one third of the total territory of the municipality has three mosques. The oldest is that of upper Vusanje, built in 1710. The mosque of lower Vusanje was built in 1910 by the Gjonbalaj (today, ''d\u017eamija Djonbali\u0107a'') brotherhood and its third mosque was built by the Qosja (today, ''d\u017eamija \u0106osovi\u0107a''). Mosques are also found in the village of Martinaj (1800) and Kru\u0161evo.<ref name=\"Had\u017ei\u010711\"/> In the village of Dolia, there is Catholic church which was built in 1936 and also houses an ethnographic museum. There is also an Orthodox church dedicated to St. George. It was built in 1926 in the reign of [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Opstina Gusinje - Kultura |url=https://www.opstinagusinje.me/al/kultura-2/ |publisher=Municipality of Gusinje}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nSince 1913, Gusinje has experienced many waves of immigration in the 20th century. These have depopulated it as a result in the 21st century. The municipality of Gusinje reports a total diaspora of ~30,000 from the Gusinje area. 18,400 people trace their origins to the town of Gusinje out of. They mostly live in the US.{{sfn|Opstina Gusinje|2012|p=18}} Gusinje is ~93% Muslim and either Albanian-speaking or Slavic-speaking. The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today's Gusinje are of Albanian origin.{{sfn|Curtis|2012|p=40}} A few (~6%) Orthodox Montenegrins and Serbs are found in the municipality. About half of the village of Dolia/Dolja are Catholics.

Only four of his poems were published in Leningrad anthologies in 1966 and 1967, most of his work appearing outside the Soviet Union or circulated in secret ([[samizdat]]) until 1987. Persecuted for his poetry and his Jewish heritage, he was denied permission to travel.

Recalling his landing in Vienna, Brodsky commented,\n\n<blockquote>I knew I was leaving my country for good, but for where, I had no idea whatsoever.

It was \"a big step for me, a small step for mankind\", he joked.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> The prize coincided with the first legal publication in Russia of Brodsky's poetry as an exil\u00e9.\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0432 \u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0418. \u0411\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0446\u0438\u0438.jpg|thumb|Plaque in honour of Brodsky in Venice]]\nIn 1991, Brodsky became [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate of the United States]]. The [[Librarian of Congress]] said that Brodsky had \"the open-ended interest of American life that immigrants have. This is a reminder that so much of American creativity is from people not born in America.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> His inauguration address was printed in ''Poetry Review''. Brodsky held an honorary degree from the [[University of Silesia]] in Poland and was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. In 1995, Gleb Uspensky, a senior editor at the Russian publishing house, Vagrius, asked Brodsky to return to Russia for a tour, but he could not agree.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> For the last ten years of his life, Brodsky was under considerable pressure from those that regarded him as a \"fortune maker\". He was a greatly honored professor, was on first name terms with the heads of many large publishing houses, and connected to the significant figures of American literary life. His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times. His position as a lauded \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Nobel Prize winner won him enemies and stoked resentment, the politics of which, she writes, made him feel \"deathly tired\" of it all toward the end.<ref>Stern (2004) p. 305</ref>\n\n[[Image:brodskygrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Brodsky in the Protestant section of the [[Isola di San Michele#history|Cimitero di San Michele]], Venice, Veneto, Italy]] \nIn 1990, while teaching literature in France, Brodsky married a young student, Maria Sozzani, who has a Russian-Italian background; they had one daughter, Anna Brodsky, born in 1993.\n\nMarina Basmanova lived in fear of the Soviet authorities until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; only after this was their son Andrei Basmanov allowed to join his father in New York.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In the 1990s, Brodsky invited Andrei to visit him in New York for three months and they maintained a father-son relationship until Brodsky's death.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Andrei married in the 1990s and had three children, all of whom were recognized and supported by Brodsky as his grandchildren; Marina Basmanova, Andrei, and Brodsky's grandchildren all live in Saint Petersburg. Andrei gave readings of his father's poetry in a documentary about Brodsky. The film contains Brodsky's poems dedicated to Marina Basmanova and written between 1961 and 1982.<ref>Brodsky, Joseph. \"New Stances\" Ardis, 1983, USA</ref>\n\nBrodsky died of a heart attack aged 55, at his apartment in [[Brooklyn Heights]], a neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], a borough of [[New York City]], on January 28, 1996.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> He had had open-heart surgery in 1979 and later two bypass operations, remaining in frail health following that time. He was buried in a non-Catholic section of the [[Isola di San Michele]] cemetery in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], also the resting place of [[Ezra Pound]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name=\"NYT\"/> In 1997, a plaque was placed on his former house in St. Petersburg, with his portrait in relief and the words \"In this house from 1940 to 1972 lived the great Russian poet, Iosif Aleksandrovich Brodsky\".<ref>Stern (2004) p. 330</ref> Brodsky's close friend, the Nobel laureate [[Derek Walcott]], memorialized him in his collection ''The Prodigal'', in 2004.\n\n==Work==\n{{quote box |width=320px |align=right  |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nI was born and grew up in the Baltic marshland\nby zinc-gray breakers that always marched on\nin twos.</poem>\n |source = \u2014From the title poem in ''A Part of Speech'' (1977)\n}}\n\nBrodsky is perhaps most known for his poetry collections, ''A Part of Speech'' (1977) and ''To Urania'' (1988), and the essay collection, ''Less Than One'' (1986), which won the National Book Critics Circle Award. Other notable works include the play, ''Marbles'' (1989), and ''Watermark'' (1992), a prose meditation on Venice.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Throughout his career he wrote in Russian and English, self-translating and working with eminent poet-translators.\n\n===Themes and forms===\nIn his introduction to Brodsky's ''Selected Poems'' (New York and Harmondsworth, 1973), W.&nbsp;H. Auden described Brodsky as a traditionalist lyric poet fascinated by \"encounters with nature, ... reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence\".<ref Name=\"Oxford\"/> He drew on wide-ranging themes, from Mexican and Caribbean literature to Roman poetry, mixing \"the physical and the metaphysical, place and ideas about place, now and the past and the future\".<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> Critic Dinah Birch suggests that Brodsky's \" first volume of poetry in English, ''Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems (1973)'', shows that although his strength was a distinctive kind of dry, meditative soliloquy, he was immensely versatile and technically accomplished in a number of forms.\"<ref name=\"OCEL\">\"Brodsky, Joseph\" ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n''To Urania: Selected Poems 1965\u20131985'' collected translations of older work with new work written during his American exile and reflect on themes of memory, home, and loss.<ref name=\"OCEL\"/> His two essay collections consist of critical studies of such poets as [[Osip Mandelshtam]], W.&nbsp;H. Auden, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Robert Frost]], sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, [[Nadezhda Mandelshtam]], and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref name=\"OCEL\"/>\n\nA recurring theme in Brodsky's writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to affect its audience positively and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the twentieth century, such as [[Nazism]], [[Communism]], and two [[World Wars]]. During his term as [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate]], Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Librarian of Congress [[James H. Billington|James Billington]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Joseph had difficulty understanding why poetry did not draw the large audiences in the United States that it did in Russia. He was proud of becoming an American citizen in 1977 (the Soviets having made him stateless upon his expulsion in 1972) and valued the freedoms that life in the United States provided. But he regarded poetry as \"language's highest degree of maturity\", and wanted everyone to be susceptible to it. As Poet Laureate, he suggested that inexpensive anthologies of the best American poets be made available in hotels and airports, hospitals and supermarkets. He thought that people who are restless or fearful or lonely or weary might pick up poetry and discover unexpectedly that others had experienced these emotions before and had used them to celebrate life rather than escape from it. Joseph's idea was picked up, and thousands of such books have in fact been placed where people may come across them out of need or curiosity.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky's opening remarks as the U.S. Poet Laureate in October 1991. He said, \"By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. ... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. ... Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon.\"<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with [[Sven Birkerts]] in 1979, Brodsky reflected:\n\n<blockquote>In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they're not talking to people any more, or to some seraphical creature. What they're doing is simply talking back to the language itself, as beauty, sensuality, wisdom, irony, those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art, it's something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological, indeed genetic, goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as \"a read\", commits an anthropological crime, in the first place, against himself.<ref>Dingle, Carol (2003) ''Memorable Quotations: Jewish Writers of the Past'' p.&nbsp;22 {{ISBN|978-0-595-27245-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Influences===\nLibrarian of Congress Dr James Billington, wrote\n\n<blockquote>He was the favored prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the great lady of Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova, and to hear him read her poems in Russian in the [[Library of Congress]] was an experience to make one's hair stand on end even if one did not understand the Russian language. Joseph Brodsky was the embodiment of the hopes not only of Anna Akhmatova, the last of the great Petersburg poets from the beginning of the century, but also [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], the widow of another great martyred poet [[Osip Mandelstam]]. Both of them saw Joseph as part of the guiding light that might some day lead Russia back to her own deep roots.<ref Name=\"LOC\">[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9603/brodsky.html 19 February 1996 \"Death of a Poet Laureate: Joseph Brodsky Turned Exile into Inspiration\"] [[Library of Congress]], obituary</ref><ref>[http://www.caxtonclub.org/reading/2007/apr07.pdf Martin, Eden (2007)  ''Collecting Anna Akhmatova''.

Many works were dedicated to other writers such as [[Tomas Venclova]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Derek Walcott]], and Benedetta Craveri.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBrodsky's work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. ''A Part of Speech'' (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Howard Moss]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Richard Wilbur]]. Critic and poet [[Henri Cole]] notes that Brodsky's \"own translations have been criticized for turgidness, lacking a native sense of musicality.\"<ref Name=\"Oxford\"/>\n\n==Awards and honors==\n*1978 \u2013 Honorary degree of [[Doctor of Letters]], [[Yale University]]\n*1979 \u2013 Fellowship of [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]]\n*1981 \u2013 [[John D. and Catherine T.

At the same time, Brodsky engaged in a program of self-education.

I snagged a copy of poems by Baratynsky. I had nothing to read. So I read that book and finally understood what I had to do in life. Or got very excited, at least. So in a way, [[Yevgeny Baratynsky|Evgeny Abramovich Baratynsky]] is sort of responsible.\" His friend, Ludmila Shtern, recalled working with Brodsky on an irrigation project in his \"geological period\" (working as a geologist's assistant): \"We bounced around the [[Leningrad Oblast|Leningrad Province]] examining kilometers of canals, checking their embankments, which looked terrible. They were falling down, coming apart, had all sorts of strange things growing in them...

Only four of his poems were published in Leningrad anthologies in 1966 and 1967, most of his work appearing outside the Soviet Union or circulated in secret ([[samizdat]]) until 1987. Persecuted for his poetry and his Jewish heritage, he was denied permission to travel. In 1972, while Brodsky was being considered for exile, the authorities consulted mental health expert [[Andrei Snezhnevsky]], a key proponent of the notorious pseudo-medical diagnosis of \"paranoid reformist delusion\".<ref name=\"Brintlinger\">{{cite book|last1=Brintlinger|first1=Angela|last2=Vinitsky|first2=Ilya|title=Madness and the mad in Russian culture|year=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-9140-6|pages=92|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ED3U_XVLwHwC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> This political tool allowed the state to lock up dissenters in psychiatric institutions indefinitely. Without examining him personally, Snezhnevsky diagnosed Brodsky as having \"[[sluggishly progressing schizophrenia]]\", concluding that he was \"not a valuable person at all and may be let go\".<ref name=\"Brintlinger\"/> In 1971, Brodsky was invited twice to emigrate to Israel. When called to the Ministry of the Interior in 1972 and asked why he had not accepted, he stated that he wished to stay in the country.

Proffer, of the [[University of Michigan]] and one of the co-founders of [[Ardis Publishers]], became Brodsky's Russian publisher from this point on. Recalling his landing in Vienna, Brodsky commented,\n\n<blockquote>I knew I was leaving my country for good, but for where, I had no idea whatsoever. One thing which was quite clear was that I didn't want to go to Israel... I never even believed that they'd allow me to go. I never believed they would put me on a plane, and when they did I didn't know whether the plane would go east or west... I didn't want to be hounded by what was left of the Soviet Security Service in England.

The [[Librarian of Congress]] said that Brodsky had \"the open-ended interest of American life that immigrants have. This is a reminder that so much of American creativity is from people not born in America.\"<ref name=\"NYT\"/> His inauguration address was printed in ''Poetry Review''. Brodsky held an honorary degree from the [[University of Silesia]] in Poland and was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science. In 1995, Gleb Uspensky, a senior editor at the Russian publishing house, Vagrius, asked Brodsky to return to Russia for a tour, but he could not agree.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> For the last ten years of his life, Brodsky was under considerable pressure from those that regarded him as a \"fortune maker\". He was a greatly honored professor, was on first name terms with the heads of many large publishing houses, and connected to the significant figures of American literary life. His friend Ludmila Shtern wrote that many Russian intellectuals in both Russia and America assumed his influence was unlimited, that a nod from him could secure them a book contract, a teaching post or a grant, that it was in his gift to assure a glittering career. A helping hand or a rejection of a petition for help could create a storm in Russian literary circles, which Shtern suggests became very personal at times. His position as a lauded \u00e9migr\u00e9 and Nobel Prize winner won him enemies and stoked resentment, the politics of which, she writes, made him feel \"deathly tired\" of it all toward the end.<ref>Stern (2004) p. 305</ref>\n\n[[Image:brodskygrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Brodsky in the Protestant section of the [[Isola di San Michele#history|Cimitero di San Michele]], Venice, Veneto, Italy]] \nIn 1990, while teaching literature in France, Brodsky married a young student, Maria Sozzani, who has a Russian-Italian background; they had one daughter, Anna Brodsky, born in 1993.\n\nMarina Basmanova lived in fear of the Soviet authorities until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991; only after this was their son Andrei Basmanov allowed to join his father in New York.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In the 1990s, Brodsky invited Andrei to visit him in New York for three months and they maintained a father-son relationship until Brodsky's death.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Andrei married in the 1990s and had three children, all of whom were recognized and supported by Brodsky as his grandchildren; Marina Basmanova, Andrei, and Brodsky's grandchildren all live in Saint Petersburg.

Other notable works include the play, ''Marbles'' (1989), and ''Watermark'' (1992), a prose meditation on Venice.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Throughout his career he wrote in Russian and English, self-translating and working with eminent poet-translators.\n\n===Themes and forms===\nIn his introduction to Brodsky's ''Selected Poems'' (New York and Harmondsworth, 1973), W.&nbsp;H. Auden described Brodsky as a traditionalist lyric poet fascinated by \"encounters with nature, ... reflections upon the human condition, death, and the meaning of existence\".<ref Name=\"Oxford\"/> He drew on wide-ranging themes, from Mexican and Caribbean literature to Roman poetry, mixing \"the physical and the metaphysical, place and ideas about place, now and the past and the future\".<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> Critic Dinah Birch suggests that Brodsky's \" first volume of poetry in English, ''Joseph Brodsky: Selected Poems (1973)'', shows that although his strength was a distinctive kind of dry, meditative soliloquy, he was immensely versatile and technically accomplished in a number of forms.\"<ref name=\"OCEL\">\"Brodsky, Joseph\" ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n''To Urania: Selected Poems 1965\u20131985'' collected translations of older work with new work written during his American exile and reflect on themes of memory, home, and loss.<ref name=\"OCEL\"/> His two essay collections consist of critical studies of such poets as [[Osip Mandelshtam]], W.&nbsp;H. Auden, [[Thomas Hardy]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and [[Robert Frost]], sketches of his own life, and those of contemporaries such as Akhmatova, [[Nadezhda Mandelshtam]], and [[Stephen Spender]].<ref name=\"OCEL\"/>\n\nA recurring theme in Brodsky's writing is the relationship between the poet and society. In particular, Brodsky emphasized the power of literature to affect its audience positively and to develop the language and culture in which it is situated. He suggested that the Western literary tradition was in part responsible for the world having overcome the catastrophes of the twentieth century, such as [[Nazism]], [[Communism]], and two [[World Wars]]. During his term as [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate]], Brodsky promoted the idea of bringing the Anglo-American poetic heritage to a wider American audience by distributing free poetry anthologies to the public through a government-sponsored program. Librarian of Congress [[James H. Billington|James Billington]] wrote,\n\n<blockquote>Joseph had difficulty understanding why poetry did not draw the large audiences in the United States that it did in Russia. He was proud of becoming an American citizen in 1977 (the Soviets having made him stateless upon his expulsion in 1972) and valued the freedoms that life in the United States provided. But he regarded poetry as \"language's highest degree of maturity\", and wanted everyone to be susceptible to it. As Poet Laureate, he suggested that inexpensive anthologies of the best American poets be made available in hotels and airports, hospitals and supermarkets. He thought that people who are restless or fearful or lonely or weary might pick up poetry and discover unexpectedly that others had experienced these emotions before and had used them to celebrate life rather than escape from it. Joseph's idea was picked up, and thousands of such books have in fact been placed where people may come across them out of need or curiosity.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/></blockquote>\n\nThis passion for promoting the seriousness and importance of poetry comes through in Brodsky's opening remarks as the U.S. Poet Laureate in October 1991. He said, \"By failing to read or listen to poets, society dooms itself to inferior modes of articulation, those of the politician, the salesman or the charlatan. ... In other words, it forfeits its own evolutionary potential. For what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom is precisely the gift of speech. ... Poetry is not a form of entertainment and in a certain sense not even a form of art, but it is our anthropological, genetic goal, our evolutionary, linguistic beacon.\"<ref Name=\"LOC\"/> This sentiment is echoed throughout his work. In interview with [[Sven Birkerts]] in 1979, Brodsky reflected:\n\n<blockquote>In the works of the better poets you get the sensation that they're not talking to people any more, or to some seraphical creature. What they're doing is simply talking back to the language itself, as beauty, sensuality, wisdom, irony, those aspects of language of which the poet is a clear mirror. Poetry is not an art or a branch of art, it's something more. If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological, indeed genetic, goal. Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as \"a read\", commits an anthropological crime, in the first place, against himself.<ref>Dingle, Carol (2003) ''Memorable Quotations: Jewish Writers of the Past'' p.&nbsp;22 {{ISBN|978-0-595-27245-7}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Influences===\nLibrarian of Congress Dr James Billington, wrote\n\n<blockquote>He was the favored prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the great lady of Petersburg, Anna Akhmatova, and to hear him read her poems in Russian in the [[Library of Congress]] was an experience to make one's hair stand on end even if one did not understand the Russian language. Joseph Brodsky was the embodiment of the hopes not only of Anna Akhmatova, the last of the great Petersburg poets from the beginning of the century, but also [[Nadezhda Mandelstam]], the widow of another great martyred poet [[Osip Mandelstam]]. Both of them saw Joseph as part of the guiding light that might some day lead Russia back to her own deep roots.<ref Name=\"LOC\">[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9603/brodsky.html 19 February 1996 \"Death of a Poet Laureate: Joseph Brodsky Turned Exile into Inspiration\"] [[Library of Congress]], obituary</ref><ref>[http://www.caxtonclub.org/reading/2007/apr07.pdf Martin, Eden (2007)  ''Collecting Anna Akhmatova''.

Many works were dedicated to other writers such as [[Tomas Venclova]], [[Octavio Paz]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Derek Walcott]], and Benedetta Craveri.<ref Name=\"LOC\"/>\n\nBrodsky's work is seen to have been vitally enhanced by the work of renowned translators. ''A Part of Speech'' (New York and Oxford, 1980), his second major collection in English, includes translations by [[Anthony Hecht]], [[Howard Moss]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[Richard Wilbur]].
